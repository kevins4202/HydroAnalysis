waters this study investigated the impact of biofilm formation and aggregation on the density of buoyant polyethylene microplastics biofilm formation on polyethylene films 4 4 0 15 mm was studied in a eutrophic reservoir bautzen saxony germany additionally aggregation dynamics of small pe microplastics 85 µm with cyanobacteria were investigated in laboratory experiments during summer phototrophic sessile cyanobacteria chamaesiphon spp and leptolyngbya spp precipitated calcite while forming biofilms on microplastics incubated in bautzen reservoir subsequently the density of the biofilms led to sinking of roughly 10 of the polyethylene particles within 29 days of incubation in the laboratory experiments planktonic cyanobacteria microcystis spp formed large and dense cell aggregates under the influence of elevated ca2 concentrations these aggregates enclosed microplastic particles and led to sinking of a small portion 0 4 of polyethylene microplastics this study showed that both sessile and planktonic phototrophic microorganisms mediate processes influenced by calcium which facilitates densification and sinking of microplastics in freshwater reservoirs loss of buoyancy leads to particle sedimentation and could be a prerequisite for the permanent burial of microplastics within reservoir sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic reservoirs

natural particles and planktonic cells lagarde et al 2016 the term biofouling describes the attachment of microorganisms biofilm formation and macro organisms to submerged surfaces rosenhahn et al 2010 in the oceans where calcareous macro foulers such as mussels kaiser et al 2017 bryozoans edlin et al 1975 or barnacles fazey and ryan 2016 are commonly found on plastics biofouling may lead to sinking of buoyant polymers within weeks the conditions in freshwater lakes differ from the marine environment resulting in fouling films dominated by more soft bodied organisms leiser et al 2020 still formation of cyanobacteria dominated biofilms can lead to the sinking of buoyant polymers chen et al 2019 however the ballasting effects of cyanobacteria ρ 0 990 to 1 055 g cm 3 are considered being insufficient to sink buoyant mp li et al 2016 therefore it was hypothesized that the density increase originated from minerals trapped or formed inside the biofilm matrix chen et al 2019 sessile

july and august kamjunke et al 1997 in lake water microcystis spp are aggregating to large and sinking colonies chen and lürling 2020 under the influence of dissolved ca2 xu et al 2016a these cell aggregates are often exceeding 500 µm in diameter feng et al 2019 possibly enclosing small inorganic particles xu et al 2016b the question whether such microcystis aggregates form under the influence of ca2 and subsequently could enclose or sink buoyant mp was studied in lab experiments therefore we investigated interaction of sessile and planktonic cyanobacteria with calcium in regards of their impact on the buoyancy of pe in freshwater reservoirs we hypothesized that i biofilms form on large pe in a eutrophic reservoir leading to a loss in buoyancy ii buoyancy loss is caused by calcite precipitation iii planktonic cyanobacteria sink small pe mp through ca2 induced aggregation these hypotheses were tested by conducting a field experiment in the eutrophic bautzen reservoir saxony germany and laboratory batch experiments with calcifying cyanobacteria 2 material and methods 2 1 study site bautzen reservoir is a freshwater body in the eastern part of germany providing water for cooling of coal fired power stations fish farming and agricultural irrigation it is a large 5 3 km2 but rather shallow mean depth 7 4 m reservoir kasprzak et al 2007 often experiencing strong winds which sometimes even destroy the summer stratification kerimoglu and rinke 2013 bautzen reservoir is eutrophic with extensive blooms of microcystis spp kamjunke et al 1997 occurring during summer which results in ph values up to 9 5 in the surface water one sediment trap uwitec austria collecting settling matter was deployed near the deepest point of the reservoir depth 12 m during the year 2018 from may to december and sampled in monthly intervals 2 2 plastic material exposition and sampling procedure squares 4 4 0 15 mm made from low density polyethylene goodfellow et311251 ρ 0 924 g

figure s1 2 3 biofilm characterization and sampling procedures particles were gently removed from the cage by tweezers or by flushing with reservoir water particles for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm analysis were fixed in 4 v v formalin solution right after removal from the cage the other particles were stored in pre combusted 450 c 4 h glass petri dishes in filtered reservoir water additional biofilm samples were taken from the inner wall of the cage and stored in reservoir water as well these samples were used to characterize the biofilms in regards of dry mass mineral composition and elemental content the pe particles were in close proximity to or even enclosed by biofilms growing on the inner cage walls given their visual appearance biofilms on pe were not different from biofilms from the inner cage walls figure s2 therefore cage walls biofilms were considered being comparable to pe biofilms in regards of the above mentioned parameters most samples except samples for dna extraction were stored at 8 c in the dark until processing the densities and volumes of three fresh biofilm sub samples from the inner walls of the cage 300 400 mg and three pooled sunken pe particles were analysed with pycnometers at 25 c dry weight 60 c 24 h and ash mass 450 c 24 h were determined for three individual cage walls biofilm samples the cell volume of microorganisms biovolume within the biofilms of ten buoyant and five sinking pe particles was analysed via clsm and image analysis particles were examined at five floating or ten sinking random locations resulting in a total sample size of 50 for each calcein assay zippel and neu 2011 was used to visualize ca carbonate minerals within the biofilms of two sinking pe particles twenty particles

63x na 0 9 lens leica calcein staining 1 µg l 1 2 h room temperature was used to visualize divalent cations such as ca2 and ca carbonate minerals zippel and neu 2011 calcein staining is not specific for ca2 ions or calcite and may also react with other divalent cations present in the solution the calcein stain did not bind to pristine pe particles data not shown pe particles were stained with non

quantitatively calculate the biovolumes of algae bacteria and cyanobacteria cells staudt et al 2004 2 5 cyanobacteria cultures and laboratory aggregation experiments the effect of dissolved ca2 on the aggregation of mp with cyanobacteria was investigated using non axenic cultures of microcystis sp strain bm25 schwarzenberger et al 2013 grown in wc media guillard and lorenzen 1972 without vitamin solution and silicate pre cultures were grown on a rotary shaker 110 rpm at room temperature and ambient daylight for 4 weeks prior to the experiment pe powder ρ 0 920 g cm 3 alfa aesar 9002 88 4 was

bm25 experiments were conducted in triplicates by inoculating 500 ml wc media with 10 v v cyanobacteria pre culture in airtight 1 liter flasks cell concentrations 107 cells ml 1 were chosen to reflect the concentration of microcystis spp in bautzen reservoir during summer 3 5 107 cells ml 1 data provided by the state reservoir administration of saxony landestalsperrenverwaltung des freistaates sachsen ltv right after inoculation samples for ph ca2 and cell counts were taken directly afterwards ph was measured using a ph meter pp 50 sartorius calcium samples were filtered 0 2 µm and stored

c under constant light 70 w m 2 on roller incubators 10 rpm until visible aggregates formed depending on the ca2 concentration aggregates formed within hours to days experiments showing no aggregation were stopped after 7 days upon termination samples for ca2 ph and cell counts were taken as described above aggregates formed within the flasks were photographed and counted employing imagej cell counter plugin rueden et al 2017 furthermore visible aggregates were gently removed using an inverted glass pipette twelve aggregates per ca2 condition 4 per triplicate were transferred into a coverwell chamber thermo fisher scientific for clsm ca2 and fluorescent mp within the sinking aggregates were visualized via clsm density measurements were conducted with 9 aggregates per ca2 condition 3 per triplicate in a temperature controlled chamber at 20 c aggregates were transferred to ultrapure water 20 c and titrated with nai 2 g ml 1 ρ 1 690 g cm 3 until neutral buoyancy was achieved the density of the resulting solution was measured with pycnometers sinking velocities of 30 individual aggregates 10 per triplicate were determined in a column diameter 5 cm filled with tap water 20 c and recorded with a camera 13 megapixel 30 fps afterwards the same aggregates were removed from the column and checked for their plastic content under a light microscope the esds of sinking aggregates were calculated from the recorded images using imagej sunken biomass aggregates remaining after aggregate selection and sampling were filtered onto a stainless steel sieve 47 mm pore size 10 µm to remove non aggregated cells the filters were subsequently rinsed three times with ultrapure water the biomass was dried 60 c 24 h and analysed for its mineral content using xrd cell

performed using a panalytical empyrean diffractometer equipped with a co tube automatic divergence slit and pixcel 3d detector field samples were sieved 4 mm to remove pe squares and filled into 27 mm

bioinformatics total dna was extracted using the dna power soil pro kit qiagen with modifications biofilm covered plastic particles were transferred into the powerbead pro tubes containing 800 µl of solution cd1 the tubes were fixed horizontally to a vortex adapter and shaken for one hour for mechanical disruption of bacteria afterwards samples were incubated for one hour with 25 μl proteinase k 22 mg ml 1 at 37 c the extraction was continued following the instructions given by the supplier libraries sequencing and data analysis were performed by microsynth ag balgach switzerland to assess the bacterial diversity the v4 v5 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by two step pcr using the primer pair 515f y and 926r parada et al 2016 libraries were sequenced using a v2 500

values and the decline of dissolved ca2 in surface water figure s3 were observed in 2018 and 2019 calcium made up between 0 9 and 6 3 of the settling matter during june july and july august 2018 table s2 assuming that this ca was present solely in the form of calcite this mineral accounted for 0 24 2 23 g m 2 d 1 or up to 16 7 of the total settling matter during this time bautzen reservoir has a lower potential for calcite precipitation in the surface water compared to lakes such as baldeggersee luzern switzerland producing 10 20 g calcite m 2 day 1 teranes et al 1999 or lake constance switzerland germany austria with 14 g m 2 d 1 stabel 1988 calcite precipitation is of high importance for matter flux in many eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes whereas being less intense in hyper eutrophic and oligotrophic water bodies koschel et al 1983 3 2 field biofilms and microplastic biofouling in bautzen reservoir the incubation cage and pe particles were covered by dense brownish biofilms after the incubation period of 29 days whitish minerals fig 1 a covered the biofilms surfaces and calcein stainable minerals were found in close proximity to cyanobacterial cells fig 1b this mineralized appearance of the biofilm was reflected by the high dry mass 19 5 3 6 n 3 and ash content 91 2 1 9 n 3 mineral phases of the cage walls biofilms were comprised of 98 pure calcite and 2 quartz as shown by xrd analysis figure s4 the contents of major elements within the cage walls biofilms dry mass were 0 2 al 31 1 ca 0 3 fe 0 4 mg 0 1 mn and 0 12 si as ca appeared solely in the form of calcite caco3 this mineral accounted for 78 of the biofilms dry mass the calcite content of bautzen reservoir biofilms was higher compared to biofilms found in lake velence 30 calcite záray et al 2005 and the sanjiadian reservoir 20 40 tianzhi et al 2014 thus calcite seems to be a common and major component of biofilms in lakes of different trophic states and water chemistry the respective wet density of the calcified biofilms was 1 18 g cm 3 0 012 n 3 20 c given the similarity of cage walls biofilms and pe biofilms figure s2 results might be extrapolated to the mp particles however it cannot be excluded that biofilm properties slightly differed which should be considered while interpreting the results the community composition within the biofilms of buoyant and sunken pe particles was examined via clsm and 16s amplicon sequencing clsm analysis showed that the sunken particles had significantly higher cell volumes of bacteria 0 43 to 0 007 µm3 µm 2 cyanobacteria 0 09 to 0 0002 µm3 µm 2 and algae 0 03 to 0 µm3 µm 2 if compared with the buoyant particles fig 2 cyanobacteria occurred either as filamentous colonies of elongated thin cells which were found in 85 of the analysed images n 50 or as colonies of rounded cells found in 28 of the images n 50 classification of the 16s rrna gene sequences revealed a dominance of non phototrophic bacteria 66 of all sequences fig 3 still a significant abundance 34 of cyanobacteria was detected within the calcifying biofilms only 12 different bacterial phyla were found on the particles such low otu richness has been described previously as a common feature of microbial biofilms on mp amaral zettler et al 2020 the non phototrophic phyla found in this study have already been described by other authors to colonize mp exposed to river or lake water hoellein et al 2014 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 within the cyanobacteria gpi were the most abundant group 26 followed by gpv 7 and gpiia 1 fig 3 based on further classification of the sequences using blast analysis altschul et al 1990 the groups gpi and gpv could be assigned to chamaesiphon spp and leptolyngbya spp according to their morphology the colonies of rounded cells could belong to chamaesiphon spp kurmayer et al 2018 whereas the filamentous colonies which were found in most of the images resembled leptolyngbya spp arp et al 2010 cells both genera chamaesiphon spp peraza zurita et al 2005 and leptolyngbya spp zippel and neu 2011 are common members of calcifying freshwater biofilms arp et al 2010 especially leptolyngbya spp has been associated with an increase of sicalcite and calcite precipitations within stream biofilms brinkmann et al 2015 further calcite grains are often found in close proximity or even encrusting cyanobacterial cells martinez et al 2010 which was also observed in our study using calcein staining fig 1b hence it is likely that calcite was precipitated by cyanobacteria leading to densification of the biofilms and subsequent sinking of the pe particles still heterotrophic bacteria might have influenced the calcite precipitation by providing nucleation sites or releasing ca2 bound to the organic biofilm matrix lópez garcía et al 2005 as algae and diatoms were scarce throughout occurring in only 10 of the image datasets n 50 their influence on calcite precipitation might have been minor pe particle buoyancy was tested by observing their upward or downward movement in water approximately 20 to 30 particles 10 15 lost their buoyancy at the end of the field experiment for a minor fraction of pe particles physical disturbance by the sampling procedure led to a certain loss of biofilm and consequently to regaining of their buoyancy the interior of the cage was covered with biofilms entrapping and hiding some of the pe particles as a consequence the proportion of sunken particles could not be estimated precisely leading to the conservative number of 20 to 30 sunken particles the density of the sunken pe particles was 1 19 g cm 3 at 20 c n 1 which implies a sharp density increase compared to pristine particles ρ 0 924 g cm 3 biofilm formation has already been reported to sink buoyant mp within 18 days in shallow and high productive lakes chen et al 2019 the authors hypothesized that minerals calcite clays trapped within the biofilms rather than the microbial cells induced sinking of the mp chen et al 2019 in the present study a biofilm volume of 2 68 10 2 cm3 n 1 was bound to the sunken mp from bautzen reservoir of which only 1 85 10 6 cm3 n 50 was accounted for by cells the main part of the fouling film collected from cage walls was comprised of water around 77 of the weight organic material around 2 and inorganic components around 21 with calcite constituting 17 of the total biofilm weight therefore it can be assumed that the contribution of organic matter and microbial cells to the overall biofilm density was minor compared to biogenic calcite in marine environments similar studies found that buoyant mp will sink within 2 to 6 weeks fazey and ryan 2016 kaiser et al 2017 due to the development of fouling films on their surfaces results of different studies are not easily transferable since the effect of biofouling on mp density is related to particle surface to volume ratio which is influenced by particle specific size and shape chubarenko et al 2016 mp films are more susceptible towards biofouling than fibers or spheres chubarenko et al 2016 while small particles will lose buoyancy faster than large particles fazey and ryan 2016 however the effect of biofouling has only been described for large particles yet given by their small size sub millimeter mp particles will be colonized by different organisms compared to large plastics rogers et al 2020 therefore it remains uncertain if findings made for larger plastics can be transferred to small mp 1 mm hence our finding that calcite formation reduces the buoyancy of large pe films might not be extrapolated to particles smaller than 1 mm furthermore it should be considered that the used pe films represented only a small part of the different shapes and size classes of mp found in freshwater as size and shape influence the surface to volume ratio these parameters have to be carefully taken into account when transferring the results of this study to other types of particles 3 3 calcium cyanobacteria and mp aggregation in lab experiments sinking aggregates of microcystis spp cells formed under the influence of 220 mg l 1 and 60 mg l 1 ca2 after 2 h and 2 days respectively while no aggregates formed under 10 mg l 1 ca2 within 7 days each of the experimental approaches reached ph 9 7 at the end of the experiment declining of ca2 concentration was not detected during the experiments calcite or other mineral phases were not found within the aggregates employing xrd analysis pe particles were incorporated into the matrix figure s5 or attached to the outer side of the aggregates some of the polymer particles were encrusted by calcein stainable matter fig 4 the aggregates formed in 60 mg l 1 and 220 mg l 1 ca2 incorporated on average 2 mp particles mean n 60 and subsequently transported them to the bottom of the incubation flasks fig 5 each flask contained approximately 65 aggregates mean n 5 which in sum incorporated 130 pe particles 0 4 of added particles aggregation and settling of mp with eukaryotic algae lagarde et al 2016 and diatoms long et al 2015 have been reported before so freshwater algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii formed dense aggregates ρ 1 2 g cm 3 with polypropylene mp readily sinking in culture media lagarde et al 2016 the aggregates in our study were denser than water ρ 1 1 g cm 3 for 60 mg l 1 ca2 1 05 g cm 3 for 220 mg l 1 ca2 fig 5 and slightly exceeded the density ranges previously reported for cyanobacterial aggregates 1 01 1 05 g cm 3 li et al 2016 aggregate densities might be influenced by strain specific excretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps li et al 2016 or formation of gas vacuoles xu et al 2016a furthermore the density of such aggregates strongly depends on other external factors such as the seasons li et al 2016 under favourable environmental conditions such as high temperature nutrient loadings or light intensities li et al 2016 cyanobacterial aggregates may stay afloat instead of sinking to the sediments multiple linear regression modelling revealed that sinking speed of the aggregates was dependent solely on their size with larger colonies settling faster than smaller ones aggregates in 60 mg l 1 ca2 were significantly larger mean 1519 µm n 30 than the aggregates formed in 220 mg l 1 ca2 mean 1262 µm n 30 therefore they were settling approximately 25 faster than the smaller aggregates fig 5 regarding the longer incubation time 2 days for 60 mg l 1 ca2 and 1 day for 220 mg l 1 ca2 this might have been a temporal effect rather than depending on the ca2 concentration considering the sinking velocity of the aggregates 0 0036 m s 1 for 60 mg l 1 ca2 and 0 0029 m s 1 for 220 mg l 1 ca2 aggregation with cyanobacteria may transport buoyant small pe to the sediment of bautzen reservoir within 34 to 42 minutes however this might only hold true for mp particles being smaller than the enclosing cyanobacterial aggregates large particles 1 5 mm such as the pe films used in the field study are unlikely to be incorporated into the cyanobacterial aggregates 1 1 5 mm therefore the results might only be applicable for mp smaller than 100 µm most likely aggregation of cyanobacterial cells was induced by the elevated ca2 concentrations used in our study ca2 ions are suspected to form bridges between the negatively charged cyanobacteria or eps xu et al 2016a leading to the formation of cell aggregates chen and lürling 2020 furthermore elevated ca2 concentrations can increase the production of cyanobacteria eps wang et al 2011 which plays a crucial role in aggregation processes by providing a sticky flexible and robust matrix in which cells are embedded de oliveira et al 2020 the assumed bridging role of ca2 can be supported by the presence of calcein stainable matter within the aggregates fig 4 connecting the cyanobacterial cells ca2 concentrations 20 mg l 1 are required to induce aggregation of cyanobacterial cells chen and lürling 2020 bautzen reservoir has a median ca2 concentration of 35 mg l 1 which lies in the usual range 10 120 mg l 1 ca2 of freshwater bodies wang et al 2011 correspondingly large cyanobacterial aggregates colonies were observed in bautzen reservoir during the samplings in 2018 and 2019 figure s6 this leads to the assumption that the aggregation of cyanobacteria through ca bridging might be relevant for the fate of small mp in bautzen reservoir the ca2 concentrations used in the lab experiments did not reflect the actual concentrations found in bautzen reservoir still we could show that microcystis spp aggregate with mp under environmentally relevant ca2 concentrations 60 mg l 1 field and lab experiments described two distinct processes leading to sinking of buoyant pe microplastics in the context of cyanobacterial interaction with calcium apparently the formation of biofilms sank proportionally more particles 10 15 than the aggregation of small pe with cyanobacteria however the low removal efficiency rather resulted from the low concentration of cyanobacterial aggregates mean 130 aggregates l 1 than from the number of pe particles incorporated into each of the aggregates mean 2 taking into account that during cyanobacteria blooms concentrations of 3 5 105 aggregates l 1 can be reached feng et al 2019 aggregation governs a high potential for mp removal in productive lakes 4 conclusions a proportion of polyethylene microplastics 10 15 of particles lost its buoyancy due to biofilm formation after being exposed for 29 days in a eutrophic reservoir biofilms were rich in calcite apparently the mineral had a greater effect on biofilm density compared to organic matter or cells cyanobacteria chamaesiphon spp and leptolyngbya spp were abundant biofilm members probably facilitating calcite formation in the biofilms planktonic cyanobacteria formed sinking aggregates with small polyethylene microplastics enclosing 0 4 of particles under elevated ca concentrations

july and august kamjunke et al 1997 in lake water microcystis spp are aggregating to large and sinking colonies chen and lürling 2020 under the influence of dissolved ca2 xu et al 2016a these cell aggregates are often exceeding 500 µm in diameter feng et al 2019 possibly enclosing small inorganic particles xu et al 2016b the question whether such microcystis aggregates form under the influence of ca2 and subsequently could enclose or sink buoyant mp was studied in lab experiments therefore we investigated interaction of sessile and planktonic cyanobacteria with calcium in regards of their impact on the buoyancy of pe in freshwater reservoirs we hypothesized that i biofilms form on large pe in a eutrophic reservoir leading to a loss in buoyancy ii buoyancy loss is caused by calcite precipitation iii planktonic cyanobacteria sink small pe mp through ca2 induced aggregation these hypotheses were tested by conducting a field experiment in the eutrophic bautzen reservoir saxony germany and laboratory batch experiments with calcifying cyanobacteria 2 material and methods 2 1 study site bautzen reservoir is a freshwater body in the eastern part of germany providing water for cooling of coal fired power stations fish farming and agricultural irrigation it is a large 5 3 km2 but rather shallow mean depth 7 4 m reservoir kasprzak et al 2007 often experiencing strong winds which sometimes even destroy the summer stratification kerimoglu and rinke 2013 bautzen reservoir is eutrophic with extensive blooms of microcystis spp kamjunke et al 1997 occurring during summer which results in ph values up to 9 5 in the surface water one sediment trap uwitec austria collecting settling matter was deployed near the deepest point of the reservoir depth 12 m during the year 2018 from may to december and sampled in monthly intervals 2 2 plastic material exposition and sampling procedure squares 4 4 0 15 mm made from low density polyethylene goodfellow et311251 ρ 0 924 g

shading effect which reduced the incoming sunlight intensity by 33 leiser et al 2020 particles were sterilized by treatment with ethanol 70 v v 10 min prior to the experiment the cage was incubated from july 23 to august 21 2019 29 days in 0 5 m depth profiles of oxygen concentrations chlorophyll a ph temperature multi parameter probe sea sun technologies germany were measured on both dates figure s1 2 3 biofilm characterization and sampling procedures particles were gently removed from the cage by tweezers or by flushing with reservoir water particles for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm analysis were fixed in 4 v v formalin solution right after removal from the cage the other particles were stored in pre combusted 450 c 4 h glass petri dishes in filtered reservoir water additional biofilm samples were taken from the inner wall of the cage and stored in reservoir water as well these samples were used to characterize the biofilms in regards of dry mass mineral composition and elemental content the pe particles were in close proximity to or even enclosed by biofilms growing on the inner cage walls given their visual appearance biofilms on pe were not different from biofilms from the inner cage walls figure s2 therefore cage walls biofilms were considered being comparable to pe biofilms in regards of the above mentioned parameters most samples except samples for dna extraction were stored at 8 c in the dark until processing the densities and volumes of three fresh biofilm sub samples from the inner walls of the cage 300 400 mg and three pooled sunken pe particles were analysed with pycnometers at 25 c dry weight 60 c 24 h and ash mass 450 c 24 h were determined for three individual cage walls biofilm samples the cell volume of microorganisms biovolume within the biofilms of ten buoyant and five sinking pe particles was analysed via clsm and image analysis particles were examined at five floating or ten sinking random

described elsewhere leiser et al 2020 in brief particles were mounted and stained sybrgreen calcein in petri dishes imaging was done using a tcs sp5x upright microscope equipped with white laser and 63x na 0 9 lens leica calcein staining 1 µg l 1 2 h room temperature was used to visualize divalent cations such as ca2 and ca carbonate minerals zippel and neu 2011 calcein staining is not specific for ca2 ions or calcite and may also react with other divalent cations present in the solution the calcein stain did not bind to pristine pe particles data not shown pe particles were stained with non toxic idye polypink following established protocols karakolis et al 2019 bacteria algae and cyanobacteria were identified via sybrgreen staining autofluorescence of chlorophyll a or phycobilins

quantitatively calculate the biovolumes of algae bacteria and cyanobacteria cells staudt et al 2004 2 5 cyanobacteria cultures and laboratory aggregation experiments the effect of dissolved ca2 on the aggregation of mp with cyanobacteria was investigated using non axenic cultures of microcystis sp strain bm25 schwarzenberger et al 2013 grown in wc media guillard and lorenzen 1972 without vitamin solution and silicate pre cultures were grown on a rotary shaker 110 rpm at room temperature and ambient daylight for 4 weeks prior to the experiment pe powder ρ 0 920 g cm 3 alfa aesar 9002 88 4 was

bm25 experiments were conducted in triplicates by inoculating 500 ml wc media with 10 v v cyanobacteria pre culture in airtight 1 liter flasks cell concentrations 107 cells ml 1 were chosen to reflect the concentration of microcystis spp in bautzen reservoir during summer 3 5 107 cells ml 1 data provided by the state reservoir administration of saxony landestalsperrenverwaltung des freistaates sachsen ltv right after inoculation samples for ph ca2 and cell counts were taken directly afterwards ph was measured using a ph meter pp 50 sartorius calcium samples were filtered 0 2 µm and stored

were stopped after 7 days upon termination samples for ca2 ph and cell counts were taken as described above aggregates formed within the flasks were photographed and counted employing imagej cell counter plugin rueden et al 2017 furthermore visible aggregates were gently removed using an inverted glass pipette twelve aggregates per ca2 condition 4 per triplicate were transferred into a coverwell chamber thermo fisher scientific for clsm ca2 and fluorescent mp within the sinking aggregates were visualized via clsm density measurements were conducted with 9 aggregates per ca2 condition 3 per triplicate in a temperature controlled chamber at 20 c aggregates were transferred to ultrapure water 20 c and titrated with nai 2 g ml 1 ρ 1 690 g cm 3 until neutral buoyancy was achieved the density of the resulting solution was measured with pycnometers sinking velocities of 30 individual aggregates 10 per triplicate were determined in a column diameter 5 cm filled with tap water 20 c and recorded with a camera 13 megapixel 30 fps afterwards the same aggregates were removed from the column and checked for their plastic content under a light microscope the esds of sinking aggregates were calculated from the recorded images using imagej sunken biomass aggregates remaining after aggregate selection and sampling were filtered onto a stainless steel sieve 47 mm pore size 10 µm to remove non aggregated cells the filters were subsequently rinsed three times with ultrapure water the biomass was dried 60 c 24 h and analysed for its mineral content using xrd cell concentrations were determined by epifluorescence microscopy after sybrgreen staining calcium concentrations in the media were measured via icp oes 2 6 x ray diffraction x ray diffraction was performed using a panalytical empyrean diffractometer equipped with a co tube automatic divergence slit and pixcel 3d detector field samples were sieved 4 mm to remove pe squares and filled into 27 mm

the bacterial diversity the v4 v5 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by two step pcr using the primer pair 515f y and 926r parada et al 2016 libraries were sequenced using a v2 500

values and the decline of dissolved ca2 in surface water figure s3 were observed in 2018 and 2019 calcium made up between 0 9 and 6 3 of the settling matter during june july and july august 2018 table s2 assuming that this ca was present solely in the form of calcite this mineral accounted for 0 24 2 23 g m 2 d 1 or up to 16 7 of the total settling matter during this time bautzen reservoir has a lower potential for calcite precipitation in the surface water compared to lakes such as baldeggersee luzern switzerland producing 10 20 g calcite m 2 day 1 teranes et al 1999 or lake constance switzerland germany austria with 14 g m 2 d 1 stabel 1988 calcite precipitation is of high importance for matter flux in many eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes whereas being less intense in hyper eutrophic and oligotrophic water bodies koschel et al 1983 3 2 field biofilms and microplastic biofouling in bautzen reservoir the incubation cage and pe particles were covered by dense brownish biofilms after the incubation period of 29 days whitish minerals fig 1 a covered the biofilms surfaces and calcein stainable minerals were found in close proximity to cyanobacterial cells fig 1b this mineralized appearance of the biofilm was reflected by the high dry mass 19 5 3 6 n 3 and ash content 91 2 1 9 n 3 mineral phases of the cage walls biofilms were comprised of 98 pure calcite and 2 quartz as shown by xrd analysis figure s4 the contents of major elements within the cage walls biofilms dry mass were 0 2 al 31 1 ca 0 3 fe 0 4 mg 0 1 mn and 0 12 si as ca appeared solely in the form of calcite caco3 this mineral accounted for 78 of the biofilms dry mass the calcite content of bautzen reservoir biofilms was higher compared to biofilms found in lake velence 30 calcite záray et al 2005 and the sanjiadian reservoir 20 40 tianzhi et al 2014 thus calcite seems to be a common and major component of biofilms in lakes of different trophic states and water chemistry the respective wet density of the calcified biofilms was 1 18 g cm 3 0 012 n 3 20 c given the similarity of cage walls biofilms and pe biofilms figure s2 results might be extrapolated to the mp particles however it cannot be excluded that biofilm properties slightly differed which should be considered while interpreting the results the community composition within the biofilms of buoyant and sunken pe particles was examined via clsm and 16s amplicon sequencing clsm analysis showed that the sunken particles had significantly higher cell volumes of bacteria 0 43 to 0 007 µm3 µm 2 cyanobacteria 0 09 to 0 0002 µm3 µm 2 and algae 0 03 to 0 µm3 µm 2 if compared with the buoyant particles fig 2 cyanobacteria occurred either as filamentous colonies of elongated thin cells which were found in 85 of the analysed images n 50 or as colonies of rounded cells found in 28 of the images n 50 classification of the 16s rrna gene sequences revealed a dominance of non phototrophic bacteria 66 of all sequences fig 3 still a significant abundance 34 of cyanobacteria was detected within the calcifying biofilms only 12 different bacterial phyla were found on the particles such low otu richness has been described previously as a common feature of microbial biofilms on mp amaral zettler et al 2020 the non phototrophic phyla found in this study have already been described by other authors to colonize mp exposed to river or lake water hoellein et al 2014 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 within the cyanobacteria gpi were the most abundant group 26 followed by gpv 7 and gpiia 1 fig 3 based on further classification of the sequences using blast analysis altschul et al 1990 the groups gpi and gpv could be assigned to chamaesiphon spp and leptolyngbya spp according to their morphology the colonies of rounded cells could belong to chamaesiphon spp kurmayer et al 2018 whereas the filamentous colonies which were found in most of the images resembled leptolyngbya spp arp et al 2010 cells both genera chamaesiphon spp peraza zurita et al 2005 and leptolyngbya spp zippel and neu 2011 are common members of calcifying freshwater biofilms arp et al 2010 especially leptolyngbya spp has been associated with an increase of sicalcite and calcite precipitations within stream biofilms brinkmann et al 2015 further calcite grains are often found in close proximity or even encrusting cyanobacterial cells martinez et al 2010 which was also observed in our study using calcein staining fig 1b hence it is likely that calcite was precipitated by cyanobacteria leading to densification of the biofilms and subsequent sinking of the pe particles still heterotrophic bacteria might have influenced the calcite precipitation by providing nucleation sites or releasing ca2 bound to the organic biofilm matrix lópez garcía et al 2005 as algae and diatoms were scarce throughout occurring in only 10 of the image datasets n 50 their influence on calcite precipitation might have been minor pe particle buoyancy was tested by observing their upward or downward movement in water approximately 20 to 30 particles 10 15 lost their buoyancy at the end of the field experiment for a minor fraction of pe particles physical disturbance by the sampling procedure led to a certain loss of biofilm and consequently to regaining of their buoyancy the interior of the cage was covered with biofilms entrapping and hiding some of the pe particles as a consequence the proportion of sunken particles could not be estimated precisely leading to the conservative number of 20 to 30 sunken particles the density of the sunken pe particles was 1 19 g cm 3 at 20 c n 1 which implies a sharp density increase compared to pristine particles ρ 0 924 g cm 3 biofilm formation has already been reported to sink buoyant mp within 18 days in shallow and high productive lakes chen et al 2019 the authors hypothesized that minerals calcite clays trapped within the biofilms rather than the microbial cells induced sinking of the mp chen et al 2019 in the present study a biofilm volume of 2 68 10 2 cm3 n 1 was bound to the sunken mp from bautzen reservoir of which only 1 85 10 6 cm3 n 50 was accounted for by cells the main part of the fouling film collected from cage walls was comprised of water around 77 of the weight organic material around 2 and inorganic components around 21 with calcite constituting 17 of the total biofilm weight therefore it can be assumed that the contribution of organic matter and microbial cells to the overall biofilm density was minor compared to biogenic calcite in marine environments similar studies found that buoyant mp will sink within 2 to 6 weeks fazey and ryan 2016 kaiser et al 2017 due to the development of fouling films on their surfaces results of different studies are not easily transferable since the effect of biofouling on mp density is related to particle surface to volume ratio which is influenced by particle specific size and shape chubarenko et al 2016 mp films are more susceptible towards biofouling than fibers or spheres chubarenko et al 2016 while small particles will lose buoyancy faster than large particles fazey and ryan 2016 however the effect of biofouling has only been described for large particles yet given by their small size sub millimeter mp particles will be colonized by different organisms compared to large plastics rogers et al 2020 therefore it remains uncertain if findings made for larger plastics can be transferred to small mp 1 mm hence our finding that calcite formation reduces the buoyancy of large pe films might not be extrapolated to particles smaller than 1 mm furthermore it should be considered that the used pe films represented only a small part of the different shapes and size classes of mp found in freshwater as size and shape influence the surface to volume ratio these parameters have to be carefully taken into account when transferring the results of this study to other types of particles 3 3 calcium cyanobacteria and mp aggregation in lab experiments sinking aggregates of microcystis spp cells formed under the influence of 220 mg l 1 and 60 mg l 1 ca2 after 2 h and 2 days respectively while no aggregates formed under 10 mg l 1 ca2 within 7 days each of the experimental approaches reached ph 9 7 at the end of the experiment declining of ca2 concentration was not detected during the experiments calcite or other mineral phases were not found within the aggregates employing xrd analysis pe particles were incorporated into the matrix figure s5 or attached to the outer side of the aggregates some of the polymer particles were encrusted by calcein stainable matter fig 4 the aggregates formed in 60 mg l 1 and 220 mg l 1 ca2 incorporated on average 2 mp particles mean n 60 and subsequently transported them to the bottom of the incubation flasks fig 5 each flask contained approximately 65 aggregates mean n 5 which in sum incorporated 130 pe particles 0 4 of added particles aggregation and settling of mp with eukaryotic algae lagarde et al 2016 and diatoms long et al 2015 have been reported before so freshwater algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii formed dense aggregates ρ 1 2 g cm 3 with polypropylene mp readily sinking in culture media lagarde et al 2016 the aggregates in our study were denser than water ρ 1 1 g cm 3 for 60 mg l 1 ca2 1 05 g cm 3 for 220 mg l 1 ca2 fig 5 and slightly exceeded the density ranges previously reported for cyanobacterial aggregates 1 01 1 05 g cm 3 li et al 2016 aggregate densities might be influenced by strain specific excretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps li et al 2016 or formation of gas vacuoles xu et al 2016a furthermore the density of such aggregates strongly depends on other external factors such as the seasons li et al 2016 under favourable environmental conditions such as high temperature nutrient loadings or light intensities li et al 2016 cyanobacterial aggregates may stay afloat instead of sinking to the sediments multiple linear regression modelling revealed that sinking speed of the aggregates was dependent solely on their size with larger colonies settling faster than smaller ones aggregates in 60 mg l 1 ca2 were significantly larger mean 1519 µm n 30 than the aggregates formed in 220 mg l 1 ca2 mean 1262 µm n 30 therefore they were settling approximately 25 faster than the smaller aggregates fig 5 regarding the longer incubation time 2 days for 60 mg l 1 ca2 and 1 day for 220 mg l 1 ca2 this might have been a temporal effect rather than depending on the ca2 concentration considering the sinking velocity of the aggregates 0 0036 m s 1 for 60 mg l 1 ca2 and 0 0029 m s 1 for 220 mg l 1 ca2 aggregation with cyanobacteria may transport buoyant small pe to the sediment of bautzen reservoir within 34 to 42 minutes however this might only hold true for mp particles being smaller than the enclosing cyanobacterial aggregates large particles 1 5 mm such as the pe films used in the field study are unlikely to be incorporated into the cyanobacterial aggregates 1 1 5 mm therefore the results might only be applicable for mp smaller than 100 µm most likely aggregation of cyanobacterial cells was induced by the elevated ca2 concentrations used in our study ca2 ions are suspected to form bridges between the negatively charged cyanobacteria or eps xu et al 2016a leading to the formation of cell aggregates chen and lürling 2020 furthermore elevated ca2 concentrations can increase the production of cyanobacteria eps wang et al 2011 which plays a crucial role in aggregation processes by providing a sticky flexible and robust matrix in which cells are embedded de oliveira et al 2020 the assumed bridging role of ca2 can be supported by the presence of calcein stainable matter within the aggregates fig 4 connecting the cyanobacterial cells ca2 concentrations 20 mg l 1 are required to induce aggregation of cyanobacterial cells chen and lürling 2020 bautzen reservoir has a median ca2 concentration of 35 mg l 1 which lies in the usual range 10 120 mg l 1 ca2 of freshwater bodies wang et al 2011 correspondingly large cyanobacterial aggregates colonies were observed in bautzen reservoir during the samplings in 2018 and 2019 figure s6 this leads to the assumption that the aggregation of cyanobacteria through ca bridging might be relevant for the fate of small mp in bautzen reservoir the ca2 concentrations used in the lab experiments did not reflect the actual concentrations found in bautzen reservoir still we could show that microcystis spp aggregate with mp under environmentally relevant ca2 concentrations 60 mg l 1 field and lab experiments described two distinct processes leading to sinking of buoyant pe microplastics in the context of cyanobacterial interaction with calcium apparently the formation of biofilms sank proportionally more particles 10 15 than the aggregation of small pe with cyanobacteria however the low removal efficiency rather resulted from the low concentration of cyanobacterial aggregates mean 130 aggregates l 1 than from the number of pe particles incorporated into each of the aggregates mean 2 taking into account that during cyanobacteria blooms concentrations of 3 5 105 aggregates l 1 can be reached feng et al 2019 aggregation governs a high potential for mp removal in productive lakes 4 conclusions a proportion of polyethylene microplastics 10 15 of particles lost its buoyancy due to biofilm formation after being exposed for 29 days in a eutrophic reservoir biofilms were rich in calcite apparently the mineral had a greater effect on biofilm density compared to organic matter or cells cyanobacteria chamaesiphon spp and leptolyngbya spp were abundant biofilm members probably facilitating calcite formation in the biofilms planktonic cyanobacteria formed sinking aggregates with small polyethylene microplastics enclosing 0 4 of particles under elevated ca concentrations

17336,calcification of anaerobic granular sludge causing the decrease of microbial activity has been focused for several decades but the mechanism of calcification and deactivation of calcified granule are still lacking in this study the calcification process of anaerobic granular sludge was analyzed in the uasb reactor with long term exposure to a high calcium level of 2 gca2 l 1 greyish white calcified granules with larger size and density first appeared at the bottom of sludge bed characterization of granular surface demonstrated that calcified granules had smaller specific surface area and pore volume with the disappearing channels in granules visualized over calcification the coverage of calcite on granular surface with a thickness of 500 600 µm was observed by a microscope which is responsible for the blockage of channels for substrate diffusion and transport the evaluation of mass transfer showed that the effectiveness factor η of calcified granules was higher than 1 23 proving the existence of mass transfer resistance furthermore the interactions between calcium and extracellular polymeric substances eps revealed the possible mechanism of calcite location at the outer layer of anaerobic granular sludge the bulk calcite directly binds the eps such as humic acids via charging functional groups and bulk co3 2 could react easily with ca2 bound to eps according to thermodynamic analysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high calcium wastewater calcified granule mass transfer resistance calcite extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction granular sludge is one special kind of biofilm which displays superior properties compared to flocs the dense compact microbial structure allows more regular shape faster settling and higher biomass density of granules franca et al 2017 these characteristics make anaerobic granules the core of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and internal circulation ic for wastewater treatment and energy recovery moreover the spherical shape and layered structure of anaerobic granules lead to their ability of pollutants removal or methane production affected by mass transfer of substrate within the granule macleod et al 1990 lemaire et al 2008 thus fast mass transfer is necessary to support the efficient performance of anaerobic bioreactors and pores and channels are the important three dimensional architecture of the granules matrix formed in the process of aggregation and offer the better mass transport within the granules flemming and wingender 2010 in the granular sludge microorganisms are surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances eps composed of proteins pn polysaccharides ps humic acids ha and nucleic acids ua etc which have an enormous effect on the granulation of sludge shi et al 2017 torres et al 2018 multivalent cations especially ca2 are another key material contributing to promoting granulation liu et al 2020 not coincidentally the interaction between eps and ca2 can greatly influence the properties of sludge and performance of sludge digestion ma et al 2020 the fundamental reason for this effect is ca2 can bridge with eps containing abundant negative charge through electrostatic force sheng et al 2013 yan et al 2017 in addition ca2 tends to react with co3 2 and po4 3 and the precipitates like bone act as a support structure in the core of granules batstone et al 2002 ren et al 2008 higher ph in the center of granules determines the easier formation of precipitates in the core cunha et al 2018a however the location of calcium in the granules is a debate cao et al 2014 found that calcium was distributed primarily in the periphery of the granules and promoted the growth of granules the reason why calcium is located in the outer layer of granules has been unclear yet every coin has two sides excessive calcium in the bulk or granules would lead to granule calcification and then change the characteristics and performance of granules dang et al 2014 yu et al 2019 unfortunately high calcium is a common feature of various kinds of industrial wastewater especially papermaking wastewater which is mostly treated by anaerobic technology işık et al 2010 gagliano et al 2017 found that calcium 1 g l 1 has a negative effect on biofilm formation and reactor performance the decrease of biomass concentrations is also caused by granule calcification at the calcium concentration of 450 800 mg l 1 and the calcium precipitation in the granules is nearly proportional to the calcium concentration in the wastewater yu et al 2001 to solve the problem of granule calcification in the anaerobic treatment of calcium rich wastewater the deactivation mechanism of calcified anaerobic granules in the biophysical aspect has been studied by researchers a common argument claims that the calcium precipitates in the center caco3 dominates or the outer layer cax po4 y dominates of granules occupy the space for microbes colonization and block the channels for mass transfer batstone et al 2002 yu et al 2019 nevertheless there is a lack of research on the characteristics and deactivation mechanism of anaerobic granules with long term exposure to high calcium level because granule calcification can t occur overnight in this study a calcium level higher than 1 g l 1 is defined as high concentration according to the previous studies and actual calcium concentration of papermaking wastewater 1 1 3 g l 1 to further investigate the causes of formation and deactivation of calcified granules the dynamic development of granule calcification was supervised based on the long term exposure of anaerobic granules to high calcium of 2 gca2 l 1 in the uasb reactor in this study calcified granules were distinguished from non calcified granules through calcium content quantification and color observation accordingly the calcium mineral in the calcified granules was identified and its distribution was also visualized by microscopy the characteristics containing surface structure and microstructure of calcified granules were comprehensively analyzed to investigate the effect of calcification on the granules and the mass transfer of granules was assessed by calculating the effectiveness factor η at the same time the properties of eps in the calcified granules and the thermodynamics of eps binding ca2 were studied the interactions between eps and calcium were finally discussed to reveal the mechanisms of granule calcification and deactivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 system set up and operation two 5 5 l lab scale up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactors were continuously operated in three stages with an increasing organic loading rate olr the inoculated granular sludge was collected from a full scale internal circulation ic bioreactor in a citric acid plant zhejiang china the difference between the two reactors was whether the influent contained additional calcium ions of high concentration the reactor without calcium addition acted as a control rn while another one was the focus of this study with adding calcium ions of 2 g l 1 rc

leica s8ap0 germany the granule morphology was visualized with a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm 1000 japan prior to sem observation granular sludge in different stages of rc was sampled on days 1 50 and 100 and the samples should be dehydrated by gradient ethanol and dried by a critical point dryer leica em cpd300 germany to quantify the surface topographies of granules the sem images were further analyzed by software imagej according to tsui et al 2018 in brief quantitative surface characterization was performed with a plugin called surfcharj before the image type set as 32 bit the assessed result was represented as several surface roughness parameters including the arithmetic mean deviation ra root mean square deviation rq lowest valley rv highest peak rp total height of the profile rt and mean height of profile irregularities rh and the valleys in the granules were visualized by interactive 3d surface plots generated with a plugin compatible with imagej 2 2 2 composition and distribution of mineral in granules the mineral in granules was detected by polycrystal x ray diffractometer xrd rigaku dmax 2550 pc japan after granules were freeze dried and ground to powder to determine the calcium carbonate localization the evolution of bubbles generation in the mixture of acid and fresh granule with hydrochloric acid titration was observed under the stereo microscope based on the density difference of substance micro computed tomography micro ct was used to distinguish the distribution of mineral in granules micro ct was performed on a multiscale x ray nanotomograph bruker skyscan 2211 belgium the samples were fresh non calcified and calcified granules 2 2 3 granule separation and analysis sludge samples were taken at 4 5 15 and 25 5 cm high from the bottom in both reactors at the end of the experiment particle size and its cumulative distribution of anaerobic granules were analyzed by quick picture qicpic dynamic image analysis system sympatec gmbh germany then the sludge samples were fractioned with mesh sieves as 1 1 to 1 6 1 6 to 2 2 to 2 5 2 5 to 3 and 3 mm diameter the calcium content of granules was analyzed for each size fraction and determined by the atomic absorption spectrometer aas thermo electron mkii m6 usa after acid digestion and filtration cunha et al 2018 moreover the specific surface area and pore volume of the granules in different diameter ranges were determined by the brunauere emmette teller and barrete joynere halenda method leofanti et al 1998 fierro et al 2008 sludge and microbial densities of granules were analyzed after 6000 rpm centrifugation and supernatant removal and calculated by the eqs 1 2 as followed respectively the details were conducted as previous studies chou et al 2008 winkler et al 2012 1 ρ s m s v s 2 ρ m m vss v s where ρs is sludge density kg l 1 ρm is microbial density gvss l 1 sludge ms is the wet weight of sludge vs is the volume of wet sludge and mvss is the weight of volatile suspended solids vss 2 3 mass transfer evaluation of granules the mass transfer evaluation of granules was conducted by batch tests granules were sampled from the bottom sampling outlets of both reactors 1 5 g wet weight intact granules or disintegrated granules after grinding fig s1 were added to 150 ml serum bottles with 60 ml mixed anaerobic media containing 1000 mg cod l 1 of acetate other nutrients were the same as the influent of reactors the serum bottles were sealed after nitrogen sweeping and placed at 35 c methane production was measured by smith fermentation tube which was filled with the 2 mol l 1 naoh solution and connected with the serum bottle by a rubber tube yu et al 2019 the specific methane activity sma of granules was calculated by the slope of the cumulative methane production curve mlch4 h 1 g 1vss all experiments had two replicates the mass transfer capacity of granules was presented as the effectiveness factor η dimensionless according to zinatizadeh et al 2017 as the following equation 3 η sm a disintegrated granules sm a intact granules when η 1 there is no mass transfer resistance in the granules η 1 there is mass transfer resistance in the granules η 1 the microbes in the granules were damaged by the disintegration method 2 4 eps extraction and characterization eps has a different stratified structure in sludge and is classified as soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps in this study 40 ml granular sludge was taken at 4 5 15 and 25 5 cm high from the bottom of both reactors on day 110 the granule sludge was washed by 0 9 physiological saline three times before extraction the extraction protocol of s eps and lb eps was used as described in detail by yu et al 2008 the tb eps was extracted by heating method due to the high extraction efficiency of eps that could be acquired d abzac et al 2010 briefly after extraction of s eps and lb eps the sludge pellets were subsequently resuspended to their original volumes with 0 9 physiological saline subjected to heat treatment at 80 c for 45 min and then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min the bulk solution was collected as tb eps all extracted eps were filtered onto 0 22 µm cellulose nitrate membrane filters the pn and ps contents in the eps were quantified by uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan using the lowry method with bovine serum albumin as standard and the dubios phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard respectively lowry et al 1951 dubios et al 1956 the calcium content of different stratified eps was also measured by aas after acid digestion and filtration the eem fluorescence spectra of the organic matter of all eps were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 4600 japan with excitation ex and emission em wavelength range of ex em 200 500 250 550 nm to quantify the component of eps parafac was used to model the eem fluorescence data by the software matlab r2019a the detailed process was carried out according to stedmon and bro 2008 in the meanwhile the total eps was extracted by heat method from granules taken at the bottom of the reactors rn and rc respectively ftir ava tar370 nicolet usa was applied to detect the functional groups in the eps after filtration and freeze drying 2 5 thermodynamics of ca2 binding with eps to determine the binding capacity of ca2 with eps isothermal titration calorimetry itc on an itc calorimeter microcal vp itc usa was used both ca2 2 mm and freeze dried eps of rn were dissolved in the tris hcl buffer 1 m ph 7 4 titrations of 2 mm ca2 into the eps was conducted at cell temperature 25 c and under stirring speed of 307 rpm the raw itc data were analyzed by origin 7 0 microcal to determine the enthalpy of ca2 binding δh stoichiometric number n and the binding constant k the change in gibbs energy δg and the entropy change δs of the binding were calculated using eq 4 5 he et al 2020 4 δ g rt ln k 5 δ g δ h t δ s 3 results and discussion the reactors condition and performance of three stages for lab scale reactors during a 120 day period operation are summarized in table 1 the only difference between rc and rn is whether calcium ions were added or not obviously the cod removal of the reactor rc with calcium addition of 2 gca2 l 1 decreased with the increase of organic loading rate olr while that of the control rn without calcium addition remained over 98 higher than rc throughout the whole operational period it suggested that the performance of granules was inhibited by calcium addition and granule calcification was considered to be responsible for the deactivation 3 1 calcium content and spatial localization in calcified granules in the process of reactors operation partial black granules especially in the bottom of the sludge bed of rc gradually turned to greyish white as shown in fig s2 the visual difference between two kinds of granules sampled from rn and rc separately at the end of the experiment was obviously shown in fig 1 a b it is speculated that the greyish white granules were the calcified granules to distinguish exactly the calcified granules the calcium content and distribution of granules immersed in calcium containing solutions from rc were determined it can be seen from fig 2 a that the calcium content increased with the increase of particle size but there was no significant difference in calcium content of granules in the vertical distribution at an early stage day 30 the calcium precipitates were accumulated in the process of calcification according to the xrd spectra of anaerobic granules on day 0 40 70 and 105 and identified as the calcite with a reference of standard calcite fig s3 as expected in fig 2b the calcium content of granules sampled on day 110 increased with the particle size ranging from 1 1 6 mm to 3 mm the granules with the particle size of 3 mm in the bottom had the highest calcium content 119 9 9 0 mgca g 1ss in the final stage which was about two times that of the granules 63 6 1 8 mgca g 1ss on day 30 as a control calcium contents of granules taken from rn at 4 5 cm height of the sludge bed on day 110 ranged from 36 7 2 1 to 53 5 0 7 mgca g 1ss much lower than those of granules from rc table s1 the abnormally high calcium content of granules with a size of 1 mm on day 110 was supposed to be caused by granule disaggregation under the conditions of high calcium loading or calcium carbonate formation in the bulk van langerak et al 1998 pevere et al 2007 two kinds of calcium precipitates and their locations in the granules have been proposed as followed 1 calcium carbonate calcite is the dominant crystal in the calcified granules which is mainly distributed in the center and 2 some slice crystals embedded in the granule surface are identified as cax po4 y precipitate yu et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in this study calcite was the main calcium deposit according to the xrd analysis in order to identify the greyish white deposits of granule surface 10 hydrochloric acid was added when granules were immersed in the deionized water under the microscope fig 1c showed that gas bubbles were formed immediately and intensely on the surface of greyish white deposits after hydrochloric acid addition after a while the greyish white deposits disappeared and gas still bubbled up through the granule fig 1d combined with the xrd results the greyish white deposits were identified as the calcite the images analysis revealed that the greyish white deposits calcite of the outer layer with a thickness of 500 600 µm and the same deposits were probably localized in the core of granules to visualize the location of calcite the calcified granule was observed by micro ct compared with the non calcified granule the inorganic part calcite appearing bright was not only present in the center of the granule but also formed layers outside the calcified granule surface fig 1e f tsui et al 2016 reported that the external mass transfer resistance would cause the substrate limitations inside the granule core followed by endogenous respiration and led to hollow granules the calcified granules in this study happened to be hollow fig 1f it seems that the calcite in the out layer was the culprit in the mass transfer resistance 3 2 the physical characteristics of calcified granules the physical characteristics of the granules determine their contact efficiency with wastewater influent and metabolic mass transfer which affect the final biological activity of granules therefore the physical characteristics of granules were then analyzed 3 2 1 particle size distribution and densities of granules the particle size distribution of the granular sludge bed of both reactors on day 105 was presented in fig 3 a the particle size distribution of granules was investigated at all fractioned sizes small granule 1 mm medium granule 1 2 5 mm and coarse granule 2 5 mm at the 25 cm height of the sludge bed the proportions of different size granules in two reactors were similar correspondingly the proportion of small granules at 4 5 and 15 cm high from the bottom of the sludge bed in the rc was much lower than that of rn on the contrary the proportion of coarse granules at 4 5 cm height of granular sludge bed in the rc was 55 73 obviously higher than 44 62 of rn in short the small granules were transformed into the coarse granules with medium granules as a transition under the high calcium conditions and coarse granules settled to the bottom of the reactor the results confirmed the role of ca2 in microbial aggregation which contributed to the formation and growth of granules yu et al 2001 in addition the sieved anaerobic granules with the particle size of 3 mm before physicochemical analysis were greyish white which indicated that calcified granules had the largest size in agreement with the result of sem images fig s4 during the operation of the reactors variation of sludge density of granules from rc was shown in fig 3b a linear increase of sludge density of granules from the 4 5 cm height of the sludge bed in the rc was observed the sludge density of granules in the rc rose to 1 8 0 2 g cm 3 on day 105 which was 1 64 times that of rn as for the granules from the 15 and 25 5 cm height of the sludge bed in two reactors the difference of their densities was indistinct besides the microbial densities of granules from rc were generally higher than that of rn as can be seen from fig 3c it is interpreted that calcium addition can make the granules denser it is well known that gravity is a crucial force of regulating the granules movement and biomass distribution in the system baeten et al 2019 the calcite has been identified as the dominant mineral in the calcified granules in this study the sludge density of granules from the bottom of rc gradually approached that of calcite 2 7 g cm 3 combining with the greyish white granules observed in the bottom of rc the results suggested that the calcified granules were usually denser 3 2 2 granule surface structure referring to the previous researches very little emphasis has been given to the surface structure of calcified granules to investigate the surface structure the surface topographies of granules in each stage were visualized by the software imagej in fig 4 which depended on the sem images fig s4 in addition the quantification of the surface topographies was presented in table 2 the surface roughness rq and ra of granules decreased continuously from stages 1 3 which represented the non calcified partial calcified and calcified granules the increasing rv and decreasing rp values showed that the deepest valley and highest peaks became more shallow moreover the calcified granules also had the lowest rh value which was the mean height of profile irregularities overall the results indicated that the calcified granules had a smoother surface while the surface of non calcified granules was rougher it is found that the surface roughness has some influence on biofilm formation and increased surface roughness of the carriers could promote biofilm accumulation because the uneven surface can provide valleys for the attachment of microorganisms or organic matters gjaltema et al 1997 iorhemen et al 2016 therefore it is speculated that the granule size was increasing due to the biofilm accumulation in the process of calcification and then calcium precipitates covering the surface of granules caused the greyish white and smoother surface the change of surface structure may influence the mass transport so next granule microstructure was further investigated 3 2 3 calcification affecting granule microstructure generally the specific surface area and pore volume as macroscopic structural parameters are used to characterize the granule microstructure and quantify the mass transfer of substrates from the bulk liquid to the granule microorganisms morgenroth et al 2008 tsui et al 2018 to explore the effect of calcification on granule microstructure in this study the specific surface area and pore volume of granules of each size fraction at different heights from the reactor rc were measured fig 5 compared with the inoculated granule the bet surface area and pore volume of granules with the same size fraction in rc mostly declined in the end the bet surface area of granules at the bottom 4 5 cm of the sludge bed was always lower than 2 0 m2 g 1 which was usually lower than that of granules at higher sludge bed it indicated that calcified granules had a smaller specific surface area available for substrate transport and reaction and thus a limited ability of biological treatment nicolella et al 2000 a similar result of pore volume was obtained and altogether the pore volume of granules undergoing the calcification had a downward trend with the increase of granule size in general anaerobic granules with a large diameter 3 mm or so tend to exhibit well developed mass transfer conditions for diffusion afridi et al 2017 the opposite result in this study exactly highlighted that the mass transfer in the granules was mostly affected by the calcification rather than particle size yu et al 2019 also reported that the overall porosity of calcified granules was lower than the counterpart it s worth pointing out that the low porosity for granular sludge implies the diffusion limitation and restrictive transport of the substrate so that nutrient deficiency of microbes within granules is conjectured to occur and may further result in a less diverse microbial community di iaconi et al 2006 elenter et al 2007 unfortunately fig 4 revealed gradually disappearing channels for diffusion in granules over calcification these results all suggested that calcified granules had mass transfer resistance 3 3 mass transfer evaluation on calcified granules to assess the mass transfer resistance of calcified granules the sma of the intact and disintegrated granules from rn and rc respectively was compared the ratio of the sma of disintegrated versus intact granules is presented as an effectiveness factor η representing the mass transfer resistance of the granules schmidt and ahring 1991 as shown in fig 6 the sma of intact granules decreased with decreasing of hydraulic retention time hrt at different stages in both reactors however the sma of intact granules undergoing calcification from 6 3 to 5 4 mlch4 h 1 g 1vss was much lower than that of the control from 7 7 to 6 9 mlch4 h 1 g 1vss while the sma of disintegrated granules in two reactors had no significant difference it is indicated that the inhibition of methane production was mainly due to the mass transfer resistance accordingly the value of η was calculated the rn had lower η values of nearly 1 but apparently the η values of rc were higher than 1 2 and had an increasing trend during continuous operation the result suggested that the calcified granules indeed had a mass transfer resistance which was due to the coverage of calcite on the surface leading to a lower pore volume and blockage of channels for mass transport and the deactivation of calcified granules was finally caused 3 4 interaction between calcium and eps the priority of solving the deactivation problem of calcified granules is to understand the calcification mechanism that is why calcite was covered on the granule surface the binding between ca2 and eps is essential for keeping the sludge structure and most of the eps are distributed in the outer layer of anaerobic granules de beer et al 1996 sheng et al 2013 it is noted that organic matrix e g eps can initiate mineralization of calcium carbonate szcześ et al 2016 perry et al 2005 found that the binding of eps to the surface of calcite arose once eps had bound the aqueous ca2 therefore the interaction between calcium and eps was considered to explore the mechanism of calcite formation in the outer layer 3 4 1 calcium contents in the eps the calcium contents in the layered eps of calcified and non calcified granules were measured as shown in fig 2c d the calcium contents in the all stratified eps especially in the lb eps 70 75 calcium content of rc were almost twice as high as those of the rn it indicated that the binding of ca2 and eps might be achieved in addition calcium contents were the lowest in the three eps fractions extracted from the granules at 4 5 cm high from the reactor bottom as mentioned above greyish white granules at 4 5 cm height of sludge bed with the highest calcium content were the total calcified granules it is speculated that the reductive calcium content in the eps especially the lb eps had been transferred into the calcite in the outer layer of granules 3 4 2 calcification effect on eps components the stratified eps contents of granules at different heights in two reactors on day 110 were determined as shown in fig s5 it is obvious that the total eps mainly pn contents of granules from rc were all higher than those of granules from rn the results were consistent with ma et al 2020 who found that ca2 promoted the secretion of eps lb eps had the lowest content even if the calcium content in lb eps was the highest followed by s eps accordingly the pn contents of s eps and lb eps of granules from rc both increased from 26 0 0 4 to 33 5 2 7 mg g 1vss for s eps and from 5 1 0 2 to 5 7 0 1 mg g 1vss for lb eps respectively with the decrease of the sludge bed height which represented more serious calcification however the ps contents of s eps and lb eps of granules from rc at different heights had little difference it is known that ca2 liked to bridge with proteins and promoted the aggregation of microorganisms rose 2000 it is supposed that the high calcium contents in the lb eps and s eps might be due to a bridge between ca2 and proteins in the eps furthermore eem fluorescence spectra of three eps fractions in different anaerobic granules taken from rn and rc respectively were investigated using the parafac model there were two components identified as the characteristic peaks at ex em of 375 420 440 nm and 230 280 330 nm which represented the humic acid like substance component 1 and aromatic proteins component 2 fluorophores respectively according to xiao et al 2018 fig s6 the humic acid like substance in all three spatial scales eps of calcified granules rc was always higher than that of non calcified granules rn table 3 especially it was the dominant organics in the tb eps of calcified granules which was more than twice as high as that of non calcified granules humic acids play a role in the binding between eps and calcite ca2 perry et al 2005 thus calcite ca2 will bind eps through humic acids mainly in the tb eps besides the intensity scores of aromatic proteins increased evidently in the lb eps of rc with the decreasing of the sludge bed height which was in accordance with the result of eps content 3 4 3 functional groups in the eps fig s7 showed that the bands at 1406 or 1415 cm 1 were corresponded to the symmetric stretching vibration of coo possibly associated with uronic acid jia et al 2017 the band at 1077 cm 1 was assigned to the ring vibrations of p o or coc as in polysaccharides the peaks at 1634 and 1515 cm 1 were assigned to c o and c n mainly in the proteins the intensities of coo c o and c n bands were all higher in the eps of calcified granules rc than those of the control except for that of the band at 1077 cm 1 the results suggested that there were more carboxyl groups in the eps of calcified granules charged functional groups like carboxyl groups may influence the mineralization of calcium carbonate by binding ca2 or adsorption on the crystal surface szcześ et al 2016 until now there were two possible reasons why calcite was located in the out layer of calcified granules 1 the bulk precipitated calcite bound eps which can have different binding interactions with calcite including the effects of humic acids and charged functional groups and 2 co3 2 replaced eps and reacted with ca2 which had bound eps mainly pn so that calcite formed in the outer layer 3 4 4 thermodynamics of binding between ca2 and eps the high calcium content and charged functional groups in the eps of calcified granules highlighted the possibility of binding between eps and ca2 added in the influent to verify the hypothesis that ca2 in the eps in the form of eps ca2 complex can be used to react with co3 2 to form the calcite the thermodynamics feasibilities of ca2 binding to eps and co3 2 were compared therefore the itc analysis was performed to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the binding between ca2 and eps after each injection of ca2 into the eps solution a clear thermopositive peak was observed and the stoichiometric number binding capacity n binding constant k binding enthalpy δh between ca2 and eps were calculated as 3 19 0 708 sites 6 00 0 729 104 m 1 and 3 49 0 304 kj mol 1 respectively from the non linear regression of the heat vs ca2 dosage fig 7 and table s2 the change of gibbs energy of the binding between ca2 and eps was calculated as 27 27 0 783 kj mol 1 according to the equation δg rt ln k das et al 2014 found a similar thermodynamic result of binding between ca2 and extracellular dna the negative value of δg suggested a thermodynamically favorable binding reaction furthermore it has been found that the binding of ca2 to eps is mainly via electrostatic interactions sheng et al 2013 which is consistent with the binding of ca2 to co3 2 the δg value of the reaction between ca2 and co3 2 was calculated as 48 kj mol 1 lide 2001 which was lower than that of the binding between ca2 and eps as well the binding constant k between ca2 and eps was much lower than 1 k sp caco3 of 3 108 it is well known that a reaction with a lower gibbs energy change has priority and a higher binding constant or equilibrium constant makes it easier to bind or react with each other all the evidence proved that co3 2 tended to displace the eps and react with ca2 to form stable calcite in a word eps distributed in the outer layer of anaerobic granules could bind with the bulk ca2 and might act as the calcium storage when co3 2 produced by acetate conversion under the anaerobic condition was transferred to the granular surface ca2 preferred to react with it and calcite was formed on the surface of granules overall the calcification of anaerobic granules was occurred due to the calcite was covered on the granule surface through the binding between calcite ca2 and eps which led to the mass transfer resistance and then the deactivation of calcified granules emerged hence preventing or breaking the binding of eps and calcite ca2 is a new way to solve the problem of calcification and deactivation of anaerobic granules treating high calcium wastewater the addition of metal minerals such as magnetite should be an efficient method to alleviate the surficial calcification of anaerobic granules and enhance the performance of anaerobic digestion simultaneously in the future 4 conclusions in this study characteristics of calcified granules were investigated in a uasb reactor with long term exposure to high calcium greyish white calcified granules covered with a layer of calcite first occurred in the bottom of the sludge bed the superficial calcification of granules caused a lower pore volume and blockage of channels for the mass transport which was verified by calculating the effectiveness factor η of calcified granules higher than 1 2 the interactions between eps and calcium revealed that calcite located in the outer layer was probably due to the bulk calcite bound eps distributed in the outer layer of granules and bulk co3 2 replaced eps to react with ca2 bound to eps finally new strategies for preventing or breaking the binding between eps and calcite ca2 could be considered to alleviate the sludge calcification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17336,calcification of anaerobic granular sludge causing the decrease of microbial activity has been focused for several decades but the mechanism of calcification and deactivation of calcified granule are still lacking in this study the calcification process of anaerobic granular sludge was analyzed in the uasb reactor with long term exposure to a high calcium level of 2 gca2 l 1 greyish white calcified granules with larger size and density first appeared at the bottom of sludge bed characterization of granular surface demonstrated that calcified granules had smaller specific surface area and pore volume with the disappearing channels in granules visualized over calcification the coverage of calcite on granular surface with a thickness of 500 600 µm was observed by a microscope which is responsible for the blockage of channels for substrate diffusion and transport the evaluation of mass transfer showed that the effectiveness factor η of calcified granules was higher than 1 23 proving the existence of mass transfer resistance furthermore the interactions between calcium and extracellular polymeric substances eps revealed the possible mechanism of calcite location at the outer layer of anaerobic granular sludge the bulk calcite directly binds the eps such as humic acids via charging functional groups and bulk co3 2 could react easily with ca2 bound to eps according to thermodynamic analysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high calcium wastewater calcified granule mass transfer resistance calcite extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction granular sludge is one special kind of biofilm which displays superior properties compared to flocs the dense compact microbial structure allows more regular shape faster settling and higher biomass density of granules franca et al 2017 these characteristics make anaerobic granules the core of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and internal circulation ic for wastewater treatment and energy recovery moreover the spherical shape and layered structure of anaerobic granules lead to their ability of pollutants removal or methane production affected by mass transfer of substrate within the granule macleod et al 1990 lemaire et al 2008 thus fast mass transfer is necessary to support the efficient performance of anaerobic bioreactors and pores and channels are the important three dimensional architecture of the granules matrix formed in the process of aggregation and offer the better mass transport within the granules flemming and wingender 2010 in the granular sludge microorganisms are surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances eps composed of proteins pn polysaccharides ps humic acids ha and nucleic acids ua etc which have an enormous effect on the granulation of sludge shi et al 2017 torres et al 2018 multivalent cations especially ca2 are another key material contributing to promoting granulation liu et al 2020 not coincidentally the interaction between eps and ca2 can greatly influence the properties of sludge and performance of sludge digestion ma et al 2020 the fundamental reason for this effect is ca2 can bridge with eps containing abundant negative charge through electrostatic force sheng et al 2013 yan et al 2017 in addition ca2 tends to react with co3 2 and po4 3 and the precipitates like bone act as a support structure in the core of granules batstone et al 2002 ren et al 2008 higher ph in the center of granules determines the easier formation of precipitates in the core cunha et al 2018a however the location of calcium in the granules is a debate cao et al 2014 found that calcium was distributed primarily in the periphery of the granules and promoted the growth of granules the reason why calcium is located in the outer layer of granules has been unclear yet every coin has two sides excessive calcium in the bulk or granules would lead to granule calcification and then change the characteristics and performance of granules dang et al 2014 yu et al 2019 unfortunately high calcium is a common feature of various kinds of industrial wastewater especially papermaking wastewater which is mostly treated by anaerobic technology işık et al 2010 gagliano et al 2017 found that calcium 1 g l 1 has a negative effect on biofilm formation and reactor performance the decrease of biomass concentrations is also caused by granule calcification at the calcium concentration of 450 800 mg l 1 and the calcium precipitation in the granules is nearly proportional to the calcium concentration in the wastewater yu et al 2001 to solve the problem of granule calcification in the anaerobic treatment of calcium rich wastewater the deactivation mechanism of calcified anaerobic granules in the biophysical aspect has been studied by researchers a common argument claims that the calcium precipitates in the center caco3 dominates or the outer layer cax po4 y dominates of granules occupy the space for microbes colonization and block the channels for mass transfer batstone et al 2002 yu et al 2019 nevertheless there is a lack of research on the characteristics and deactivation mechanism of anaerobic granules with long term exposure to high calcium level because granule calcification can t occur overnight in this study a calcium level higher than 1 g l 1 is defined as high concentration according to the previous studies and actual calcium concentration of papermaking wastewater 1 1 3 g l 1 to further investigate the causes of formation and deactivation of calcified granules the dynamic development of granule calcification was supervised based on the long term exposure of anaerobic granules to high calcium of 2 gca2 l 1 in the uasb reactor in this study calcified granules were distinguished from non calcified granules through calcium content quantification and color observation accordingly the calcium mineral in the calcified granules was identified and its distribution was also visualized by microscopy the characteristics containing surface structure and microstructure of calcified granules were comprehensively analyzed to investigate the effect of calcification on the granules and the mass transfer of granules was assessed by calculating the effectiveness factor η at the same time the properties of eps in the calcified granules and the thermodynamics of eps binding ca2 were studied the interactions between eps and calcium were finally discussed to reveal the mechanisms of granule calcification and deactivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 system set up and operation two 5 5 l lab scale up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactors were continuously operated in three stages with an increasing organic loading rate olr the inoculated granular sludge was collected from a full scale internal circulation ic bioreactor in a citric acid plant zhejiang china the difference between the two reactors was whether the influent contained additional calcium ions of high concentration the reactor without calcium addition acted as a control rn while another one was the focus of this study with adding calcium ions of 2 g l 1 rc

on days 1 50 and 100 and the samples should be dehydrated by gradient ethanol and dried by a critical point dryer leica em cpd300 germany to quantify the surface topographies of granules the sem images were further analyzed by software imagej according to tsui et al 2018 in brief quantitative surface characterization was performed with a plugin called surfcharj before the image type set as 32 bit the assessed result was represented as several surface roughness parameters including the arithmetic mean deviation ra root mean square deviation rq lowest valley rv highest peak rp total height of the profile rt and mean height of profile irregularities rh and the valleys in the granules were visualized by interactive 3d surface plots generated with a plugin compatible with imagej 2 2 2 composition and distribution of mineral in granules the mineral in granules was detected by polycrystal x ray diffractometer xrd rigaku dmax 2550 pc japan after granules were freeze dried and ground to powder to determine the calcium carbonate localization the evolution of bubbles generation in the mixture of acid and fresh granule with hydrochloric acid titration was observed under the stereo microscope based on the density difference of substance micro computed tomography micro ct was used to distinguish the distribution of mineral in granules micro ct was performed on a multiscale x ray nanotomograph bruker skyscan 2211 belgium the samples were fresh non calcified and calcified granules 2 2 3 granule separation and analysis sludge samples were taken at 4 5 15 and 25 5 cm high from the bottom in both reactors at the end of the experiment particle size and its cumulative distribution of anaerobic granules were analyzed by quick picture qicpic dynamic image analysis system sympatec gmbh germany then the sludge samples were fractioned with mesh sieves as 1 1 to 1 6 1 6 to 2 2 to 2 5 2 5 to 3 and 3 mm diameter the calcium content of granules was analyzed for each size fraction and determined by the atomic absorption spectrometer aas thermo electron mkii m6 usa after acid digestion and filtration cunha et al 2018 moreover the specific surface area and pore volume of the granules in different diameter ranges were determined by the brunauere emmette teller and barrete joynere halenda method leofanti et al 1998 fierro et al 2008 sludge and microbial densities of granules were analyzed after 6000 rpm centrifugation and supernatant removal and calculated by the eqs 1 2 as followed respectively the details were conducted as previous studies chou et al 2008 winkler et al 2012 1 ρ s m s v s 2 ρ m m vss v s where ρs is sludge density kg l 1 ρm is microbial density gvss l 1 sludge ms is the wet weight of sludge vs is the volume of wet sludge and mvss is the weight of volatile suspended solids vss 2 3 mass transfer evaluation of granules the mass transfer evaluation of granules was conducted by batch tests granules were sampled from the bottom sampling outlets of both reactors 1 5 g wet weight intact granules or disintegrated granules after grinding fig s1 were added to 150 ml serum bottles with 60 ml mixed anaerobic media containing 1000 mg cod l 1 of acetate other nutrients were the same as the influent of reactors the serum bottles were sealed after nitrogen sweeping and placed at 35 c methane production was measured by smith fermentation tube which was filled with the 2 mol l 1 naoh solution and connected with the serum bottle by a rubber tube yu et al 2019 the specific methane activity sma of granules was calculated by the slope of the cumulative methane production curve mlch4 h 1 g 1vss all experiments had two replicates the mass transfer capacity of granules was presented as the effectiveness factor η dimensionless according to zinatizadeh et al 2017 as the following equation 3 η sm a disintegrated granules sm a intact granules when η 1 there is no mass transfer resistance in the granules η 1 there is mass transfer resistance in the granules η 1 the microbes in the granules were damaged by the disintegration method 2 4 eps extraction and characterization eps has a different stratified structure in sludge and is classified as soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps in this study 40 ml granular sludge was taken at 4 5 15 and 25 5 cm high from the bottom of both reactors on day 110 the granule sludge was washed by 0 9 physiological saline three times before extraction the extraction protocol of s eps and lb eps was used as described in detail by yu et al 2008 the tb eps was extracted by heating method due to the high extraction efficiency of eps that could be acquired d abzac et al 2010 briefly after extraction of s eps and lb eps the sludge pellets were subsequently resuspended to their original volumes with 0 9 physiological saline subjected to heat treatment at 80 c for 45 min and then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min the bulk solution was collected as tb eps all extracted eps were filtered onto 0 22 µm cellulose nitrate membrane filters the pn and ps contents in the eps were quantified by uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan using the lowry method with bovine serum albumin as standard and the dubios phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard respectively lowry et al 1951 dubios et al 1956 the calcium content of different stratified eps was also measured by aas after acid digestion and filtration the eem fluorescence spectra of the organic matter of all eps were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 4600 japan with excitation ex and emission em wavelength range of ex em 200 500 250 550 nm to quantify the component of eps parafac was used to model the eem fluorescence data by the software matlab r2019a the detailed process was carried out according to stedmon and bro 2008 in the meanwhile the total eps was extracted by heat method from granules taken at the bottom of the reactors rn and rc respectively ftir ava tar370 nicolet usa was applied to detect the functional groups in the eps after filtration and freeze drying 2 5 thermodynamics of ca2 binding with eps to determine the binding capacity of ca2 with eps isothermal titration calorimetry itc on an itc calorimeter microcal vp itc usa was used both ca2 2 mm and freeze dried eps of rn were dissolved in the tris hcl buffer 1 m ph 7 4 titrations of 2 mm ca2 into the eps was conducted at cell temperature 25 c and under stirring speed of 307 rpm the raw itc data were analyzed by origin 7 0 microcal to determine the enthalpy of ca2 binding δh stoichiometric number n and the binding constant k the change in gibbs energy δg and the entropy change δs of the binding were calculated using eq 4 5 he et al 2020 4 δ g rt ln k 5 δ g δ h t δ s 3 results and discussion the reactors condition and performance of three stages for lab scale reactors during a 120 day period operation are summarized in table 1 the only difference between rc and rn is whether calcium ions were added or not obviously the cod removal of the reactor rc with calcium addition of 2 gca2 l 1 decreased with the increase of organic loading rate olr while that of the control rn without calcium addition remained over 98 higher than rc throughout the whole operational period it suggested that the performance of granules was inhibited by calcium addition and granule calcification was considered to be responsible for the deactivation 3 1 calcium content and spatial localization in calcified granules in the process of reactors operation partial black granules especially in the bottom of the sludge bed of rc gradually turned to greyish white as shown in fig s2 the visual difference between two kinds of granules sampled from rn and rc separately at the end of the experiment was obviously shown in fig 1 a b it is speculated that the greyish white granules were the calcified granules to distinguish exactly the calcified granules the calcium content and distribution of granules immersed in calcium containing solutions from rc were determined it can be seen from fig 2 a that the calcium content increased with the increase of particle size but there was no significant difference in calcium content of granules in the vertical distribution at an early stage day 30 the calcium precipitates were accumulated in the process of calcification according to the xrd spectra of anaerobic granules on day 0 40 70 and 105 and identified as the calcite with a reference of standard calcite fig s3 as expected in fig 2b the calcium content of granules sampled on day 110 increased with the particle size ranging from 1 1 6 mm to 3 mm the granules with the particle size of 3 mm in the bottom had the highest calcium content 119 9 9 0 mgca g 1ss in the final stage which was about two times that of the granules 63 6 1 8 mgca g 1ss on day 30 as a control calcium contents of granules taken from rn at 4 5 cm height of the sludge bed on day 110 ranged from 36 7 2 1 to 53 5 0 7 mgca g 1ss much lower than those of granules from rc table s1 the abnormally high calcium content of granules with a size of 1 mm on day 110 was supposed to be caused by granule disaggregation under the conditions of high calcium loading or calcium carbonate formation in the bulk van langerak et al 1998 pevere et al 2007 two kinds of calcium precipitates and their locations in the granules have been proposed as followed 1 calcium carbonate calcite is the dominant crystal in the calcified granules which is mainly distributed in the center and 2 some slice crystals embedded in the granule surface are identified as cax po4 y precipitate yu et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in this study calcite was the main calcium deposit according to the xrd analysis in order to identify the greyish white deposits of granule surface 10 hydrochloric acid was added when granules were immersed in the deionized water under the microscope fig 1c showed that gas bubbles were formed immediately and intensely on the surface of greyish white deposits after hydrochloric acid addition after a while the greyish white deposits disappeared and gas still bubbled up through the granule fig 1d combined with the xrd results the greyish white deposits were identified as the calcite the images analysis revealed that the greyish white deposits calcite of the outer layer with a thickness of 500 600 µm and the same deposits were probably localized in the core of granules to visualize the location of calcite the calcified granule was observed by micro ct compared with the non calcified granule the inorganic part calcite appearing bright was not only present in the center of the granule but also formed layers outside the calcified granule surface fig 1e f tsui et al 2016 reported that the external mass transfer resistance would cause the substrate limitations inside the granule core followed by endogenous respiration and led to hollow granules the calcified granules in this study happened to be hollow fig 1f it seems that the calcite in the out layer was the culprit in the mass transfer resistance 3 2 the physical characteristics of calcified granules the physical characteristics of the granules determine their contact efficiency with wastewater influent and metabolic mass transfer which affect the final biological activity of granules therefore the physical characteristics of granules were then analyzed 3 2 1 particle size distribution and densities of granules the particle size distribution of the granular sludge bed of both reactors on day 105 was presented in fig 3 a the particle size distribution of granules was investigated at all fractioned sizes small granule 1 mm medium granule 1 2 5 mm and coarse granule 2 5 mm at the 25 cm height of the sludge bed the proportions of different size granules in two reactors were similar correspondingly the proportion of small granules at 4 5 and 15 cm high from the bottom of the sludge bed in the rc was much lower than that of rn on the contrary the proportion of coarse granules at 4 5 cm height of granular sludge bed in the rc was 55 73 obviously higher than 44 62 of rn in short the small granules were transformed into the coarse granules with medium granules as a transition under the high calcium conditions and coarse granules settled to the bottom of the reactor the results confirmed the role of ca2 in microbial aggregation which contributed to the formation and growth of granules yu et al 2001 in addition the sieved anaerobic granules with the particle size of 3 mm before physicochemical analysis were greyish white which indicated that calcified granules had the largest size in agreement with the result of sem images fig s4 during the operation of the reactors variation of sludge density of granules from rc was shown in fig 3b a linear increase of sludge density of granules from the 4 5 cm height of the sludge bed in the rc was observed the sludge density of granules in the rc rose to 1 8 0 2 g cm 3 on day 105 which was 1 64 times that of rn as for the granules from the 15 and 25 5 cm height of the sludge bed in two reactors the difference of their densities was indistinct besides the microbial densities of granules from rc were generally higher than that of rn as can be seen from fig 3c it is interpreted that calcium addition can make the granules denser it is well known that gravity is a crucial force of regulating the granules movement and biomass distribution in the system baeten et al 2019 the calcite has been identified as the dominant mineral in the calcified granules in this study the sludge density of granules from the bottom of rc gradually approached that of calcite 2 7 g cm 3 combining with the greyish white granules observed in the bottom of rc the results suggested that the calcified granules were usually denser 3 2 2 granule surface structure referring to the previous researches very little emphasis has been given to the surface structure of calcified granules to investigate the surface structure the surface topographies of granules in each stage were visualized by the software imagej in fig 4 which depended on the sem images fig s4 in addition the quantification of the surface topographies was presented in table 2 the surface roughness rq and ra of granules decreased continuously from stages 1 3 which represented the non calcified partial calcified and calcified granules the increasing rv and decreasing rp values showed that the deepest valley and highest peaks became more shallow moreover the calcified granules also had the lowest rh value which was the mean height of profile irregularities overall the results indicated that the calcified granules had a smoother surface while the surface of non calcified granules was rougher it is found that the surface roughness has some influence on biofilm formation and increased surface roughness of the carriers could promote biofilm accumulation because the uneven surface can provide valleys for the attachment of microorganisms or organic matters gjaltema et al 1997 iorhemen et al 2016 therefore it is speculated that the granule size was increasing due to the biofilm accumulation in the process of calcification and then calcium precipitates covering the surface of granules caused the greyish white and smoother surface the change of surface structure may influence the mass transport so next granule microstructure was further investigated 3 2 3 calcification affecting granule microstructure generally the specific surface area and pore volume as macroscopic structural parameters are used to characterize the granule microstructure and quantify the mass transfer of substrates from the bulk liquid to the granule microorganisms morgenroth et al 2008 tsui et al 2018 to explore the effect of calcification on granule microstructure in this study the specific surface area and pore volume of granules of each size fraction at different heights from the reactor rc were measured fig 5 compared with the inoculated granule the bet surface area and pore volume of granules with the same size fraction in rc mostly declined in the end the bet surface area of granules at the bottom 4 5 cm of the sludge bed was always lower than 2 0 m2 g 1 which was usually lower than that of granules at higher sludge bed it indicated that calcified granules had a smaller specific surface area available for substrate transport and reaction and thus a limited ability of biological treatment nicolella et al 2000 a similar result of pore volume was obtained and altogether the pore volume of granules undergoing the calcification had a downward trend with the increase of granule size in general anaerobic granules with a large diameter 3 mm or so tend to exhibit well developed mass transfer conditions for diffusion afridi et al 2017 the opposite result in this study exactly highlighted that the mass transfer in the granules was mostly affected by the calcification rather than particle size yu et al 2019 also reported that the overall porosity of calcified granules was lower than the counterpart it s worth pointing out that the low porosity for granular sludge implies the diffusion limitation and restrictive transport of the substrate so that nutrient deficiency of microbes within granules is conjectured to occur and may further result in a less diverse microbial community di iaconi et al 2006 elenter et al 2007 unfortunately fig 4 revealed gradually disappearing channels for diffusion in granules over calcification these results all suggested that calcified granules had mass transfer resistance 3 3 mass transfer evaluation on calcified granules to assess the mass transfer resistance of calcified granules the sma of the intact and disintegrated granules from rn and rc respectively was compared the ratio of the sma of disintegrated versus intact granules is presented as an effectiveness factor η representing the mass transfer resistance of the granules schmidt and ahring 1991 as shown in fig 6 the sma of intact granules decreased with decreasing of hydraulic retention time hrt at different stages in both reactors however the sma of intact granules undergoing calcification from 6 3 to 5 4 mlch4 h 1 g 1vss was much lower than that of the control from 7 7 to 6 9 mlch4 h 1 g 1vss while the sma of disintegrated granules in two reactors had no significant difference it is indicated that the inhibition of methane production was mainly due to the mass transfer resistance accordingly the value of η was calculated the rn had lower η values of nearly 1 but apparently the η values of rc were higher than 1 2 and had an increasing trend during continuous operation the result suggested that the calcified granules indeed had a mass transfer resistance which was due to the coverage of calcite on the surface leading to a lower pore volume and blockage of channels for mass transport and the deactivation of calcified granules was finally caused 3 4 interaction between calcium and eps the priority of solving the deactivation problem of calcified granules is to understand the calcification mechanism that is why calcite was covered on the granule surface the binding between ca2 and eps is essential for keeping the sludge structure and most of the eps are distributed in the outer layer of anaerobic granules de beer et al 1996 sheng et al 2013 it is noted that organic matrix e g eps can initiate mineralization of calcium carbonate szcześ et al 2016 perry et al 2005 found that the binding of eps to the surface of calcite arose once eps had bound the aqueous ca2 therefore the interaction between calcium and eps was considered to explore the mechanism of calcite formation in the outer layer 3 4 1 calcium contents in the eps the calcium contents in the layered eps of calcified and non calcified granules were measured as shown in fig 2c d the calcium contents in the all stratified eps especially in the lb eps 70 75 calcium content of rc were almost twice as high as those of the rn it indicated that the binding of ca2 and eps might be achieved in addition calcium contents were the lowest in the three eps fractions extracted from the granules at 4 5 cm high from the reactor bottom as mentioned above greyish white granules at 4 5 cm height of sludge bed with the highest calcium content were the total calcified granules it is speculated that the reductive calcium content in the eps especially the lb eps had been transferred into the calcite in the outer layer of granules 3 4 2 calcification effect on eps components the stratified eps contents of granules at different heights in two reactors on day 110 were determined as shown in fig s5 it is obvious that the total eps mainly pn contents of granules from rc were all higher than those of granules from rn the results were consistent with ma et al 2020 who found that ca2 promoted the secretion of eps lb eps had the lowest content even if the calcium content in lb eps was the highest followed by s eps accordingly the pn contents of s eps and lb eps of granules from rc both increased from 26 0 0 4 to 33 5 2 7 mg g 1vss for s eps and from 5 1 0 2 to 5 7 0 1 mg g 1vss for lb eps respectively with the decrease of the sludge bed height which represented more serious calcification however the ps contents of s eps and lb eps of granules from rc at different heights had little difference it is known that ca2 liked to bridge with proteins and promoted the aggregation of microorganisms rose 2000 it is supposed that the high calcium contents in the lb eps and s eps might be due to a bridge between ca2 and proteins in the eps furthermore eem fluorescence spectra of three eps fractions in different anaerobic granules taken from rn and rc respectively were investigated using the parafac model there were two components identified as the characteristic peaks at ex em of 375 420 440 nm and 230 280 330 nm which represented the humic acid like substance component 1 and aromatic proteins component 2 fluorophores respectively according to xiao et al 2018 fig s6 the humic acid like substance in all three spatial scales eps of calcified granules rc was always higher than that of non calcified granules rn table 3 especially it was the dominant organics in the tb eps of calcified granules which was more than twice as high as that of non calcified granules humic acids play a role in the binding between eps and calcite ca2 perry et al 2005 thus calcite ca2 will bind eps through humic acids mainly in the tb eps besides the intensity scores of aromatic proteins increased evidently in the lb eps of rc with the decreasing of the sludge bed height which was in accordance with the result of eps content 3 4 3 functional groups in the eps fig s7 showed that the bands at 1406 or 1415 cm 1 were corresponded to the symmetric stretching vibration of coo possibly associated with uronic acid jia et al 2017 the band at 1077 cm 1 was assigned to the ring vibrations of p o or coc as in polysaccharides the peaks at 1634 and 1515 cm 1 were assigned to c o and c n mainly in the proteins the intensities of coo c o and c n bands were all higher in the eps of calcified granules rc than those of the control except for that of the band at 1077 cm 1 the results suggested that there were more carboxyl groups in the eps of calcified granules charged functional groups like carboxyl groups may influence the mineralization of calcium carbonate by binding ca2 or adsorption on the crystal surface szcześ et al 2016 until now there were two possible reasons why calcite was located in the out layer of calcified granules 1 the bulk precipitated calcite bound eps which can have different binding interactions with calcite including the effects of humic acids and charged functional groups and 2 co3 2 replaced eps and reacted with ca2 which had bound eps mainly pn so that calcite formed in the outer layer 3 4 4 thermodynamics of binding between ca2 and eps the high calcium content and charged functional groups in the eps of calcified granules highlighted the possibility of binding between eps and ca2 added in the influent to verify the hypothesis that ca2 in the eps in the form of eps ca2 complex can be used to react with co3 2 to form the calcite the thermodynamics feasibilities of ca2 binding to eps and co3 2 were compared therefore the itc analysis was performed to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the binding between ca2 and eps after each injection of ca2 into the eps solution a clear thermopositive peak was observed and the stoichiometric number binding capacity n binding constant k binding enthalpy δh between ca2 and eps were calculated as 3 19 0 708 sites 6 00 0 729 104 m 1 and 3 49 0 304 kj mol 1 respectively from the non linear regression of the heat vs ca2 dosage fig 7 and table s2 the change of gibbs energy of the binding between ca2 and eps was calculated as 27 27 0 783 kj mol 1 according to the equation δg rt ln k das et al 2014 found a similar thermodynamic result of binding between ca2 and extracellular dna the negative value of δg suggested a thermodynamically favorable binding reaction furthermore it has been found that the binding of ca2 to eps is mainly via electrostatic interactions sheng et al 2013 which is consistent with the binding of ca2 to co3 2 the δg value of the reaction between ca2 and co3 2 was calculated as 48 kj mol 1 lide 2001 which was lower than that of the binding between ca2 and eps as well the binding constant k between ca2 and eps was much lower than 1 k sp caco3 of 3 108 it is well known that a reaction with a lower gibbs energy change has priority and a higher binding constant or equilibrium constant makes it easier to bind or react with each other all the evidence proved that co3 2 tended to displace the eps and react with ca2 to form stable calcite in a word eps distributed in the outer layer of anaerobic granules could bind with the bulk ca2 and might act as the calcium storage when co3 2 produced by acetate conversion under the anaerobic condition was transferred to the granular surface ca2 preferred to react with it and calcite was formed on the surface of granules overall the calcification of anaerobic granules was occurred due to the calcite was covered on the granule surface through the binding between calcite ca2 and eps which led to the mass transfer resistance and then the deactivation of calcified granules emerged hence preventing or breaking the binding of eps and calcite ca2 is a new way to solve the problem of calcification and deactivation of anaerobic granules treating high calcium wastewater the addition of metal minerals such as magnetite should be an efficient method to alleviate the surficial calcification of anaerobic granules and enhance the performance of anaerobic digestion simultaneously in the future 4 conclusions in this study characteristics of calcified granules were investigated in a uasb reactor with long term exposure to high calcium greyish white calcified granules covered with a layer of calcite first occurred in the bottom of the sludge bed the superficial calcification of granules caused a lower pore volume and blockage of channels for the mass transport which was verified by calculating the effectiveness factor η of calcified granules higher than 1 2 the interactions between eps and calcium revealed that calcite located in the outer layer was probably due to the bulk calcite bound eps distributed in the outer layer of granules and bulk co3 2 replaced eps to react with ca2 bound to eps finally new strategies for preventing or breaking the binding between eps and calcite ca2 could be considered to alleviate the sludge calcification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17337,the free floating extracellular dna exdna fraction of microbial ecosystems harbors antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges natural transformation of these xenogenetic elements can generate microbial cells resistant to one or more antibiotics isolating and obtaining a high yield of exdna is challenging due to its low concentration in wastewater environments profiling exdna is crucial to unravel the ecology of free floating args and mges and their contribution to horizontal genetransfer we developed a method using chromatography to isolate and enrich exdna without causing cell lysis from complex wastewater matrices like influent 9 µg exdna out of 1 l activated sludge 5 6 µg out of 1 l and treated effluent 4 3 µg out of 1 l args and mges were metagenomically profiled for both the exdna and intracellular dna idna of activated sludge and quantified by qpcr in effluent water qpcr revealed that args and mges are more abundant in the idna

the resistome of exdna args uptake by natural transformation is likely not the main transfer mechanism although args are not highly abundant in exdna the prevalence of mges in the exdna fraction can indirectly promote antibiotic resistance development the combination of this method with functional metagenomics can help to elucidate the transfer and development of resistances in microbial

based on the molecular analysis of total dna extracts from the microbial communities of wastewater however besides the intracellular dna idna the extracellular dna exdna that is free floating in the bulk liquid water phase may carry a substantial amount of args and mges of environmental and public health concern the exdna fraction has not been studied in detail even if there are some exceptions in sludge cattle manure and swine waste samples zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 differential isolation and systematic profiling of idna and free floating exdna is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of transfer of these mobile dna contaminants that replicate exdna retrieved from environmental samples can be defined as the dna fraction that is not housed within the envelope of the cell membrane torti et al 2015 the acronym edna is widely intermixed to describe either environmental dna or extracellular dna environmental dna does not necessarily discriminate between extracellular and intracellular fractions of nucleic acids it only means that dna extracted originates from cells that were present in the investigated ecosystem at the sampling event thomsen and willerslev 2015 we define free floating exdna as all the dna components that are neither enclosed inside cells nor adsorbed or aggregated in complex matrices and that are persistently floating in aqueous samples this exdna fraction can represent a genetic proxy of microbial and cellular diversity among different biogeographical areas corinaldesi et al 2018 torti et al 2015 isolating and analyzing exdna from environmental samples provides insight into the dynamics interactions and evolutionary history of populations of microorganisms and higher organisms that are or have been present in the investigated environment moreover exdna is abundant and plays an important role as a structural component of microcolonies stabilizing microbial bioaggregates dominiak et al 2011 rusanowska et al 2019 weissbrodt

been suggested as reservoirs for arg occurrence and dissemination guo et al 2018 he et al 2019 active or passive release out of cells are the main sources of exdna nagler et al 2018a torti et al 2015 whether exdna is actively or passively released in these biological environments remains unsolved although some authors provide claims about one or the other hypotheses flemming and wingender 2010 merod and wuertz 2014 until mechanistic measurements will be made available strong debate will remain on the intention of cells to release dna to drive biofilm formation in this study exdna immobilized in the eps matrix is considered to be likely less available to gene transfer in comparison with free floating exdna karygianni et al 2020 the persistence of exdna in biofilms and of free floating exdna that can also sorb to surfaces may generate hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt in microbial biocoenoses natural competence is a widely distributed cellular mechanism harboured by microorganisms in nature to take up molecular resources from their surroundings naturally competent microbes may take up free or bound exdna nagler et al 2018a natural transformation is a parasexual mechanism for the exchange of genetic material induced by stress conditions such as nutrient limitations or the presence of antibiotics claverys et al 2009 such conditions are found in densely populated cultures such as activated sludge samples natural transformation in managed environments does not implicitly result in a threat for human health since it is a mechanism generating diversity and adaptation jørgensen et al 2014 however if args mges and pathogenic islands can be found in exdna fractions the formation of pathogenic bacterial cells resistant to one or more antibiotics also known as superbugs could be induced domingues et al 2012 dna fragments that have been released by sterilization of microbial cultures using e g industrial and research facility methods does not lose its integrity and capacity to be re amplified calderón franco et al 2020a thus making it an undesired source of xenogenetic pollution the molecular mechanisms generating superbugs and the underlying sources of genetic materials that can prompt it need to be studied methods to efficiently isolate quantify and metagenomically characterize exdna templates from complex biological samples are required in the last years a few methods to extract exdna have been published wang et al 2016 have used an aluminum hydroxide column to adsorb aquatic exdna nagler et al 2018 have opted for sequential steps involving enzymatic treatments to extract exdna from cattle rumen samples yuan et al 2019 have integrated magnetic beads in combination with the classic dna precipitation method involving the surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab yielding a relatively good amount of exdna of 0 2 µg out of 5 ml of wastewater silica solid phases similar to commercial silica resin columns have been tested to adsorb and extract exdna from low concentration clinical samples katevatis et al 2017 cell lysis has seldom been investigated although often debated across protocols for exdna extractions assessing and preventing cell lysis during exdna isolations is crucial to obtain confident analytical results from exdna templates moreover volumes previously used 100 ml have hindered a more detailed exdna characterization by metagenomics due to low isolation yields metagenomics can be used for deciphering the distribution mobility and microbial hosts of args in both dna fractions from environmental samples such as sludge zhou et al 2019 a mathematical model that accounts for args sitting on both idna and exdna fractions has been developed to predict the fate and transport of args in receiving waters downstream of wwtps ikuma and rehmann 2020 an improved quantitative understanding of these processes and of the impact of exdna on arg spread and occurrence requires more effective methods to extract exdna it will enable a more accurate risk assessment toward more targeted mitigation of antibiotic resistance here we systematically profiled xenogenetic elements from free floating exdna out of the complex biological environment of wastewater we highlight for the first time the potential xenogenetic risk associated with free floating exdna fragments transported with sewage across urban water systems we provide an efficient analytical method to investigate it at high resolution 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling from the influent activated sludge tank and effluent of a

biological replicates were collected on three different days as grab samples a total of 1000 ml of influent wastewater was collected per replicate all samples were processed in a timeframe of less than 2 h prior to dna extraction six biological replicates of activated sludge were collected in two different sampling campaigns as grab samples from the activated sludge tank each campaign consisted of three successive dry days i e without recent rainfall and variations in the hydraulic retention time the first round of edna isolation experiments was performed with three biological replicates of activated sludge once the method was successful we conducteda second campaignfor which additional three samples were taken from three different days from the three different biological matrices

4 plasmid dna used as chromatography selectivity control a bacillus expression pht01 plasmid mobitec gmbh germany was used as nucleic acid selectivity control for the deae anion exchange column 2 5 biomass pre treatment live dead staining and flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry combined with live dead staining was used to check for the prevention of cell lysis across the exdna isolation

buffer the diluted sludge samples were mild sonicated branson sonifier 250 usa on ice in 3 cycles of 45 s at 40 w after sonication samples were diluted at 1 500 in 1x pbs buffer right after the second dilution samples were filtered through a 10 µm syringe filter in order to remove possible residual cell debris and membranes the live dead staining protocol and flow cytometry analyses were based on previous works boulos et al 1999 hammes et al 2008 pinel et al 2020 prest et al 2013 two staining dyes were used to track viable cells with sybr green invitrogen usa and dead cells with red

16s rrna gene was selected as a proxy to quantify total bacteria args and mges were selected from a panel used for wastewater samples berendonk et al 2015 pallares vega et al 2019 standards for qpcr were generated from resfinder https cge cbs dtu dk services resfinder a curated database of args the chosen args targeted macrolides multidrug export protein gene ermb sulfonamides sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 fluoroquinolones quinolone resistance gene qnrs and extended spectrum β lactamase cefotaxime hydrolyzing β lactamase blactxm table s1 the class i integron integrase gene inti1 known to be responsible for genes mobility ma et al 2017 was included to assess the presence of mges standards primers and reaction conditions are listed in tables s2 and s3 in supplementary material 2 8 metagenomic profiling of exdna and idna fractions from activated sludge samples metagenomics libraries of exdna and idna samples at 50 ng µl 1 were sequenced using a miseq pe300 benchtop sequencer illumina usa library preparation was done with a truseq dna pcr free kit lt lib prep kt st b phix control v3 datasets of 14 million reads were obtained per sample corresponding to a sequencing depth of 6 5 gb for idna and 6 8 gb for exdna fractions raw metagenomic data have been deposited in bioproject under accession number prjna632452 and id 632452 activated sludge was selected for metagenomics for being a highly diverse sample from which microbiome resistome and mobilome differences could be assessed in order to check the applicability of the extraction method the quality of the acquired illumina reads was assessed by fastqc version 0 11 9 with default parameters andrews 2010 paired ends reads were trimmed and filtered by trimmomatic version 0 39 with default parameters bolger et al 2014 alignments were performed by bwa mem version 2 with default parameters li 2013 generating a sam file to filter soft and hard clipped reads sam files were filtered by samclip tool with default parameters removing undesirable alignments that could generate downstream problems https github com tseemann samclip centrifuge kim et al 2016 was applied for taxonomic microbial classification http ccb jhu edu software centrifuge the megares 2 0 database was used to identify args http megares meglab org the metagenomes were searched for signatures of known mges plasmids prophages and viruses through aclame http aclame ulb ac be leplae et al 2009 the mobilome was searched for integrative conjugative elements through the iceberg database http db mml sjtu edu cn iceberg liu et al 2019 insertion sequences through isfinder https isfinder biotoul fr siguier et al 2006 and integrons through the integrall database https integrall bio ua pt moura et al 2009 different databases of args and mges of different completeness and curation levels are available in public repositories such as the aforementioned while no consensus database is available yet follow up research will lead to a comprehensive database for wastewater environments http repares vscht cz both megares 2 0 and aclame were used as references for the alignment of trimmed and filtered metagenomic reads the output sam file from the bwa mem alignment was converted into a bam file using samtools version v1 4 li et al 2009 https github com samtools samtools unmapped reads were removed and secondary alignments ignored in order to get a list of the best hits for further data processing args and mges hits were considered when 2 or more reads per variant were aligned 2 9 comparative subsystems analysis of the metagenomic data unassembled clean reads from the exdna and idna fractions of activated sludge were annotated using the open access metagenome curation and analysis platform metagenome rapid annotation using subsystem technology mg rast http metagenomics nmpdr org meyer et al 2008 the subsystem classification mg rast id are available for the free floating extracellular dna mgm4886400 3 and the intracellular dna mgm4886611 3 2 10 statistics statistical analyses were performed on all molecular datasets with r 3 5 1 r foundation for statistical computing 2018 and rstudio https www rstudio com for the analysis of significance on the purification effect on the yield of dna isolation a non parametric wilcoxon test was performed for both exdna and idna samples biological replicates were used from influent water 3 replicates activated sludge 6 replicates and effluent water 3 replicates a parametric two tailed student s t test with statistical significance established at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 was performed to analyze the significance of the differences in arg and mge compositions between exdna and idna fractions for both exdna and idna samples 3 biological replicates with 3 technical replicates were used from effluent water 3 results and discussion 3 1 high yields of free floating exdna were obtained by anion exchange chromatography the column performed with high nucleic acid selectivity for the retention separation and spectrophotometric detection λ 260 nm with known concentration of pure pht01 plasmid of bacillus subtilis as control figure s1a a sharp and well resolved narrow peak was obtained in the chromatographic elution and detection of the plasmid control the raw non precipitated exdna obtained from filtered activated sludge started to elute after 10 min for 35 min figure s1b the chromatographic peak maximum was detected at a retention time of 18 min the concentrated raw free floating exdna extract displayed a hydrogel aspect fig 2 its color related to the source of the exdna extract namely dark brown with influent water yellow with activated sludge or colorless with effluent water the explanation could relate to either polyphenols or humic acids polyphenols are soluble in water and change to a red coloration when in contact with air hussain et al 2015 humic acids are abundant in wastewater and can interact with dna saeki et al 2011 the concentration of humic acids decreases during wastewater treatment nemerow and doby 1956 for instance humic acids adsorb onto activated sludge feng et al 2008 they are less abundant in absolute concentration in effluent water ma et al 2001 therefore we hypothesize that the loss of color in the exdna extract through the process is due to loss of humic acids that are co extracted with the exdna the diethylaminoethyl cellulose deae column efficiently isolated and concentrated the free floating exdna fraction from large volumes of influent wastewater activated sludge and effluent water of the wwtp the yields i e mass of dna isolated in molecular biology after the isolation and purification procedures of raw and purified with a commercial dna purification kit after proteinase k treatment free floating exdna isolated from influent wastewater activated sludge and effluent water are shown in figure s2 yields and concentrations are summarized in table 1 the exdna fraction corresponded to 1 of the total dna extracted from activated sludge only exdna obtained from activated sludge samples showed significant differences in the yields between raw and purified exdna p 0 05 there was no significant difference p 0 05 between in yields of raw exdna obtained from different water quality samples however the influent wastewater displayed a significantly p 0 05 higher fraction of purified free floating exdna 9 000 ng out of 1000 ml initial sample volume than activated sludge 5 631 ng out of 1000 ml initial sample volume and effluent water 4 276 ng out of 1000 ml initial sample volume the raw exdna extracted from influent wastewater and activated sludge supernatant samples yielded higher concentrations 12 5 1 9 ng ml 1 and 12 3 1 ng ml 1 respectively than after purification 9 0 0 7 ng ml 1 and 5 6 0 46 ng ml 1 respectively an average mass loss of 42 through the commercial purification kit was measured in the method one commercial kit was used for the purification of the exdna extracts after digestion with proteinase k for future works other commercial kits or classical purification methods might also be assessed for the isolation of free floating exdna from low content water samples it is paramount to note that the exdna yields were substantial for the three biological matrices the free floating exdna extracts fulfilled the minimal quantitative and qualitative requirements mass 1 µg concentration 20 ng µl 1 volume 20 µl required for qpcr and high throughput metagenomics analyses much higher yields were obtained than with other isolation methods tested in parallel in this study or reported in literature ca 3 fold higher than with classical ctab and pci methods and up to as high as ca 2000 fold higher than direct precipitation with isopropanol table 2 our method and the one of yuan et al yuan et al 2019 provide the necessary yield of exdna recovered from wastewater samples for subsequent molecular analyses 3 2 mild enzymatic post treatment with proteinase k is necessary to release exdna from bound extracellular polymeric proteins found in activated sludge the free floating exdna extracted from activated sludge was characterized by an intense band at the top of the agarose gel this suggested that exdna was entrapped in a protein mesh that did not allow it to migrate through the gel fig 3 a after mild enzymatic treatment of these residual proteins bound to the exdnas with proteinase k it was observed that the purified exdna templates were able to run through the gel fig 3b these were characterized by a distribution of fragments sizes that ranged from 0 5 kbp to 20 kbp for comparison the idna that was extracted in parallel using commercial kits exhibited dna fragments that also ranged from less than 0 5 kbp to 20 kbp both dna fractions displayed similar fragment size distribution assuming that the average size of genes present in bacterial genomes is 1 5 kb long exdna was suggested to be large enough to contain multiple args and mges deflaun et al 1987 zhang et al 2013 no significant differences in band intensity could be observed between untreated biomass and treated with dnase i prior to intracellular dna extraction fig 3b this suggests a low exdna content bound to biomass when dna is extracted from 0 25 g of activated sludge the extracted pools of free floating exdna fragments were suitable for further molecular analyses since purity 1 76 0 02 was close to optimal the optimum absorbance ratio a260 nm a280 nm of 1 8 3 3 cell lysis is not induced during the isolation of free floating exdna cell lysis measurements and control were conducted on the processing of activated sludge since exhibiting the highest microbial density among the wastewater environment samples thus activated sludge was considered as more prone to potential cell lysis and cross contamination of the free floating exdna extract with idna residues flow cytometry was used to measure the total cells counts after each biomass processing step in the developed protocol fig 4 a together with the relative abundances of live dead cells measured after stainings with sybr green and propidium iodide fluorophores respectively fig 4b after filtration of centrifuged activated sludge supernatant through the 0 45 µm membrane filter the number of flow cytometry events ml 1 was below 10 after second filtration on 0 2 µm below 1 event the diluted activated sludge control that consisted of a non centrifuged and non filtered activated sludge sample had an average of 1606 events ml 1 cells retained in the membrane filters were assumed to maintain their robustness and viability tanny et al 1980 wu and xi 2010 initial cell viability was preserved and bacterial cells were removed upfront by centrifugation and filtration depending on the type of biomasses targeted even smaller filter pore sizes than 0 2 μm could be used besides high yield the free floating exdna template was therefore of high quality being deprived of idna contamination the isolation method did not induce cell lysis during the extraction a cell free and idna free exdna fraction was isolated this quality control ensured that in the exdna fraction there was no genomic dna contamination caused by the extraction hence we demonstrated the isolation of free floating exdna at high yield and high quality from complex microbial community matrices of activated sludge across a workflow exempt of cell lysis 3 4 free floating exdna displays lesser arg copies than idna qpcr results highlighted that molecular analysis of five selected args sul1 sul2 ermb qnrs blactxm and one mge intl1 could be performed from both the idna and the free floating exdna fractions of wastewater environments being effluent wastewater in this case fig 5 all genes tested but blactxm were detected in both dna fractions the free floating exdna template harbored a lower number of arg and mge copies than idna with a significant difference δ of 0 87 0 32 log10 gene copies p 0 005 across the gene panel at individual gene level the free floating exdna displayed a significantly lower log based gene copy number of both the bacterial 16s rrna gene δ 1 2 0 43 log10 gene copies and the args δ values given hereafter vs idna sulfonamides δ sul1 0 94 0 33 δ sul2 1 11 0 32 log10 gene copies ml 1 and β lactamase δ blactxm 1 92 0 25 log10 gene copies ml 1 args and the integrase type i δ inti1 1 32 0 38 log10 gene copies ml 1 mge were significantly lesser in the free floating exdna than in the idna conversely the macrolides δ ermb 0 27 0 24 log10 gene copies and fluoroquinolone δ qnrs 0 1 log10 gene copies args displayed similar copy numbers in both idna and exdna macrolide resistance genes ermb have been described to be embedded in transposon like elements such as tn551 tn552 tn4001 or tn4003 conferring resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mls partridge et al 2018 fluoroquinolone resistance genes have been reported to be plasmid borne since 1998 martínez martínez et al 1998 most of the qnr genes have been detected in entereobacteriaceae with the qnrs gene prevalent both in environmental strains guillard et al 2014 and in non conjugative plasmids harbouring mob genes allowing their mobilization kehrenberg et al 2007 these args are commonly found in mges forming the principal subsystem component of the exdna fraction fig 6 the genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 were the most abundant args in both idna and exdna fractions from the selected panel sulfonamides account within the most systemically used antibiotics in hospitals in the netherlands national institute for public health and the environment 2019 such a high level of sul genes meets with other studies that have measured args from total dna extracted out of activated sludge biomasses and effluent water czekalski et al 2012 rocha et al 2019 lower number of args copies have already been observed in the exdna fraction when compared to the idna from sludge using a protocol for extracting exdna from marine sediments corinaldesi et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 here we made a key contribution to enable the direct comparison of the molecular compositions of the free floating exdna and idna fractions of wastewater environments as a relevant milestone within the problematic of args and mges in environmental and public health protection lower copy numbers measured in the exdna fraction can arise from different possible causes it may be considered that dna fragments of the genes are less released outside cells thus interrogating whether sul1 2 and blactxm genes are less transferred on plasmids thus less mobile it can also suggest that idna when released because of cell decay or active release mechanisms may be degraded by nucleases present in both dna fractions another possibility is the degradation of dna fragments that carried these genes by microorganisms but dna degradation by microbes is likely not specific at gene level all in all the reason for this difference between compositions of idna and free floating exdna fractions needs to be investigated in more detail our isolation method provides the analytical key to investigate it what it is highly remarkable is that args can still be detected in significant amounts 100 1000 gene copies ml 1 in the exdna fraction that is fully exposed to the environment surface water is considered as an indicator for low arg level and hospitals effluent water as high arg level an arg level of less than 1000 gene copies ml 1 is considered low and an arg level of more than 104 gene copies ml 1 is considered high le et al 2016 wu et al 2020 however all these indicatory arg levels are based on analyses of intracellular dna obtaining 100 1000 gene copies ml 1 in the free floating extracellular dna sample where dna is exposed to all kind of nucleases and environmental hazards would be considered as high a plausible explanation of why exdna persists in aqueous environments is that it is clothed with a mesh of extracellular proteins demonstrated here with the proteinase k post treatments other causes of protection against degradation by nucleases can relate to exdna being locked within organic and inorganic aggregates adsorbed onto mineral matrices or integrated into viral genomes torti et al 2015 the qpcr data obtained on the selected panel of args and mges measured from effluent water are displayed in fig 5 together with the number of primary metagenomic reads retrieved for these genes from the resistome of free floating exdna isolated from activated sludge see next section 3 5 although the two types of analyses cannot be directly compared since made on effluent water and activated sludge respectively this comparison was performed to verify if there was a quantitative tendency between dna fractions followed by both detection methods qpcr and metagenomics the resistome dataset showed a lower log10 number of arg reads when compared to qpcr data this is due to lower sensitivity of metagenomics when compared to pcr based methods on wastewater samples manaia et al 2018 the integration of the results presented here with previous studies highlights the need to combine molecular methods for an accurate analysis of args and mges in wastewater metagenomics provides high resolution on the diversity of genes and their alleles qpcr provides high sensitivity for the detection of args and mges strong new insight on the separation and comparison of free floating exdna fractions from complex environmental biological samples is therefore provided here genes displayed in fig 5 sul1 sul2 ermb qnrs and blactxm corresponded to less than 2 of the total primary args reads found in the idna resistome from the activated sludge resistome only the number of reads of the universal 16s rrna and ubiquitous inti1 genes were in line with the ones measured by qpcr in both dna fractions when the trend in gene copies per ml was compared idna fractions contained a higher number of primary aligned reads from the selected panel of genes than the exdna fraction this was similar to qpcr results differences on the comparison results can be explained by the databases used as the resistome analysis fully depends on the databases selected for gene mapping the resistome analysis was also done with resfinder table s5 results suggested that using a curated database did not modify the results obtained resfinder is also not fully complete as sul1 sul2 ermb qnrs nor blactxm genes were not found arg sequences that are highly dissimilar to reference sequences deposited in databases cannot be detected thus not resulting in hits and not appearing in final results willmann and peter 2017 harmonization of both molecular methods and databases are needed to advance the field 3 5 metagenomics allowed the comparison of the resistome mobilome and microbiome between idna and exdna the quantity and quality of the exdna and idna templates that were separately retrieved from the complex activated sludge enabled a functional analysis of the different dna fractions fig 6 and a high throughput metagenomics analysis of their mobilome resistome and microbiome compositions fig 7 the number of reads used for metagenomic analysis are summarized in table s6 s7 the absolute read counts of specific genes were then translated into relative abundances when normalized by the total number of primary aligned reads after samclip filtration per database selected 3 5 1 functional analysis and mobilome profiling of exdna and idna fractions fig 6 displays the functional assignment level 1 of subsystem of metagenomics sequences from the exdna and idna metagenomes approximately 40 and 50 of the total predicted proteins with known functions 808 680 and 6 771 570 respectively matched with the subsystems database on the mg rast server meyer et al 2008 interestingly the patterns in the data confirmed that the metagenome of exdna was predominantly composed of mges with phages prophages transposable elements and plasmids making 65 1 526 534 hits of the sequencing dataset the same category corresponded to a residual 1 6 108 713 hits on the idna metagenome the idna fraction showed a heterogeneous distribution classified mainly by clustering based subsystems 13 94 944 394 hits carbohydrates 12 8 865 220 hits and amino acids and derivatives 9 13 701 175 hits sublevels among others clustering based subsystems contain functions such as proteosomes ribosomes and recombination related clusters delmont et al 2012 which are localized in the cytoplasm of microorganisms i e idna mobilome results showed that both the free floating exdna and the idna fractions contained a higher relative abundance of plasmids 58 and 74 respectively than viruses and prophages 41 and 26 respectively fig 7a in the exdna fraction the relative abundance of plasmids was significantly lower than the viruses this might be explained by extracellular plasmids exposure to and degradation by environmental nucleases the presence of microorganisms may also enhance the degradation rate of free floating extracellular dna plasmids zhu 2006 thus increasing the relative abundance of viral units in the free floating extracellular dna fraction mges are made of dna segments that are capable to jump randomly to new locations within a single cell or multiple microorganisms jørgensen et al 2014 they include viruses plasmids and associated elements such as insertion sequences transposons and integrons detailed mobilome compositions are summarized in the supplementary material table s7 and figure s4 for both free floating exdna and idna integrons integrative conjugative elements ice and insertion sequences is were analyzed from the exdna fraction inti1 92 figure s4b actinomycete conjugative integrative element aice 35 and sxt r391 30 figure s4c and is200 38 figure s4d were the most abundant components in their category respectively microorganisms use mges via hgt as a mechanism to evolve and adapt to new environmental conditions by being subjected to natural selection consideringthat antibiotic concentrations in effluent wastewater and surface waters have increased up to 1 µg l 1 in the last years sanseverino et al 2018 microorganisms can take profit from these mobile genes as an indirect tool to increase their resistance towards antimicrobials further research needs to be conducted on the relationship between the mges present in the free floating exdna fraction of biological systems like wastewater environments and the molecular mechanisms conferring antibiotics resistance overall the free floating exdna was confirmed as a pool of potentially transferrable dna via hgt mechanisms since mainly composed of mges these mges do not necessarily mobilize args in their structural composition jørgensen et al 2014 but can contribute to antibiotic resistance acquisition 3 5 2 resistome profiling of exdna and idna fractions we are showing the profile of the resistome of the free floating exdna from an activated sludge sample resistome results showed more distinct patterns among dna fractions fig 7b the free floating exdna fraction harbored a total of 12 different args from 5 different antibiotic resistance families there was a clear relative dominance of aminoglycosides 67 and β lactams 22 resistant genes on the exdna a total of 289 different args from 15 different antibiotic resistance families were found in the idna fraction this matched with the latest work of jia et al 2020 who detected 297 different genes from 17 different families in water and water filters from a drinking water treatment plant mls dominated 24 followed by rifampin 20 fluoroquinolones 15 1 and elfamycins 11 7 among other resistance genes on the idna most of the args are enclosed inside bacterial cells while some specific types may endure floating or are bound to matrices in activated sludge samples even if in low quantities the low amount of args on the free floating exdna suggests that natural transformation may not be the main mechanism through which arg transfer and exchange does occur zhang et al 2013 however this smaller amount of extracellular args does not preclude any possibility to be taken up by naturally competent bacteria in complex cultures via transformation processes it could be discussed whether the occurrence rate is lower in the exdna fraction because of preferential uptake of exdna fragments with args 3 5 3 microbiome profiling of exdna and idna fractions microbiome profiles were more conserved i e both as populations and their relative abundances between free floating exdna and idna fig 7c operational taxonomic units otus found in the extracellular fraction are genomic fragments that at some point have been released from lysed or necropsied cells these genes are easier to be degraded than plasmid or viral dna due to the potential for fragmented double stranded dna to be exposed to nucleases thus the exdna is more likely originating from cell lysis inside the activated sludge rather than immigrating from the influent moreover some studies have suggested that dna adsorbed to soil or eps matrices are protected from degradation by environmental nucleases indicating that genes on plasmid may be better preserved than genomic dna corinaldesi et al 2008 grande et al 2011 in this case it can be observed that only some specific bacterial and viral families are exclusive from one or another dna fraction if we consider the 0 5 relative abundance cutoff examples are microbacteriacae pseudonocardiacae and adenoviridae for the idna fraction and moraxellaceae and thermococcaceae for the exdna fig 7c however the moraxellaceae family is known as an inductor of activated sludge flocculation shchegolkova et al 2016 being also in the idna fraction 0 48 the same situation was observed with the other bacterial and viral families that were found only in one of the dna fraction this meant that no significant differences in populations could be observed at the bacterial family level between the exdna and idna fractions from activated sludge samples we therefore hypothesize that exdna may originate to some extent from the influent water but mainly from microbial populations that decayed in the activated sludge tank our combined exdna isolation and characterization method can become an efficient way to track microbial decay phenomena in activated sludge at the population resolution level 4 conclusions we aimed to develop a method to isolate and differentially characterize the genetic composition of free floating exdna fractions from wastewater their xenogenetic elements namely args and mges were characterized from molecular quantification at high sensitivity with qpcr to profiling at high throughput and resolution with metagenome sequencing this work led to the following key conclusions the implementation of deae chromatography promoted an efficient isolation of free floating exdna at high yield and quality from complex matrices of wwtp environments from influent wastewater to activated sludge and effluent water samples qpcr analyses of a panel of selected genes highlighted the presence of args from 1 8 to 3 8 log10 copies in the free floating exdna fraction significant differences were detected between the exdna and idna fractions for the predominant sulfonamides args sul1 and sul2 were 0 93 1 11 log10 more abundant in idna the metagenomes displayed similar microbiome compositions between exdna and idna fractions suggesting that a big fraction of free exdna found in activated sludge may derive from the flocs the mobilomes and resistomes from the exdna were less rich than on idna but still form a source of mges for natural transformation interestingly subsystems classifications showed that the exdna fraction was mainly composed of mges 65 1 this confirmed the hypothesis that free floating exdna is a pool of stable mges that can drive hgt and antibiotic resistance within the field of environmental ecology free floating exdna can serve as a target matrix for biodiversity survey studies nagler et al 2018a it can help to elucidate the ecological relevance and persistence of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the water sanitation process or to estimate the microbial activity from specific environments levy booth et al 2007 among others new physical chemical technologies can be studied for the removal of xenogenetic pollution specifically args and mges removal from wastewater calderón franco et al 2020b high removal of exdna from effluent water by e g adsorption may allow the discharge of water streams deprived of xenogenetic elements in receiving bodies thus potentially contributing to reducing the development antibiotic resistant bacteria by transformation processes gillings et al 2018 further studies on the conditions promoting hgt in complex biological systems are needed to elucidate the actual natural transformation rate for free floating exdna components their systematic chromatographic isolation molecular quantification and metagenomics profiling will be powerful to generate data useful for xenogenetic risk assessments on args mges but also residual gmo materials across urban and natural water systems it will support measures by water authorities to remove them from wastewater to safeguard environmental and public health data availability metagenome sequencing data were deposited in

17337,the free floating extracellular dna exdna fraction of microbial ecosystems harbors antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges natural transformation of these xenogenetic elements can generate microbial cells resistant to one or more antibiotics isolating and obtaining a high yield of exdna is challenging due to its low concentration in wastewater environments profiling exdna is crucial to unravel the ecology of free floating args and mges and their contribution to horizontal genetransfer we developed a method using chromatography to isolate and enrich exdna without causing cell lysis from complex wastewater matrices like influent 9 µg exdna out of 1 l activated sludge 5 6 µg out of 1 l and treated effluent 4 3 µg out of 1 l args and mges were metagenomically profiled for both the exdna and intracellular dna idna of activated sludge and quantified by qpcr in effluent water qpcr revealed that args and mges are more abundant in the idna fraction while still significant on exdna 100 1000 gene copies ml 1 in effluent water the metagenome highlighted that exdna is mainly composed of mges 65 according to their relatively low abundance in the resistome of exdna args uptake by natural transformation is likely not the main transfer mechanism although args are not highly abundant in exdna the prevalence of mges in the exdna fraction can indirectly promote antibiotic resistance development the combination of this method with functional metagenomics can help to elucidate the transfer and development of resistances in microbial communities a systematic profiling of the different dna fractions will foster microbial risk assessments across water systems supporting water authorities to delineate measures to safeguard

pathogenic agents antibiotic resistance genes args mobile genetic elements mges and materials from genetically modified organisms gmos via waterways and biological systems like wastewater environments are under active examination berendonk et al 2015 bürgmann et al 2018 pruden et al 2013 while args and mges are now widely targeted across investigations of sewage their survey has primarily been made based on the molecular analysis of total dna extracts from the microbial communities of wastewater however besides the intracellular dna idna the extracellular dna exdna that is free floating in the bulk liquid water phase may carry a substantial amount of args and mges of environmental and public health concern the exdna fraction has not been studied in detail even if there are some exceptions in sludge cattle manure and swine waste samples zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 differential isolation and systematic profiling of idna and free floating exdna is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of transfer of these mobile dna contaminants that replicate exdna retrieved from environmental samples can be defined as the dna fraction that is not housed within the envelope of the cell membrane torti et al 2015 the acronym edna is widely intermixed to describe either environmental dna or extracellular dna environmental dna does not necessarily discriminate between extracellular and intracellular fractions of nucleic acids it only means that dna extracted originates from cells that were present in the investigated ecosystem at the sampling event thomsen and willerslev 2015 we define free floating exdna as all the dna components that are neither enclosed inside cells nor adsorbed or aggregated in complex matrices and that are persistently floating in aqueous samples this exdna fraction can represent a genetic proxy of microbial and cellular diversity among different biogeographical areas corinaldesi et al 2018 torti et al 2015 isolating and analyzing exdna from environmental samples provides insight into the dynamics interactions and evolutionary history of populations of microorganisms and higher organisms that are or have been present in the investigated environment moreover exdna is abundant and plays an important role as a structural component of microcolonies stabilizing microbial bioaggregates dominiak et al 2011 rusanowska et al 2019 weissbrodt et al 2013 being a key component within the matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps dominiak et al 2011 tang et al 2013 tetz and tetz 2010 wu and xi 2010 however biofilm and flocs have also been suggested as reservoirs for arg occurrence and dissemination guo et al 2018 he et al 2019 active or passive release out of cells are the main sources of exdna nagler et al 2018a torti et al 2015 whether exdna is actively or passively released in these biological environments remains unsolved although some authors provide claims about one or the other hypotheses flemming and wingender 2010 merod and wuertz 2014 until mechanistic measurements will be made available strong debate will remain on the intention of cells to release dna to drive biofilm formation in this study exdna immobilized in the eps matrix is considered to be likely less available to gene transfer in comparison with free floating exdna karygianni et al 2020 the persistence of exdna in biofilms and of free floating exdna that can also sorb to surfaces may generate hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt in microbial biocoenoses natural competence is a widely distributed cellular mechanism harboured by microorganisms in nature to take up molecular resources from their surroundings naturally competent microbes may take up free or bound exdna nagler et al 2018a natural transformation is a parasexual mechanism for the exchange of genetic material induced by stress conditions such as nutrient limitations or the presence of antibiotics claverys et al 2009 such conditions are found in densely populated cultures such as activated sludge samples natural transformation in managed environments does not implicitly result in a threat for human health since it is a mechanism generating diversity and adaptation jørgensen et al 2014 however if args mges and pathogenic islands can be found in exdna fractions the formation of pathogenic bacterial cells resistant to one or more antibiotics also known as superbugs could be induced domingues et al 2012 dna fragments that have been released by sterilization of microbial cultures using e g industrial and research facility methods does not lose its integrity and capacity to be re amplified calderón franco et al 2020a thus making it an undesired source of xenogenetic pollution the molecular mechanisms generating superbugs and the underlying sources of genetic materials that can prompt it need to be studied methods to efficiently isolate quantify and metagenomically characterize exdna templates from complex biological samples are required in the last years a few methods to extract exdna have been published wang et al 2016 have used an aluminum hydroxide column to adsorb aquatic exdna nagler et al 2018 have opted for sequential steps involving enzymatic treatments to extract exdna from cattle rumen samples yuan et al 2019 have integrated magnetic beads in combination with the classic dna precipitation method involving the surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab yielding a relatively good amount of exdna of 0 2 µg out of 5 ml of wastewater silica solid phases similar to commercial silica resin columns have been tested to adsorb and extract exdna from low concentration clinical samples katevatis et al 2017 cell lysis has seldom been investigated although often debated across protocols for exdna extractions assessing and preventing cell lysis during exdna isolations is crucial to obtain confident analytical results from exdna templates moreover volumes previously used 100 ml have hindered a more detailed exdna characterization by metagenomics due to low isolation yields metagenomics can be used for deciphering the distribution mobility and microbial hosts of args in both dna fractions from environmental samples such as sludge zhou et al 2019 a mathematical model that accounts for args sitting on both idna and exdna fractions has been developed to predict the fate and transport of args in receiving waters downstream of wwtps ikuma and rehmann 2020 an improved quantitative understanding of these processes and of the impact of exdna on arg spread and occurrence requires more effective methods to extract exdna it will enable a more accurate risk assessment toward more targeted mitigation of antibiotic resistance here we systematically profiled xenogenetic elements from free floating exdna out of the complex biological environment of wastewater we highlight for the first time the potential xenogenetic risk associated with free floating exdna fragments transported with sewage across urban water systems we provide an efficient analytical method to investigate it at high resolution 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling from the influent activated sludge tank and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant biological samples were collected from influent wastewater activated sludge and effluent water of the urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder waterboard delfland the netherlands operated for full biological nutrient removal grab sampling was used totest the exdna isolation method on the different wastewater matrices and to metagenomically characterize

intracellular dna from biomass separated from activated sludge and effluent water idna was extracted from cells present in activated sludge and effluent water for analytical comparison of xenogenetic elements with exdna biomass was obtained as a pellet by centrifugation 6000 x g at 4 c for 10 min of activated sludge and filtration 0 45 and 0 2 µm 47 mm pes membrane filter pall corporation usa of effluent water an amount of 0 25 g wet weight of activated sludge 3 6 g tss l 1 was incubated during 1 h with 300 u ml 1 of dnase i in order to remove the residual exdna from the biological sample

4 plasmid dna used as chromatography selectivity control a bacillus expression pht01 plasmid mobitec gmbh germany was used as nucleic acid selectivity control for the deae anion exchange column 2 5 biomass pre treatment live dead staining and flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry combined with live dead staining was used to check for the prevention of cell lysis across the exdna isolation workflow cells from the biological samples were disaggregated as a prerequisite for the migration of individual cells in the flow cytometer activated sludge samples were diluted at 1 500 in 1x pbs buffer the diluted sludge samples were mild sonicated branson sonifier 250 usa on ice in 3 cycles of 45 s at 40 w after sonication samples were diluted at 1 500 in 1x pbs buffer right after the second dilution samples were filtered through a 10 µm syringe filter in order to remove possible residual cell debris and membranes the live dead staining protocol and flow cytometry analyses were based on previous works boulos et al 1999 hammes et al 2008 pinel et al 2020 prest et al 2013 two staining dyes were used to track viable cells with sybr green invitrogen usa and dead cells with red

50 µl sample volume with a threshold value of 700 on fl1 to reduce the background detection noise 2 6 gel electrophoresis on the free floating extracellular dna to analyze the different lengths of exdna templates the exdna samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis with agarose at 1 w v sigma aldrich haverhill united kingdom in 1xtae buffer 2 7 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr

inti1 known to be responsible for genes mobility ma et al 2017 was included to assess the presence of mges standards primers and reaction conditions are listed in tables s2 and s3 in supplementary material 2 8 metagenomic profiling of exdna and idna fractions from activated sludge samples metagenomics libraries of exdna and idna samples at 50 ng µl 1 were sequenced using a miseq pe300 benchtop sequencer illumina usa library preparation was done with a truseq dna pcr free kit lt lib prep kt st b phix control v3 datasets of 14 million reads were obtained per sample corresponding to a sequencing depth of 6 5 gb for idna and 6 8 gb for exdna fractions raw metagenomic data have been deposited in bioproject under accession number prjna632452 and id 632452 activated sludge was selected for metagenomics for being a highly diverse sample from which microbiome resistome and mobilome differences could be assessed in order to check the applicability of the extraction method the quality of the acquired illumina reads was assessed by fastqc version 0 11 9 with default parameters andrews 2010 paired ends reads were trimmed and filtered by trimmomatic version 0 39 with default parameters bolger et al 2014 alignments were performed by bwa mem version 2 with default parameters li 2013 generating a sam file to filter soft and hard clipped reads sam files were filtered by

microbial classification http ccb jhu edu software centrifuge the megares 2 0 database was used to identify args http megares meglab org the metagenomes were searched for signatures of known mges plasmids prophages and viruses through aclame http aclame ulb ac be leplae et al 2009 the mobilome was searched for integrative conjugative elements through the iceberg database http db mml sjtu edu cn iceberg liu et al 2019 insertion sequences through isfinder https isfinder biotoul fr siguier et al 2006 and integrons through the integrall database https integrall bio ua pt moura et al 2009 different databases of args and mges of different completeness and curation levels are available in public repositories such as the aforementioned while no consensus database is available yet follow

and secondary alignments ignored in order to get a list of the best hits for further data processing args and mges hits were considered when 2 or more reads per variant were aligned 2 9 comparative subsystems analysis of the metagenomic data unassembled clean reads from the exdna and idna fractions of activated sludge were annotated using the open access metagenome curation and analysis platform metagenome rapid annotation using subsystem technology mg rast http metagenomics nmpdr org meyer et al 2008 the subsystem classification mg rast id are available for the free floating extracellular dna mgm4886400 3 and the intracellular dna mgm4886611 3 2 10 statistics statistical analyses were performed on all molecular datasets with r 3 5 1 r foundation for statistical computing 2018 and rstudio https www rstudio com for the analysis of significance on the purification effect on the yield of dna isolation a non parametric wilcoxon test was performed for both exdna and idna samples biological replicates were used from influent water 3 replicates activated sludge 6 replicates and effluent water 3 replicates a parametric two tailed student s t test with statistical significance established at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 was performed to analyze the significance of the differences in arg and mge compositions between exdna and idna fractions for both exdna and idna samples 3 biological replicates with 3 technical replicates were used from effluent water 3 results and discussion 3 1 high yields of free floating exdna were obtained by anion exchange chromatography the column performed with high nucleic acid selectivity for the retention separation and spectrophotometric detection λ 260 nm with known concentration of pure pht01 plasmid of bacillus subtilis as control figure s1a a sharp and well resolved narrow peak was obtained in the chromatographic elution and detection of the plasmid control the raw non precipitated exdna obtained from filtered activated sludge started to elute after 10 min for 35 min figure s1b the chromatographic peak maximum was detected at a retention time of 18 min the concentrated raw free floating exdna extract displayed a hydrogel aspect fig 2 its color related to the source of the exdna extract namely dark brown with influent water yellow with activated sludge or colorless with effluent water the explanation could relate to either polyphenols or humic acids polyphenols are soluble in water and change to a red coloration when in contact with air hussain et al 2015 humic acids are abundant in wastewater and can interact with dna saeki et al 2011 the concentration of humic acids decreases during wastewater treatment nemerow and doby 1956 for instance humic acids adsorb onto activated sludge feng et al 2008 they are less abundant in absolute concentration in effluent water ma et al 2001 therefore we hypothesize that the loss of color in the exdna extract through the process is due to loss of humic acids that are co extracted with the exdna the diethylaminoethyl cellulose deae column efficiently isolated and concentrated the free floating exdna fraction from large volumes of influent wastewater activated sludge and effluent water of the wwtp the yields i e mass of dna isolated in molecular biology after the isolation and purification procedures of raw and purified with a commercial dna purification kit after proteinase k treatment free floating exdna isolated from influent wastewater activated sludge and effluent water are shown in figure s2 yields and concentrations are summarized in table 1 the exdna fraction corresponded to 1 of the total dna extracted from activated sludge only exdna obtained from activated sludge samples showed significant differences in the yields between raw and purified exdna p 0 05 there was no significant difference p 0 05 between in yields of raw exdna obtained from different water quality samples however the influent wastewater displayed a significantly p 0 05 higher fraction of purified free floating exdna 9 000 ng out of 1000 ml initial sample volume than activated sludge 5 631 ng out of 1000 ml initial sample volume and effluent water 4 276 ng out of 1000 ml initial sample volume the raw exdna extracted from influent wastewater and activated sludge supernatant samples yielded higher concentrations 12 5 1 9 ng ml 1 and 12 3 1 ng ml 1 respectively than after purification 9 0 0 7 ng ml 1 and 5 6 0 46 ng ml 1 respectively an average mass loss of 42 through the commercial purification kit was measured in the method one commercial kit was used for the purification of the exdna extracts after digestion with proteinase k for future works other commercial kits or classical purification methods might also be assessed for the isolation of free floating exdna from low content water samples it is paramount to note that the exdna yields were substantial for the three biological matrices the free floating exdna extracts fulfilled the minimal quantitative and qualitative requirements mass 1 µg concentration 20 ng µl 1 volume 20 µl required for qpcr and high throughput metagenomics analyses much higher yields were obtained than with other isolation methods tested in parallel in this study or reported in literature ca 3 fold higher than with classical ctab and pci methods and up to as high as ca 2000 fold higher than direct precipitation with isopropanol table 2 our method and the one of yuan et al yuan et al 2019 provide the necessary yield of exdna recovered from wastewater samples for subsequent molecular analyses 3 2 mild enzymatic post treatment with proteinase k is necessary to release exdna from bound extracellular polymeric proteins found in activated sludge the free floating exdna extracted from activated sludge was characterized by an intense band at the top of the agarose gel this suggested that exdna was entrapped in a protein mesh that did not allow it to migrate through the gel fig 3 a after mild enzymatic treatment of these residual proteins bound to the exdnas with proteinase k it was observed that the purified exdna templates were able to run through the gel fig 3b these were characterized by a distribution of fragments sizes that ranged from 0 5 kbp to 20 kbp for comparison the idna that was extracted in parallel using commercial kits exhibited dna fragments that also ranged from less than 0 5 kbp to 20 kbp both dna fractions displayed similar fragment size distribution assuming that the average size of genes present in bacterial genomes is 1 5 kb long exdna was suggested to be large enough to contain multiple args and mges deflaun et al 1987 zhang et al 2013 no significant differences in band intensity could be observed between untreated biomass and treated with dnase i prior to intracellular dna extraction fig 3b this suggests a low exdna content bound to biomass when dna is extracted from 0 25 g of activated sludge the extracted pools of free floating exdna fragments were suitable for further molecular analyses since purity 1 76 0 02 was close to optimal the optimum absorbance ratio a260 nm a280 nm of 1 8 3 3 cell lysis is not induced during the isolation of free floating exdna cell lysis measurements and control were conducted on the processing of activated sludge since exhibiting the highest microbial density among the wastewater environment samples thus activated sludge was considered as more prone to potential cell lysis and cross contamination of the free floating exdna extract with idna residues flow cytometry was used to measure the total cells counts after each biomass processing step in the developed protocol fig 4 a together with the relative abundances of live dead cells measured after stainings with sybr green and propidium iodide fluorophores respectively fig 4b after filtration of centrifuged activated sludge supernatant through the 0 45 µm membrane filter the number of flow cytometry events ml 1 was below 10 after second filtration on 0 2 µm below 1 event the diluted activated sludge control that consisted of a non centrifuged and non filtered activated sludge sample had an average of 1606 events ml 1 cells retained in the membrane filters were assumed to maintain their robustness and viability tanny et al 1980 wu and xi 2010 initial cell viability was preserved and bacterial cells were removed upfront by centrifugation and filtration depending on the type of biomasses targeted even smaller filter pore sizes than 0 2 μm could be used besides high yield the free floating exdna template was therefore of high quality being deprived of idna contamination the isolation method did not induce cell lysis during the extraction a cell free and idna free exdna fraction was isolated this quality control ensured that in the exdna fraction there was no genomic dna contamination caused by the extraction hence we demonstrated the isolation of free floating exdna at high yield and high quality from complex microbial community matrices of activated sludge across a workflow exempt of cell lysis 3 4 free floating exdna displays lesser arg copies than idna qpcr results highlighted that molecular analysis of five selected args sul1 sul2 ermb qnrs blactxm and one mge intl1 could be performed from both the idna and the free floating exdna fractions of wastewater environments being effluent wastewater in this case fig 5 all genes tested but blactxm were detected in both dna fractions the free floating exdna template harbored a lower number of arg and mge copies than idna with a significant difference δ of 0 87 0 32 log10 gene copies p 0 005 across the gene panel at individual gene level the free floating exdna displayed a significantly lower log based gene copy number of both the bacterial 16s rrna gene δ 1 2 0 43 log10 gene copies and the args δ values given hereafter vs idna sulfonamides δ sul1 0 94 0 33 δ sul2 1 11 0 32 log10 gene copies ml 1 and β lactamase δ blactxm 1 92 0 25 log10 gene copies ml 1 args and the integrase type i δ inti1 1 32 0 38 log10 gene copies ml 1 mge were significantly lesser in the free floating exdna than in the idna conversely the macrolides δ ermb 0 27 0 24 log10 gene copies and fluoroquinolone δ qnrs 0 1 log10 gene copies args displayed similar copy numbers in both idna and exdna macrolide resistance genes ermb have been described to be embedded in transposon like elements such as tn551 tn552 tn4001 or tn4003 conferring resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mls partridge et al 2018 fluoroquinolone resistance genes have been reported to be plasmid borne since 1998 martínez martínez et al 1998 most of the qnr genes have been detected in entereobacteriaceae with the qnrs gene prevalent both in environmental strains guillard et al 2014 and in non conjugative plasmids harbouring mob genes allowing their mobilization kehrenberg et al 2007 these args are commonly found in mges forming the principal subsystem component of the exdna fraction fig 6 the genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 were the most abundant args in both idna and exdna fractions from the selected panel sulfonamides account within the most systemically used antibiotics in hospitals in the netherlands national institute for public health and the environment 2019 such a high level of sul genes meets with other studies that have measured args from total dna extracted out of activated sludge biomasses and effluent water czekalski et al 2012 rocha et al 2019 lower number of args copies have already been observed in the exdna fraction when compared to the idna from sludge using a protocol for extracting exdna from marine sediments corinaldesi et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 here we made a key contribution to enable the direct comparison of the molecular compositions of the free floating exdna and idna fractions of wastewater environments as a relevant milestone within the problematic of args and mges in environmental and public health protection lower copy numbers measured in the exdna fraction can arise from different possible causes it may be considered that dna fragments of the genes are less released outside cells thus interrogating whether sul1 2 and blactxm genes are less transferred on plasmids thus less mobile it can also suggest that idna when released because of cell decay or active release mechanisms may be degraded by nucleases present in both dna fractions another possibility is the degradation of dna fragments that carried these genes by microorganisms but dna degradation by microbes is likely not specific at gene level all in all the reason for this difference between compositions of idna and free floating exdna fractions needs to be investigated in more detail our isolation method provides the analytical key to investigate it what it is highly remarkable is that args can still be detected in significant amounts 100 1000 gene copies ml 1 in the exdna fraction that is fully exposed to the environment surface water is considered as an indicator for low arg level and hospitals effluent water as high arg level an arg level of less than 1000 gene copies ml 1 is considered low and an arg level of more than 104 gene copies ml 1 is considered high le et al 2016 wu et al 2020 however all these indicatory arg levels are based on analyses of intracellular dna obtaining 100 1000 gene copies ml 1 in the free floating extracellular dna sample where dna is exposed to all kind of nucleases and environmental hazards would be considered as high a plausible explanation of why exdna persists in aqueous environments is that it is clothed with a mesh of extracellular proteins demonstrated here with the proteinase k post treatments other causes of protection against degradation by nucleases can relate to exdna being locked within organic and inorganic aggregates adsorbed onto mineral matrices or integrated into viral genomes torti et al 2015 the qpcr data obtained on the selected panel of args and mges measured from effluent water are displayed in fig 5 together with the number of primary metagenomic reads retrieved for these genes from the resistome of free floating exdna isolated from activated sludge see next section 3 5 although the two types of analyses cannot be directly compared since made on effluent water and activated sludge respectively this comparison was performed to verify if there was a quantitative tendency between dna fractions followed by both detection methods qpcr and metagenomics the resistome dataset showed a lower log10 number of arg reads when compared to qpcr data this is due to lower sensitivity of metagenomics when compared to pcr based methods on wastewater samples manaia et al 2018 the integration of the results presented here with previous studies highlights the need to combine molecular methods for an accurate analysis of args and mges in wastewater metagenomics provides high resolution on the diversity of genes and their alleles qpcr provides high sensitivity for the detection of args and mges strong new insight on the separation and comparison of free floating exdna fractions from complex environmental biological samples is therefore provided here genes displayed in fig 5 sul1 sul2 ermb qnrs and blactxm corresponded to less than 2 of the total primary args reads found in the idna resistome from the activated sludge resistome only the number of reads of the universal 16s rrna and ubiquitous inti1 genes were in line with the ones measured by qpcr in both dna fractions when the trend in gene copies per ml was compared idna fractions contained a higher number of primary aligned reads from the selected panel of genes than the exdna fraction this was similar to qpcr results differences on the comparison results can be explained by the databases used as the resistome analysis fully depends on the databases selected for gene mapping the resistome analysis was also done with resfinder table s5 results suggested that using a curated database did not modify the results obtained resfinder is also not fully complete as sul1 sul2 ermb qnrs nor blactxm genes were not found arg sequences that are highly dissimilar to reference sequences deposited in databases cannot be detected thus not resulting in hits and not appearing in final results willmann and peter 2017 harmonization of both molecular methods and databases are needed to advance the field 3 5 metagenomics allowed the comparison of the resistome mobilome and microbiome between idna and exdna the quantity and quality of the exdna and idna templates that were separately retrieved from the complex activated sludge enabled a functional analysis of the different dna fractions fig 6 and a high throughput metagenomics analysis of their mobilome resistome and microbiome compositions fig 7 the number of reads used for metagenomic analysis are summarized in table s6 s7 the absolute read counts of specific genes were then translated into relative abundances when normalized by the total number of primary aligned reads after samclip filtration per database selected 3 5 1 functional analysis and mobilome profiling of exdna and idna fractions fig 6 displays the functional assignment level 1 of subsystem of metagenomics sequences from the exdna and idna metagenomes approximately 40 and 50 of the total predicted proteins with known functions 808 680 and 6 771 570 respectively matched with the subsystems database on the mg rast server meyer et al 2008 interestingly the patterns in the data confirmed that the metagenome of exdna was predominantly composed of mges with phages prophages transposable elements and plasmids making 65 1 526 534 hits of the sequencing dataset the same category corresponded to a residual 1 6 108 713 hits on the idna metagenome the idna fraction showed a heterogeneous distribution classified mainly by clustering based subsystems 13 94 944 394 hits carbohydrates 12 8 865 220 hits and amino acids and derivatives 9 13 701 175 hits sublevels among others clustering based subsystems contain functions such as proteosomes ribosomes and recombination related clusters delmont et al 2012 which are localized in the cytoplasm of microorganisms i e idna mobilome results showed that both the free floating exdna and the idna fractions contained a higher relative abundance of plasmids 58 and 74 respectively than viruses and prophages 41 and 26 respectively fig 7a in the exdna fraction the relative abundance of plasmids was significantly lower than the viruses this might be explained by extracellular plasmids exposure to and degradation by environmental nucleases the presence of microorganisms may also enhance the degradation rate of free floating extracellular dna plasmids zhu 2006 thus increasing the relative abundance of viral units in the free floating extracellular dna fraction mges are made of dna segments that are capable to jump randomly to new locations within a single cell or multiple microorganisms jørgensen et al 2014 they include viruses plasmids and associated elements such as insertion sequences transposons and integrons detailed mobilome compositions are summarized in the supplementary material table s7 and figure s4 for both free floating exdna and idna integrons integrative conjugative elements ice and insertion sequences is were analyzed from the exdna fraction inti1 92 figure s4b actinomycete conjugative integrative element aice 35 and sxt r391 30 figure s4c and is200 38 figure s4d were the most abundant components in their category respectively microorganisms use mges via hgt as a mechanism to evolve and adapt to new environmental conditions by being subjected to natural selection consideringthat antibiotic concentrations in effluent wastewater and surface waters have increased up to 1 µg l 1 in the last years sanseverino et al 2018 microorganisms can take profit from these mobile genes as an indirect tool to increase their resistance towards antimicrobials further research needs to be conducted on the relationship between the mges present in the free floating exdna fraction of biological systems like wastewater environments and the molecular mechanisms conferring antibiotics resistance overall the free floating exdna was confirmed as a pool of potentially transferrable dna via hgt mechanisms since mainly composed of mges these mges do not necessarily mobilize args in their structural composition jørgensen et al 2014 but can contribute to antibiotic resistance acquisition 3 5 2 resistome profiling of exdna and idna fractions we are showing the profile of the resistome of the free floating exdna from an activated sludge sample resistome results showed more distinct patterns among dna fractions fig 7b the free floating exdna fraction harbored a total of 12 different args from 5 different antibiotic resistance families there was a clear relative dominance of aminoglycosides 67 and β lactams 22 resistant genes on the exdna a total of 289 different args from 15 different antibiotic resistance families were found in the idna fraction this matched with the latest work of jia et al 2020 who detected 297 different genes from 17 different families in water and water filters from a drinking water treatment plant mls dominated 24 followed by rifampin 20 fluoroquinolones 15 1 and elfamycins 11 7 among other resistance genes on the idna most of the args are enclosed inside bacterial cells while some specific types may endure floating or are bound to matrices in activated sludge samples even if in low quantities the low amount of args on the free floating exdna suggests that natural transformation may not be the main mechanism through which arg transfer and exchange does occur zhang et al 2013 however this smaller amount of extracellular args does not preclude any possibility to be taken up by naturally competent bacteria in complex cultures via transformation processes it could be discussed whether the occurrence rate is lower in the exdna fraction because of preferential uptake of exdna fragments with args 3 5 3 microbiome profiling of exdna and idna fractions microbiome profiles were more conserved i e both as populations and their relative abundances between free floating exdna and idna fig 7c operational taxonomic units otus found in the extracellular fraction are genomic fragments that at some point have been released from lysed or necropsied cells these genes are easier to be degraded than plasmid or viral dna due to the potential for fragmented double stranded dna to be exposed to nucleases thus the exdna is more likely originating from cell lysis inside the activated sludge rather than immigrating from the influent moreover some studies have suggested that dna adsorbed to soil or eps matrices are protected from degradation by environmental nucleases indicating that genes on plasmid may be better preserved than genomic dna corinaldesi et al 2008 grande et al 2011 in this case it can be observed that only some specific bacterial and viral families are exclusive from one or another dna fraction if we consider the 0 5 relative abundance cutoff examples are microbacteriacae pseudonocardiacae and adenoviridae for the idna fraction and moraxellaceae and thermococcaceae for the exdna fig 7c however the moraxellaceae family is known as an inductor of activated sludge flocculation shchegolkova et al 2016 being also in the idna fraction 0 48 the same situation was observed with the other bacterial and viral families that were found only in one of the dna fraction this meant that no significant differences in populations could be observed at the bacterial family level between the exdna and idna fractions from activated sludge samples we therefore hypothesize that exdna may originate to some extent from the influent water but mainly from microbial populations that decayed in the activated sludge tank our combined exdna isolation and characterization method can become an efficient way to track microbial decay phenomena in activated sludge at the population resolution level 4 conclusions we aimed to develop a method to isolate and differentially characterize the genetic composition of free floating exdna fractions from wastewater their xenogenetic elements namely args and mges were characterized from molecular quantification at high sensitivity with qpcr to profiling at high throughput and resolution with metagenome sequencing this work led to the following key conclusions the implementation of deae chromatography promoted an efficient isolation of free floating exdna at high yield and quality from complex matrices of wwtp environments from influent wastewater to activated sludge and effluent water samples qpcr analyses of a panel of selected genes highlighted the presence of args from 1 8 to 3 8 log10 copies in the free floating exdna fraction significant differences were detected between the exdna and idna fractions for the predominant sulfonamides args sul1 and sul2 were 0 93 1 11 log10 more abundant in idna the metagenomes displayed similar microbiome compositions between exdna and idna fractions suggesting that a big fraction of free exdna found in activated sludge may derive from the flocs the mobilomes and resistomes from the exdna were less rich than on idna but still form a source of mges for natural transformation interestingly subsystems classifications showed that the exdna fraction was mainly composed of mges 65 1 this confirmed the hypothesis that free floating exdna is a pool of stable mges that can drive hgt and antibiotic resistance within the field of environmental ecology free floating exdna can serve as a target matrix for biodiversity survey studies nagler et al 2018a it can help to elucidate the ecological relevance and persistence of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the water sanitation process or to estimate the microbial activity from specific environments levy booth et al 2007 among others new physical chemical technologies can be studied for the removal of xenogenetic pollution specifically args and mges removal from wastewater calderón franco et al 2020b high removal of exdna from effluent water by e g adsorption may allow the discharge of water streams deprived of xenogenetic elements in receiving bodies thus potentially contributing to reducing the development antibiotic resistant bacteria by transformation processes gillings et al 2018 further studies on the conditions promoting hgt in complex biological systems are needed to elucidate the actual natural transformation rate for free floating exdna components their systematic chromatographic isolation molecular quantification and metagenomics profiling will be powerful to generate data useful for xenogenetic risk assessments on args mges but also residual gmo materials across urban and natural water systems it will support measures by water authorities to remove them from wastewater to safeguard environmental and public health data availability metagenome sequencing data were deposited in

17338,colloids and nanoparticles leached from agricultural land are major carriers of potentially bioavailable nutrients with high mobility in the environment despite significant research efforts accurate knowledge of macronutrients in colloids and nanoparticles is limited we used multi elemental synchrotron x ray fluorescence xrf microscopy with multivariate spatial analysis and x ray atomic absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy at the p and s k edges to study the speciation of p and s in two fractions of leached particles 0 45 and 0 45 µm respectively collected from four tile drained agricultural sites in sweden p k edge xanes showed that organic p followed by p adsorbed to surfaces of aluminum bearing particles were the most common forms of leached p iron bound p fe p forms were generally less abundant 0 30 of the total p s k edge xanes showed that s was predominantly organic and a relatively high abundance of reduced s species suggests that redox conditions were adverse to the persistence of p bound to fe bearing colloids in the leachates acid ammonium oxalate extractions suggested that p associated with al and fe al p and fe p in most cases could be explained by the adsorption capacity of non crystalline oxalate extractable oxides of al and fe these results improve our understanding of particulate p and s speciation in the vadose zone and helps in developing effective technologies for mitigating colloidal driven eutrophication of water bodies near agricultural land graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leachates colloids nanoparticles phosphorus sulfur speciation 1 introduction diffuse loss of macronutrients from agricultural land remains one of the main drivers of eutrophication leading to harmful algae bloom deterioration of drinking water quality and loss of biodiversity in affected aquatic systems zou et al 2020 the eutrophication of surface and subsurface waters depends on nutrient concentration as well as molecular speciation liu et al 2014 read et al 2014 it has been shown that most elements mobilized from soils are associated with colloidal and nanoparticulate phases gottselig et al 2017a gottselig et al 2014 hill and aplin 2001 jarvie et al 2012 knowledge of their speciation and potential bioavailability is critical in order to reduce the loss of nutrients from agricultural lands and to predict environmental risks colloids and nanoparticles are small enough to withstand gravitational settling they consist of mineral particles detrital organic matter and living bacterial cells gustafsson and gschwend 1997 due to their large specific surface area and high reactivity clay minerals including fe al hydroxides 2 μm and particulate organic matter are considered as the most mobile components of the soil system and as important vehicles of nutrient transport from the soil profile das et al 2019 regelink et al 2013 natural colloids like iron fe and aluminum al oxides silica and organic molecules in natural aquatic systems have been linked to weathering and mineralization processes in the soil holtzman and lehman 1998 tsao et al 2011 however the knowledge of the nature and properties of macronutrients in colloids and nanoparticles mobilized from agricultural land is limited one of the reasons for this is the adherence to operational definitions of dissolved compounds based solely on filtration through a filter e g of 0 45 µm pore size hall et al 1996 heathwaite et al 2005 however the filtrate is likely to include fine nanoparticles as well as dissolved species gimbert et al 2007 surface runoff subsurface lateral flow and vertical percolation leaching are the major hydrological pathways through which soil nutrients are transported in many agricultural systems especially under high intensity rainfall events surface runoff is the main route of nutrient loss from the soil ma et al 2016 sharpley et al 1993 however transport by rapid vertical flow in macropores can be the predominant pathway in flat areas and this is considered as the main pathway of nutrient loss in central sweden andersson et al 2013 ulén and snäll 2007 of all nutrients the loss of phosphorus p from arable land is of strategic importance to the swedish environment especially the eutrophication of the baltic sea one of the largest brackish water areas in the world eriksson et al 2013 murray et al 2019 a similar scenario of p driven eutrophication is applicable in other parts of europe ulén et al 2007 and north america council 2011 kleinman et al 2019 moreover successive p inputs over time have resulted in a build up of p in many soils globally liu et al 2015 this accumulated legacy p is characterized by slow remobilization in agricultural soils acting as a continuous source of p pollution in aquatic environments bergström et al 2015 sharpley et al 2013 according to prior studies colloidal and nanoparticulate p may constitute up to 80 of total p in leachates from agricultural land gottselig et al 2014 liu et al 2014 sharma et al 2017 elucidating the chemical speciation of this p is critical to unravel the processes that govern particulate p retention and desorption in soils and to predict particulate p reactivity in the receiving environments for example the p that exists as iron phosphate or is bound to the surfaces of iron bearing minerals like ferrihydrite or goethite would be more sensitive to redox conditions henderson et al 2012 murray and hesterberg 2006 on the other hand the p that exists as aluminum phosphate or is bound to the surfaces of aluminum oxide hydroxide particles as well as p that exists as hydroxyapatite or other calcium phosphates would be more vulnerable to changes in ph conditions guidry and mackenzie 2003 organic p on the other hand would be susceptible to microbial mineralization and biotransformation prentice et al 2019 there have been few attempts at deciphering the speciation of p in suspended particles leached from arable soils under field conditions a study on colloids that were artificially detached from the soils by mechanical dispersion showed colloidal p to be mainly inorganic with p associated with fe and al minerals as the main species 70 83 followed by hydroxyapatite 17 20 liu et al 2014 the capacity of mineral surfaces to adsorb phosphate varies greatly depending on ph and the crystallinity of the oxide phase the absence of a sharp boundary between surface adsorption and formation of a separate phosphate phase through precipitation further complicates the assessment of maximum adsorption capacity hesterberg 2010 van riemsdijk and lyklema 1980 notwithstanding the maximum sorption is reported to be modest on phyllosilicate clays with values ranging from 8 to 13 mmol kg 1 for 2 1 minerals violante and pigna 2002 and up to 42 in 1 1 minerals gray wannell et al 2020 it is roughly one or two orders of magnitude greater in allophane crystalline gibbsite and goethite khare et al 2005 violante and pigna 2002 and approximately 1700 and 3300 mmol kg 1 in ferrihydrite and amorphous al oh 3 respectively hesterberg 2010 khare et al 2005 sulfur s is an essential macronutrient used by plants in amounts similar to those of p kopriva et al 2019 the majority of s transported to aquatic environments comes from soils and wetlands and the s is mostly released in organic forms fakhraee et al 2017 organic s in soils exists in reduced species sulfides thiols intermediately oxidized species sulfoxides sulfones and sulfonates and fully oxidized s in sulfate esters in a study of s in two swedish agricultural soils sulfate esters were the single most abundant category representing 40 64 of the s whereas inorganic sulfate was less than 2 boye et al 2011 however the redox state of organic s may depend on the redox conditions of the soil with more abundant reduced species and less intermediate and oxidized species in waterlogged soils and vice versa prietzel et al 2009b most importantly increases in p eutrophication have been linked to s biotransformation and mineralization during the breakdown of organic matter lamers et al 2002 van diggelen et al 2014 therefore the speciation of s in colloids leached from the soil carries information on processes relevant for both s itself and for p to our knowledge there is no study that has examined the molecular speciation of p and s simultaneously in colloids and nanoparticles leached from agricultural land under natural conditions the aim of this study was to reveal the molecular speciation of these elements in two fractions of naturally leached particles 0 45 and 0 45 µm respectively by using synchrotron x ray fluorescence microscopy and x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy 2 methodology 2 1 study sites leachates from tile drained fields at four agricultural sites situated in the drainage basin of the north sea the baltic sea and vänern the largest lake in the european union were selected for this study the sites include three clayey soils krusenberg 59 14 n 17 41 e lilla böslid 56 35 n 12 56 e and lanna 58 21 n 13 07 e as well as a sandy soil mellby 56 29 n 12 59 e the trials are equipped with plots that are individually tile drained at 0 9 1 0 m depth and have an area of 42 m2 at krusenberg 320 1700 m2 at the other sites flow proportional bulk samples are collected in a drain station over 14 consecutive days from each plot the trials receive 8 20 kg ha 1 of p annually supplied as mineral fertilizer at lanna and lilla böslid and cattle and pig slurry at krusenberg and mellby respectively a detailed description of the sites is presented in the supplementary material s1 2 2 chemical analyses bulk leachates were analyzed for ph alkalinity and electric conductivity ec ionic strength was calculated from the latter with the marion babcock equation total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen were measured in unfiltered samples by combustion and catalytic oxidation respectively shimadzu toc vcph suspended materials were collected on a 0 2 µm membrane filter and weighed three operational p fractions were analyzed 1 total p by flow analysis of molybdate reactive phosphate technicon autoanalyzer 3 after oxidation of non filtered samples with peroxodisulfate iso 6878 2004 2 total p 0 2 µm after filtration using the same digestion and analysis as for the total p 3 molybdate reactive ortho phosphate iso 15923 1 2013 2013 after filtration 0 2 µm the difference 1 2 will be referred to as particulate p 0 2 µm 2 3 is non orthophosphate p 0 2 µm 2 3 isolation of leached particles leachate particles were isolated in two steps first particles 0 45 µm were collected on a 0 45 µm durapore membrane filter second particles in leachates from the first step were collected on a 10 kda ultracel membrane filter to yield a size range from 10 kda to 0 45 µm these fractions are henceforth referred to as coarse particles 0 45 µm and fine particles 0 45 µm respectively the isolated particles were rinsed twice with milli q water and freeze dried for bulk chemical analysis or stored wet at 5 c until further analysis as specified in table s1 the freeze dried particles were analyzed for bulk chemistry after digestion in a mixture of hno3 hcl and hf according to sfs en13656 2002 non crystalline and organically bound metals were extracted with 0 2 m ammonium oxalate at ph 3 in darkness jiang et al 2015 elements in bulk digests and oxalate extracts were analyzed by icp sfms church et al 2017 oxalate extractable al si fe p and s were divided by the respective bulk concentration to yield a weight percent representing the extractability in oxalate 2 4 mineralogical analysis by x ray diffraction xrd coarse particles in one leachate from each plot were isolated on a 0 45 µm silver filter membrane millipore ag4502550 and scanned using copper kα radiation from 3 to 45 2θ in i air dried state ii after glycolation and iii after heating to 300 c for one hour clay minerals were semi quantified using a reference intensity ratio factor approach hillier 2003 a c qf ratio crudely estimating the relative proportions of phyllosilicates to non clay minerals the latter principally consisting of quartz and feldspars was also calculated from the peak heights of the phyllosilicate peak near 5 å and the quartz k feldspar doublet at about 4 26 å in the diffractogram obtained after heating the 5 å peak was chosen because of its proximity to the 4 26 å doublet which means any sample related errors will be near constant for the two peaks and because the 5 å peak in the heated sample as 002 of the peak near 10 å little intensity remained in the 10 å range following heating represents most of the clay minerals present 2 5 bulk p k edge xanes p k edge xanes spectra were collected from freeze dried particle fractions at beam line 8 of the synchrotron light research institute slri in nakhon ratchasima thailand klysubun et al 2020 the analysis is henceforth referred to as bulk xanes as distinct from spot wise µ xanes described below the beamline was equipped with an insb 111 crystal monochromator and a solid state 13 element ge fluorescence detector the beamline has a photon flux that ranges from 4 107 to 3 1011 photons s 1 100 ma 1 and a high energy resolution of 4 6 10 4 at 3206 ev and 3 8 10 4 at 6539 ev klysubun et al 2020 the beam size was 18 2 mm and the beam flux was 2 1011 photons s 1 100 ma 1 the particles were homogenized and mounted on p free kapton tape to minimize x ray absorption by air the sample compartment was filled with helium gas spectra of samples and reference p compounds were recorded over 2100 2320 ev the step size was 2 ev at 2100 2132 ev 1 ev at 2132 2144 ev 0 2 ev at 2144 2153 ev 0 3 ev at 2153 2182 ev and 5 ev at 2182 2320 ev the dwell time was 3 s per energy step during all measurements 2 6 synchrotron micro focused xrf and xanes micro focused xrf imaging and micro focused xanes analysis referred to as µ xrf and µ xanes in the following was performed at the x ray microscopy beamline id21 of the european synchrotron research facility esrf france the beamline is optimized for micro spectroscopy with submicron resolution in the 2 to 9 5 kev energy range allowing the mapping and xanes analysis of both low and high energy elements salomé et al 2013 samples table s1 were first mixed with a vortex mixer deposited on ultralene thin film and allowed to dry at 25 οc the detectors on the beamline includes a si3n4 diode for i0 and a silicon drift detector sgs sensortech 80 mm2 active area for the emitted x ray fluorescence focusing of the x ray beam 0 5 1 2 µm was performed by a kirkpatrick baez mirrors system a double beam set up was used by selecting both the first and the third harmonic in order to allow the simultaneous mapping of low and high z elements the photon flux was 1 9739 109 photons s 1 at 2 5 kev high resolution µ xrf images of elements were acquired with a dwell time of 100 ms using a step size of 1 0 1 0 µm2 for the coarse particles and 0 5 0 5 µm2 for the fine particles spot wise µ xanes of p and s was performed at spots with varying concentration according to the elemental imaging p and s k edge μ xanes spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode by single point acquisition over 2 10 2 22 and 2 45 2 55 kev energy ranges for p and s respectively with 0 2 ev steps using the moving si 111 monochromator of id21 for both measurements the calibration of the monochromator energy was done using hydroxyapatite for p and l cysteine for s at every selected spot 8 to 12 μ xanes scans were collected collected μ xanes spectra were examined for possible beam damage and up to 6 high quality spectra were selected and merged to represent a spot 2 7 analysis of x ray fluorescence data the μ xrf spectra were dead time corrected and normalized to incoming beam intensities before deconvolution high resolution elemental images were obtained after fitting each pixel spectrum using the pymca x ray fluorescence toolkit solé et al 2007 the spatial correlation of p with relevant elements s al ca and fe is shown using 3 colour rgb red green blue correlator principal component analysis pca of deconvoluted elemental intensities of mg al si p s k ca and fe was performed using jmp pro 14 mean centering of each element and scaling to unit standard deviation was part of the procedure 2 8 analysis of xanes data the p speciation by both μ xanes and bulk xanes was estimated by linear combination fitting lcf tannazi and bunker 2005 because p in soils sediments and particles is most often associated with al ca fe and organic matter adediran et al 2020 werner and prietzel 2015 12 standard p spectra fig s1 were selected from a large library of model precipitates and sorption species of p with these elements and materials gustafsson et al 2020 in the following ca phosphates will be referred to as ca p and were fitted with spectra of apatite from taiba sudan amorphous calcium phosphate and or hydroxyapatite precipitates and sorption species of p with hydrous oxides of al and fe will be denoted al p and fe p respectively the former category was fitted with spectra of aluminum phosphate p adsorbed to amorphous aluminum hydroxide gibbsite and or allophane the latter with spectra of iron phosphate p adsorbed to ferrihydrite and or goethite phosphate in organic matter will be called org p fitted with phytate inositol hexakisphosphate and or natural soil organic phosphorus from forest mor sop a detailed description of the standard compounds is available in gustafsson et al 2020 the lcf was performed on normalized spectra using the demeter athena software ravel and newville 2005 no energy shifts were permitted and the component sum was not forced to 100 a maximum of 4 of the 12 reference compounds were allowed a least squares algorithm from 2144 05 to 2184 05 ev was used the goodness of the fit was estimated by calculating the residual r factor of the fit r σi experimentali fiti 2 σi experimentali 2 where experimentali and fiti represent observed and fitted intensity at the ith energy step respectively the sums σ are over 142 data points as flattened mu e the lower the r factor the better the fit the differences between the r factor of the best ten lcf combinations was less than 10 the means and the standard deviation of the best 10 combinations were calculated and reported to resolve the s species in the leached particles internally calibrated spectra of 19 model compounds table s2 were used to fit the normalized s k edge xanes spectra using the linest function in microsoft excel almkvist et al 2010 in this a least squares method was used to optimize a fit to the experimental data using up to 15 reference spectra simultaneously this approach allows more accurate partitioning of organic sulfate esters from inorganic sulfate a differentiation that is not possible by traditional gaussian curve fitting prietzel et al 2011 the fitted s species were grouped into reduced peak energy 2475 ev intermediate 2475 2479 ev and highly oxidized s forms 2479 ev unlike in p spot wise variation in s speciation was not investigated as high quality s k edge xanes fits were obtained only after merging all spectra from all spots into one spectrum per sample 3 results 3 1 chemical and mineralogical composition of leached particles the soil texture at the study sites ranged from loamy sand to clay the organic c content of the topsoil was 1 2 at the three clayey sites and 3 in the loamy sand of mellby table 1 during the study period may 2017 to april 2019 leachates on average for each site had near neutral ph with alkalinity that ranged from 1 to 4 mmolc l 1 and electric conductivity from 20 to 58 ms m 1 table 1 the annual leaching of suspended materials 0 2 µm was several hundred kg ha 1 on an annual basis at lilla böslid and lanna exceptionally high from individual plots at krusenberg range 380 7800 kg ha 1 yr 1 potentially due to the small plot size and lateral flow from the surroundings at this site and more than an order of magnitude less at mellby toc was analyzed in unfiltered leachates and consists of both dissolved and particulate organic matter leaching of organic matter kg ha 1 yr 1 estimated as 2 toc corresponded to 4 17 of the suspended materials 0 2 µm at the clayey sites and exceeded it six fold at mellby indicating that toc was to a great extent dissolved or finer than 0 2 µm at least at the latter site at the clayey sites particle bound p 0 2 µm represented the vast majority of the leached p whereas orthophosphate was an important constituent at mellby the coarse particles were generally of clay size approximately 2 µm or less they had sio2 and al2o3 approximately at a 2 1 mass ratio table 2 which is intermediary to al rich dioctahedral clay minerals on the one hand and trioctahedral clay quartz and k feldspar on the other pca demonstrated strong spatial correlation of al and mg suggesting the presence of partly trioctahedral clay minerals figs 1 3 a with the exception of mellby where particles 0 45 µm were too scarce to permit isolation for xrd the mineralogical analysis confirmed the presence of clay minerals in the coarse particle fraction although quartz and feldspars are common in the fine size fractions of nordic clayey soils the c qf ratio indicated that clay minerals on the whole were somewhat more prevalent in several of the leachates relative to standard 2 µm soil clay fractions table 3 suggesting a preponderance of very fine clay materials in most leachates an fe2o3 component between 10 and 20 was also present oxalate was able to dissolve 10 of al and fe in the coarse fractions indicating that most of these elements existed in crystalline phases the fine particles on the other hand had less al2o3 and sio2 and more cao mgo and na2o suggesting the presence of remaining soluble salts in the isolated fractions table 2 in two fine fractions lilla böslid and mellby the oxalate extraction indicates that most fe was present in a non crystalline form table 2 the sum of major oxides had a large deficit to 100 in all fine fractions however these freeze dried powders were highly hygroscopic and despite the drying procedures it is uncertain to what extent the deficit represents organic constituents or moisture in the samples unfortunately the scarce availability of isolated fractions did not allow an independent measurement of their organic c content total p2o5 in both coarse and fine particles was fractions of a percent generally with somewhat higher concentrations in coarse than in fine particles table 2 total s concentrations are expressed as the oxide so3 in table 2 although organic forms were dominant as shown below its concentration was consistently higher in fine than coarse particles indicating a higher organic matter content in the former the oxalate extractant dissolved 30 73 of the p in coarse and fine particles and was strongly correlated with total p in both fig s2 for s the extractability was higher at approximately 80 or more table 2 3 2 overall p and s speciation bulk p k edge xanes showed that al p and org p were predominant p species in coarse as well as fine particles ca p was also prominent in most isolated materials table 4 and fig s3 fe p on the other hand was the least abundant generally accounting for less than 10 of the p spot wise µ xanes obtained from the coarse particles 0 45 µm which constituted the majority of leached particles from most sites shed some more light on this result across all the spots and sites al p and ca p were more or less ubiquitous at concentration ranges of 20 50 and 10 30 respectively figs 1 3b org p was common while also showing high variability within several of the samples fe p overall appeared as the least abundant p species in the coarse particles as it was detected only in certain areas of the samples from krusenberg and lilla böslid the samples of fine particles 0 45 µm were generally richer in org p and the content of fe p reached high levels in certain areas according to the lcf figs 4 6 b and c average spot wise s k edge µ xanes showed that organic s accounted for 75 97 of the total s in the coarse particles table 5 with the thiol and sulfate ester groups being the predominant portion of organic s figs 1c 2c and 3c the proportion of reduced s species was quite variable with a high percentage in the coarse fraction of lilla böslid table 5 similarly to the coarse fraction organic s species accounted for 89 of the total s in the fine particles at krusenberg table 5 with thiols and sulfate ester groups being the dominant form of organic s accounting for 75 of the total s fig 4c similar results were obtained for the other two sites with organic s accounting for 97 and 95 of the total s in lanna and mellby respectively table 5 while the reduced thiol groups constituted the main portion 77 of organic s in lanna a high proportion 27 of total s in the particles at mellby was in the form of sulfonate a result that is unique to mellby figs 5c and 6c although high quality xanes spectra and fits were obtained for all samples there was a slight miss fit of the s standards to the s k edge xanes in mellby especially at the thiol and sulfoxide xanes region 2471 2477 ev this may be due to the presence of other thiol and sulfoxide compounds than the l methionine l cysteine tiosalicylic acid and sodium dimethyl sulfoxide used to model the region nevertheless there are clear indications of the presence of thiol and sulfoxide functional groups in the s k edge xanes spectra from mellby 3 3 spatial relationships in coarse particles 0 45 μm of the most abundant elements mg al si k ca and fe considerable variability in intensity occurred over distances smaller than the resolution of the beam 1 0 µm however aggregation of particles did occur with areas of different intensity from the different elements figs s4a s5a s6a pca was applied on deconvoluted element intensities whereas the first principal component pc1 mainly expressed variations in sample thickness overall intensity across the mapped area the second and higher pcs captured differences in the spatial distribution of different elements in all coarse samples krusenberg lanna lilla böslid the pca demonstrated spatial correlation between p and s through pc1 pc3 figs 1a 2a and 3a also the rgb correlator identified hot spots with co localization of p and s yellow in figs s4b s5b s6b these spots showed a high proportion of organic p according to µ xanes figs 1 3b suggesting that p in organic matter was associated with discrete aggregates with a high content also of s for fe p µ xanes indicated its presence in areas that were high in fe in the coarse samples from krusenberg figs 1b and s4 and lilla böslid figs 2b and s5 the s in its turn ranged from reduced forms e g thiol to intermediately oxidized sulfoxide and dimethylsulfite and highly oxidized sulfonate and sulfate groups figs 1c 2c and 3c most importantly the co occurrence of org p with the mainly organic s species strengthened the evidence of p associated with organic matter leaching from the soils 3 4 spatial relationships in fine particles 0 45 µm similarly to the coarse faction aggregation occurred with areas of different intensity from the different elements figs s7a s8a s9a and pca indicated that p was closely related to s figs 4a 5a and 6a spot wise p k edge xanes analysis in fine particles leached from krusenberg fig 4b and mellby fig 6b showed little spatial variation in p speciation in both samples org p was important constituting up to 74 of the p at the former site organic p was prominent also in the heterogeneous sample from lanna figs 5b spots high in org p were found at the aggregate to be high also in s spot 2 in fig 5b as well as in the matrix beside it spot 3 in fig 5b similarly to the coarse particles fe p was found sporadically with high proportions according to lcf in some spots in samples from lanna and mellby while absent at others ca p forms were ubiquitous in the sample from krusenberg present in some spots of the lanna sample and absent in mellby 4 discussion leaching of colloidal soil materials involves at least partial dispersion of soil aggregates the latter consist of various proportions of clay minerals oxides and organic matter totsche et al 2018 where surface complexes or coprecipitation form intimate associations of organic and mineral materials kleber et al 2015 the stability of these associations may be disrupted by processes affecting either of the solid phases involved our combination of bulk chemistry quantification mineralogical analysis multi elemental μ xrf imaging and p and s k edge xanes on bulk and spatially resolved samples revealed that p speciation was potentially influenced by both phyllosilicate clays non crystalline al and fe oxides and organic matter although consistent with previous analyses of particles isolated from soils and natural waters gottselig et al 2017b jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2014 missong et al 2018 our work demonstrates a large diversity in the speciation of p and s at the micron scale even in leachates from a single site across sites and fractions the two most common p forms were org p and al p table 4 fig s12a organic p within particulate organic matter in surface waters is composed of diverse molecular forms including glycerol phosphate guanosine monophosphate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate cheesman et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 the presence of organic s species which ranged from reduced s species like thiols and sulfoxides to fully oxidized sulfate esters and minor amounts of inorganic sulfate table 5 and often was co localized with the p further supports the leaching of organic p bearing components probably derived from soil organic matter in the top soil because phosphate is well known to adsorb to hydrous fe and al oxides kingston et al 1972 it is not surprising that an appreciable amount of particulate p was found to be adsorbed to such surfaces according to the lcf in table 6 the p binding conditions on non crystalline al and fe bearing phases in leached particles are explored site and fraction percentages of the average al p and fe p table 4 combined with the total p2o5 table 2 suggest that per kg of leached particles between 0 67 and 15 mmol p was associated with al and up to 5 4 mmol p with fe furthermore table 2 suggests that oxalate extractable al and fe represented 0 052 11 g al2o3 and 0 20 14 g fe2o3 per kg table 6 shows that fe p relative to oxalate extractable fe2o3 generally represented a ratio not exceeding the sorption capacity of ferrihydrite of approximately 1000 mmol p kg 1 fe2o3 hesterberg 2010 in most cases also al p relative to oxalate extractable al2o3 was within the binding capacity of amorphous al oh 3 2500 mmol p kg 1 al2o3 khare et al 2005 while apparently exceeding it in one or two of the fine fractions phyllosilicates on the other hand were dominated by 2 1 minerals and constituted roughly half the mineral mass of leached coarse particles according to c qf ratios around 2 table 3 with 8 13 mmol kg 1 overall p sorption capacity of 2 1 minerals violante and pigna 2002 their contribution of p sorption sites could be of the order of 5 mmol kg 1 in the coarse particles this is somewhat less than the al p and fe p of the coarse fraction although a significant part of it table 6 hence sorption sites in non crystalline oxides of al and fe in most samples could explain all the al p and fe p present in the leachates although phyllosilicates cannot be ruled out as sorbents for part of these species interactions between organic matter p and al are not fully deciphered by k edge xanes aluminum ions complex bound to soil organic matter can in its turn adsorb phosphate in a ternary complex gerke 2010 libecki and dziejowski 2008 at p al ratios higher than those characteristic of p sorbed at al hydrous oxide surfaces gerke and hermann 1992 this is further suggested by hot spots of organic particulate s co localized with spots with al p similar observations were made in several studies of particulate p from top forest soils and in stream waters gottselig et al 2014 gottselig et al 2017b missong et al 2018 furthermore phytate sorbed to an al hydrous oxide surface may contribute to the apparent pools of both pure organic p and inorganic p bound to the same mineral surface gustafsson et al 2020 if some of the apparent organic p was associated with al hydrous oxide surfaces the latter might be occupied by p to a larger extent than suggested in table 6 the pool of ca p is chemically less ambiguous although the ability of ca2 to cement organic matter and inorganic minerals and promote the formation of macroaggregates has been well described missong et al 2018 whittinghill and hobbie 2012 ca2 has been reported not to be capable of acting as the metal bridge for the binding of phosphate to organic e g humic surfaces gerke and hermann 1992 on average less than 10 of total p was associated to fe in all particles and across all sites table 4 this is in contrast to previous results of p speciation in colloids and nanoparticles isolated by water dispersion from top soils and in surface waters gottselig et al 2017b jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2014 missong et al 2018 where fe oxides are known for effective adsorption of phosphate however abiotic or bacteria driven fe reduction during the oxidation of organic matter is documented as a mechanism of p release in oxygen depleted environments henderson et al 2012 murray and hesterberg 2006 warrinnier et al 2020 al oxides on the other hand are stable under reducing conditions darke and walbridge 2000 additionally a laboratory study indicated that phosphate released during reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite was re adsorbed by al murray and hesterberg 2006 overall the sulfur in the present study was more reduced than in the study of boye et al 2011 some samples were comparable to those found under waterlogged conditions by prietzel et al 2009a it may be speculated that fluctuations in redox potential as suspended particles drain through the soil profile kept fe iii bearing colloids as well as p species associated with ferric oxide phases at a low level al p and fe p in these soils was largely formed by adsorption of p by non crystalline minerals of al and fe e g allophane and ferrihydrite which are ubiquitous products of weathering in soils eriksson et al 2016 the high contents of p associated with organic materials and non crystalline minerals of al and fe in the suspended particles of the leachates indicates that studies aiming to characterize these phases and their associations with the clay minerals that may form the bulk of leached particles should be prioritized organic s and p and p bound by amorphous al are highly susceptible to mineralization which would eventually lead to the release of readily bioavailable nutrients in the receiving water bodies the high abundance of these species in the studied particles makes the mobilization of suspended particles from agricultural land a key driver of eutrophication our report of multiple s and p species in the leached particles is therefore of strategic importance in agricultural watershed management especially in devising technologies to mitigate colloidal driven eutrophication 5 conclusions we combined the use of multiple x ray spectroscopic methodologies to reveal the nature of micro and nano sized particles in drain water from four agricultural soils in sweden crystalline mineral phases like illite and expandable phyllosilicates as well as primary minerals like quartz and feldspars were major components of the mobilized particles nonetheless non crystalline oxalate extractable al and fe generally could account for p associated with oxide surfaces of these elements according to xanes however the somewhat subordinate role of p associated with fe challenges the common view of fe as a major carrier for p leaching from the soil and indicates a need to study the effects of redox reactions in the soil prior to the leaching on the export of other p species from the soil profile organic p was important in all samples and associations of p with clusters of organic s indicated the presence of p in micro aggregates with organic matter the significance of al and fe oxides in binding p indicates a need to intensify research into processes leading to destabilization of their aggregates with

17338,colloids and nanoparticles leached from agricultural land are major carriers of potentially bioavailable nutrients with high mobility in the environment despite significant research efforts accurate knowledge of macronutrients in colloids and nanoparticles is limited we used multi elemental synchrotron x ray fluorescence xrf microscopy with multivariate spatial analysis and x ray atomic absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy at the p and s k edges to study the speciation of p and s in two fractions of leached particles 0 45 and 0 45 µm respectively collected from four tile drained agricultural sites in sweden p k edge xanes showed that organic p followed by p adsorbed to surfaces of aluminum bearing particles were the most common forms of leached p iron bound p fe p forms were generally less abundant 0 30 of the total p s k edge xanes showed that s was predominantly organic and a relatively high abundance of reduced s species suggests that redox conditions were adverse to the persistence of p bound to fe bearing colloids in the leachates acid ammonium oxalate extractions suggested that p associated with al and fe al p and fe p in most cases could be explained by the adsorption capacity of non crystalline oxalate extractable oxides of al and fe these results improve our understanding of particulate p and s speciation in the vadose zone and helps in developing effective technologies for mitigating colloidal driven eutrophication of water bodies near agricultural land graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leachates colloids nanoparticles phosphorus sulfur speciation 1 introduction diffuse loss of macronutrients from agricultural land remains one of the main drivers of eutrophication leading to harmful algae bloom deterioration of drinking water quality and loss of biodiversity in affected aquatic systems zou et al 2020 the eutrophication of surface and subsurface waters depends on nutrient concentration as well as molecular speciation liu et al 2014 read et al 2014 it has been shown that most elements mobilized from soils are associated with colloidal and nanoparticulate phases gottselig et al 2017a gottselig et al 2014 hill and aplin 2001 jarvie et al 2012 knowledge of their speciation and potential bioavailability is critical in order to reduce the loss of nutrients from agricultural lands and to predict environmental risks colloids and nanoparticles are small enough to withstand gravitational settling they consist of mineral particles detrital organic matter and living bacterial cells gustafsson and gschwend 1997 due to their large specific surface area and high reactivity clay minerals including fe al hydroxides 2 μm and particulate organic matter are considered as the most mobile components of the soil system and as important vehicles of nutrient transport from the soil profile das et al 2019 regelink et al 2013 natural colloids like iron fe and aluminum al oxides silica and organic molecules in natural aquatic systems have been linked to weathering and mineralization processes in the soil holtzman and lehman 1998 tsao et al 2011 however the knowledge of the nature and properties of macronutrients in colloids and nanoparticles mobilized from agricultural land is limited one of the reasons for this is the adherence to operational definitions of dissolved compounds based solely on filtration through a filter e g of 0 45 µm pore size hall et al 1996 heathwaite et al 2005 however the filtrate is likely to include fine nanoparticles as well as dissolved species gimbert et al 2007 surface runoff subsurface lateral flow and vertical percolation leaching are the major hydrological pathways through which soil nutrients are transported in many agricultural systems especially under high intensity rainfall events surface runoff is the main route of nutrient loss from the soil ma et al 2016 sharpley et al 1993 however transport by rapid vertical flow in macropores can be the predominant pathway in flat areas and this is considered as the main pathway of nutrient loss in central sweden andersson et al 2013 ulén and snäll 2007 of all nutrients the loss of phosphorus p from arable land is of strategic importance to the swedish environment especially the eutrophication of the baltic sea one of the largest brackish water areas in the world eriksson et al 2013 murray et al 2019 a similar scenario of p driven eutrophication is applicable in other parts of europe ulén et al 2007 and north america council 2011 kleinman et al 2019 moreover successive p inputs over time have resulted in a build up of p in many soils globally liu et al 2015 this accumulated legacy p is characterized by slow remobilization in agricultural soils acting as a continuous source of p pollution in aquatic environments bergström et al 2015 sharpley et al 2013 according to prior studies colloidal and nanoparticulate p may constitute up to 80 of total p in leachates from agricultural land gottselig et al 2014 liu et al 2014 sharma et al 2017 elucidating the chemical speciation of this p is critical to unravel the processes that govern particulate p retention and desorption in soils and to predict particulate p reactivity in the receiving environments for example the p that exists as iron phosphate or is bound to the surfaces of iron bearing minerals like ferrihydrite or goethite would be more sensitive to redox conditions henderson et al 2012 murray and hesterberg 2006 on the other hand the p that exists as aluminum phosphate or is bound to the surfaces of aluminum oxide hydroxide particles as well as p that exists as hydroxyapatite or other calcium phosphates would be more vulnerable to changes in ph conditions guidry and mackenzie 2003 organic p on the other hand would be susceptible to microbial mineralization and biotransformation prentice et al 2019 there have been few attempts at deciphering the speciation of p in suspended particles leached from arable soils under field conditions a study on colloids that were artificially detached from the soils by mechanical dispersion showed colloidal p to be mainly inorganic with p associated with fe and al minerals as the main species 70 83 followed by hydroxyapatite 17 20 liu et al 2014 the capacity of mineral surfaces to adsorb phosphate varies greatly depending on ph and the crystallinity of the oxide phase the absence of a sharp boundary between surface adsorption and formation of a separate phosphate phase through precipitation further complicates the assessment of maximum adsorption capacity hesterberg 2010 van riemsdijk and lyklema 1980 notwithstanding the maximum sorption is reported to be modest on phyllosilicate clays with values ranging from 8 to 13 mmol kg 1 for 2 1 minerals violante and pigna 2002 and up to 42 in 1 1 minerals gray wannell et al 2020 it is roughly one or two orders of magnitude greater in allophane crystalline gibbsite and goethite khare et al 2005 violante and pigna 2002 and approximately 1700 and 3300 mmol kg 1 in ferrihydrite and amorphous al oh 3 respectively hesterberg 2010 khare et al 2005 sulfur s is an essential macronutrient used by plants in amounts similar to those of p kopriva et al 2019 the majority of s transported to aquatic environments comes from soils and wetlands and the s is mostly released in organic forms fakhraee et al 2017 organic s in soils exists in reduced species sulfides thiols intermediately oxidized species sulfoxides sulfones and sulfonates and fully oxidized s in sulfate esters in a study of s in two swedish agricultural soils sulfate esters were the single most abundant category representing 40 64 of the s whereas inorganic sulfate was less than 2 boye et al 2011 however the redox state of organic s may depend on the redox conditions of the soil with more abundant reduced species and less intermediate and oxidized species in waterlogged soils and vice versa prietzel et al 2009b most importantly increases in p eutrophication have been linked to s biotransformation and mineralization during the breakdown of organic matter lamers et al 2002 van diggelen et al 2014 therefore the speciation of s in colloids leached from the soil carries information on processes relevant for both s itself and for p to our knowledge there is no study that has examined the molecular speciation of p and s simultaneously in colloids and nanoparticles leached from agricultural land under natural conditions the aim of this study was to reveal the molecular speciation of these elements in two fractions of naturally leached particles 0 45 and 0 45 µm respectively by using synchrotron x ray fluorescence microscopy and x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy 2 methodology 2 1 study sites leachates from tile drained fields at four agricultural sites situated in the drainage basin of the north sea the baltic sea and vänern the largest lake in the european union were selected for this study the sites include three clayey soils krusenberg 59 14 n 17 41 e lilla böslid 56 35 n 12 56 e and lanna 58 21 n 13 07 e as well as a sandy soil mellby 56 29 n 12 59 e the trials are equipped with plots that are individually tile drained at 0 9 1 0 m depth and have an area of 42 m2 at krusenberg 320 1700 m2 at the other sites flow proportional bulk samples are collected in a drain station over 14 consecutive days from each plot the trials receive 8 20 kg ha 1 of p annually supplied as mineral fertilizer at lanna and lilla böslid and cattle and pig slurry at krusenberg and mellby respectively a detailed description of the sites is presented in the supplementary material s1 2 2 chemical analyses bulk leachates were analyzed for ph alkalinity and electric conductivity ec ionic strength was calculated from the latter with the marion babcock equation total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen were measured in unfiltered samples by combustion and catalytic oxidation respectively shimadzu toc vcph suspended materials were collected on a 0 2 µm membrane filter and weighed three operational p fractions were analyzed 1 total p by flow analysis of molybdate reactive phosphate technicon autoanalyzer 3 after oxidation of non filtered samples with peroxodisulfate iso 6878 2004 2 total p 0 2 µm after filtration using the same digestion and analysis as for the total p 3 molybdate reactive ortho phosphate iso 15923 1 2013 2013 after filtration 0 2 µm the difference 1 2 will be referred to as particulate p 0 2 µm 2 3 is non orthophosphate p 0 2 µm 2 3 isolation of leached particles leachate particles were isolated in two steps first particles 0 45 µm were collected on a 0 45 µm durapore membrane filter second particles in leachates from the first step were collected on a 10 kda ultracel membrane filter to yield a size range from 10 kda to 0 45 µm these fractions are henceforth referred to as coarse particles 0 45 µm and fine particles 0 45 µm respectively the isolated particles were rinsed twice with milli q water and freeze dried for bulk chemical analysis or stored wet at 5 c until further analysis as specified in table s1 the freeze dried particles were analyzed for bulk chemistry after digestion in a mixture of hno3 hcl and hf according to sfs en13656 2002 non crystalline and organically bound metals were extracted with 0 2 m ammonium oxalate at ph 3 in darkness jiang et al 2015 elements in bulk digests and oxalate extracts were analyzed by icp sfms church et al 2017 oxalate extractable al si fe p and s were divided by the respective bulk concentration to yield a weight percent representing the extractability in oxalate 2 4 mineralogical analysis by x ray diffraction xrd coarse particles in one leachate from each plot were isolated on a 0 45 µm silver filter membrane millipore ag4502550 and scanned using copper kα radiation from 3 to 45 2θ in i air dried state ii after glycolation and iii after heating to 300 c for one hour clay minerals were semi quantified using a reference intensity ratio factor approach hillier 2003 a c qf ratio crudely estimating the relative proportions of phyllosilicates to non clay minerals the latter principally consisting of quartz and feldspars was also calculated from the peak heights of the phyllosilicate peak near 5 å and the quartz k feldspar doublet at about 4 26 å in the diffractogram obtained after heating the 5 å peak was chosen because of its proximity to the 4 26 å doublet which means any sample related errors will be near constant for the two peaks and because the 5 å peak in the heated sample as 002 of the peak near 10 å little intensity remained in the 10 å range following heating represents most of the clay minerals present 2 5 bulk p k edge

2020 the beam size was 18 2 mm and the beam flux was 2 1011 photons s 1 100 ma 1 the particles were homogenized and mounted on p free kapton tape to minimize x ray absorption by air the sample compartment was filled with helium gas spectra of samples and reference p compounds were recorded over 2100 2320 ev the step size was 2 ev at 2100 2132 ev 1 ev at 2132 2144 ev 0 2 ev at 2144 2153 ev 0

for micro spectroscopy with submicron resolution in the 2 to 9 5 kev energy range allowing the mapping and xanes analysis of both low and high energy elements salomé et al 2013 samples table s1 were first mixed with a vortex mixer deposited on ultralene thin film and allowed to dry at 25 οc the detectors on the beamline includes a si3n4 diode for i0 and a silicon drift detector sgs sensortech 80 mm2 active area for the emitted x ray fluorescence focusing of the x ray beam 0 5 1 2 µm was performed by a kirkpatrick baez mirrors system a double beam set up was used by selecting both the first and the third harmonic in order to allow the simultaneous mapping of low and high z elements the photon flux was 1 9739 109 photons s 1 at 2 5 kev high resolution µ xrf images of elements were acquired with a dwell time of 100 ms using a step size of 1 0 1 0 µm2 for the coarse particles and 0 5 0 5 µm2 for the fine particles spot wise µ xanes of p and s was performed at spots with varying concentration according to the elemental imaging p and s k edge μ xanes spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode by single point acquisition over 2 10 2 22 and 2 45 2 55 kev energy ranges for p and s respectively with 0 2 ev steps using the moving si 111 monochromator of id21 for both measurements the calibration of the monochromator energy was done using hydroxyapatite for p and l cysteine for s at every selected spot 8 to 12 μ xanes scans were collected collected μ xanes spectra were examined for possible beam damage and up to 6 high quality spectra were selected and merged to represent a spot 2 7 analysis of x ray fluorescence data the μ xrf spectra were dead time corrected and normalized to incoming beam intensities before deconvolution high resolution elemental images were obtained after fitting each pixel spectrum using the pymca x ray fluorescence toolkit solé et al 2007 the spatial correlation of p with relevant elements s al ca and fe is shown using 3 colour rgb red green blue correlator principal component analysis pca of deconvoluted elemental intensities of mg al si p s k ca and fe was performed using jmp pro 14 mean centering of each element and scaling to unit standard deviation was part of the procedure 2 8 analysis of xanes data the p speciation by both μ xanes and bulk xanes was estimated by linear combination fitting lcf tannazi and bunker 2005 because p in soils sediments and particles is most often associated with al ca fe and organic matter adediran et al 2020 werner and prietzel 2015 12 standard p spectra fig s1 were selected from a large library of model precipitates and sorption species of p with these elements and materials gustafsson et al 2020 in the following ca phosphates will be referred to as ca p and were fitted with spectra of apatite from taiba sudan amorphous calcium phosphate and or hydroxyapatite precipitates and sorption species of p with hydrous oxides of al and fe will be denoted al p and fe p respectively the former category was fitted with spectra of aluminum phosphate p adsorbed to amorphous aluminum hydroxide gibbsite and or allophane the latter with spectra of iron phosphate p adsorbed to ferrihydrite and or goethite phosphate in organic matter will be called org p fitted with phytate inositol hexakisphosphate and or natural soil organic phosphorus from forest mor sop a detailed description of the standard compounds is available in gustafsson et al 2020 the lcf was performed on normalized spectra using the demeter athena software ravel and newville 2005 no energy shifts were permitted and the component sum was not forced to 100 a maximum of 4 of the 12 reference compounds were allowed a least squares algorithm from 2144 05 to 2184 05 ev was used the goodness of the fit was estimated by calculating the residual r factor of the fit r σi experimentali fiti 2 σi experimentali 2 where experimentali and fiti represent observed and fitted intensity at the ith energy step respectively the sums σ are over 142 data points as flattened mu e the lower the r factor the better the fit the differences between the r factor of the best ten lcf combinations was less than 10 the means and the standard deviation of the best 10 combinations were calculated and reported to resolve the s species in the leached particles internally calibrated spectra of 19 model compounds table s2 were used to fit the normalized s k edge xanes spectra using the linest function in microsoft excel almkvist et al 2010 in this a least squares method was used to optimize a fit to the experimental data using up to 15 reference spectra simultaneously this approach allows more accurate partitioning of organic sulfate esters from inorganic sulfate a differentiation that is not possible by traditional gaussian curve fitting prietzel et al 2011 the fitted s species were grouped into reduced peak energy 2475 ev intermediate 2475 2479 ev and highly oxidized s forms 2479 ev unlike in p spot wise variation in s speciation was not investigated as high quality s k edge xanes fits were obtained only after merging all spectra from all spots into one spectrum per sample 3 results 3 1 chemical and mineralogical composition of leached particles the soil texture at the study sites ranged from loamy sand to clay the organic c content of the topsoil was 1 2 at the three clayey sites and 3 in the loamy sand of mellby table 1 during the study period may 2017 to april 2019 leachates on average for each site had near neutral ph with alkalinity that ranged from 1 to 4 mmolc l 1 and electric conductivity from 20 to 58 ms m 1 table 1 the annual leaching of suspended materials 0 2 µm was several hundred kg ha 1 on an annual basis at lilla böslid and lanna exceptionally high from individual plots at krusenberg range 380 7800 kg ha 1 yr 1 potentially due to the small plot size and lateral flow from the surroundings at this site and more than an order of magnitude less at mellby toc was analyzed in unfiltered leachates and consists of both dissolved and particulate organic matter leaching of organic matter kg ha 1 yr 1 estimated as 2 toc corresponded to 4 17 of the suspended materials 0 2 µm at the clayey sites and exceeded it six fold at mellby indicating that toc was to a great extent dissolved or finer than 0 2 µm at least at the latter site at the clayey sites particle bound p 0 2 µm represented the vast majority of the leached p whereas orthophosphate was an important constituent at mellby the coarse particles were generally of clay size approximately 2 µm or less they had sio2 and al2o3 approximately at a 2 1 mass ratio table 2 which is intermediary to al rich dioctahedral clay minerals on the one hand and trioctahedral clay quartz and k feldspar on the other pca demonstrated strong spatial correlation of al and mg suggesting the presence of partly trioctahedral clay minerals figs 1 3 a with the exception of mellby where particles 0 45 µm were too scarce to permit isolation for xrd the mineralogical analysis confirmed the presence of clay minerals in the coarse particle fraction although quartz and feldspars are common in the fine size fractions of nordic clayey soils the c qf ratio indicated that clay minerals on the whole were somewhat more prevalent in several of the leachates relative to standard 2 µm soil clay fractions table 3 suggesting a preponderance of very fine clay materials in most leachates an fe2o3 component between 10 and 20 was also present oxalate was able to dissolve 10 of al and fe in the coarse fractions indicating that most of these elements existed in crystalline phases the fine particles on the other hand had less al2o3 and sio2 and more cao mgo and na2o suggesting the presence of remaining soluble salts in the isolated fractions table 2 in two fine fractions lilla böslid and mellby the oxalate extraction indicates that most fe was present in a non crystalline form table 2 the sum of major oxides had a large deficit to 100 in all fine fractions however these freeze dried powders were highly hygroscopic and despite the drying procedures it is uncertain to what extent the deficit represents organic constituents or moisture in the samples unfortunately the scarce availability of isolated fractions did not allow an independent measurement of their organic c content total p2o5 in both coarse and fine particles was fractions of a percent generally with somewhat higher concentrations in coarse than in fine particles table 2 total s concentrations are expressed as the oxide so3 in table 2 although organic forms were dominant as shown below its concentration was consistently higher in fine than coarse particles indicating a higher organic matter content in the former the oxalate extractant dissolved 30 73 of the p in coarse and fine particles and was strongly correlated with total p in both fig s2 for s the extractability was higher at approximately 80 or more table 2 3 2 overall p and s speciation bulk p k edge xanes showed that al p and org p were predominant p species in coarse as well as fine particles ca p was also prominent in most isolated materials table 4 and fig s3 fe p on the other hand was the least abundant generally accounting for less than 10 of the p spot wise µ xanes obtained from the coarse particles 0 45 µm which constituted the majority of leached particles from most sites shed some more light on this result across all the spots and sites al p and ca p were more or less ubiquitous at concentration ranges of 20 50 and 10 30 respectively figs 1 3b org p was common while also showing high variability within several of the samples fe p overall appeared as the least abundant p species in the coarse particles as it was detected only in certain areas of the samples from krusenberg and lilla böslid the samples of fine particles 0 45 µm were generally richer in org p and the content of fe p reached high levels in certain areas according to the lcf figs 4 6 b and c average spot wise s k edge µ xanes showed that organic s accounted for 75 97 of the total s in the coarse particles table 5 with the thiol and sulfate ester groups being the predominant portion of organic s figs 1c 2c and 3c the proportion of reduced s species was quite variable with a high percentage in the coarse fraction of lilla böslid table 5 similarly to the coarse fraction organic s species accounted for 89 of the total s in the fine particles at krusenberg table 5 with thiols and sulfate ester groups being the dominant form of organic s accounting for 75 of the total s fig 4c similar results were obtained for the other two sites with organic s accounting for 97 and 95 of the total s in lanna and mellby respectively table 5 while the reduced thiol groups constituted the main portion 77 of organic s in lanna a high proportion 27 of total s in the particles at mellby was in the form of sulfonate a result that is unique to mellby figs 5c and 6c although high quality xanes spectra and fits were obtained for all samples there was a slight miss fit of the s standards to the s k edge xanes in mellby especially at the thiol and sulfoxide xanes region 2471 2477 ev this may be due to the presence of other thiol and sulfoxide compounds than the l methionine l cysteine tiosalicylic acid and sodium dimethyl sulfoxide used to model the region nevertheless there are clear indications of the presence of thiol and sulfoxide functional groups in the s k edge xanes spectra from mellby 3 3 spatial relationships in coarse particles 0 45 μm of the most abundant elements mg al si k ca and fe considerable variability in intensity occurred over distances smaller than the resolution of the beam 1 0 µm however aggregation of particles did occur with areas of different intensity from the different elements figs s4a s5a s6a pca was applied on deconvoluted element intensities whereas the first principal component pc1 mainly expressed variations in sample thickness overall intensity across the mapped area the second and higher pcs captured differences in the spatial distribution of different elements in all coarse samples krusenberg lanna lilla böslid the pca demonstrated spatial correlation between p and s through pc1 pc3 figs 1a 2a and 3a also the rgb correlator identified hot spots with co localization of p and s yellow in figs s4b s5b s6b these spots showed a high proportion of organic p according to µ xanes figs 1 3b suggesting that p in organic matter was associated with discrete aggregates with a high content also of s for fe p µ xanes indicated its presence in areas that were high in fe in the coarse samples from krusenberg figs 1b and s4 and lilla böslid figs 2b and s5 the s in its turn ranged from reduced forms e g thiol to intermediately oxidized sulfoxide and dimethylsulfite and highly oxidized sulfonate and sulfate groups figs 1c 2c and 3c most importantly the co occurrence of org p with the mainly organic s species strengthened the evidence of p associated with organic matter leaching from the soils 3 4 spatial relationships in fine particles 0 45 µm similarly to the coarse faction aggregation occurred with areas of different intensity from the different elements figs s7a s8a s9a and pca indicated that p was closely related to s figs 4a 5a and 6a spot wise p k edge xanes analysis in fine particles leached from krusenberg fig 4b and mellby fig 6b showed little spatial variation in p speciation in both samples org p was important constituting up to 74 of the p at the former site organic p was prominent also in the heterogeneous sample from lanna figs 5b spots high in org p were found at the aggregate to be high also in s spot 2 in fig 5b as well as in the matrix beside it spot 3 in fig 5b similarly to the coarse particles fe p was found sporadically with high proportions according to lcf in some spots in samples from lanna and mellby while absent at others ca p forms were ubiquitous in the sample from krusenberg present in some spots of the lanna sample and absent in mellby 4 discussion leaching of colloidal soil materials involves at least partial dispersion of soil aggregates the latter consist of various proportions of clay minerals oxides and organic matter totsche et al 2018 where surface complexes or coprecipitation form intimate associations of organic and mineral materials kleber et al 2015 the stability of these associations may be disrupted by processes affecting either of the solid phases involved our combination of bulk chemistry quantification mineralogical analysis multi elemental μ xrf imaging and p and s k edge xanes on bulk and spatially resolved samples revealed that p speciation was potentially influenced by both phyllosilicate clays non crystalline al and fe oxides and organic matter although consistent with previous analyses of particles isolated from soils and natural waters gottselig et al 2017b jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2014 missong et al 2018 our work demonstrates a large diversity in the speciation of p and s at the micron scale even in leachates from a single site across sites and fractions the two most common p forms were org p and al p table 4 fig s12a organic p within particulate organic matter in surface waters is composed of diverse molecular forms including glycerol phosphate guanosine monophosphate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate cheesman et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 the presence of organic s species which ranged from reduced s species like thiols and sulfoxides to fully oxidized sulfate esters and minor amounts of inorganic sulfate table 5 and often was co localized with the p further supports the leaching of organic p bearing components probably derived from soil organic matter in the top soil because phosphate is well known to adsorb to hydrous fe and al oxides kingston et al 1972 it is not surprising that an appreciable amount of particulate p was found to be adsorbed to such surfaces according to the lcf in table 6 the p binding conditions on non crystalline al and fe bearing phases in leached particles are explored site and fraction percentages of the average al p and fe p table 4 combined with the total p2o5 table 2 suggest that per kg of leached particles between 0 67 and 15 mmol p was associated with al and up to 5 4 mmol p with fe furthermore table 2 suggests that oxalate extractable al and fe represented 0 052 11 g al2o3 and 0 20 14 g fe2o3 per kg table 6 shows that fe p relative to oxalate extractable fe2o3 generally represented a ratio not exceeding the sorption capacity of ferrihydrite of approximately 1000 mmol p kg 1 fe2o3 hesterberg 2010 in most cases also al p relative to oxalate extractable al2o3 was within the binding capacity of amorphous al oh 3 2500 mmol p kg 1 al2o3 khare et al 2005 while apparently exceeding it in one or two of the fine fractions phyllosilicates on the other hand were dominated by 2 1 minerals and constituted roughly half the mineral mass of leached coarse particles according to c qf ratios around 2 table 3 with 8 13 mmol kg 1 overall p sorption capacity of 2 1 minerals violante and pigna 2002 their contribution of p sorption sites could be of the order of 5 mmol kg 1 in the coarse particles this is somewhat less than the al p and fe p of the coarse fraction although a significant part of it table 6 hence sorption sites in non crystalline oxides of al and fe in most samples could explain all the al p and fe p present in the leachates although phyllosilicates cannot be ruled out as sorbents for part of these species interactions between organic matter p and al are not fully deciphered by k edge xanes aluminum ions complex bound to soil organic matter can in its turn adsorb phosphate in a ternary complex gerke 2010 libecki and dziejowski 2008 at p al ratios higher than those characteristic of p sorbed at al hydrous oxide surfaces gerke and hermann 1992 this is further suggested by hot spots of organic particulate s co localized with spots with al p similar observations were made in several studies of particulate p from top forest soils and in stream waters gottselig et al 2014 gottselig et al 2017b missong et al 2018 furthermore phytate sorbed to an al hydrous oxide surface may contribute to the apparent pools of both pure organic p and inorganic p bound to the same mineral surface gustafsson et al 2020 if some of the apparent organic p was associated with al hydrous oxide surfaces the latter might be occupied by p to a larger extent than suggested in table 6 the pool of ca p is chemically less ambiguous although the ability of ca2 to cement organic matter and inorganic minerals and promote the formation of macroaggregates has been well described missong et al 2018 whittinghill and hobbie 2012 ca2 has been reported not to be capable of acting as the metal bridge for the binding of phosphate to organic e g humic surfaces gerke and hermann 1992 on average less than 10 of total p was associated to fe in all particles and across all sites table 4 this is in contrast to previous results of p speciation in colloids and nanoparticles isolated by water dispersion from top soils and in surface waters gottselig et al 2017b jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2014 missong et al 2018 where fe oxides are known for effective adsorption of phosphate however abiotic or bacteria driven fe reduction during the oxidation of organic matter is documented as a mechanism of p release in oxygen depleted environments henderson et al 2012 murray and hesterberg 2006 warrinnier et al 2020 al oxides on the other hand are stable under reducing conditions darke and walbridge 2000 additionally a laboratory study indicated that phosphate released during reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite was re adsorbed by al murray and hesterberg 2006 overall the sulfur in the present study was more reduced than in the study of boye et al 2011 some samples were comparable to those found under waterlogged conditions by prietzel et al 2009a it may be speculated that fluctuations in redox potential as suspended particles drain through the soil profile kept fe iii bearing colloids as well as p species associated with ferric oxide phases at a low level al p and fe p in these soils was largely formed by adsorption of p by non crystalline minerals of al and fe e g allophane and ferrihydrite which are ubiquitous products of weathering in soils eriksson et al 2016 the high contents of p associated with organic materials and non crystalline minerals of al and fe in the suspended particles of the leachates indicates that studies aiming to characterize these phases and their associations with the clay minerals that may form the bulk of leached particles should be prioritized organic s and p and p bound by amorphous al are highly susceptible to mineralization which would eventually lead to the release of readily bioavailable nutrients in the receiving water bodies the high abundance of these species in the studied particles makes the mobilization of suspended particles from agricultural land a key driver of eutrophication our report of multiple s and p species in the leached particles is therefore of strategic importance in agricultural watershed management especially in devising technologies to mitigate colloidal driven eutrophication 5 conclusions we combined the use of multiple x ray spectroscopic methodologies to reveal the nature of micro and nano sized particles in drain water from four agricultural soils in sweden crystalline mineral phases like illite and expandable phyllosilicates as well as primary minerals like quartz and feldspars were major components of the mobilized particles nonetheless non crystalline oxalate extractable al and fe generally could account for p associated with oxide surfaces of these elements according to xanes however the somewhat subordinate role of p associated with fe challenges the common view of fe as a major carrier for p leaching from the soil and indicates a need to study the effects of redox reactions in the soil prior to the leaching on the export of other p species from the soil profile organic p was important in all samples and associations of p with clusters of organic s indicated the presence of p in micro aggregates with organic matter the significance of al and fe oxides in binding p indicates a need to intensify research into processes leading to destabilization of their aggregates with phyllosilicate clay and soil organic materials in order to mitigate eutrophication driven by leaching of particulate macronutrients from agricultural land declaration of competing interest the authors

17339,three different sized biosand filters i e the center for affordable water and sanitation technology v10 concrete filter a 5 gal bucket filter and a 2 gal bucket filter with fine sand depths of 54 15 and 10 cm respectively configured with and without the addition of iron nails to the diffuser basin were evaluated for removal of bacteria protozoa and viruses over pause periods ranging from 1 to 72 hrs biosand filtration proved effective at all pause periods tested and log10 removal of bacteria and protozoan cysts for all filter sizes and configurations ranged from 3 to 4 the addition of nails resulted in significantly better p 0 05 bacteria removal for all filter sizes and significantly better p 0 02 protozoan removal for the bucket sized filters log10 virus removal for all filter types and sizes ranged from 1 to 6 both the pause period and filter type size configuration influenced virus removal and the addition of nails to the filter improved virus removal at the shorter pause periods scaled down biosand filters provide a viable household water treatment option for some of the millions of people that still lack access to an improved water source graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biosand filtration bacteria e coli virus ms2 coliphage cryptosporidium 1 introduction the biosand filter bsf is used globally to provide those without access to a community based water source a means for treating water at the household level the bsf is an effective household water treatment option due in part to its simple design ease of use low maintenance and local availability of construction materials the size and weight of bsfs which use a concrete casing that can require over 20 l of sand and rock can make them difficult to install in remote locations and cost prohibitive for some families sand bed depth and filter charge volume are two design parameters that influence filter performance filtration through the schmutzdecke has been found to provide the most effective e coli reduction in intermittently operated bsfs young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 although increasing media depth has also been shown have a positive effect on the removal of turbidity total suspended solids carbonaceous oxygen demand and total coliforms in slow sand filters verma et al 2019 while some studies observed increased removal of ms2 coliphage with depth wang et al 2014 young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 others found that virus reduction in bsfs as a function of depth varies depending on the virus elliott et al 2008 wang et al 2016 past laboratory studies baumgartner et al 2007 elliott et al 2008 jenkins et al 2011 demonstrated improved contaminant removal for water that resides in the sand bed for a full pause period as compared to water that flows continuously through the filter with no residence time elliott et al elliott et al 2008 found that performance was maximized when less than one pore volume was charged to the filter per day for an end user to obtain the same quantity of treated water in a given day a bucket sized bsf would need to be filled more frequently than the standard sized bsf resulting in shorter pause periods between fills in this study we tested microbial removal over a range of pause periods in three different sized bsfs the standard sized center for affordable water and sanitation technology cawst version 10 v10 concrete bsf and two smaller filters using 5 gal and 2 gal buckets respectively as casing material it was not clear whether the smaller sand beds in the bucket sized bsfs would remove microorganisms and particularly viruses as effectively as the cawst v10 concrete bsfs virus sorption to sand is primarily mediated by electrostatic interactions and van der waal s forces quartz sand has an isoelectric point iep of 2 2 and ms2 coliphage has an iep of 3 5 3 9 which means that both sand and ms2 coliphage as well as most viruses are negatively charged at ph values typical of natural water conditions ph 6 9 leading to electrostatic repulsion that reduces virus adsorption to the sand surface bradley et al 2011 previous work has shown that viruses electrostatically adsorb to positively charged iron oxides ryan et al 1999 and modifying filter media with iron oxides improved microorganism removals due to electrostatic attraction of the virus to the iron oxides sand filters modified with zerovalent iron removed viruses from water more effectively than non modified filters you et al 2005 iron oxyhydroxide coated sand improved groundwater bacteria adsorption compared to clean quartz sand mills et al 1994 and significantly higher p 0 05 removals of bacteria and viruses in metallic ferric and aluminum hydroxide modified sand compared to untreated sand columns were observed lukasik et al 1999 bsfs modified with iron oxide coated sand removed more bacteria than non modified bsfs ahammed and davra 2011 and full scale bsfs modified with iron oxides in the top half of the sand bed showed improved ms2 coliphage removals until the iron oxide adsorption sites were exhausted bradley et al 2011 the importance of electrostatic attraction in virus removal was demonstrated by zhuang and jin zhuang and jin 2003 who showed that virus removal in saturated aluminum oxide coated sand columns decreased as ionic strength increased because of ion shielding i e the added ions reduced the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged oxides and negatively charged viruses therefore in this study we investigated the impact of an added iron source small non galvanized iron nails added to the diffuser basin on the removal of microorganisms in the scaled down bsfs this study is novel in that it investigated the long term performance of six different bsf designs three sand bed depths each with and without iron nails in the diffuser basin with respect to four different microbiological contaminants two types of bacteria total coliforms and e coli one protozoan cryptosporidium parvum and one virus ms2 coliphage we hypothesized that the scaled down bsfs would perform comparably to standard sized bsfs with respect to bacteria and protozoa removal and that the addition of an iron source to the scaled down bsfs would enable virus removals comparable to those in standard sized bsfs the specific objectives of this study were to investigate 1 whether the six different bsf designs perform significantly differently with respect to bacteria protozoa and virus removal 2 whether modifying the bsf with nails in the diffuser basin significantly improves microbial removal and 3 the impact of pause period on microbial removal in the six bsf designs 2 materials and methods experimental setup this study included twelve bsfs built as previously described design details provided in napotnik et al 2017 including four replicate filters of three different sizes the cawst v10 concrete bsf and two smaller versions constructed in 5 gal and 2 gal buckets respectively table 1 the bucket filters were built using the same design principal as the cawst v10 bsf specifically that the charge volume equaled the pore volume of the sand bed two bsfs of each size were modified by adding iron nails non galvanized ¾ finishing nails code 1ac06 tree island industries ltd richmond bc to the diffuser basins specifically 5 kg 1 5 kg and 0 625 kg iron nails were added to the cawst v10 5 gal and 2 gal filters respectively to maintain a constant ratio of 0 42 kg nails per liter of charge water volume across all three filter designs this ratio of nails to charge water was chosen to provide sufficient contact of the iron surface of the nails with the influent water on each fill to avoid using too much space in the influent reservoir that would necessitate a reduction in fill volume and to ensure sufficient nails such that the oxidation process would not rust out the nails before the end of the expected life of the bsf filters were ripened for one month prior to testing during the ripening period filters were filled twice per day with local creek water filters were operated at each pause period for approximately six weeks at the start of a new pause period all filters were cleaned as previously described napotnik et al 2017 and operated for a minimum of one week prior to microbial challenge tests to condition the filters and minimize the effects of a new fill schedule on filter performance the filters were tested at six different pause periods of 1 3 6 12 24 and 72 hrs the order of pause period testing was 6 3 1 12 24 and 72 hrs filters were charged three times per day during the 6 3 and 1 hr pause period tests influent water consisting of dechlorinated tap water augmented with local creek water and sediments monocacy creek bethlehem pa to obtain a target turbidity level of 50 ntu was spiked with bacteria protozoa and viruses as described below on microbial test days the average ph and turbidity of the influent water was 7 3 s d 0 46

table s2 in supplementary material procedures for filling the filters and collecting the effluent on microbial test days are also provided in supplementary material only one challenge microorganism was introduced to the filter influent on each test day microbial removal tests were performed in triplicate for bacteria for all pause periods except 24 hr and 72 hr which were completed in duplicate and in duplicate for protozoa and viruses for all pause periods filter flow rates were measured weekly as described in supplementary material to identify when cleaning needed to be performed cleaning was performed as previously described napotnik et al 2017 when flow rates decreased to approximately half of the initial clean bed value while all filters were consistently cleaned at this flow rate threshold the timing of cleaning for each filter was different viruses freeze dried stock solutions of ms2 coliphage and e coli host strain 15 597 were obtained from atcc manassas va influent water

kruskal wallis test with bonferroni error protection was performed to identify significant differences in performance i across the various pause periods for each of the six filter types and ii between the two configurations i e with versus without nails for filters of the same size operated at the same pause period pearson correlation tests were performed to identify any correlations between microbial removal and either pause period or sand depth all statistical analyses were performed with the analyze it add in analyze it software ltd leeds england for microsoft excel a significance level of 0 05 was applied to all statistical tests 3 results virus removal evaluation of ms2 coliphage log10 removal values across each filter type fig 1 table 2 showed similar filter performance across several pause periods e g three performance groups were observed for the cawst v10 bsf with no nails filters operated at 1 and 3 hr pause periods had the lowest removal filters operated at 6 12 and 24 hr pause periods showed similar mid range removal levels and filters operated at a 72 hr pause period had the highest observed removal this trend was confirmed by the kruskal wallis test on the median n 4 ms2 removals for the pause periods tested for each filter type table 2 the overall p values from the six datasets were all 0 05 confirming a significant difference in the ms2 removal medians among pause periods of the same filter type the performance groupings of the pause periods for each filter configuration were based on the p values for each pairwise comparison p values not shown but a performance group consisted of pause period comparisons with p values 0 05 for all three filter sizes without nails three performance groupings were observed the addition of nails to each filter size improved ms2 removal at the same pause period table 2 all filter types exhibited a strong statistically significant p 0 001 positive correlation between ms2 coliphage removal and pause

improved with the addition of nails as evidenced by the upward shift of the data points in fig 2 b compared to fig 2 a ms2 coliphage removal as a function of sand bed depth was evaluated to identify the pause periods for which there was a significant correlation table 4 fig 3 for filters without nails fig 3 a a significant positive correlation was only observed at pause periods of 6 hrs p 0 0033 and 12 hrs p 0 0046 ms2 coliphage removal at these pause periods was enhanced with increasing sand depth for filters with nails fig 3 b ms2 coliphage removal increased with bed depth at all pause periods and the positive correlation between virus removal and bed depth was significant p 0 05 at all pause periods except 12 hrs bacteria removal there was no significant difference p 0 1022 among median e coli and total coliform removal across the pause periods for each filter type table 5 fig 1 the geometric mean for all pause periods n 32 is presented in table 5 for comparison of each filter type for filters of the same size the addition of nails to the diffuser basin significantly improved e coli removal p values 0 05 comparing with versus without nails configurations for all filter

geometric mean for total coliform removal was greater for filters with nails than filters without nails i e 3 4 vs 3 0 respectively although the difference was not significant p 0 2020 protozoan

at the 3 6 and 12 hr pause periods based on pairwise comparisons however the other 12 pairwise comparisons for this filter type e g 1 hr vs 24 hr 3 hr vs 24 hr 6 hr vs 24 hr etc yielded insignificant p values p 0 05 data not shown for the cawst v10 filters with nails c parvum removal at the 1 hr pause period was significantly different p 0 05 from that obtained at the 72 hr pause period based on

period all other pairwise comparisons were insignificant p 0 05 data not shown based on review of the entire set of pairwise comparison results no consistent significant difference in c parvum removals across pause periods for any of the filter types was observed the geometric mean of c parvum removals across all pause periods n 24 is presented for each filter type in table 6 as observed for bacteria removal the addition of nails to each filter size improved c parvum removal the observed difference was significant p 0 05 for the 5 gal and 2 gal bucket filters table 6 4 discussion this research is one of the first comprehensive laboratory performance studies of the cawst v10 concrete bsf which was first recommended by cawst in september 2009 cawst 2009 and remains the current filter design recommendation the iron amendment to this filter design is inexpensive compared to the overall cost of the bsf and easy to implement since iron nails are simply placed inside the diffuser basin in the presence of oxygen and water the iron readily corrodes to form a positively charged iron oxide precipitate that binds to negatively charged water contaminants through electrostatic attraction since the contaminant laden iron oxide particles are readily captured within the filter by straining and adsorption the quality of the treated water is improved the traditional i e sand only cawst v10 bsf averaged 99 98 3 8 log10 e coli bacteria removal table 5 removal of c parvum was over 99 99 4 log10 for all pause periods tested table 6 virus reduction ms2 coliphage was lowest for the 1 and 3 hr pause periods 85 and 51 respectively but over 99 2 log10 for the remainder of the pause periods tested i e 6 12 24 and 72 hrs table 2 the modified cawst v10 bsf i e with nails removed greater than 99 99 of bacteria for all pause periods tested median of 99 999 or 5 1 log10 table 5 virus reduction for the modified cawst v10 bsf varied from 99 9 to 99 9999 3 log10 to 6 log10 over all pause periods and was better than the traditional sand only bsf at the shorter pause periods i e 1 and 3 hrs table 2 protozoan removal for the modified configuration was similar to the sand only filter at over 99 99 4 log10 in all experiments table 6 while the bacteria and virus removals observed in the modified cawst v10 filter were higher than those observed in studies of the kanchan filter chiew et al 2009 ngai et al 2007 these differences may be attributable to different filter designs specifically with respect to charge volume and pore volume different operational flow rates and different microbial spike concentrations it should be noted that such high log removals are possible to measure only when the microbial loads in the influent water are also high while influent microbial concentrations were kept high in these laboratory studies target influent concentrations for e coli ms2 coliphage and c parvum were 1e6 cfu ml 1e5 pfu ml and 5e3 oocysts ml respectively microbial concentrations in natural waters are likely to be lower therefore log removals in the field can be expected to be lower than those measured in controlled laboratory studies increasing the pause period increased ms2 coliphage removal for all filter sizes and in the bucket sized filters this relationship was stronger for filters without nails table 3 contaminant particle size sand grain size pore water velocity and ripening time are other primary parameters that influence contaminant removal in filters for sub micron e g virus particles molecular diffusion due to brownian motion is a primary transport mechanism the observed increase in virus removal with an increase in pause period may be due in part to the additional time for diffusion of the virus particles to the sand surface in addition microbial processes like grazing and release of exoproducts like proteolytic enzymes are also likely to contribute to the increase in virus removal during idle times elliott et al 2011 these results agree with other studies which observed improved virus removal in biosand filters with increased residence time jenkins et al 2011 phillips and smidt 2020 wang et al 2016 in this study all three filter sizes without the addition of nails achieved 2 log10 ms2 coliphage removals with a 24 hr pause period table 2 maintaining the 24 hr pause period and adding nails to the filter increased ms2 removal in the cawst v10 and 5 gal filters by 1 log10 there was no significant p 0 05 change in ms2 coliphage removal in the 2 gal filters from the addition of nails ms2 removals observed for the traditional filter configurations no nails are in line with previous work that showed ms2 coliphage removal ranging from 2 log10 to 4 log10 in a bsf column study elliott et al 2011 in another previous study a 60 l plastic cased bsf with a 40 cm sand bed exhibited fluctuating ms2 removals during the first 150 days of operation between 1 log10 and 3 log10 bradley et al 2011 which is comparable with the 2 3 log10 removal observed in this study for the cawst v10 bsf at the 24 hr pause period the low iep of ms2 coliphage 3 5 3 9 results in repulsive electrostatic forces between the virus particles and negatively charged sand particles it is important to note that ms2 coliphage has a lower iep relative to other virus types e g echoviruses have ieps in the range of 5 0 6 4 which increases the difficulty with which it is removed in filtration units for this reason ms2 coliphage is often chosen as a challenge organism for testing as the results reported for its removal are likely lower than would be observed for other virus types with higher ieps for the filters with nails the introduction of positively charged iron oxide particles led to increased ms2 removal via sorption onto the iron oxide particles by attractive electrostatic forces and capture within the filter bed increased removal of bacteria and viruses has been demonstrated in other ferric sand environments as well bradley et al 2011 lukasik et al 1999 mills et al 1994 where the electrostatic repulsion was reduced by modification and or introduction of positively charged surfaces for all filters tested improved virus removal correlated significantly with increased pause period p 0 001 table 3 fig 2 while this observed relationship may have been confounded by the difference in ripening times between the shorter pause periods tested earlier in the study with subsequently shorter ripening times and the longer pause periods tested later in the study when ripening time was the longest improved filter performance with increasing pause periods has been observed by others as well increasing the pause period leads to longer contact times of the water with the sand and previous work elliott et al 2008 jenkins et al 2011 phillips and smidt 2020 young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 has shown that virus removals improve with increased residence time in the filters over the majority of pause periods a significant p 0 05 positive correlation between sand bed depth and virus removal was observed for the filters with nails table 4 suggesting that iron enhanced virus removal occurred throughout the entire bed depth this finding agrees with observations by others elliott et al 2011 lynn et al 2013 young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 that biomass removal occurs throughout the depth of the sand bed rather than only near the surface in the biolayer this deep bed maturation has been shown to produce better virus removals with greater ripening time bradley et al 2011 however the impact of bed depth on virus removal has been found in several other studies to be virus specific with ms2 coliphage showing little to no reduction with filter depth compared to other viruses elliott et al 2008 wang et al 2016 the addition of nails likely explains the increase in ms2 reduction with filter depth observed in this study only at the 6 and 12 hr pause periods was a significant p 0 05 correlation between ms2 coliphage removal and bed depth observed for the filters without nails table 4 pause periods of 1 and 3 hrs were presumably too short for even deeper bed depths to enhance ms2 coliphage removal pause periods of 24 and 72 hrs were presumably long enough that maximum ms2 coliphage removal could be achieved with the shortest bed depths tested the results confirm that the presence of iron oxide in the system improved the ms2 removal performance of the filters ripening time may have also affected observed virus removal this study was performed with newly installed filters that had been operated for one month prior to the experiments improved filter performance with respect to bacteria and virus removals has been observed by others after ripening times of about one month elliott et al 2008 palmateer et al 1999 wang et al 2014 in these experiments one month was also observed to ripen the filter mostly at the top of the fine sand layer i e the biolayer or schmutzdecke sufficiently to achieve greater than 2 log10 removal of e coli and total coliform bacteria i e world health organization who 2011 2 star comprehensive protection with a 6 hr pause period i e the first pause period tested in this study table 5 the duration of testing for each pause period in this study was approximately 6 weeks with 2 4 days between pause periods to prepare for the following test therefore the ripening time of the filters in these experiments varied from 4 to 35 weeks with the shorter pause periods tested first further research is warranted to determine if increased ripening time can improve virus removal in the bsf sufficiently to overcome shorter pause periods e g what amount of ripening time would be necessary to achieve 3 log10 removal of viruses with only a 1 hr pause period bacteria removal for each filter type was not impacted by the pause periods tested in this study table 5 the filters with nails yielded statistically p 0 05 higher bacterial removal than those without nails for each filter size table 5 for micron sized particles like bacteria removal in the filter bed is dominated by interception i e particle collision with the sand grains and sedimentation the fact that bacterial deposition has been shown to be a reversible process lukasik et al 1999 could explain the lack of observed correlation between removal rates and pause periods the increased bacterial removal in filters modified with nails could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction of the bacteria to the iron oxides neutralizing the negative charge of the bacteria and enhancing their adsorption onto negatively charged sand grains lukasik et al 1999 mills et al 1994 the increased removal could also be attributed to the bactericidal effect of the iron oxide while iron is an essential micronutrient high iron concentrations have been shown to have toxic biological effects reportedly inducing oxidative stress and irreversible damage to protein and dna during the growth phase abdul tehrani et al 1999 s i 1999 however susceptibility to iron toxicity is not universal the presence of iron oxide in nutrient limited environments as found in rusting distribution pipes was shown to increase the survivability of starved and aging e coli cells grandjean et al 2006 all bsf types exhibited 3 log10 c parvum removal rates for each of the pause periods tested the cawst v10 and 5 gal bucket filters yielded 4 log10 c parvum removals over the range of pause periods table 6 these results are slightly better than the 3 log10 removal of cryptosporidium oocysts reported for the original manz intermittent slow sand filter palmateer et al 1999 this early version of the biosand filter was designed with a charge volume greater than the pore volume such that not all influent water benefitted from a full pause period of residence time in the filter in this study no appreciable correlation between c parvum removal and pause period was identified and the addition of nails did not significantly p 0 0964 improve c parvum removal for the cawst v10 filters however a significant increase in c parvum log10 removal from 4 1 to 4 6 p 0 0105 and from 3 7 to 4 3 p 0 0004 was observed when nails were added to the 5 gal and 2 gal bucket filters respectively table 6 an increase in ph in the cawst v10 effluent was observed in this study table s2 with this ph shift more pronounced at the longer pause periods and in the filters modified with nails this same ph shift has been observed by others and attributed to leaching of calcium carbonate from the concrete filter body mahaffy et al 2015 murphy et al 2010 it is unlikely that this ph shift impacted filter performance as the ph shift was observed in the concrete filters as pause period increased yet bacteria removal in the cawst v10 filters was not impacted by pause period given the ieps of e coli 5 6 ms2 coliphage 3 5 3 9 and quartz sand 2 2 an increased ph would lead to more negative bacteria virus and sand surface charges increasing electrostatic repulsion in the filter a previous study mahaffy et al 2015 of 10 full sized bsfs eight plastic and two concrete also reported an increase in the effluent ph for one of the two concrete filters but similar e coli removals among all of the filters suggesting that the ph shift did not impact filter performance it is recommended that bsfs are filled a minimum of once per day cawst 2012 the 12 l of water produced from one fill of the cawst v10 bsf would be the minimum required to sustain a family of six who 2006 with an adequate volume of drinking water for the day however multiple fills per day would be required to obtain the same volume of drinking water from the smaller bsfs if users filled the smaller units three times per day a 6 hr pause period is a reasonable approximation of expected operating conditions the traditional cawst v10 bsf no nails operated at a 6 hr pause period achieved a median virus removal of 2 42 log10 table 2 the unmodified no nails 5 gal and 2 gal bucket bsfs required a pause period of 12 hrs to obtain a similar level 2 log10 of ms2 removal table 2 which would yield only 7 2 and 3 0 l of water in a 24 hr period however with the addition of nails to the filter the 5 gal bucket bsf achieved 2 log10 removal at a 3 hr pause period and the 2 gal bucket filter achieved 1 8 log10 removal at a 6 hr pause table 7 shows the minimum recommended pause periods for the six different filter configurations to meet the world health organization who criteria for targeted 1 star and comprehensive 2 and 3 star protection and table 8 quantifies the daily volume of water that could be produced by each filter at these recommended pause periods for targeted protection the scaled down filters achieve similar performance to the cawst filter even without the addition of nails table 7 and can provide 15 l 2 gal bucket filters and 36 l 5 gal bucket filters of water per day respectively table 8 for comprehensive 2 star protection the addition of nails allowed the cawst and 5 gal bucket filters to meet the who criteria with shorter pause periods than the non modified filters but nails did not reduce the recommended pause period for the 2 gal bucket filters table 7 the 2 gal bsfs need more than one day 72 hr to produce water meeting 2 star protection table 8 to achieve 2 star protection the 5 gal bucket filter modified with nails could produce 7 2 l of water per day table 8 which is not enough to meet the needs of a household s drinking water but is very close to the minimum 7 5 l per person per day recommended by the who to provide sufficient water for hydration and incorporation into food for most people under most conditions who 2017 previous work phillips and smidt 2020 has shown that adjusting the design of scaled down bsfs to be shallow and broad which allows the same volume of water to be charged to the filter but with a reduced pressure head in the influent reservoir that leads to slower flows and longer residence times in the filter can achieve greater contaminant removal than the typical narrow and tall bsf design a redesign of the scaled down bsfs to broaden their diameter without increasing the depth of sand may enable the 5 gal bsfs to achieve 2 star protection at shorter pause periods thereby increasing the volume of clean water that can be produced each day of the four scaled down bsf designs only the 5 gal bucket filter with nails achieved 3 star protection table 7 however a 72 hr pause period was required to achieve 3 star protection so daily drinking water needs could not be met with this filter at this level of protection therefore the 5 gal bucket filter modified with nails holds the greatest potential to provide comprehensive 2 star protection at a pause period 12 hr that could provide 7 2 l of drinking water each day design modifications to make the bucket filters broader and shallower as described by phillips and smidt phillips and smidt 2020 hold great promise for the potential of these scaled down filters to produce safe drinking water in volumes that would sustain a household s drinking water needs these are the first full scale laboratory tests which confirm that biosand filtration can be effective over a range of pause periods 1 to 72 hrs and sand bed depths 10 to 54 cm for removal of protozoan cysts bacteria and viruses the addition of nails to the filters improved virus and bacteria removals in all three filter sizes tested and improved protozoan cyst removal in the 2 gal bucket filters the cawst v10 filters charged with larger volumes of water per fill required cleaning about twice as frequently as the scaled down filters at the shorter pause periods 1 3 and 6 hrs and the cawst v10 filters with nails required cleaning about twice as frequently as the unmodified cawst v10 filters at the 6 and 12 hr pause periods table s1 in supplementary material future work should evaluate the potential to reduce the quantity of nails added to the diffuser basin or investigate other means of introducing iron into the filter system with a particular focus on options that utilize locally available materials in the areas where bsfs are to be deployed given that we did not observe an appreciable loss in volume of nails by the end of the study reducing the quantity of nails may still provide improved treated water quality regional sand types with differing surface properties should be investigated for their impact on the removal of contaminants in particular the sub micron virus particles in addition modifying the filter design to be broader and shallower phillips and smidt 2020 may provide the slower flow rates and increased residence times to support greater contaminant removal in small scale filters without the addition of nails successful and sustainable household water treatment interventions depend upon a number of variables including source water contaminants end user volume requirements and user operation and maintenance of the treatment technology biosand filtration offers the potential to tailor household water treatment to the specific needs of a community this study shows that bsfs can be scaled down using locally available casings and with the addition of locally available nails to the diffuser basin provide substantive improvements to drinking water quality even meeting the who health based criteria for comprehensive protection scaled down bsfs could present a viable option for some of the millions of people that still lack access to an improved water source and aid in the attainment of sustainable development goal 6 to provide sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 5 conclusion the following conclusions from this study support the use of scaled down bsfs for removal of protozoan cysts bacteria and viruses in household water treatment all three filter sizes cawst v10 5 gal bucket and 2 gal bucket filters without the addition of nails to the diffuser basin achieved 2 log10 ms2 coliphage removals with a 24 hr pause period removal of ms2 coliphage improved with longer pause periods between 1 and 72 hrs no consistent significant reduction in bacteria and protozoan cyst removal was observed at shorter pause periods between 1 and 72 hrs for any of the filter types the addition of nails to the diffuser basin improved virus and bacteria removals in all three filter sizes and improved protozoan cyst removal in the 2 gal bucket filters the 5 gal bucket filter modified with nails and operated with a 12 hr pause period can produce 7 2 l of water per day and meet who 2 star comprehensive protection criteria the daily volume of water produced is close to the minimum 7 5 l per person per day recommended by the who to

17339,three different sized biosand filters i e the center for affordable water and sanitation technology v10 concrete filter a 5 gal bucket filter and a 2 gal bucket filter with fine sand depths of 54 15 and 10 cm respectively configured with and without the addition of iron nails to the diffuser basin were evaluated for removal of bacteria protozoa and viruses over pause periods ranging from 1 to 72 hrs biosand filtration proved effective at all pause periods tested and log10 removal of bacteria and protozoan cysts for all filter sizes and configurations ranged from 3 to 4 the addition of nails resulted in significantly better p 0 05 bacteria removal for all filter sizes and significantly better p 0 02 protozoan removal for the bucket sized filters log10 virus removal for all filter types and sizes ranged from 1 to 6 both the pause period and filter type size configuration influenced virus removal and the addition of nails to the filter improved virus removal at the shorter pause periods scaled down biosand filters provide a viable household water treatment option for some of the millions of people that still lack access to an improved water source graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biosand filtration bacteria e coli virus ms2 coliphage cryptosporidium 1 introduction the biosand filter bsf is used globally to provide those without access to a community based water source a means for treating water at the household level the bsf is an effective household water treatment option due in part to its simple design ease of use low maintenance and local availability of construction materials the size and weight of bsfs which use a concrete casing that can require over 20 l of sand and rock can make them difficult to install in remote locations and cost prohibitive for some families sand bed depth and filter charge volume are two design parameters that influence filter performance filtration through the schmutzdecke has been found to provide the most effective e coli reduction in intermittently operated bsfs young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 although increasing media depth has also been shown have a positive effect on the removal of turbidity total suspended solids carbonaceous oxygen demand and total coliforms in slow sand filters verma et al 2019 while some studies observed increased removal of ms2 coliphage with depth wang et al 2014 young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 others found that virus reduction in bsfs as a function of depth varies depending on the virus elliott et al 2008 wang et al 2016 past laboratory studies baumgartner et al 2007 elliott et al 2008 jenkins et al 2011 demonstrated improved contaminant removal for water that resides in the sand bed for a full pause period as compared to water that flows continuously through the filter with no residence time elliott et al elliott et al 2008 found that performance was maximized when less than one pore volume was charged to the filter per day for an end user to obtain the same quantity of treated water in a given day a bucket sized bsf would need to be filled more frequently than the standard sized bsf resulting in shorter pause periods between fills in this study we tested microbial removal over a range of pause periods in three different sized bsfs the standard sized center for affordable water and sanitation technology cawst version 10 v10 concrete bsf and two smaller filters using 5 gal and 2 gal buckets respectively as casing material it was not clear whether the smaller sand beds in the bucket sized bsfs would remove microorganisms and particularly viruses as effectively as the cawst v10 concrete bsfs virus sorption to sand is primarily mediated by electrostatic interactions and van der waal s forces quartz sand has an isoelectric point iep of 2 2 and ms2 coliphage has an iep of 3 5 3 9 which means that both sand and ms2 coliphage as well as most viruses are negatively charged at ph values typical of natural water conditions ph 6 9 leading to electrostatic repulsion that reduces virus adsorption to the sand surface bradley et al 2011 previous work has shown that viruses electrostatically adsorb to positively charged iron oxides ryan et al 1999 and modifying filter media with iron oxides improved microorganism removals due to electrostatic attraction of the virus to the iron oxides sand filters modified with zerovalent iron removed viruses from water more effectively than non modified filters you et al 2005 iron oxyhydroxide coated sand improved groundwater bacteria adsorption compared to clean quartz sand mills et al 1994 and significantly higher p 0 05 removals of bacteria and viruses in metallic ferric and aluminum hydroxide modified sand compared to untreated sand columns were observed lukasik et al 1999 bsfs modified with iron oxide coated sand removed more bacteria than non modified bsfs ahammed and davra 2011 and full scale bsfs modified with iron oxides in the top half of the sand bed showed improved ms2 coliphage removals until the iron oxide adsorption sites were exhausted bradley et al 2011 the importance of electrostatic attraction in virus removal was demonstrated by zhuang and jin zhuang and jin 2003 who showed that virus removal in saturated aluminum oxide coated sand columns decreased as ionic strength increased because of ion shielding i e the added ions reduced the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged oxides and negatively charged viruses therefore in this study we investigated the impact of an added iron source small non galvanized iron nails added to the diffuser basin on the removal of microorganisms in the scaled down bsfs this study is novel in that it investigated the long term performance of six different bsf designs three sand bed depths each with and without iron nails in the diffuser basin with respect to four different microbiological contaminants two types of bacteria total coliforms and e coli one protozoan cryptosporidium parvum and one virus ms2 coliphage we hypothesized that the scaled down bsfs would perform comparably to standard sized bsfs with respect to bacteria and protozoa removal and that the addition of an iron source to the scaled down bsfs would enable virus removals comparable to those in standard sized bsfs the specific objectives of this study were to investigate 1 whether the six different bsf designs perform significantly differently with respect to bacteria protozoa and virus removal 2 whether modifying the bsf with nails in the diffuser basin significantly improves microbial removal and 3 the impact of pause period on microbial removal in the six bsf designs 2 materials and methods experimental setup this study included twelve bsfs built as previously described design details provided in napotnik et al 2017 including four replicate filters of three different sizes the cawst v10 concrete bsf and two smaller versions constructed in 5 gal and 2 gal buckets respectively table 1 the bucket filters were built using the same design principal as the cawst v10 bsf specifically that the charge volume equaled the pore volume of the sand bed two bsfs of each size were modified by adding iron nails non galvanized ¾ finishing nails code 1ac06 tree island industries ltd richmond bc to the diffuser basins specifically 5 kg 1 5 kg and 0 625 kg iron nails were added to the cawst v10 5 gal and 2 gal filters respectively to maintain a constant ratio of 0 42 kg nails per liter of charge water volume across all three filter designs this ratio of nails to charge water was chosen to provide sufficient contact of the iron surface of the nails with the influent water on each fill to avoid using too much space in the influent reservoir that would necessitate a reduction in fill volume and to ensure sufficient nails such that the oxidation process would not rust out the nails before the end of the expected life of the bsf filters were ripened for one month prior to testing during the ripening period filters were filled twice per day with local creek water filters were operated at each pause period for approximately six weeks at the start of a new pause period all filters were cleaned as previously described napotnik et al 2017 and operated for a minimum of one week prior to microbial challenge tests to condition the filters and minimize the effects of a new fill schedule on filter performance the filters were tested at six different pause periods of 1 3 6 12 24 and 72 hrs the order of pause period testing was 6 3 1 12 24 and 72 hrs filters were charged three times per day during the 6 3 and 1 hr pause period tests influent water consisting of dechlorinated tap water augmented with local creek water and sediments monocacy creek bethlehem pa to obtain a target turbidity level of 50 ntu was spiked with bacteria protozoa and viruses as described below on microbial test days the average ph and turbidity of the influent water was 7 3 s d 0 46

table s2 in supplementary material procedures for filling the filters and collecting the effluent on microbial test days are also provided in supplementary material only one challenge microorganism was introduced to the filter influent on each test day microbial removal tests were performed in triplicate for bacteria for all pause periods except 24 hr and 72 hr which were completed in duplicate and in duplicate for protozoa and viruses for all pause periods filter flow rates were measured weekly as described in supplementary material to identify when cleaning needed to be performed cleaning was performed as previously described napotnik et al 2017 when flow rates decreased to approximately half of the initial clean bed value while all filters were consistently cleaned at this flow rate

and 24 hr pause periods showed similar mid range removal levels and filters operated at a 72 hr pause period had the highest observed removal this trend was confirmed by the kruskal wallis test on the median n 4 ms2 removals for the pause periods tested for each filter type table 2 the overall p values from the six datasets were all 0 05 confirming a significant difference in the ms2 removal medians among pause periods of the same filter type the performance groupings of the pause periods for each filter configuration were based on the p values for each pairwise comparison p values not shown but a performance group consisted of pause period comparisons with p values 0 05 for all three filter sizes without nails three performance groupings were observed the addition of nails to each filter size improved ms2 removal at the same pause period table 2 all filter types exhibited a strong statistically significant p 0 001 positive correlation between ms2 coliphage removal and pause period i e removal increased as pause period increased table 3 fig 2 the correlation was the strongest for the smallest filters without nails table 3 for all filter sizes ms2 coliphage removal improved with the addition of nails as evidenced by the upward shift of the data points in fig 2 b compared to fig 2 a ms2 coliphage removal as a function of sand bed depth was evaluated to identify the pause periods for which there was a significant correlation table 4 fig 3 for filters without nails fig 3 a a significant positive correlation was only observed at pause periods of 6 hrs p 0 0033 and 12 hrs p 0 0046 ms2 coliphage removal at these pause periods was enhanced with increasing sand depth for filters with nails fig 3 b ms2 coliphage removal increased with bed depth at all pause

median e coli and total coliform removal across the pause periods for each filter type table 5 fig 1 the geometric mean for all pause periods n 32 is presented in table 5 for comparison of each filter

at the 3 6 and 12 hr pause periods based on pairwise comparisons however the other 12 pairwise comparisons for this filter type e g 1 hr vs 24 hr 3 hr vs 24 hr 6 hr vs 24 hr etc yielded insignificant

period all other pairwise comparisons were insignificant p 0 05 data not shown based on review of the entire set of pairwise comparison results no consistent significant difference in c parvum removals across pause periods for any of the filter types was observed the geometric mean of c parvum removals across all pause periods n 24 is presented for each filter type in table 6 as observed for bacteria removal the addition of nails to each filter size improved c parvum removal the observed difference was significant p 0 05 for the 5 gal and 2 gal bucket filters table 6 4 discussion this research is one of the first comprehensive laboratory performance studies of the cawst v10 concrete bsf which was first recommended by cawst in september 2009 cawst 2009 and remains the current filter design recommendation the iron amendment to this filter design is inexpensive compared to the overall cost of the bsf and easy to implement since iron nails are simply placed inside the diffuser basin in the presence of oxygen and water the iron readily corrodes to form a positively charged iron oxide precipitate that binds to negatively charged water contaminants through electrostatic attraction since the contaminant laden iron oxide particles are readily captured within the filter by straining and adsorption the quality of the treated water is improved the traditional i e sand only cawst v10 bsf averaged 99 98 3 8 log10 e coli bacteria removal table 5 removal of c parvum was over 99 99 4 log10 for all pause periods tested table 6 virus reduction ms2 coliphage was lowest for the 1 and 3 hr pause periods 85 and 51 respectively but over 99 2 log10 for the remainder of the pause periods tested i e 6 12 24 and 72 hrs table 2 the modified cawst v10 bsf i e with nails removed greater than 99 99 of bacteria for all pause periods tested median of 99 999 or 5 1 log10 table 5 virus reduction for the modified cawst v10 bsf varied from 99 9 to 99 9999 3 log10 to 6 log10 over all pause periods and was better than the traditional sand only bsf at the shorter pause periods i e 1 and 3 hrs table 2 protozoan removal for the modified configuration was similar to the sand only filter at over 99 99 4 log10 in all experiments table 6 while the bacteria and virus removals observed in the modified cawst v10 filter were higher than those observed in studies of the kanchan filter chiew et al 2009 ngai et al 2007 these differences may be attributable to different filter designs specifically with respect to charge volume and pore volume different operational flow rates and different microbial spike concentrations it should be noted that such high log removals are possible to measure only when the microbial loads in the influent water are also high while influent microbial concentrations were kept high in these laboratory studies target influent concentrations for e coli ms2 coliphage and c parvum were 1e6 cfu ml 1e5 pfu ml and 5e3 oocysts ml respectively microbial concentrations in natural waters are likely to be lower therefore log removals in the field can be expected to be lower than those measured in controlled laboratory studies increasing the pause period increased ms2 coliphage removal for all filter sizes and in the bucket sized filters this relationship was stronger for filters without nails table 3 contaminant particle size sand grain size pore water velocity and ripening time are other primary parameters that influence contaminant removal in filters for sub micron e g virus particles molecular diffusion due to brownian motion is a primary transport mechanism the observed increase in virus removal with an increase in pause period may be due in part to the additional time for diffusion of the virus particles to the sand surface in addition microbial processes like grazing and release of exoproducts like proteolytic enzymes are also likely to contribute to the increase in virus removal during idle times elliott et al 2011 these results agree with other studies which observed improved virus removal in biosand filters with increased residence time jenkins et al 2011 phillips and smidt 2020 wang et al 2016 in this study all three filter sizes without the addition of nails achieved 2 log10 ms2 coliphage removals with a 24 hr pause period table 2 maintaining the 24 hr pause period and adding nails to the filter increased ms2 removal in the cawst v10 and 5 gal filters by 1 log10 there was no significant p 0 05 change in ms2 coliphage removal in the 2 gal filters from the addition of nails ms2 removals observed for the traditional filter configurations no nails are in line with previous work that showed ms2 coliphage removal ranging from 2 log10 to 4 log10 in a bsf column study elliott et al 2011 in another previous study a 60 l plastic cased bsf with a 40 cm sand bed exhibited fluctuating ms2 removals during the first 150 days of operation between 1 log10 and 3 log10 bradley et al 2011 which is comparable with the 2 3 log10 removal observed in this study for the cawst v10 bsf at the 24 hr pause period the low iep of ms2 coliphage 3 5 3 9 results in repulsive electrostatic forces between the virus particles and negatively charged sand particles it is important to note that ms2 coliphage has a lower iep relative to other virus types e g echoviruses have ieps in the range of 5 0 6 4 which increases the difficulty with which it is removed in filtration units for this reason ms2 coliphage is often chosen as a challenge organism for testing as the results reported for its removal are likely lower than would be observed for other virus types with higher ieps for the filters with nails the introduction of positively charged iron oxide particles led to increased ms2 removal via sorption onto the iron oxide particles by attractive electrostatic forces and capture within the filter bed increased removal of bacteria and viruses has been demonstrated in other ferric sand environments as well bradley et al 2011 lukasik et al 1999 mills et al 1994 where the electrostatic repulsion was reduced by modification and or introduction of positively charged surfaces for all filters tested improved virus removal correlated significantly with increased pause period p 0 001 table 3 fig 2 while this observed relationship may have been confounded by the difference in ripening times between the shorter pause periods tested earlier in the study with subsequently shorter ripening times and the longer pause periods tested later in the study when ripening time was the longest improved filter performance with increasing pause periods has been observed by others as well increasing the pause period leads to longer contact times of the water with the sand and previous work elliott et al 2008 jenkins et al 2011 phillips and smidt 2020 young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 has shown that virus removals improve with increased residence time in the filters over the majority of pause periods a significant p 0 05 positive correlation between sand bed depth and virus removal was observed for the filters with nails table 4 suggesting that iron enhanced virus removal occurred throughout the entire bed depth this finding agrees with observations by others elliott et al 2011 lynn et al 2013 young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 that biomass removal occurs throughout the depth of the sand bed rather than only near the surface in the biolayer this deep bed maturation has been shown to produce better virus removals with greater ripening time bradley et al 2011 however the impact of bed depth on virus removal has been found in several other studies to be virus specific with ms2 coliphage showing little to no reduction with filter depth compared to other viruses elliott et al 2008 wang et al 2016 the addition of nails likely explains the increase in ms2 reduction with filter depth observed in this study only at the 6 and 12 hr pause periods was a significant p 0 05 correlation between ms2 coliphage removal and bed depth observed for the filters without nails table 4 pause periods of 1 and 3 hrs were presumably too short for even deeper bed depths to enhance ms2 coliphage removal pause periods of 24 and 72 hrs were presumably long enough that maximum ms2 coliphage removal could be achieved with the shortest bed depths tested the results confirm that the presence of iron oxide in the system improved the ms2 removal performance of the filters ripening time may have also affected observed virus removal this study was performed with newly installed filters that had been operated for one month prior to the experiments improved filter performance with respect to bacteria and virus removals has been observed by others after ripening times of about one month elliott et al 2008 palmateer et al 1999 wang et al 2014 in these experiments one month was also observed to ripen the filter mostly at the top of the fine sand layer i e the biolayer or schmutzdecke sufficiently to achieve greater than 2 log10 removal of e coli and total coliform bacteria i e world health organization who 2011 2 star comprehensive protection with a 6 hr pause period i e the first pause period tested in this study table 5 the duration of testing for each pause period in this study was approximately 6 weeks with 2 4 days between pause periods to prepare for the following test therefore the ripening time of the filters in these experiments varied from 4 to 35 weeks with the shorter pause periods tested first further research is warranted to determine if increased ripening time can improve virus removal in the bsf sufficiently to overcome shorter pause periods e g what amount of ripening time would be necessary to achieve 3 log10 removal of viruses with only a 1 hr pause period bacteria removal for each filter type was not impacted by the pause periods tested in this study table 5 the filters with nails yielded statistically p 0 05 higher bacterial removal than those without nails for each filter size table 5 for micron sized particles like bacteria removal in the filter bed is dominated by interception i e particle collision with the sand grains and sedimentation the fact that bacterial deposition has been shown to be a reversible process lukasik et al 1999 could explain the lack of observed correlation between removal rates and pause periods the increased bacterial removal in filters modified with nails could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction of the bacteria to the iron oxides neutralizing the negative charge of the bacteria and enhancing their adsorption onto negatively charged sand grains lukasik et al 1999 mills et al 1994 the increased removal could also be attributed to the bactericidal effect of the iron oxide while iron is an essential micronutrient high iron concentrations have been shown to have toxic biological effects reportedly inducing oxidative stress and irreversible damage to protein and dna during the growth phase abdul tehrani et al 1999 s i 1999 however susceptibility to iron toxicity is not universal the presence of iron oxide in nutrient limited environments as found in rusting distribution pipes was shown to increase the survivability of starved and aging e coli cells grandjean et al 2006 all bsf types exhibited 3 log10 c parvum removal rates for each of the pause periods tested the cawst v10 and 5 gal bucket filters yielded 4 log10 c parvum removals over the range of pause periods table 6 these results are slightly better than the 3 log10 removal of cryptosporidium oocysts reported for the original manz intermittent slow sand filter palmateer et al 1999 this early version of the biosand filter was designed with a charge volume greater than the pore volume such that not all influent water benefitted from a full pause period of residence time in the filter in this study no appreciable correlation between c parvum removal and pause period was identified and the addition of nails did not significantly p 0 0964 improve c parvum removal for the cawst v10 filters however a significant increase in c parvum log10 removal from 4 1 to 4 6 p 0 0105 and from 3 7 to 4 3 p 0 0004 was observed when nails were added to the 5 gal and 2 gal bucket filters respectively table 6 an increase in ph in the cawst v10 effluent was observed in this study table s2 with this ph shift more pronounced at the longer pause periods and in the filters modified with nails this same ph shift has been observed by others and attributed to leaching of calcium carbonate from the concrete filter body mahaffy et al 2015 murphy et al 2010 it is unlikely that this ph shift impacted filter performance as the ph shift was observed in the concrete filters as pause period increased yet bacteria removal in the cawst v10 filters was not impacted by pause period given the ieps of e coli 5 6 ms2 coliphage 3 5 3 9 and quartz sand 2 2 an increased ph would lead to more negative bacteria virus and sand surface charges increasing electrostatic repulsion in the filter a previous study mahaffy et al 2015 of 10 full sized bsfs eight plastic and two concrete also reported an increase in the effluent ph for one of the two concrete filters but similar e coli removals among all of the filters suggesting that the ph shift did not impact filter performance it is recommended that bsfs are filled a minimum of once per day cawst 2012 the 12 l of water produced from one fill of the cawst v10 bsf would be the minimum required to sustain a family of six who 2006 with an adequate volume of drinking water for the day however multiple fills per day would be required to obtain the same volume of drinking water from the smaller bsfs if users filled the smaller units three times per day a 6 hr pause period is a reasonable approximation of expected operating conditions the traditional cawst v10 bsf no nails operated at a 6 hr pause period achieved a median virus removal of 2 42 log10 table 2 the unmodified no nails 5 gal and 2 gal bucket bsfs required a pause period of 12 hrs to obtain a similar level 2 log10 of ms2 removal table 2 which would yield only 7 2 and 3 0 l of water in a 24 hr period however with the addition of nails to the filter the 5 gal bucket bsf achieved 2 log10 removal at a 3 hr pause period and the 2 gal bucket filter achieved 1 8 log10 removal at a 6 hr pause table 7 shows the minimum recommended pause periods for the six different filter configurations to meet the world health organization who criteria for targeted 1 star and comprehensive 2 and 3 star protection and table 8 quantifies the daily volume of water that could be produced by each filter at these recommended pause periods for targeted protection the scaled down filters achieve similar performance to the cawst filter even without the addition of nails table 7 and can provide 15 l 2 gal bucket filters and 36 l 5 gal bucket filters of water per day respectively table 8 for comprehensive 2 star protection the addition of nails allowed the cawst and 5 gal bucket filters to meet the who criteria with shorter pause periods than the non modified filters but nails did not reduce the recommended pause period for the 2 gal bucket filters table 7 the 2 gal bsfs need more than one day 72 hr to produce water meeting 2 star protection table 8 to achieve 2 star protection the 5 gal bucket filter modified with nails could produce 7 2 l of water per day table 8 which is not enough to meet the needs of a household s drinking water but is very close to the minimum 7 5 l per person per day recommended by the who to provide sufficient water for hydration and incorporation into food for most people under most conditions who 2017 previous work phillips and smidt 2020 has shown that adjusting the design of scaled down bsfs to be shallow and broad which allows the same volume of water to be charged to the filter but with a reduced pressure head in the influent reservoir that leads to slower flows and longer residence times in the filter can achieve greater contaminant removal than the typical narrow and tall bsf design a redesign of the scaled down bsfs to broaden their diameter without increasing the depth of sand may enable the 5 gal bsfs to achieve 2 star protection at shorter pause periods thereby increasing the volume of clean water that can be produced each day of the four scaled down bsf designs only the 5 gal bucket filter with nails achieved 3 star protection table 7 however a 72 hr pause period was required to achieve 3 star protection so daily drinking water needs could not be met with this filter at this level of protection therefore the 5 gal bucket filter modified with nails holds the greatest potential to provide comprehensive 2 star protection at a pause period 12 hr that could provide 7 2 l of drinking water each day design modifications to make the bucket filters broader and shallower as described by phillips and smidt phillips and smidt 2020 hold great promise for the potential of these scaled down filters to produce safe drinking water in volumes that would sustain a household s drinking water needs these are the first full scale laboratory tests which confirm that biosand filtration can be effective over a range of pause periods 1 to 72 hrs and sand bed depths 10 to 54 cm for removal of protozoan cysts bacteria and viruses the addition of nails to the filters improved virus and bacteria removals in all three filter sizes tested and improved protozoan cyst removal in the 2 gal bucket filters the cawst v10 filters charged with larger volumes of water per fill required cleaning about twice as frequently as the scaled down filters at the shorter pause periods 1 3 and 6 hrs and the cawst v10 filters with nails required cleaning about twice as frequently as the unmodified cawst v10 filters at the 6 and 12 hr pause periods table s1 in supplementary material future work should evaluate the potential to reduce the quantity of nails added to the diffuser basin or investigate other means of introducing iron into the filter system with a particular focus on options that utilize locally available materials in the areas where bsfs are to be deployed given that we did not observe an appreciable loss in volume of nails by the end of the study reducing the quantity of nails may still provide improved treated water quality regional sand types with differing surface properties should be investigated for their impact on the removal of contaminants in particular the sub micron virus particles in addition modifying the filter design to be broader and shallower phillips and smidt 2020 may provide the slower flow rates and increased residence times to support greater contaminant removal in small scale filters without the addition of nails successful and sustainable household water treatment interventions depend upon a number of variables including source water contaminants end user volume requirements and user operation and maintenance of the treatment technology biosand filtration offers the potential to tailor household water treatment to the specific needs of a community this study shows that bsfs can be scaled down using locally available casings and with the addition of locally available nails to the diffuser basin provide substantive improvements to drinking water quality even meeting the who health based criteria for comprehensive protection scaled down bsfs could present a viable option for some of the millions of people that still lack access to an improved water source and aid in the attainment of sustainable development goal 6 to provide sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 5 conclusion the following conclusions from this study support the use of scaled down bsfs for removal of protozoan cysts bacteria and viruses in household water treatment all three filter sizes cawst v10 5 gal bucket and 2 gal bucket filters without the addition of nails to the diffuser basin achieved 2 log10 ms2 coliphage removals with a 24 hr pause period removal of ms2 coliphage improved with longer pause periods between 1 and 72 hrs no consistent significant reduction in bacteria and protozoan cyst removal was observed at shorter pause periods between 1 and 72 hrs for any of the filter types the addition of nails to the diffuser basin improved virus and bacteria removals in all three filter sizes and improved protozoan cyst removal in the 2 gal bucket filters the 5 gal bucket filter modified with nails and operated with a 12 hr pause period can produce 7 2 l of water per day and meet who 2 star comprehensive protection criteria the daily volume of water produced is close to the minimum 7 5 l per person per day recommended by the who to provide sufficient water for most people under most conditions 6 associated content supplementary material contents include detailed procedures for 1 filling the filters and collecting the effluent on
