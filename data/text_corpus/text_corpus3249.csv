16245,the california state water resources control board is the first regulatory body in the united states to develop statewide regulations for direct potable reuse dpr to support this effort a pathogen monitoring campaign was undertaken to develop and implement an optimized standard operating protocol to better characterize the concentration of human pathogens in raw wastewater methods to detect relevant viral and protozoan pathogens in raw wastewater were optimized and implemented during a 14 month monitoring campaign over 120 samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants treating a quarter of california s population samples were analyzed for two protozoa cryptosporidium and giardia using microscopy methods three enteric viruses enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus using culture and or molecular methods and male specific coliphage using culture methods the method recovery efficiency was measured in every protozoa sample and every other virus sample to confirm minimum recovery efficiencies were achieved and to correct the concentrations for pathogen losses during sample processing the results from this study provide the industry with a large high quality dataset as demonstrated by the high degree of method sensitivity method recovery and qa qc steps such high quality data on pathogen concentrations in raw wastewater are critical for confirming the level of treatment needed to reduce pathogen concentrations down to acceptable levels for potable water in dpr projects graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pathogen concentrations wastewater monitoring potable reuse enterovirus cryptosporidium 1 introduction in the face of increasing water supply deficits and historic droughts communities across the american west are implementing bold plans to maximize the use of recycled water for instance the city of los angeles is pursuing efforts to recycle 100 of its wastewater by 2035 allowing it to produce 35 of its total supply through water reuse city of los angeles 2019 the city of san diego s pure water program will produce 40 of the city s supply through potable reuse projects by 2035 city of san diego 2021 one element that will aid in the widespread implementation of potable reuse is the regulatory flexibility to pursue the full spectrum of reuse types which would allow communities to tailor projects to address their local constraints the california state water resources control board state board has already completed regulations for groundwater recharge and reservoir water augmentation both of which are deemed indirect potable reuse ipr because the water must pass through an environmental buffer before distribution ddw 2018 the state board is also under legislative mandate to develop regulations by 2023 for direct potable reuse dpr in which water may go directly to consumers without relying on an environmental buffer the absence of an aquifer or reservoir presents new challenges for dpr pecson et al 2018 tchobanoglous et al 2015 in 2016 the state board and their dpr expert panel concluded that additional research was needed to address knowledge gaps for dpr particularly those dealing with the control of toxic chemical contaminants and pathogens olivieri et al 2016 swrcb 2016 because pathogens can cause infection and illness after a single exposure they require consistent and reliable control at all times even brief periods of reduced pathogen control performance may impact public health protection particularly in a dpr setting where there is no additional attenuation in the environment pecson et al 2017 soller et al 2018 determining the appropriate level of pathogen control requires two fundamental pieces of information knowledge of a the concentration of pathogens in the raw influent wastewater and b the much lower concentrations that are acceptable in a finished potable water the required level of pathogen control can then be estimated as the difference between the influent and effluent concentrations typically expressed as log10 reduction values lrvs beyond the seminal monitoring study conducted by rose et al 2004 only a handful of studies have characterized pathogen concentrations in raw us wastewaters in the last twenty years gennaccaro et al 2003 kitajima et al 2014 sedmak et al 2005 simmons et al 2011 simmons and xagoraraki 2011 the lack of such studies reflects the industry s historical efforts to separate wastewater from drinking water the growth of potable reuse however has motivated a number of utilities to better characterize the concentration of pathogens in wastewater and their removal through treatment plants trussell technologies 2017 2020 trussell technologies and michigan state university 2017 two important limitations of many previous monitoring studies include low method sensitivity resulting in non detect nd values and the lack of matrix spikes allowing for the calculation of and correction for recovery efficiency this study assessed the concentration of relevant pathogens in raw wastewater via a 14 month monitoring campaign conducted at five wastewater treatment plants wwtps treating sewage from one quarter of the california population approximately 10 million people from december 2019 through january 2021 the two principal objectives were to a develop an improved empirical dataset characterizing the concentration and variability of pathogen concentrations in raw wastewater and b develop recommendations for the collection and analysis of pathogen data in raw wastewater that address the limitations of previous monitoring efforts 2 methods raw wastewater samples were collected from five california wwtps to assess the distribution of pathogen concentrations 24 grab samples were collected from each wwtp over the duration of 14 months resulting in a total of 120 samples the samples were analyzed by three commercial laboratories for five pathogens representing both protozoa and virus the methods to concentrate and purify the samples for enumeration were optimized prior to the start of the 14 month campaign to increase the method sensitivity rigorous quality controls were established to ensure the reliability of the data produced the sample collection sample analysis using the optimized methods and quality controls are summarized below and described in detail in the project s publicly available quality assurance project plan qapp dpr 2 project team 2021 2 1 selection of pathogens to monitor two protozoa giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts and three viruses enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus were selected for the monitoring campaign giardia cryptosporidium and enteric viruses are currently regulated under the us epa s surface water treatment rules and california s ipr regulations ddw 2018 epa 1989 1998 2006 these pathogens have served as historical indicators of treatment performance because they are a representative of the different types of pathogens that occur in water b known to pose a high health burden in the us and c are relatively resistant to removal and inactivation processes regli et al 1991 scallan et al 2011 the campaign broadened beyond the historical pathogens to include additional virus including adenovirus via culture and molecular methods and three genogroups of norovirus via molecular methods 2 2 microorganisms ms2 and phix174 bacteriophage were used as matrix spikes to assess the recovery efficiency of the virus culture and molecular methods male specific f ms2 coliphage stock atcc 15597 b1 and the e coli

atcc 13706 b1 and e coli cn 13 somatic coliphage host atcc 700609 were obtained from atcc and cultured according to the manufacturer s instructions the double agar layer dal procedure was used to enumerate stock suspensions of somatic and male specific coliphage for use in spiking quality control samples per epa 1602 stock solutions of sabin poliovirus type 3 containing 1000 100 mpn ml were stored at 80 c in 1 1 ml aliquots per epa 1615 stock solutions of adenovirus serotype 10 adv10 atcc 1504 containing 1000 to 80 000 pfu ml were stored at 80 c in 1 1 ml aliquots from prepared stocks the positive control in each cell culture assay was seeded by diluting the stocks in phosphate buffered saline pbs to give a concentration of approximately 20 to 100 mpn per 0 1 ml inoculum volume 2 3 sample collection shipping and handling raw wastewater samples were collected from five california wwtps between december 2019 and january 2021 table 1 120 samples were collected during the study with 24 samples collected from each wwtp approximately one sample per facility every two to three weeks 4 l grab samples were collected upstream of primary clarification either before grit removal lasan sfpuc or after lacsd ocsd sd because the campaign sought to characterize the full range of values in the distributions including both minimum and maximum values grab samples were collected to eliminate the effects of dilution samples were shipped to the laboratories overnight on ice to maintain a temperature between 1 and 10 c until processing the samples were analyzed by three commercial laboratories cel analytical san francisco ca biological consulting services gainesville fl and scientific methods granger in using standardized methods upon receipt by the laboratories samples were refrigerated at 4 c and processed within 72 h of sample collection wastewater agencies were selected that have either demonstrated interest in a future dpr project or have already committed to an ipr project the sampling schedule was developed with the intent to collect samples on different days of the week and at different times of day to capture as close to the full range of pathogen concentrations as possible due to staffing constraints samples were collected sunday through wednesday between the hours of 8 am and 3 pm pt a rotation was created to ensure that wastewater from each location was evaluated by all labs participating in the study an equal number of times over the testing period details of the sample collection shipping and handling are described in the quality assurance project plan dpr 2 project team 2021 2 4 sample analysis the methods used for sample processing and quantification of protozoa giardia cryptosporidium enteric virus enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus and native coliphage are briefly described below detailed standard operating procedures for these methods can be found in the qapp project team 2020 protozoa a modified version of epa method 1693 epa 2014b was used to enumerate giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts prior to processing a colorseedtm matrix spike containing approximately 100 fluorescently labeled giardia cysts

hepatitis g armored rna was used as the positive control inhibition control for the molecular assay dilutions 1 5 or 1 25 were performed to reduce inhibition if the cycle number between hepatitis g in the reagent water and the test sample was greater than one negative controls negative controls reagent water or buffer were analyzed alongside every culture molecular and microscopy assay method qa qc samples once a month one positive control colorseedtm in reagent water and one negative control reagent water were processed following the protozoa method concentration purification and enumeration steps similarly once a month one positive control poliovirus in reagent water and one negative control reagent water were processed following the virus culture and molecular concentration purification and enumerations steps these positive controls were required to meet the following recovery efficiencies in line with epa 1615 and epa 1693 5 200 for poliovirus culture and molecular 18 100 for giardia colorseedtm and 14 100 for cryptosporidium colorseedtm epa 2014a b 2 6 evaluation of limit of detection and limit of quantification the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq for each method is a function of the instrument detection quantification limit method concentration factor cf and recovery as shown by the following equation m e t h o d l o d l o q i n s t r u m e n t l o d l o q c f r e c o v e r y where cf is a factor that accounts for the net change in sample volume through the method s concentration and dilution steps the equivalent sample volume which is the effective volume of original sample analyzed in the assay is calculated by the product of the concentration factor and the volume of the concentrate in the assay for the protozoa assays the instrument lod and loq were both taken to be 1 0 oo cyst per total volume of pellet analyzed for the virus culture assays the instrument lod was taken to be 0 95 mpn per inoculum volume analyzed based on the epa mpn calculator epa 2020 and the instrument loq was taken to be 1 0 mpn per inoculum volume analyzed for the molecular assays the instrument lod was determined by running 20 replicates of the standards at different concentrations and determining the concentration that resulted in 90 of the replicates showing amplification above the fluorescence threshold the loq was the concentration that resulted in the 20 replicates having a coefficient of variation cv of 35 or less where the cv is calculated using the following equation forootan et al 2017 c v 1 e s d 2 ln 1 e 1 e amplification efficiency sd standard deviation of cycle numbers for the replicates results that were below the lod were considered non detect nd and results that were between the lod and loq were considered detected but not quantifiable dnq because the molecular assays were run in triplicate and the concentration of the replicates was averaged if the concentrations in one or two of the molecular replicates were below the lod but the third replicate was above the lod the replicates below the lod were excluded from the average if all of the molecular replicates were below the lod the sample concentration was reported as nd if the concentration in a replicate was above the lod but below the loq the concentration for that replicate was set at one half of the loq and was then included in the average depending on the concentration in the other replicates the averaged concentration for that sample may or may not be below the loq 2 7 data analysis results were evaluated both with and without correcting for recovery efficiency the average of the ms2 and phix174 recovery was used to quantify the virus recovery efficiency since ms2 and phix174 recovery were measured in every other sample for a given wwtp linear interpolation using the previous and subsequent sample was used to determine the recovery for samples without a direct recovery measurement uncorrected and recovery corrected results were log10 transformed before proceeding with the statistical analysis the normal quantile probability plots were prepared by ranking all the data and assigning all nds and dnqs the same rank just below the lowest quantifiable measurement the probability percentile corresponding to each rank was then calculated using the following equation blom 1958 p e r c e n t i l e r a n k 0 375 t o t a l n u m b e r o f d a t a p o i n t s 0 25 the percentiles were transformed to z scores using a normal distribution table the log10 transformed concentrations were plotted against the z score and the probability percentiles were overlaid at the corresponding z scores nds and dnqs were plotted as blanks all statistical analysis of the data was performed in r r core team 2020 the shapiro wilk test was used to evaluate if the log10 transformed data were normally distributed p values greater than 0 05 indicate the distribution is not significantly different from a normal distribution the shapiro wilk test excludes nds and dnqs and the approach was considered appropriate given the low frequency of nds and dnqs for most of the pathogens for pathogens with higher frequencies of nds and dnqs e g adenovirus with the molecular method the normal quantile plot was visually inspected to qualitatively determine if the log10 transformed data were normally distributed the log10 transformed data were fit to a normal distribution using the function fitdistcens from the r package fitdistrplus which estimates the mean and standard deviation for censored datasets using maximum likelihood estimation delignette muller and dutang 2015 values below the loq i e both nd and dnq were considered left censored and the right bound for these censored datapoints was the loq for that measurement two approaches were used to perform one way comparisons the first approach was to use one way analysis of variance anova excluding all nds and dnqs a tukey post hoc test was used to perform multiple pair wise comparisons the second approach was to use a rank based test the kruskal wallis test and assign all nds and dnqs the same rank a post hoc test with bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed in both approaches comparisons with a p value less than 0 05 were considered significantly different 3 results 3 1 summary statistics the descriptive statistics for each pathogen and coliphage monitored in the 14 month campaign are shown in table 3 full results for all samples are provided in tables si 1 to si 5 of the supplementary information si a total of 120 protozoa samples and 122 virus samples were analyzed a high rate of detects was observed in the microscopy and culture assays with 98 100 95 and 83 of the assays resulting in detectable concentrations of cryptosporidium giardia enterovirus and adenovirus respectively the high detection rate was a result of the optimization process that increased method sensitivities allowing them to achieve the low lods and loqs one factor contributing to method sensitivity was the high recovery efficiency which was measured with matrix spikes in every protozoa sample and every other virus sample for each method the average recovery efficiency was over 38 furthermore 99 of the protozoa assays 99 of the virus culture assays and 97 of the virus molecular assays had a recovery of at least 10 distribution of recoveries shown in figs si 1 to si 8 a lower rate of detects was observed for the molecular methods compared to the microscopy and culture based methods despite the similar recovery efficiencies this discrepancy was likely because the equivalent sample volume for the molecular methods was lower than for the microscopy and culture methods and therefore the molecular method was limited by higher lods and loqs recovery efficiency studies verified that the ms2 and phix174 matrix spikes exhibited similar recovery efficiencies as poliovirus the average poliovirus recovery of triplicate culture assays was 11 compared to 36 and 16 for ms2 and phix174 respectively recovery correction for each round of sampling was based on an average recovery of the two bacteriophages in order to account for a range of viral characteristics due to the similarity of the phage and poliovirus recoveries ms2 and phix174 were deemed to be suitable surrogates for assessing virus recovery all pathogen distributions were well described by log10 normal distributions based on the shapiro wilk normality test the only exception was the adenovirus and norovirus gia molecular data which had a relatively high frequency of nds and dnqs consequently all pathogen concentration data were log10 transformed before calculating the descriptive statistics the mean and standard deviation for both the uncorrected and recovery corrected datasets are shown in table 3 due to the high recovery efficiency the corrected and uncorrected concentrations are within the same order of magnitude 3 2 distributions of pathogen concentrations distributions of the log10 transformed concentrations for each pathogen both with and without recovery correction are shown in fig 1 while the nds and dnqs in each dataset were not plotted they were considered in modeling the distributions the high sensitivity of the methods is illustrated by the fact that the dataset has quantifiable values at both the high and low ends of the distributions the two parameter log10 normal models that were fit for each distribution table 3 are overlaid with the empirical data in fig 1 the empirical data line up well with the log10 normal models in agreement with the results of the shapiro wilk normality test the distributions can be used to reassess the pathogen assumptions used in california s ipr regulations which were based on point estimates of 105 pathogens l for enteric virus and giardia and 104 pathogens l of cryptosporidium in raw wastewater hultquist 2016 the new empirical datasets reached these previous point estimates at the 99th 95th and 99th percentiles for the recovery corrected giardia enterovirus and adenovirus distributions respectively contrarily the cryptosporidium concentrations never reached the 104 oocysts l concentration during the campaign maximum value of 102 8 oocyst l after recovery correction and would not be modeled to reach those values until after the 99 999th percentile 3 3 geographic and temporal evaluation geographic variability was assessed by comparing the distributions at the five different monitoring facility locations the frequency of detects pathogen concentrations and recoveries at each of the five wwtps showed a high degree of similarity table si 6 and figs si 9 to si 17 both a one way anova test and a one way rank based test were used to compare each of the nine pathogen datasets at the five different locations of the 90 pair wise comparisons only five of the comparisons were statistically different for each test table 4 the cryptosporidium distribution observed at lasan was statistically higher than two to three other facilities depending on the statistical test similarly the virus distributions observed at san diego were statistically lower than those observed at two to three other facilities these findings should not obscure the main conclusions of the geographic evaluation which are that a 94 of the datasets had no significant differences between locations and b the handful of significant differences were generally small in magnitude between 0 27 and 0 78 log time series plots of the pathogen concentrations at each facility are shown for giardia and cryptosporidium fig 2 enterovirus fig 3 adenovirus fig 4 and norovirus figs si 18 si 19 and si 20 a rank based statistical test on the aggregated 120 sample dataset was used to compare the concentrations of giardia cryptosporidium enterovirus and adenovirus in the fall winter defined as october march to the concentration in the spring summer defined as april september only culturable enterovirus and molecular adenovirus had a statistical difference in concentration between the winter and summer the concentration of culturable enterovirus was higher in the summer while the concentration of molecular adenovirus was higher in the winter on march 19 2020 in response to the covid 19 pandemic california instituted a stay at home sah order that lasted through the end of the study the aggregated datasets were compared using a rank based statistical test kruskal wallis to assess whether and how the sah order impacted the raw wastewater pathogen concentrations the aggregated datasets before and after the sah order contained 36 and 84 datapoints respectively because the concentration of norovirus gia gib and gii was frequently below the loq during the duration of this campaign changes in concentration due to seasonality or the sah order could not be reliably evaluated with the exception of the molecular adenovirus data which decreased after the sah order there was no significant change in the giardia cryptosporidium enterovirus and adenovirus distributions before and after the sah order in addition to comparing the data before and after the sah order the pre covid winter months of december 2019 through march 2020 39 datapoints were compared against the covid impacted winters months of october 2020 through january 2021 32 datapoints using a kruskal wallis test similar to the sah results there was no significant change in the pathogen concentrations with the exception of molecular adenovirus which was lower in winter 2020 2021 and giardia which was higher in winter 2020 2021 4 discussion determining risk based treatment levels for potable reuse depends critically on high quality raw wastewater pathogen concentration data the following criteria were used to guide the design of this pathogen monitoring campaign and are recommended for the design of future campaigns large sample size high method sensitivity compatibility of methods with risk assessment recovery correction geographic distribution temporal distribution large sample size a minimum number of data points are needed to describe a distribution and account for the variability that may occur over the course of a day and across days seasons and years the collection of 24 samples at each site was sufficient to characterize variability over a wide range of the distribution from approximately the 5th to the 95th percentile this number of samples also matches the source water monitoring requirements for cryptosporidium under the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 which requires monthly sampling for a period of 24 months the 120 point datasets for the five pathogens evaluated via nine separate culture microscopy and molecular based methods represent the most comprehensive dataset reported in the literature to date this number of samples provides the ability to characterize the extremities of the distribution down to the 1st and up to the 99th percentile a higher number of data points also aids in fitting the distributions to parametric models the models offer the important benefit of predicting the likelihood of encountering concentrations outside of the range of the measured values method sensitivity and compatibility with risk assessment one important limitation of previous studies has been low method sensitivities that lead to non detect values this limitation is particularly notable for cryptosporidium where a survey of nine recent monitoring campaigns showed that the average percent of nds observed in a sampling campaign was 46 gennaccaro et al 2003 gray et al 2009 kitajima et al 2014 mccuin and clancy 2005 melbourne water 2011 robertson et al 2006 rose et al 2004 trussell technologies 2017 2018 through the optimization of the sops the culture and microscopy based assays averaged a detection rate over 90 this high detection rate is particularly important for these methods because they are the ones typically used to quantify pathogens for dose response studies haas et al 1999 culture data are more easily incorporated into microbial risk assessments than molecular data which typically require an additional step to translate from genome copies to infectious disease units as with increased sample size higher method sensitivities allow for a more complete characterization of the lower concentrations in the distributions and improves our ability to fit the data to models recovery correction a challenge in working with raw wastewater is the difficulty of isolating pathogens from a complex matrix a recent study comparing 36 methods for quantifying sars cov 2 in raw wastewater showed that recovery efficiency ranged from approximately 100 at the high end to 0 00001 at the low end i e seven orders of magnitude pecson et al 2021 in such cases not accounting for recovery efficiency could introduce a ten million fold factor of error when analyzing the same sample using the optimized analytical methods in this study a relatively high and consistent recovery efficiency was observed for all assays the average recovery efficiencies across all pathogens ranged from 39 to 56 meaning that the recovery corrected values were only approximately 2 to 3 fold higher than the uncorrected data while a handful of studies have conducted matrix spikes at the frequencies applied in this study mccuin and clancy 2005 melbourne water 2011 trussell technologies 2020 most studies did not measure or report recovery gray et al 2009 robertson et al 2006 rose et al 2004 sedmak et al 2005 simmons et al 2011 simmons and xagoraraki 2011 or achieved lower recovery efficiencies gennaccaro et al 2003 trussell technologies 2017 to assess recovery the use of matrix spikes is recommended for future studies one assumption that is needed is that the matrix spike behaves similarly to the pathogen of interest for the matrix spike to accurately reflect the recovery of the target pathogen it should behave similarly to the pathogen through each step of the enumeration method for the protozoa the colorseedtm matrix spike is essentially equivalent to the native giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts with the exception that they have been uniquely stained to distinguish them from the native protozoa in the case of the viruses two phages were used to assess the recovery of enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus based on results from the pre testing ms2 and phix174 demonstrated similar recoveries 26 to poliovirus 11 providing evidence that they are acceptable surrogates for assessing the fate of pathogenic enteric viruses therefore correcting for recovery in this study led to small but important increases that improved the accuracy of the concentrations additional studies that confirm the behavior of the matrix spike to the target pathogens would provide greater confidence in the accuracy of the correction the matrix spikes also provided the ability to monitor the reproducibility of the methods between labs between locations and over time at a given location based on the results of the monitoring campaign it is recommended that future pathogen studies include matrix spikes in all samples or as many as economically feasible to assess and correct for recovery efficiency geographic distribution raw wastewater samples were collected across california from five wwtps ranging in flows from 17 to 292 mgd the comparison of pathogen distributions across plants supports the conclusion that the pathogen concentrations do not vary widely in wastewaters across the state this finding is important because these five wwtps treat approximately one quarter of the sewage from california s diverse population while the data are highly relevant for california regulatory development the consistency across geographic regions and population make up suggests that they may be transferable to other regions additional studies in other regions are recommended to determine whether region specific factors impact raw wastewater concentrations including per capita water use stormwater contributions and the degree of industrial wastewater inputs into the collection system temporal distribution raw wastewater samples were collected over a period of 14 months to capture the variability of pathogen concentrations over two winter periods october to march and one summer april to september previous studies have noted seasonal variations in the prevalence of infections in california with norovirus cases peaking in december january and cryptosporidium cases peaking in august wigginton et al 2021 the seasonality of these clinical findings however was not evident in the wastewater concentrations which had relatively stable concentrations over the monitoring period a recent clinical study described decreases in the incidence of acute gastroenteritis in california that coincided with the covid 19 related sah order bulterys et al 2021 the number of reported cases of cryptosporidiosis also decreased in march of 2020 wigginton et al 2021 these findings have raised concerns that the wastewater concentrations measured in this study may also be lower than typical years two analyses were undertaken to evaluate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on the measured wastewater numbers 1 comparing pathogen concentrations before and after the sah order and 2 comparing datasets from similar timeframes in the pre covid winter of 2019 2020 and the mid covid winter of 2020 2021 in both cases there was no systematic change in the concentration of pathogens for a small number of cases the concentrations either were statistically lower molecular adenovirus or statistically higher giardia compared to the concentrations before the sah order but most pathogens showed no significant change one hypothesis to reconcile these two pieces of information is that acute gastrointestinal infections were not substantially decreased by the pandemic as evidenced by the wastewater pathogen data though infected individuals were less likely to seek clinical care the sah order played a critical role in limiting the spread of sars cov 2 the respiratory virus responsible for covid 19 but the impact on gastrointestinal pathogens was not evident in the data use of the data for regulatory development due to the dearth of reliable pathogen data in wastewater california regulators have used conservative point estimates rather than distributions to develop treatment requirements for ipr hultquist 2016 while the approach may have been appropriate given the lack of sufficient reliable data the use of the highest reported literature values adds a significant degree of conservatism that increases the degree cost and complexity of treatment the express purpose of developing the extensive dataset in this study was to develop high quality distributions that replace the previous point estimates while the new giardia and enterovirus culture data overlap with the previously used point estimates albeit at high percentile values fig 1 the new cryptosporidium distribution suggests that the 104 oocysts l point estimate represents an extremely high degree of conservatism in line with the earlier california dpr expert panel s findings and recommendations olivieri et al 2016 the new dataset and resulting distributions should be used to support the development of regulatory criteria using the modeled distributions in probabilistic assessments of treatment train performance and quantitative microbial risk assessment allows the full range of potential concentrations to be estimated rather than being limited to a bounded empirical dataset because the data collected from this effort meet the multiple strict requirements for quality and quantity the distributions can justifiably replace the historical use of extreme point estimates the use of such data in future regulatory efforts will help to provide reliable and adequate protection of public health minimize the overdesign and cost of treatment and maximize the availability and use of california water resources 5 conclusions high quality data on pathogen concentrations in raw wastewater are critical for confirming the level of treatment needed to reduce pathogen concentrations down to acceptable levels and adequately protect public health in dpr 120 raw wastewater samples were collected from five wwtps representing one quarter of the california population approximately 10 million people over a 14 month monitoring period and analyzed for five waterborne pathogens via nine microscopy culture and molecular methods the analytical methods were optimized to achieve high sensitivity in raw wastewater these methods and quality controls as detailed in the qapp are recommended for future pathogen monitoring campaigns or treatment performance studies it is recommended that future studies adhere tightly to qa qc protocols and that data be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure its accuracy and reproducibility the results from the 14 month monitoring campaign provide the industry with an extensive high quality dataset of pathogen distributions in raw wastewater as demonstrated by the large size of the dataset the high percentage of detects the consistent and high recovery efficiency and the use of matrix spikes to correct for losses declaration of

16245,the california state water resources control board is the first regulatory body in the united states to develop statewide regulations for direct potable reuse dpr to support this effort a pathogen monitoring campaign was undertaken to develop and implement an optimized standard operating protocol to better characterize the concentration of human pathogens in raw wastewater methods to detect relevant viral and protozoan pathogens in raw wastewater were optimized and implemented during a 14 month monitoring campaign over 120 samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants treating a quarter of california s population samples were analyzed for two protozoa cryptosporidium and giardia using microscopy methods three enteric viruses enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus using culture and or molecular methods and male specific coliphage using culture methods the method recovery efficiency was measured in every protozoa sample and every other virus sample to confirm minimum recovery efficiencies were achieved and to correct the concentrations for pathogen losses during sample processing the results from this study provide the industry with a large high quality dataset as demonstrated by the high degree of method sensitivity method recovery and qa qc steps such high quality data on pathogen concentrations in raw wastewater are critical for confirming the level of treatment needed to reduce pathogen concentrations down to acceptable levels for potable water in dpr projects graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pathogen concentrations wastewater monitoring potable reuse enterovirus cryptosporidium 1 introduction in the face of increasing water supply deficits and historic droughts communities across the american west are implementing bold plans to maximize the use of recycled water for instance the city of los angeles is pursuing efforts to recycle 100 of its wastewater by 2035 allowing it to produce 35 of its total supply through water reuse city of los angeles 2019 the city of san diego s pure water program will produce 40 of the city s supply through potable reuse projects by 2035 city of san diego 2021 one element that will aid in the widespread implementation of potable reuse is the regulatory flexibility to pursue the full spectrum of reuse types which would allow communities to tailor projects to address their local constraints the california state water resources control board state board has already completed regulations for groundwater recharge and reservoir water augmentation both of which are deemed indirect potable reuse ipr because the water must pass through an environmental buffer before distribution ddw 2018 the state board is also under legislative mandate to develop regulations by 2023 for direct potable reuse dpr in which water may go directly to consumers without relying on an environmental buffer the absence of an aquifer or reservoir presents new challenges for dpr pecson et al 2018 tchobanoglous et al 2015 in 2016 the state board and their dpr expert panel concluded that additional research was needed to address knowledge gaps for dpr particularly those dealing with the control of toxic chemical contaminants and pathogens olivieri et al 2016 swrcb 2016 because pathogens can cause infection and illness after a single exposure they require consistent and reliable control at all times even brief periods of reduced pathogen control performance may impact public health protection particularly in a dpr setting where there is no additional attenuation in the environment pecson et al 2017 soller et al 2018 determining the appropriate level of pathogen control requires two fundamental pieces of information knowledge of a the concentration of pathogens in the raw influent wastewater and b the much lower concentrations that are acceptable in a finished potable water the required level of pathogen control can then be estimated as the difference between the influent and effluent concentrations typically expressed as log10 reduction values lrvs beyond the seminal monitoring study conducted by rose et al 2004 only a handful of studies have characterized pathogen concentrations in raw us wastewaters in the last twenty years gennaccaro et al 2003 kitajima et al 2014 sedmak et al 2005 simmons et al 2011 simmons and xagoraraki 2011 the lack of such studies reflects the industry s historical efforts to separate wastewater from drinking water the growth of potable reuse however has motivated a number of utilities to better characterize the concentration of pathogens in wastewater and their removal through treatment plants trussell technologies 2017 2020 trussell technologies and michigan state university 2017 two important limitations of many previous monitoring studies include low method sensitivity resulting in non detect nd values and the lack of matrix spikes allowing for the calculation of and correction for recovery efficiency this study assessed the concentration of relevant pathogens in raw wastewater via a 14 month monitoring campaign conducted at five wastewater treatment plants wwtps treating sewage from one quarter of the california population approximately 10 million people from december 2019 through january 2021 the two principal objectives were to a develop an improved empirical dataset characterizing the concentration and variability of pathogen concentrations in raw wastewater and b develop recommendations for the collection and analysis of pathogen data in raw wastewater that address the limitations of previous monitoring efforts 2 methods raw wastewater samples were collected from five california wwtps to assess the distribution of pathogen concentrations 24 grab samples were collected from each wwtp over the duration of 14 months resulting in a total of 120 samples the samples were analyzed by three commercial laboratories for five pathogens representing both protozoa and virus the methods to concentrate and purify the samples for enumeration were optimized prior to the start of the 14 month campaign to increase the method sensitivity rigorous quality controls were established to ensure the reliability of the data produced the sample collection sample analysis using the optimized methods and quality controls are summarized below and described in detail in the project s publicly available quality assurance project plan qapp dpr 2 project team 2021 2 1 selection of pathogens to monitor two protozoa giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts and three viruses enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus were selected for the monitoring campaign giardia cryptosporidium and enteric viruses are currently regulated under the us epa s surface water treatment rules and california s ipr regulations ddw 2018 epa 1989 1998 2006 these pathogens have served as historical indicators of treatment performance because they are a representative of the different types of pathogens that occur in water b known to pose a high health burden in the us and c are relatively resistant to removal and inactivation processes regli et al 1991 scallan et al 2011 the campaign broadened beyond the historical pathogens to include additional virus including adenovirus via culture and molecular methods and three genogroups of norovirus via molecular methods 2 2 microorganisms

laboratories cel analytical san francisco ca biological consulting services gainesville fl and scientific methods granger in using standardized methods upon receipt by the laboratories samples were refrigerated at 4 c and processed within 72 h of sample collection wastewater agencies were selected that have either demonstrated interest in a future dpr project or have already committed to an ipr project the sampling schedule was developed with the intent to collect samples on different days of the week and at different times of day to capture as close to the full range of pathogen concentrations as possible due to staffing constraints samples were collected sunday through wednesday between the hours of 8 am and 3 pm pt a rotation was created to ensure that wastewater from each location was evaluated by all labs participating in the study an equal number of times over the testing period details of the sample collection shipping and handling are described in the quality

steps similarly once a month one positive control poliovirus in reagent water and one negative control reagent water were processed following the virus culture and molecular concentration purification and enumerations steps these positive controls were required to meet the following recovery efficiencies in line with epa 1615 and epa 1693 5 200 for poliovirus culture and molecular 18 100 for giardia colorseedtm and 14 100 for cryptosporidium colorseedtm epa 2014a b 2 6 evaluation of limit of detection and limit of quantification the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq for each method is a function of the instrument detection quantification limit method concentration factor cf and recovery as shown by the following equation m e t h o d l o d l o q i n s t r u m e n t l o d l o q c f r e c o v e r y where cf is a factor that accounts for the net change in sample volume through the method s concentration and dilution steps the equivalent sample volume which is the effective volume of original sample analyzed in the assay is calculated by the product of the concentration factor and the volume of the concentrate in the assay for the protozoa assays the instrument lod and loq were both taken to be 1 0 oo cyst per total volume of pellet analyzed for the virus culture assays the instrument lod was taken to be 0 95 mpn per inoculum volume analyzed based on the epa mpn calculator epa 2020 and the instrument loq was taken to be 1 0 mpn per inoculum volume analyzed for the molecular assays the instrument lod was determined by running 20 replicates of the standards at different concentrations and determining the concentration that resulted in 90 of the replicates showing amplification above the fluorescence threshold the loq was the concentration that resulted in the 20 replicates having a coefficient of variation cv of 35 or less where the cv is calculated using the following equation forootan et al 2017 c v 1 e s d 2 ln 1 e 1 e amplification efficiency sd standard deviation of cycle numbers for the replicates results that were below the lod were considered non detect nd and results that were between the lod and loq were considered detected but not quantifiable dnq because the molecular assays were run in triplicate and the concentration of the replicates was averaged if the concentrations in one or two of the molecular replicates were below the lod but the third replicate was above the lod the replicates below the lod were excluded from the average if all of the molecular replicates were below the lod the sample concentration was reported as nd if the concentration in a replicate was above the lod but below the loq the concentration for that replicate was set at one half of the loq and was then included in the average depending on the concentration in the other replicates the averaged concentration for that sample may or may not be below the loq 2 7 data analysis results were evaluated both with and without correcting for recovery efficiency the average of the ms2 and phix174 recovery was used to quantify the virus recovery efficiency since ms2 and phix174 recovery were measured in every other sample for a given wwtp linear interpolation using the previous and subsequent sample was used to determine the recovery for samples without a direct recovery measurement uncorrected and recovery corrected results were log10 transformed before proceeding with the statistical analysis the normal quantile probability plots were prepared by ranking all the data and assigning all nds and dnqs the same rank just below the lowest quantifiable measurement the probability percentile corresponding to each rank was then calculated using the following equation blom 1958 p e r c e n t i l e r a n k 0 375 t o t a l n u m b e r o f d a t a p o i n t s 0 25 the percentiles were transformed to z scores using a normal distribution table the log10 transformed concentrations were plotted against the z score and the probability percentiles were overlaid at the corresponding z scores nds and dnqs were plotted as blanks all statistical analysis of the data was performed in r r core team 2020 the shapiro wilk test was used to evaluate if the log10 transformed data were normally distributed p values greater than 0 05 indicate the distribution is not significantly different from a normal distribution the shapiro wilk test excludes nds and dnqs and the approach was considered appropriate given the low frequency of nds and dnqs for most of the pathogens for pathogens with higher frequencies of nds and dnqs e g adenovirus with the molecular method the normal quantile plot was visually inspected to qualitatively determine if the log10 transformed data were normally distributed the log10 transformed data were fit to a normal distribution using the function fitdistcens from the r package fitdistrplus which estimates the mean and standard deviation for censored datasets using maximum likelihood estimation delignette muller and dutang 2015 values below the loq i e both nd and dnq were considered left censored and the right bound for these censored datapoints was the loq for that measurement two approaches were used to perform one way comparisons the first approach was to use one way analysis of variance anova excluding all nds and dnqs a tukey post hoc test was used to perform multiple pair wise comparisons the second approach was to use a rank based test the kruskal wallis test and assign all nds and dnqs the same rank a post hoc test with bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed in both approaches comparisons with a p value less than 0 05 were considered significantly different 3 results 3 1 summary statistics the descriptive statistics for each pathogen and coliphage monitored

and adenovirus respectively the high detection rate was a result of the optimization process that increased method sensitivities allowing them to achieve the low lods and loqs one factor contributing to method sensitivity was the high recovery efficiency which was measured with matrix spikes in every protozoa sample and every other virus sample for each method the average recovery efficiency was over 38 furthermore 99 of the protozoa assays 99 of the virus culture assays and 97 of the virus molecular assays had a recovery of at least 10 distribution of recoveries shown in figs si 1 to si 8 a lower rate of detects was observed for the molecular methods compared to the microscopy and culture based methods despite the similar recovery efficiencies this discrepancy was likely because the equivalent sample volume for the molecular methods was lower than for the microscopy and culture methods and therefore the molecular method was limited by higher lods and loqs recovery efficiency studies verified that the ms2 and phix174 matrix spikes exhibited similar recovery efficiencies as poliovirus the average poliovirus recovery of triplicate culture assays was 11 compared to 36 and 16 for ms2 and phix174 respectively recovery correction for each round of sampling was based on an average recovery of the two bacteriophages in order to account for a range of viral characteristics due to the similarity of the phage and poliovirus recoveries ms2 and phix174 were deemed to be suitable surrogates for assessing virus recovery all pathogen distributions were well described by log10 normal distributions based on the shapiro wilk normality test the only exception was the adenovirus and norovirus gia molecular data which had a relatively high frequency of nds and dnqs consequently all pathogen concentration data were log10 transformed before calculating the descriptive statistics the mean and standard deviation for both the uncorrected and recovery corrected datasets are shown in table 3 due to the high recovery efficiency the corrected and uncorrected concentrations are within the same order of magnitude 3 2 distributions of pathogen concentrations distributions of the log10 transformed concentrations for each pathogen both with and without recovery correction are shown in fig 1 while the nds and dnqs in each dataset were not plotted they were considered in modeling the distributions the high sensitivity of the methods is illustrated by the fact that the dataset has quantifiable values at both the high and low ends of the distributions the two parameter log10 normal models that were fit for each distribution table 3 are overlaid with the empirical data in fig 1 the empirical data line up well with the log10 normal models in agreement with the results of the shapiro wilk normality test the distributions can be used to reassess the pathogen assumptions used in california s ipr regulations which were based on point estimates of 105 pathogens l for enteric virus and giardia and 104 pathogens l of cryptosporidium in raw wastewater hultquist 2016 the new empirical datasets reached these previous point estimates at the 99th 95th and 99th percentiles for the recovery corrected giardia enterovirus and adenovirus distributions respectively contrarily the cryptosporidium concentrations never reached the 104 oocysts l concentration during the campaign maximum value of 102 8 oocyst l after recovery correction and would not be modeled to reach those values until after the 99 999th percentile 3 3 geographic and temporal evaluation geographic variability was assessed by comparing the distributions at the five different monitoring facility locations the frequency of detects pathogen concentrations and recoveries at each of the five wwtps showed a high degree of similarity table si 6 and figs si 9 to si 17 both a one way anova test and a one way rank based test were used to compare each of the nine pathogen datasets at the five different locations of the 90 pair wise comparisons only five of the comparisons were statistically different for each test table 4 the cryptosporidium distribution observed at lasan was statistically higher than two to three other facilities depending on the statistical test similarly the virus distributions observed at san diego were statistically lower than those observed at two to three other facilities these findings should not obscure the main conclusions of the geographic evaluation which are that a 94 of the datasets had no significant differences between locations and b the handful of significant differences were generally small in magnitude between 0 27 and 0 78 log time series plots of the pathogen concentrations at each facility are shown for giardia and cryptosporidium fig 2 enterovirus fig 3 adenovirus fig 4 and norovirus figs si 18 si 19 and si 20 a rank based statistical test on the aggregated 120 sample dataset was used to compare the concentrations of giardia cryptosporidium enterovirus and adenovirus in the fall winter defined as october march to the concentration in the spring summer defined as april september only culturable enterovirus and molecular adenovirus had a statistical difference in concentration between the winter and summer the concentration of culturable enterovirus was higher in the summer while the concentration of molecular adenovirus was higher in the winter on march 19 2020 in response to the covid 19 pandemic california instituted a stay at home sah order that lasted through the end of the study the aggregated datasets were compared using a rank based statistical test kruskal wallis to assess whether and how the sah order impacted the raw wastewater pathogen concentrations the aggregated datasets before and after the sah order contained 36 and 84 datapoints respectively because the concentration of norovirus gia gib and gii was frequently below the loq during the duration of this campaign changes in concentration due to seasonality or the sah order could not be reliably evaluated with the exception of the molecular adenovirus data which decreased after the sah order there was no significant change in the giardia cryptosporidium enterovirus and adenovirus distributions before and after the sah order in addition to comparing the data before and after the sah order the pre covid winter months of december 2019 through march 2020 39 datapoints were compared against the covid impacted winters months of october 2020 through january 2021 32 datapoints using a kruskal wallis test similar to the sah results there was no significant change in the pathogen concentrations with the exception of molecular adenovirus which was lower in winter 2020 2021 and giardia which was higher in winter 2020 2021 4 discussion determining risk based treatment levels for potable reuse depends critically on high quality raw wastewater pathogen concentration data the following criteria were used to guide the design of this pathogen monitoring campaign and are recommended for the design of future campaigns large sample size high method sensitivity compatibility of methods with risk assessment recovery correction geographic distribution temporal distribution large sample size a minimum number of data points are needed to describe a distribution and account for the variability that may occur over the course of a day and across days seasons and years the collection of 24 samples at each site was sufficient to characterize variability over a wide range of the distribution from approximately the 5th to the 95th percentile this number of samples also matches the source water monitoring requirements for cryptosporidium under the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 which requires monthly sampling for a period of 24 months the 120 point datasets for the five pathogens evaluated via nine separate culture microscopy and molecular based methods represent the most comprehensive dataset reported in the literature to date this number of samples provides the ability to characterize the extremities of the distribution down to the 1st and up to the 99th percentile a higher number of data points also aids in fitting the distributions to parametric models the models offer the important benefit of predicting the likelihood of encountering concentrations outside of the range of the measured values method sensitivity and compatibility with risk assessment one important limitation of previous studies has been low method sensitivities that lead to non detect values this limitation is particularly notable for cryptosporidium where a survey of nine recent monitoring campaigns showed that the average percent of nds observed in a sampling campaign was 46 gennaccaro et al 2003 gray et al 2009 kitajima et al 2014 mccuin and clancy 2005 melbourne water 2011 robertson et al 2006 rose et al 2004 trussell technologies 2017 2018 through the optimization of the sops the culture and microscopy based assays averaged a detection rate over 90 this high detection rate is particularly important for these methods because they are the ones typically used to quantify pathogens for dose response studies haas et al 1999 culture data are more easily incorporated into microbial risk assessments than molecular data which typically require an additional step to translate from genome copies to infectious disease units as with increased sample size higher method sensitivities allow for a more complete characterization of the lower concentrations in the distributions and improves our ability to fit the data to models recovery correction a challenge in working with raw wastewater is the difficulty of isolating pathogens from a complex matrix a recent study comparing 36 methods for quantifying sars cov 2 in raw wastewater showed that recovery efficiency ranged from approximately 100 at the high end to 0 00001 at the low end i e seven orders of magnitude pecson et al 2021 in such cases not accounting for recovery efficiency could introduce a ten million fold factor of error when analyzing the same sample using the optimized analytical methods in this study a relatively high and consistent recovery efficiency was observed for all assays the average recovery efficiencies across all pathogens ranged from 39 to 56 meaning that the recovery corrected values were only approximately 2 to 3 fold higher than the uncorrected data while a handful of studies have conducted matrix spikes at the frequencies applied in this study mccuin and clancy 2005 melbourne water 2011 trussell technologies 2020 most studies did not measure or report recovery gray et al 2009 robertson et al 2006 rose et al 2004 sedmak et al 2005 simmons et al 2011 simmons and xagoraraki 2011 or achieved lower recovery efficiencies gennaccaro et al 2003 trussell technologies 2017 to assess recovery the use of matrix spikes is recommended for future studies one assumption that is needed is that the matrix spike behaves similarly to the pathogen of interest for the matrix spike to accurately reflect the recovery of the target pathogen it should behave similarly to the pathogen through each step of the enumeration method for the protozoa the colorseedtm matrix spike is essentially equivalent to the native giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts with the exception that they have been uniquely stained to distinguish them from the native protozoa in the case of the viruses two phages were used to assess the recovery of enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus based on results from the pre testing ms2 and phix174 demonstrated similar recoveries 26 to poliovirus 11 providing evidence that they are acceptable surrogates for assessing the fate of pathogenic enteric viruses therefore correcting for recovery in this study led to small but important increases that improved the accuracy of the concentrations additional studies that confirm the behavior of the matrix spike to the target pathogens would provide greater confidence in the accuracy of the correction the matrix spikes also provided the ability to monitor the reproducibility of the methods between labs between locations and over time at a given location based on the results of the monitoring campaign it is recommended that future pathogen studies include matrix spikes in all samples or as many as economically feasible to assess and correct for recovery efficiency geographic distribution raw wastewater samples were collected across california from five wwtps ranging in flows from 17 to 292 mgd the comparison of pathogen distributions across plants supports the conclusion that the pathogen concentrations do not vary widely in wastewaters across the state this finding is important because these five wwtps treat approximately one quarter of the sewage from california s diverse population while the data are highly relevant for california regulatory development the consistency across geographic regions and population make up suggests that they may be transferable to other regions additional studies in other regions are recommended to determine whether region specific factors impact raw wastewater concentrations including per capita water use stormwater contributions and the degree of industrial wastewater inputs into the collection system temporal distribution raw wastewater samples were collected over a period of 14 months to capture the variability of pathogen concentrations over two winter periods october to march and one summer april to september previous studies have noted seasonal variations in the prevalence of infections in california with norovirus cases peaking in december january and cryptosporidium cases peaking in august wigginton et al 2021 the seasonality of these clinical findings however was not evident in the wastewater concentrations which had relatively stable concentrations over the monitoring period a recent clinical study described decreases in the incidence of acute gastroenteritis in california that coincided with the covid 19 related sah order bulterys et al 2021 the number of reported cases of cryptosporidiosis also decreased in march of 2020 wigginton et al 2021 these findings have raised concerns that the wastewater concentrations measured in this study may also be lower than typical years two analyses were undertaken to evaluate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on the measured wastewater numbers 1 comparing pathogen concentrations before and after the sah order and 2 comparing datasets from similar timeframes in the pre covid winter of 2019 2020 and the mid covid winter of 2020 2021 in both cases there was no systematic change in the concentration of pathogens for a small number of cases the concentrations either were statistically lower molecular adenovirus or statistically higher giardia compared to the concentrations before the sah order but most pathogens showed no significant change one hypothesis to reconcile these two pieces of information is that acute gastrointestinal infections were not substantially decreased by the pandemic as evidenced by the wastewater pathogen data though infected individuals were less likely to seek clinical care the sah order played a critical role in limiting the spread of sars cov 2 the respiratory virus responsible for covid 19 but the impact on gastrointestinal pathogens was not evident in the data use of the data for regulatory development due to the dearth of reliable pathogen data in wastewater california regulators have used conservative point estimates rather than distributions to develop treatment requirements for ipr hultquist 2016 while the approach may have been appropriate given the lack of sufficient reliable data the use of the highest reported literature values adds a significant degree of conservatism that increases the degree cost and complexity of treatment the express purpose of developing the extensive dataset in this study was to develop high quality distributions that replace the previous point estimates while the new giardia and enterovirus culture data overlap with the previously used point estimates albeit at high percentile values fig 1 the new cryptosporidium distribution suggests that the 104 oocysts l point estimate represents an extremely high degree of conservatism in line with the earlier california dpr expert panel s findings and recommendations olivieri et al 2016 the new dataset and resulting distributions should be used to support the development of regulatory criteria using the modeled distributions in probabilistic assessments of treatment train performance and quantitative microbial risk assessment allows the full range of potential concentrations to be estimated rather than being limited to a bounded empirical dataset because the data collected from this effort meet the multiple strict requirements for quality and quantity the distributions can justifiably replace the historical use of extreme point estimates the use of such data in future regulatory efforts will help to provide reliable and adequate protection of public health minimize the overdesign and cost of treatment and maximize the availability and use of california water resources 5 conclusions high quality data on pathogen concentrations in raw wastewater are critical for confirming the level of treatment needed to reduce pathogen concentrations down to acceptable levels and adequately protect public health in dpr 120 raw wastewater samples were collected from five wwtps representing one quarter of the california population approximately 10 million people over a 14 month monitoring period and analyzed for five waterborne pathogens via nine microscopy culture and molecular methods the analytical methods were optimized to achieve high sensitivity in raw wastewater these methods and quality controls as detailed in the qapp are recommended for future pathogen monitoring campaigns or treatment performance studies it is recommended that future studies adhere tightly to qa qc protocols and that data be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure its accuracy and reproducibility the results from the 14 month monitoring campaign provide the industry with an extensive high quality dataset of pathogen distributions in raw wastewater as demonstrated by the large size of the dataset the high percentage of detects the consistent and high recovery efficiency and the use of matrix spikes to correct for losses declaration of

16246,phosphorus p an essential nutrient for all organisms urgently needs to be recovered due to the increasing demand and scarcity of this natural resource recovering p from wastewater is a feasible and promising way widely studied nowadays due to the need to remove p in wastewater treatment plants wwtps when enhanced biological p removal ebpr is implemented an innovative option is to recover p from the supernatant streams obtained in the mainstream water line and then combine it with liquor crystallisation recovery processes being the final recovered product struvite vivianite or hydroxyapatite the basic idea of these mainstream p recovery strategies is to take advantage of the ability of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao to increase p concentration under anaerobic conditions when some carbon source is available this work shows the mainstream p recovery technologies reported so far both in continuous and sequenced batch reactors sbr based configurations the amount of extraction as a key parameter to balance the recovery efficiency and the maintenance of the ebpr of the system should be the first design criterion the maximum value of p recovery efficiency for long term operation with an adequate extraction ratio would be around 60 other relevant factors e g cod p ratio of the influent need for an additional carbon source and operational parameters e g aeration srt hrt are also reported and discussed keywords configurations enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr mainstream phosphorus recovery precipitation 1 introduction the new paradigm in wastewater treatment proclaims that wastewater treatment plants wwtps should evolve to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs where resources and energy are recovered from water amongst all the potential resources to be recovered p arises as a perfect candidate since i in the current context of population and food demand growth p is essential for fertilizers production chowdhury et al 2017 cieślik and konieczka 2017 roy 2017 ii p is currently a pollutant of our wastewater which may promote eutrophication in water bodies if it is not removed and iii p is mainly obtained from non renewable sources such as phosphate rocks van vuuren et al 2010 which are expected to be depleted in only 50 100 years cordell et al 2009 desmidt et al 2015 rittmann et al 2011 for the full scale application of p recovery processes one of the main current limitations is that the market price table 1 of rock phosphate is lower than recovered products such as struvite however if the additional benefits of p recovery are accounted for significant incentives to support it emerge for example the need to treat the impurities in phosphate rock e g cadmium or uranium which can be highly toxic cornel and schaum 2009 or to avoid the need for external dependence on a strategic resource such as phosphate rock in addition p in urban wastewaters has to be removed anyway to avoid eutrophication processes making p recovery a win win scenario wwtps seem to be an adequate place to recover p since 1 3 mt of p are removed annually worldwide through wastewater treatment some estimates indicate that global demand for p could be covered by 15 20 with this recovery li and li 2017 wu et al 2019 yuan et al 2012 other studies indicate that in central europe p recovery from municipal wastewater would satisfy 40 50 of the mineral p fertilizer applied annually in agriculture egle et al 2016 furthermore from a life cycle assessment lca point of view it has been concluded that p recovery from municipal wastewater sludge liquor or ash of sludge mono incineration would provide environmental benefits remy and jossa 2015 although differences appear in the amount of p recovered requirements of energy chemicals and fuels or in side effects in the process p recovery processes can reduce environmental impacts mainly on global warming potential freshwater eutrophication of and fossil energy demand remy and jossa 2015 p recovery as struvite seems to be especially attractive for urban areas to satisfy the growing trend of local crop production linked to the large volumes of wastewater treated in centralized wwtps rufí salís et al 2020 in this recent lca study three recovery technologies were analysed for large wwtps showing that were able to recover 5 30 times the amount of p required to fertilize the agricultural area of the studied region annually 36 5 t although there was an increase of chemicals and energy requirements per m3 of wastewater due to struvite recovery it resulted in lower eutrophication potential 1 1 fate of p in wwtps the fate of the influent p in a wwtp depends on its configuration part of the influent p is removed with the primary sludge around 11 according to cornel and schaum 2009 if the plant does not implement enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in the secondary step approximately 15 30 of the p in the influent becomes part of the biomass a conventional wwtp sludge contains around 1 2 of p according to mass basis and removed with the purged sludge henze et al 2008 parsons and smith 2008 then if complete p removal is mandatory the remaining p should be chemically removed with addition of fe iii and al iii salts in different dosing points such as the primary sedimentation before and or following biological treatment or in a tertiary treatment tchobanoglous et al 2014 however the chemical sludge produced is not recommended as fertiliser since these salts could reduce the mobility of p in soils where this chemical sludge is applied desmidt et al 2015 sartorius et al 2012 the sludge generated is often accumulated in landfills or burnt in incinerators and may end up contaminating water bodies such as aquifers rivers or sea mainstone et al 2000 alternatively the use of ashes from sewage sludge incinerators is proposed for p recovery ma and rosen 2021 and to produce fertilizers via a chemical extraction fang et al 2021 j li et al 2018 the fate of p in wwtps that include ebpr is very different ebpr is based on the proliferation of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao which can accumulate phosphate internally as polyphosphate poly p under aerobic or anoxic conditions after being exposed to anaerobic conditions with available carbon source then p is removed as poly p inside cell biomass by waste sludge tchobanoglous et al 2014 pao can incorporate up to 0 38 mg p mg vss compared to the 0 02 mg p mg vss incorporated by the ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho gebremariam et al 2011 henze et al 2008 yuan et al 2012 ebpr based wwtps can typically remove more than 85 of the p from the influent that is stored within the biomass bunce et al 2018 gebremariam et al 2011 the reported range of the p content in ebpr based sludge is around 0 06 0 15 mg p mg vss henze et al 2008 however the use of this sewage sludge in agriculture is nowadays limited in many areas because of the ecological and health threats involved for example it is estimated that only about 20 of the sewage sludge meets the eu regulations for fertilizers in terms of concentration of heavy metals or radioactive elements e g radon and uranium european commission 2019 pettersson et al 2008 weigand et al 2013 there is another reason to implement p recovery strategies in ebpr based wwtps the clogging of tubes and pumps due to undesired struvite precipitation is observed when the bio p sludge undergoes anaerobic digestion and p recovery is not implemented d wild et al 1996 doyle and parsons 2002 the repair of this clogging is costly due to the need to shut down and clean the clogged equipment in a modelling study lizarralde et al 2019 constructed a plant wide model to understand the effect of several operational parameters on the uncontrolled struvite precipitation when ebpr was implemented they concluded that struvite recovery has many benefits for the plant not only for its commercial value but also for the reduction of sludge production ferric chloride dosage and the prevention of uncontrolled struvite precipitation 1 2 most studied technologies for p recovery in wwtps different technologies have been proposed for p recovery from flows containing phosphorus in wwtp i e effluent sewage sludge sludge ash dewatering liquor and digester supernatant providing different operability costs and potential uses of the recovered material cieślik and konieczka 2017 desmidt et al 2015 egle et al 2016 law and pagilla 2018 egle et al 2016 indicated that an ideal technology should provide good p removal from wastewater maximize p recovery rate destroy hazardous substances and produce a material that could be applied with low environmental risks good fertilizing effects and high economic efficiency they also studied all these characteristics from 19 different p recovery technologies and concluded that the choice of a specific recovery technology is a compromise amongst these factors furthermore the lca analysis by amann et al 2018 showed wide range of changes in gaseous emissions energy demand and p recovery potential of different technologies based on liquid phase sewage sludge and ash and concluded that lca should be combined with additional environmental criteria to put the performance of the technologies into perspective considering the wide range of existing p recovery processes this section presents the most studied ones classified in two groups depending on whether they can be obtained from primary secondary effluents or from the sludge line and includes another subsection showing the crystallisation processes that could be applied to p enriched streams to make p recovery effective section 2 then presents the p recovery processes related to mainstream strategies that are the focus of this review 1 2 1 p recovery from primary or secondary effluents p recovery from primary or secondary effluents using chemical precipitation does not seem to be a cost effective alternative because it would require a large amount of chemicals cornel and schaum 2009 desmidt et al 2015 egle et al 2016 several alternative methodologies have been described previously egle et al 2015 kabdaşlı and tünay 2018 for instance liberti et al 1979 reported a methodology based on the combination of ion exchange ix for phosphate selective exchange and p recovery from the concentrated stream by struvite precipitation which was further evaluated in subsequent works liberti et al 2001 petruzzelli et al 2003 williams et al 2015 studied p and n removal with media based on fe cu and al and then precipitation columns with clinoptilolite ix they achieved almost 84 of p recovery and a regeneration eluate with concentration up to 560 mg p l 1 beaudry and sengupta 2021 used a novel pyridine based polymeric ion exchanger and three different fixed bed columns producing an effluent concentration with p 6 μg l and recovering about 90 of the phosphorus the hybrid anion exchanger haix which consists of a hybrid polymeric base dispersed with hydrated ferric oxide hfo nanoparticles has also been reported for p removal martin et al 2018 2009 sendrowski and boyer 2013 phosphate uptake is based on the selective sorption sites with hfo nanoparticles which form sphere complexes with fe iii and phosphate blaney et al 2007 after long term sorption phosphate breakthrough occurs but the exhausted haix can be reused with a regeneration phase with naoh nacl solution and finally a rinse with co2 sparged filtered water blaney et al 2007 a recent work by guida et al 2021 evaluated a large 10 m3 d haix system for 2 5 years using treated municipal wastewater showing high p removal 95 i e from 6 to 0 3 mg po4 3 p l and recovery efficiency 95 of phosphate from the wastewater recovered as hydroxyapatite in subsequent work the regeneration of the media and the modelling of this system were also studied pinelli et al 2022 however the feasibility of this methodology at full scale has not been proved yet egle et al 2015 rufí salís et al 2020 siciliano et al 2020 apart from the above mentioned approach microalgae cultivation has been proposed as a promising technology for p recovery from secondary effluents due to its low cost eco friendliness and low technology dependence yang et al 2017 p is taken up biologically by algal growth by assimilation accompanied by oxygen generation that supports aerobic bacteria growth algae can also be used either as a feedstock for biofuel production or directly as a biofertilizer chisti 2013 2008 el hamouri 2009 showed that 63 of influent p could be removed and incorporated into algae as a tertiary treatment using a high rate algal pond xu et al 2016 2015 also showed that algae could remove about 60 of influent phosphorus for secondary wastewater effluent however the application of algae for p recovery is still limited in large scale wastewater treatment gebremariam et al 2011 1 2 2 p recovery from the sludge line as mentioned above the maximum p recovery potential is from ebpr based sludge however this option is not straightforward for instance the agricultural application of stabilized sludge with high p content hester and harrison 2013 has to consider the strict national health and safety restrictions on nutrients and heavy metals this hinders the agricultural application of sludge and thus this pathway of p recovery law and pagilla 2018 another option is the incinerated sludge ashes which may contain 4 to 11 of p biswas et al 2009 donatello et al 2010 franz 2008 ottosen et al 2013 however as a result of the organic matter oxidation the heavy metal content in these ashes may be even higher than the sludge itself therefore a chemical franz 2008 ottosen et al 2013 or thermochemical adam et al 2007 process is needed to separate the p from the heavy metals of the ashes wet chemical treatment by acid alkaline or both have been proposed for the dissolution of p law and pagilla 2018 acid leaching sulphuric or nitric acid is proposed for fe rich ashes ottosen et al 2013 while the combination of both acid and alkaline treatment is proposed for al rich ashes petzet et al 2012 the most reported location to recover p is a liquid stream from the sludge line either from the sludge treatment or the anaerobic digestion egle et al 2015 the treatment of the purged secondary sludge releases soluble phosphate and ammonium resulting in a supernatant with increased concentrations of these compounds these streams can contain up to 30 of the influent p loads levlin and hultman 2003 reviewed several side stream based p recovery strategies and concluded that p recovery efficiency about 60 65 is achieved from these streams 1 2 3 crystallization processes for p recovery crystallization is nowadays the most accepted strategy for recovering p from these enriched liquors being struvite the preferred precipitation product le corre et al 2009 li et al 2019 rittmann et al 2011 struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o can be applied directly to the field as a slow release fertiliser also providing nitrogen n and magnesium mg to the soil and has been reported to be a good option for agricultural uses hu et al 2016 sometimes ammonium in struvite can be replaced by potassium and then the precipitate is known as k struvite ronteltap et al 2007 the reactions to precipitate struvite and k struvite and their corresponding solubility are presented in table 2 fig 1 presents a graphical representation of the minimum magnesium mg2 concentration needed to reach the struvite solubility product at different ph as a function of phosphate and ammonium concentration as observed significant concentrations of p mg2 nh4 and high ph around 9 10 are needed so that struvite crystallisation becomes thermodynamically favourable struvite precipitation in streams with low concentration of phosphate or ammonium or low ph as the influent or effluent of wwtps becomes an unaffordable option because of the requirement of adding high amount of magnesium e g see fig 1 at the condition of ph 7 in any case there are successful reports of p recovery as struvite under full scale conditions using side streams obtained from the sludge line desmidt et al 2015 jabr et al 2019 law and pagilla 2018 le corre et al 2009 mayer et al 2016 and successfully marketed technologies for the recovery of struvite include amongst others ostara airprex multiform dhv crystalactor and nuresys law and pagilla 2018 however struvite crystallization also has some drawbacks in its practical application for example an unsatisfactory recovery efficiency related to the total p load in the raw sludge in the range 45 80 in some full scale projects for p recovery from digested sludge or liquor as reported by remy and jossa 2015 vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is an alternative valuable product for p recovery it has a high market value table 1 as it is a relatively slow release fertilizer widely found in soils lake sediments hydrothermal deposits or bogs wu et al 2019 moreover the precipitating agent iron is a common dissolved mineral in natural water and fe iii salts are commonly used for improving sludge settleability li et al 2014 and odour control zhang et al 2009 the reaction to precipitate vivianite and its solubility is presented in table 2 the theoretical molar ratio of fe p to form vivianite is 1 5 1 but the optimal stoichiometric ratio range applied is 1 5 2 considering some of fe ii could be transformed to fe oh 2 or oxidized to fe iii priambodo et al 2017 the formation condition of vivianite is less dependant on ph i e adequate range is 6 9 compared to struvite 8 9 5 vivianite can be precipitated from the digested sewage sludge prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 wastewater wu et al 2019 and aqueous solutions liu et al 2018 some researchers have shown that about 62 of p could be precipitated to vivianite from an anaerobic digestate with a ph around 8 li li and li 2018 priambodo et al 2017 however the p recovery process as vivianite also has disadvantages i the formation of vivianite in the sludge produces small crystals or aggregates 10 150 μm resulting in a complex separation from sludge and ii vivianite usually contains calcium or magnesium impurities robles et al 2020 impure vivianite is less stable since it can be oxidized within 48 h in contrast to the several weeks of stability reported for pure vivianite wilfert et al 2018 in addition separation and purification methods for vivianite still need further development robles et al 2020 another alternative to struvite is hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh hap can be directly used as a fertilizer in the field of agriculture johansson et al 2017 mayer et al 2016 and as an adsorbent for removing dyes emerging pollutants and heavy metals maity et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 it is of great potential for p recovery since calcium phosphate has a large market driver et al 1999 and thus it is expected to be of essential importance for the closure of p cycle leinweber et al 2018 the reaction to precipitate hap and its solubility is presented in table 2 hap is thermodynamically the most stable phase for orthophosphate and calcium in solution within a broad range of ph of 4 12 cichy et al 2019 oubagha et al 2017 when dealing with the common problem of low p concentration in municipal wastewater hap is a more attractive option than struvite since struvite demands higher enriched p for example although this is highly specific depending on the ph and species concentration for a typical wastewater composition 8 mgpo4 3 p l and 40 mgnh4 n l and based on the hap and struvite solubility the addition of 10 mgca2 l and 10 mgmg2 l at ph 8 or higher leads to almost complete precipitation of ca to produce hap whereas struvite is not formed even at a higher ph thus some works have exploited this facility of hap to precipitate and evaluated p recovery strategies in lab scale systems berg et al 2005 zou and wang 2016 however hap could lose advantage over struvite precipitation when aiming at a simultaneous recovery of n and p in real industrial wastewater treatment cichy et al 2019 in addition hap has lower potential for fertilizer use robles et al 2020 2 potential p recovery from mainstream p recovery via precipitation e g struvite k struvite hap vivianite requires a high concentration of p for displacing the solubility equilibrium to the precipitation side fig 1 as described before in ebpr based wwtps digestate is a common option to precipitate recover p since the sludge entering anaerobic digestion contains a high amount of internally stored p as poly p that can be easily released inside the digester and results in a high concentration of p into the digestate the digestate also contains high ammonia concentration and thus seems to be a favourable option for struvite precipitation however these systems also bring disadvantages such as undesired precipitation in the anaerobic digester or in the downstream tubing and instrumentation doyle and parsons 2002 on the other hand the high concentration of some ions in the anaerobic digestion sludge e g calcium could hinder the precipitation of p as struvite since when p is released it can precipitate as other compounds such as hap brushite and other calcium phosphates in any case to determine the actual precipitation competition in a given anaerobic digestion scenario not only solubility has to be taken into account but also kinetics d wild et al 1996 apart from the digestate the other location with the highest p concentration in an ebpr plant is the anaerobic reactor and thus it can be an alternative for p recovery during the anaerobic phase pao have taken up most of the readily biodegradable cod and most of the p has been released into the bulk liquid reaching levels from 30 to 70 mg p l acevedo et al 2015 izadi et al 2021 2020 zhang et al 2020 zou and wang 2016 therefore the anaerobic reactor appears as a good point to implement mainstream p recovery whilst the digestate seems to be the ideal point for side stream p recovery the integration of ebpr and mainstream p recovery as struvite would be beneficial to prevent undesired precipitation throughout the plant and to reduce n load when treating wastewater with high ammonium concentration 1 g of p removed as struvite yields 7 92 g of struvite containing 0 45 g of n thus it shows a good potential for improving system performance and for this reason it has recently received the attention of researchers e g acevedo et al 2015 larriba et al 2020 shi et al 2016 zou and lu 2016 the first proposal on the potential to obtain a p rich liquor from the mainstream anaerobic reactor was reported by van loosdrecht et al 1998 the biological chemical p and n removal bcfs process fig 2 a bcfs was a modification of the uct design where a stream from the anaerobic reactor for instance an average flow of 10 of the influent flow was sent to a sludge thickener and a phosphate stripper where fecl3 was dosed for p precipitation thus a continuous ebpr operation and a p chemical precipitation system were combined modelling was used to better understand this process and to assess its performance under different scenarios barat and van loosdrecht 2006 hao and van loosdrecht 2006 hao and van loosdrecht 2006 simulated the effect of anaerobic stripping on the p removal and recovery performance within the bcfs frame and reported an optimal stripping flow rate ratio flow rate of supernatant flow rate of influent of 0 2 to favour p recovery higher values resulted in decreased pao activity and lower values in low p recovery see section 3 2 for the discussion of this effect moreover they showed that the system could operate with a lower influent cod p ratio without hindering pao activity the ratio could be decreased from 20 to 10 g cod g p and the system could still meet the discharge requirements of p 1 mg p l and maintain 36 of p recovery this first experimental attempt of mainstream p recovery already showed that there is a maximum threshold value for the amount of p extracted barat and van loosdrecht 2006 implemented the model of the hardenberg wwtp and simulated different control strategies to explore the p recovery potential of the bcfs configuration they stated that the maximum potential p recovery without affecting pao activity was 60 of the influent p following this first report several other works have presented configurations taking advantage of the pao capability to increase p concentration under anaerobic conditions baeza et al 2017 shi et al 2016 wong et al 2013 the p recovery efficiencies of the evaluated works were calculated according to eqs 1 2 and 3 1 p o u t p e f f p b i o 2 p a s p i n f p o u t 3 p r p a s p i n f 100 where pout represents the p output per day in the effluent peff plus in the purged biomass pbio pas the p in the anaerobic supernatant thus available for p recovery pinf the total input of p in the influent to the secondary treatment per day and pr the p recovery efficiency pinf is highly influenced by the configuration of the primary treatment typical p removal values around 11 have been reported for conventional primary treatments cornel and schaum 2009 but these values can be increased considerably to values of 40 99 if chemical dosing is used in the primary settler as in the chemically enhanced primary treatment cept processes shewa and dagnew 2020 the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows the studies related to mainstream p recovery currently available in the literature are briefly described in the following two subsections classified by their operation mode section 2 1 for sequencing batch reactors sbrs and section 2 2 for continuous systems this classification separates sbr configurations which offer greater configurability than continuous systems although they are typically used for lab scale evaluation of different operating strategies from continuous systems which offer more stable operation and are more suitable for full scale implementation although the achievable p concentration is typically lower after this schematic description section 3 critically discusses the most important factors affecting p recovery sbr vs continuous configurations extraction ratio influent cod p ratio concentration of p in the recovered stream carbon source needs and future outlook 2 1 sbr configurations most of the configurations for mainstream p recovery studied in previous works have been based on sbr operation table 3 fig 3 the supernatant after the anaerobic phase is used for p recovery since it has the highest p concentration in all the cycle sbrs provide greater flexibility than continuous systems for research studies and the fact that particular actions can be taken in a single cycle such as extra cod dosing or supernatant extraction facilitates the understanding of p recovery performance under different operation modes for example some authors have evaluated the effects of sporadic extractions of anaerobic supernatant and others have tested the automated extraction every single cycle long term operation is in general required to demonstrate the ability of these two different approaches to maintain stable pao activity despite the extractions as a decrease in p availability may hinder pao metabolism wong et al 2013 reported a novel two step biofilm fig 3c process to facilitate anoxic p recovery in the first step the pao enriched biofilm was immersed into a diluted wastewater stream f1 so that the biomass could take up p and nitrate to remove p and n of the wastewater in a second step the biofilm was subjected to a carbon enriched stream f2 under anaerobic conditions where acetate was taken up and p was released then the biofilm acted under aerobic condition storing p from wastewater and under anaerobic condition releasing p and hence allowing the generation of an enriched p recovery stream the anaerobic supernatant volume 1 8 l was four times lower than the initial volume of wastewater 7 2 l and achieved a p concentration almost 4 times higher 28 vs 7 mg p l an additional experiment was conducted to improve the system efficiency they applied a highly enriched carbon stream after 10 cycles of normal operation and they obtained an anaerobic supernatant around 100 mg p l which is theoretically high enough for an efficient p recovery by struvite rittmann et al 2011 nevertheless they did not test the effect of extracting this p on pao survival neither in a short term nor a long term basis xia et al 2014 studied a configuration where a fraction of the anaerobic mixed liquor from a parent ebpr sbr was treated in a separate batch reactor and intermittent external carbon source was dosed to stimulate p release in view of p recovery the sludge from this batch reactor was separated with a non woven cloth and recycled to the parent sbr whereas the supernatant was treated with mgcl2 6h2o to recover p as mg3 po4 2 thus dosing 10 of additional carbon source in the batch reactor resulted in the recovery of 79 of the p in the influent in single cycle the authors applied this new p recovery sequence for nearly one month in only one out of four cycles although recommended to evaluate this approach in a longer period acevedo et al 2015 investigated a comparable ebpr sbr configuration but the extra carbon was dosed in situ in the anaerobic phase the frequency of this extra carbon addition and subsequent anaerobic extraction for potential p recovery was varied in different sets of experiments two times per week with low p extraction or once per week but with high p extraction their results were promising since they obtained 59 recovery of the influent p when extracting p two times per week and 81 when they extracted once per week in the latter case they used an extra vfa addition of 9 of the usual load no p removal deterioration was observed in the cycle after both extractions but the long term impact of a p recovery strategy with continuous extraction of p was not investigated lv et al 2014 studied a 10 l ebpr sbr system to investigate the effect of the extraction of 5 l of supernatant enriched in p for subsequent chemical precipitation supernatant that was obtained after an additional anaerobic settling period the supernatant was treated with fecl3 for p precipitation and the treated supernatant was returned to the aerobic stage this extraction was applied to the sbr once every 3 cycles for a long term and observed the decrease of p release p uptake and the concentration of intracellular poly p ebpr activity was deteriorated and p removal efficiency decreased to about 75 they disabled the p recovery strategy and tried to recover the ebpr activity by operating under conventional anaerobic aerobic conditions but the system did not recover after that work lv and yuan 2015 demonstrated that the same system could have a successful short term performance 40 d when 50 of anaerobic supernatant with a concentration of 39 4 mg p l was extracted the recovery process was operated in another separated reaction sedimentation basin with fecl3 as a precipitating agent and half of the anaerobic supernatant was removed for p recovery ebpr activity was strongly limited because of the shortage of poly p as a continuous stripping of 40 d and it could not be recovered even though the stripping was stopped for 60 d in the same direction guisasola et al 2019 proposed the operation with an automated extraction of anaerobic supernatant every cycle to understand the p recovery capacity in a long term basis but without any external dose of additional organic carbon fig 3a thus the anaerobic p concentration was lower than in the previous reports since it was the routine anaerobic p concentration of the system they demonstrated that a successful p recovery strategy could be maintained with 1 l 10 of reactor volume 20 of the influent of automated anaerobic extraction per cycle during more than 120 days without any deleterious effect on ebpr activity they tried to push the system into the limits and operated with other cod p ratios and different extraction conditions in order to investigate two different aspects the minimum initial cod p ratio and the maximum amount of p extraction that the system could tolerate without the loss of the pao activity they demonstrated that up to 60 of the influent p could be recovered when extracting 10 of the anaerobic volume per cycle without any harmful effect on pao activity and that the system could be operated under low cod p ratios i e 7 5 gcod gp zu nan he and liu 2020 also used a lab scale sbr to study the effect of the volume of anaerobic extraction on the biological c and p removal performance different extraction ratio of anaerobic supernatant 30 60 and 90 were tested for p recovery as vivianite extraction was carried out every fourth cycle p removal efficiency was improved when increasing from 30 to 60 of the extraction volume however the phosphorus balance and the pao population severely deceased under the extraction ratio of 90 the harm was irreversible even after a long term normal operation without stripping process in addition to p removal and p recovery some researchers have studied the simultaneous p and n recovery from mainstream in a batch system configuration shi et al 2016 proposed an anaerobic anoxic nitrifying induced crystallization ic sbr configuration fig 3b named as a2n ic sbr for n p removal and p recovery which was composed of three different sbrs a a o sbr n sbr and ic sbr with 10 10 and 1 3 l nitrifiers oxidised ammonium to nitrate which was denitrified by denitrifying pao dpao linked to p uptake during this process 1 3 l of anaerobic supernatant extraction was sent to the ic column with calcite seeds for p recovery the percentage of chemical p removal with respect to the total p removal was 14 9 17 1 similarly zou and wang 2016 implemented a lab scale ebpr p recovery process aiming at removing cod nutrients and recovering p which consisted of a dpao enriched sbr operated with anaerobic aerobic anoxic mode and an ic p recovery column the ic column received part of the supernatant obtained after a post anaerobic settling phase and the ic supernatant was returned to the anoxic phase with external nitrate solution dosage the system was operated with either synthetic around 250 mg cod l or real domestic wastewater cod concentration between 153 and 223 mg cod l they achieved successful n and p removal and p recovery efficiency via hap precipitation the average removal efficiencies were 82 6 87 5 and 91 6 for cod p and n respectively the flow ratio of anaerobic supernatant to influent from 0 to 0 5 was varied and the maximum p recovery as hap up to 59 was achieved at a ratio of 0 3 salehi et al 2019 explored the possibility of a simultaneous nitrification denitrification and p removal sndpr process for nutrient removal and p recovery a lab scale anaerobic aerobic sbr was employed with synthetic wastewater feeding they achieved anaerobic liquor with high p concentration i e around 100 mg l in granular sndpr process with an influent p of 10 mg l and a low cod 200 mg l yu et al 2021 used an anaerobic aerobic lab scale sbr 5 4 l to promote biological c n and p removal biological nitrogen removal bnr was achieved with low do during the aerobic phase and thus simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was promoted successful nutrient removal was stable for a long period 310 d under different anaerobic supernatant extraction ratios 0 1 12 1 9 1 6 and low do conditions 0 6 and 1 mg l more than 40 of p could be recovered as struvite due to these extractions the reactor began to deteriorate and the efficiency of p removal decreased to 60 when operating the system with the lowest do of 0 2 mg l and a relatively high extraction ratio 1 9 and no p recovery was found afterwards they proposed a do of 0 6 mg l and an extraction ratio of 1 6 in view of saving energy and an optimal condition of do of 1 mg l and extraction ratio of 1 9 to maximise the process performance some modelling studies have been reported about mainstream p recovery with sbr systems baeza et al 2017 simulated an ebpr based sbr configuration for p recovery named ebpr2 a typical ebpr anaerobic aerobic cycle configuration was modified including after the anaerobic phase a settling and decanting phase where the p enriched stream was extracted for p recovery fig 3a they simulated different scenarios and showed that it was possible to obtain a stable operation with a high amount of p recovered up to 63 when the supernatant extraction in each cycle was 5 of the reactor volume moreover total p removal was achieved regardless of cod fractionation in the wastewater in addition they proposed the inclusion of anaerobic sludge purging which could be a good option in view of a higher energy recovery i e increasing biochemical methane potential per gram of volatile suspended solid sludge obtained from the anaerobic phase contains a higher concentration of poly hydroxyalkanoate pha which would boost the production of methane during anaerobic digestion chan et al 2020a the highest pha production was obtained by extracting 4 3 of the reactor volume per cycle taking into account the previous simulations and the pilot plant experiments of a two sludge configuration with ebpr and via nitrite n removal marcelino et al 2011 a new two sludge process including p recovery was designed larriba et al 2020 this novel configuration fig 3d was named shortcut enhanced p and pha recovery mainstream scepphar and was tested in a large demo pilot scale total volume of 7 8 m3 fed with real primary influent larriba et al 2020 it consisted of a two sludge sbr system het sbr was operated as a conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o ebpr sbr and aut sbr was aerobic and aimed at a complete or partial nitrification a third crystallization reactor pre sbr was designed so that the supernatant extracted after the anaerobic phase of het sbr could be used for p recovery an additional interchange vessel was required to interchange supernatants amongst these reactors in order to avoid idle phases and to ensure that all three reactors could operate simultaneously rather than sequentially this configuration was operated successfully for a long term for c n and p removal 86 12 93 9 and 79 6 with either full nitrification or nitrite shortcut p recovery as struvite was carried out in this third reactor by mg2 dosing at a ph of 8 5 allowing the recovery of an average of 45 of the influent p as struvite precipitate with a maximum peak of 63 2 2 continuous configurations this section details the reported alternatives for p recovery from mainstream with continuous configurations in addition to the seminal bcfs process discussed above van loosdrecht et al 1998 continuous systems are often used to test the p recovery strategies previously developed in sbr mode under these conditions part of the anaerobic supernatant is diverted to a p recovery equipment and in some cases the flow is returned to the system after p is recovered for instance an anaerobic anoxic nitrifying a2n continuous configuration combined with an induced p crystallisation ic column was proposed by shi et al 2012 for mainstream p recovery in addition to removal of cod n and p fig 2b part of the p enriched anaerobic supernatant was extracted to precipitate calcium phosphate crystals in the ic column the conventional a2n system performance was compared to that of a2n ic a2n ic showed a more stable performance than a2n the authors used a wide range of cod p ratios from 17 7 to 67 4 g cod gp and found that the p removal efficiency was consistently maintained at 99 2 for a2n ic regardless of the influent cod p ratio tested however the a2n process reduced p removal efficiency from 93 0 to 65 7 when the influent cod p ratio was decreased from 67 4 to 17 7 gcod gp p recovery in the a2n ic process ranged from 8 9 to 12 9 when the influent cod p ratio was reduced from 67 4 to 19 9 gcod gp later zou and wang 2017 used the same configuration and studied the effect of various operational conditions on the ic performance and optimized the crystal dose acting as a seed ph temperature do molar ca p ratio and reaction time in view of boosting p recovery they showed that on the optimal conditions 80 min ph of 8 5 molar ca p ratio of 2 0 60 g l seed crystal loads and 4 0 l min of aeration flow the system reached an excellent p recovery of 92 3 in addition they found that the temperature had a slight effect on induced hap crystallization thus benefiting the integration of ebpr with induced hap crystallization in a similar configuration dai et al 2017 evaluated the influence of the flow of the anaerobic supernatant to ic in a long run over 180 d and found that the optimal ratio of anaerobic supernatant extracted to influent was 0 3 under these conditions p recovery efficiency reached 72 4 at the optimal hrt 0 5 h in ic reactor higher extraction ratios could disrupt system stability without enhancing p recovery and could induce a change of the activated sludge characteristics since it favoured the percentage of extracellular polymeric substances of the sludge the same authors reported a modelling study about the continuous a2n ic aiming at finding the optimal conditions to maximize energy savings and minimize emission reduction dai et al 2019 their results indicated that p recovery decreased with the reduction of the extraction ratio and the ic volume kodera et al 2013 studied a configuration based on a pao enriched biotrickling filter exposed alternatively to anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig 2d p uptake by pao was promoted under aerobic conditions when the filter treated by recirculation a synthetic stream emulating an urban wastewater which contained a low concentration of p 5 mg p l for the anaerobic phase the system required a stream with vfa to enhance p release with up to 2000 mg cod l which could be generated by primary sludge fermentation although in this work a synthetic stream was used the effluent from the anaerobic phase had a high concentration of p 125 mg p l that was adequate for p recovery the system operated for a long period of time 250 d with this configuration obtaining a p recovery of almost 60 of the influent p in the frame of the cultivation of microalgae for p recovery valverde pérez et al 2015 proposed a novel model based design of p removal and recovery system consisting of a conventional continuous a2o operation where nitrification was suppressed at low do fig 2c the objective was to produce a nutrient medium for microalgae cultivation to produce biofuel or a natural fertiliser for direct use in agriculture the p recovered for algae cultivation was obtained from the anaerobic effluent as a stream with high p concentration they investigated the potential p recovery under different scenarios of do and srt and obtained a maximum of 70 p recovery of influent p when 30 of the influent flow was diverted as a p stream and the system was operated at srt 5 d at do 1 5 mg l nitrification was still being inhibited due to this low do and p uptake was favoured increasing p recovery up to 75 3 discussion amongst the different locations for p recovery in ebpr based wwtps the supernatant of the anaerobic reactor has recently gained attention since mainstream p recovery would i mitigate undesired precipitation of p in the sludge line ii reduce the cod requirements for p removal iii enable the treatment of wastewater with lower cod p ratio and iv depending on the recovery agent decrease the n load to the plant and thus its operational costs as detailed above mainstream p recovery can be achieved with different configurations and thus several operation parameters are essential for an efficient p recovery performance tables 3 and 4 summarize the different reported proposals for the implementation of p recovery from mainstream and lists for each case the applied equipment and recovery methods basic operation parameters srt hrt operation temperature aeration ph extraction volume and frequency and influent characteristics 3 1 sbr vs continuous configurations for mainstream p recovery mainstream p recovery under sbr conditions is based on extracting part of the supernatant once the anaerobic phase is finished whereas it consists of diverting part of the anaerobic liquid to a p recovery unit under continuous conditions most reports on mainstream p recovery employed lab scale sbrs table 3 as sbrs have several advantages compared to continuous systems on the one hand it is easier to obtain a biomass free anaerobic supernatant as a settling phase can be easily included after the anaerobic phase whereas in the case of continuous system a membrane or a combined settling reactor biomass recycle would be needed sekine et al 2018 moreover sbrs show a lower space requirement and lower configuration and installation costs as well as the flexibility to face operational or influent variations jiang et al 2016 tomei et al 2016 however it can also lead to higher operational costs and capital expenditures due to its discontinuous operation as reported in larriba et al 2020 when comparing the mainstream scepphar configuration to a conventional continuous a2o configuration 3 2 extraction ratio as mentioned before the key operational parameter for efficient p recovery is the extraction ratio i e the percentage of anaerobic volume extracted for an sbr or the flow diverted from the anaerobic reactor to the p recovery unit for a continuous system high anaerobic extraction volumes should be chosen to maximise p recovery but too high values may hinder p storage activity of pao the rationale is that the effect of internal poly p limitations is not observed with single periodic extraction or in the short term but after several cycles high p extraction values would deplete the internal poly p reserves and pao would lose the competitive advantage versus other microorganisms such as glycogen accumulating organisms gao which are able to uptake vfa as pha without requiring poly p reserves for this reason many authors have opted for sporadic extraction of anaerobic liquid thus the reported p recovery efficiencies for single short term experiments can be very high particularly if an extra dose of carbon is added under anaerobic conditions to boost p release in this sense as observed in table 3 the p recovery efficiency ranges from 30 to 90 as a function of the sbr operational conditions for example acevedo et al 2015 reported p recovery efficiencies around 80 in a single cycle with extraction values of nearly 75 and an external carbon dosage of 350 mg cod l as acetate however it must be carefully considered that even if 100 p recovery from one out of four cycles was achieved the average extraction per treated cycle in the plant would only be about 25 of the p input moreover one should realise that these high p extractions are sporadic and could not be sustained in a routine basis due to loss of pao activity for example lv et al 2014 operated an ebpr sbr with an extraction ratio of 0 5 once every 3 cycles after 83 days of p stripping p removal performance decreased observing a metabolic shift from pao to gao and pao declined to less than 1 of the population in a subsequent study lv and yuan 2015 extracted half of the anaerobic supernatant every cycle and reached a p recovery efficiency of 50 in 40 days of operation without additional vfa dosage in the anaerobic stage but again the internal poly p levels decreased and the system failed in the next 20 days on the other hand if the extraction ratio is properly selected to avoid over extraction pao activity can be maintained for a longer period of time in this sense a maximum automated cycle extraction ratio of 10 was suggested to ensure the stability of pao activity and thus the feasibility of a long term p recovery process guisasola et al 2019 which allowed the recovery of 60 of influent p without any harmful effect on pao in a modelling study baeza et al 2017 evaluated the impact of the anaerobic supernatant extraction ratio on the performance of an ebpr sbr p recovery system if the objective was achieving the highest concentration of p in the supernatant to facilitate precipitation an extraction ratio lower than 5 of the reactor volume 10 of the influent was recommended for which a concentration of 61 mg p l was obtained lower ratios did not increase p concentration and resulted in a lower amount of p redirected to the p recovery system due to the lower volume on the other hand higher ratios led to a decrease of pao activity and hence lower p concentration hindering p precipitation regarding the experimental studies the range of extraction ratios that led to a successful long term p recovery was 8 15 of reactor volume in batch mode and 20 to 35 of flowrate under continuous mode moreover lower extraction ratios lead to higher anaerobic p concentrations which from a practical point of view is very interesting since precipitation becomes more feasible i e with less chemical dosage requirements on the other side higher extraction ratios enable a higher amount of p recovery but at expenses of higher costs since the anaerobic p concentration is lower in summary choosing the optimal extraction ratio requires a balance between a optimal pao activity high anaerobic p concentration and a low amount of p recovered vs b hindering pao activity low anaerobic p concentration and a high amount of p recovered thus it is difficult to suggest a general optimal value but based on the results reported in the literature we propose 10 as a first initial guess for the extraction ratio when designing batch systems and 25 when designing continuous systems 3 3 influent cod p ratio and n removal another significant parameter is the influent cod p ratio the theoretical studies on mainstream p recovery indicate that wastewater with a low cod p ratio could be successfully treated in systems where mainstream p recovery is implemented due to a much better utilisation of the influent c the range of influent cod p ratios in tables 3 and 4 is very wide from 7 5 to 80 gcod gp since few reports aimed at finding the minimum cod requirements for a successful mainstream p removal recovery in general continuous systems are reported with a higher cod p ratio in addition some of the reports include simultaneous n and p removal and hence a higher amount of cod is needed other reports somehow prevent nitrification from occurring either with a low srt with allylthiourea atu addition low do setpoint or with a very low influent nitrogen load for example valverde pérez et al 2015 fixed a do setpoint of 1 5 mg l and p recovery efficiency improved up to 75 of the influent p because the activity of nitrifiers was being limited at low oxygen concentrations and p uptake was favoured in any case the choice of the do setpoint is not straightforward since too low do values may also hinder pao activity guisasola et al 2019 prevented nitrifying activity using atu tested different influent cod p ratio and showed that the minimum initial cod p ratio 7 5 gcod gp allowed 60 of the p recovery without any harmful effect on pao activity which is the value that agrees with the first experiments conducted with the bcfs methodology barat and van loosdrecht 2006 this value also agrees with the modelling work of baeza et al 2017 where a supernatant extraction of 5 of the reactor volume in each sbr cycle led to a stable operation with up to 63 of p recovered the rest of p removed was incorporated to the purged biomass where additional p recovery strategies reported for the sludge line i e as sewage sewage ash or digestate could also be applied in view of boosting the global p recovery efficiency the interaction between mainstream p recovery and nitrogen removal deserves more attention if p is recovered as struvite part of the influent ammonium 1 1 molar p n ratio would be directly recovered without nitrification denitrification needed this would decrease the n load to the plant and thus the operation costs e g those related to aeration or biomass handling to the best of our knowledge an experimental study that analyses these interactions has not been reported yet when aiming at simultaneous n and p removal a higher cod p ratio is needed in order to divert some electron donor to bnr bnr results in a certain entrance of nitrate to the anaerobic reactor and if cod limitations exist that would hinder the amount of p to be released and thus the amount of p to be recovered guerrero et al 2011 already demonstrated that pao can outcompete denitrifiers under certain operational conditions salehi et al 2019 showed that p recovery could be achieved together with bnr with synthetic wastewater of only 200 mg cod l and a cod p ratio of 20 gcod gp 3 4 concentration of p in the recovered stream a high p concentration is critical to guarantee a high p recovery performance the phostrip and bcfs processes report a minimum phosphate concentration in the stripper stream of 25 mg p l for an efficient p recovery during the crystallization process barat and van loosdrecht 2006 hao and van loosdrecht 2006 other works report a higher minimum p concentration more than 50 mg l for the struvite precipitation cordell et al 2009 kodera et al 2013 most of the mainstream p recovery processes listed in tables 3 and 4 report p concentrations higher than 50 mg l in the recovery stream even so some works report more than 100 mg l of p in the enriched stream by repeated exposure of the biofilm to external cod source acetate or propionate the typical reported anaerobic p concentrations in ebpr systems are in the range of 30 to 70 mg p l so they are in the bottom limit and this is why some of these reports use an external carbon dosage under anaerobic conditions to increase anaerobic p release in a real environment external cod dosage under anaerobic conditions boosts p release at expenses of higher operating cost moreover this addition should be sporadic or otherwise the internal poly p reserves will be depleted and thus this operation would not be sustained in a long term basis 3 5 carbon source needs most of the works in table 3 and 4 were conducted at lab scale and used synthetic wastewater to mimic urban wastewater however some of them prepared a highly loaded wastewater with an extra c inlet normally acetic acid or propionic acid acevedo et al 2015 guisasola et al 2019 wong et al 2013 and there was no need for a sporadic carbon dosage in the case of the reports with real wastewater the additional carbon source was only supplemented when the influent cod was relatively low zou and lu 2016 the only work with external cod amendment and a real environment is presented by larriba et al 2020 they treated the effluent from the primary settler of a full sale wwtp by the mainstream scepphar configuration aiming at p recovery in a demo scale and studied different strategies such as nitrite pathway to improve the efficiency of c usage in view of decreasing the carbon footprint and the operational costs this external carbon can also be obtained in a more sustainable way from the own internal plant resources though the fermentation of waste sludge which is an environmental way to obtain the vfa required to boost anaerobic p release in the work of kodera et al 2013 an additional fermentation tank was conceptually proposed to obtain enriched vfa by primary sludge fermentation which was supposed to provide enough cod for anaerobic p release and subsequent p recovery nowadays the use of side stream sludge fermenters to provide cod to fulfil the carbon needs for biological nutrient removal is becoming a trend ali et al 2021 li li and li 2018 wang et al 2019 thus it could also be used as a source for extra carbon dosage in view of p recovery 3 6 effect of other operational parameters regarding the effect of other operational parameters on the observed performance the main general recommendation would be to select them to ensure good pao activity the same conditions that would maintain pao activity in a conventional sbr or a2o continuous system would be recommended in a mainstream p recovery configuration for example baeza et al 2017 reported the effect of srt in an sbr configuration with p recovery and found a minimum of srt 4 d was required to achieve complete p removal but to achieve maximum pha production srt 10 d was recommended therefore for the specific wastewater composition used and the other particular experimental conditions e g t do ph volume exchange ratio operation objective these results were obtained but they are case specific and hence for each scenario they should be determined experimentally or using a proper modelling approach in fact mainstream p recovery is adding an additional limitation to the typical needs that pao microorganisms also require such as a minimal t dependent srt brdjanovic et al 1998 chan et al 2020b enough do and aerobic phase length and typical aerobic and anaerobic hrt tchobanoglous et al 2014 3 7 future outlook p recovery from the anaerobic supernatant of the mainstream ebpr process is a novel and promising process as in addition to the advantages of other p recovery configurations such as alleviating the problem of undesired p precipitation and recovering a valuable resource it has additional advantages that help to reduce the cod requirements for p removal allowing the treatment of wastewaters with lower cod p ratio and maintaining high p removal activity however most of the investigations concentrated on lab scale sbr and almost all recovery processes were based on p crystallization in order to optimize these systems the extraction ratio is the most basic and important operating parameter to achieve high p recovery without impairing the long term stability of the system anyway proper simulation studies should be performed as the operating parameters are case specific and highly dependant on the operating objective to demonstrate that this is a reliable technology for p recovery future works should focus on continuous configurations which seem more suitable for full scale application and using real municipal wastewater the objective is challenging as it is necessary to obtain an enriched stream with high p concentration to facilitate p recovery but without requiring the addition of an external carbon source that would compromise the economics of the process moreover lca and cost analysis should be used to demonstrate the overall positive effect of p recovery systems in wrrfs in any case policy decisions will be of paramount importance for the implementation of p recovery as it has been shown that the costs are affordable but like many environmental technologies it is not cost effective unless it is driven by policy nättorp et al 2017 4 conclusions this paper critically reviews for the first time the performance of the current reported strategies for mainstream p recovery in ebpr wwtps and provides the main points to be addressed for its successful implementation furthermore it shows that full scale mainstream p recovery is a medium term possibility it is based on the pao capability of producing a p enriched supernatant that enables p recovery and sbr and continuous configurations at different scales have been reported it can improve p removal performance and enable a successful treatment of influents with a relatively low cod p ratio configurations combining ebpr with mainstream p recovery are still at an early stage and their successful full scale application has not yet been reported the most important parameter to describe these systems is the extraction ratio the amount of anaerobic supernatant to be extracted or derived to recover p the choice of this value is a compromise between i having a low amount of p recovered with high pao activity and anaerobic p concentration i e easing precipitation and ii having a high amount of p recovered with a potential deleterious effect to pao activity and low anaerobic p concentration a maximum value for the p recovery efficiency of 60 of influent p seems the most sensitive goal for a long term operation of these systems however higher values can be used for sporadic or single extractions regarding the preferred agent for p recovery most of the works opted for struvite while vivianite or hap are less common at this point declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16246,phosphorus p an essential nutrient for all organisms urgently needs to be recovered due to the increasing demand and scarcity of this natural resource recovering p from wastewater is a feasible and promising way widely studied nowadays due to the need to remove p in wastewater treatment plants wwtps when enhanced biological p removal ebpr is implemented an innovative option is to recover p from the supernatant streams obtained in the mainstream water line and then combine it with liquor crystallisation recovery processes being the final recovered product struvite vivianite or hydroxyapatite the basic idea of these mainstream p recovery strategies is to take advantage of the ability of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao to increase p concentration under anaerobic conditions when some carbon source is available this work shows the mainstream p recovery technologies reported so far both in continuous and sequenced batch reactors sbr based configurations the amount of extraction as a key parameter to balance the recovery efficiency and the maintenance of the ebpr of the system should be the first design criterion the maximum value of p recovery efficiency for long term operation with an adequate extraction ratio would be around 60 other relevant factors e g cod p ratio of the influent need for an additional carbon source and operational parameters e g aeration srt hrt are also reported and discussed keywords configurations enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr mainstream phosphorus recovery precipitation 1 introduction the new paradigm in wastewater treatment proclaims that wastewater treatment plants wwtps should evolve to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs where resources and energy are recovered from water amongst all the potential resources to be recovered p arises as a perfect candidate since i in the current context of population and food demand growth p is essential for fertilizers production chowdhury et al 2017 cieślik and konieczka 2017 roy 2017 ii p is currently a pollutant of our wastewater which may promote eutrophication in water bodies if it is not removed and iii p is mainly obtained from non renewable sources such as phosphate rocks van vuuren et al 2010 which are expected to be depleted in only 50 100 years cordell et al 2009 desmidt et al 2015 rittmann et al 2011 for the full scale application of p recovery processes one of the main current limitations is that the market price table 1 of rock phosphate is lower than recovered products such as struvite however if the additional benefits of p recovery are accounted for significant incentives to support it emerge for example the need to treat the impurities in phosphate rock e g cadmium or uranium which can be highly toxic cornel and schaum 2009 or to avoid the need for external dependence on a strategic resource such as phosphate rock in addition p in urban wastewaters has to be removed anyway to avoid eutrophication processes making p recovery a win win scenario wwtps seem to be an adequate place to recover p since 1 3 mt of p are removed annually worldwide through wastewater treatment some estimates indicate that global demand for p could be covered by 15 20 with this recovery li and li 2017 wu et al 2019 yuan et al 2012 other studies indicate that in central europe p recovery from municipal wastewater would satisfy 40 50 of the mineral p fertilizer applied annually in agriculture egle et al 2016 furthermore from a life cycle assessment lca point of view it has been concluded that p recovery from municipal wastewater sludge liquor or ash of sludge mono incineration would provide environmental benefits remy and jossa 2015 although differences appear in the amount of p recovered requirements of energy chemicals and fuels or in side effects in the process p recovery processes can reduce environmental impacts mainly on global warming potential freshwater eutrophication of and fossil energy demand remy and jossa 2015 p recovery as struvite seems to be especially attractive for urban areas to satisfy the growing trend of local crop production linked to the large volumes of wastewater treated in centralized wwtps rufí salís et al 2020 in this recent lca study three recovery technologies were analysed for large wwtps showing that were able to recover 5 30 times the amount of p required to fertilize the agricultural area of the studied region annually 36 5 t although there was an increase of chemicals and energy requirements per m3 of wastewater due to struvite recovery it resulted in lower eutrophication potential 1 1 fate of p in wwtps the fate of the influent p in a wwtp depends on its configuration part of the influent p is removed with the primary sludge around 11 according to cornel and schaum 2009 if the plant does not implement enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in the secondary step approximately 15 30 of the p in the influent becomes part of the biomass a conventional wwtp sludge contains around 1 2 of p according to mass basis and removed with the purged sludge henze et al 2008 parsons and smith 2008 then if complete p removal is mandatory the remaining p should be chemically removed with addition of fe iii and al iii salts in different dosing points such as the primary sedimentation before and or following biological treatment or in a tertiary treatment tchobanoglous et al 2014 however the chemical sludge produced is not recommended as fertiliser since these salts could reduce the mobility of p in soils where this chemical sludge is applied desmidt et al 2015 sartorius et al 2012 the sludge generated is often accumulated in landfills or burnt in incinerators and may end up contaminating water bodies such as aquifers rivers or sea mainstone et al 2000 alternatively the use of ashes from sewage sludge incinerators is proposed for p recovery ma and rosen 2021 and to produce fertilizers via a chemical extraction fang et al 2021 j li et al 2018 the fate of p in wwtps that include ebpr is very different ebpr is based on the proliferation of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao which can accumulate phosphate internally as polyphosphate poly p under aerobic or anoxic conditions after being exposed to anaerobic conditions with available carbon source then p is removed as poly p inside cell biomass by waste sludge tchobanoglous et al 2014 pao can incorporate up to 0 38 mg p mg vss compared to the 0 02 mg p mg vss incorporated by the ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho gebremariam et al 2011 henze et al 2008 yuan et al 2012 ebpr based wwtps can typically remove more than 85 of the p from the influent that is stored within the biomass bunce et al 2018 gebremariam et al 2011 the reported range of the p content in ebpr based sludge is around 0 06 0 15 mg p mg vss henze et al 2008 however the use of this sewage sludge in agriculture is nowadays limited in many areas because of the ecological and health threats involved for example it is estimated that only about 20 of the sewage sludge meets the eu regulations for fertilizers in terms of concentration of heavy metals or radioactive elements e g radon and uranium european commission 2019 pettersson et al 2008 weigand et al 2013 there is another reason to implement p recovery strategies in ebpr based wwtps the clogging of tubes and pumps due to undesired struvite precipitation is observed when the bio p sludge undergoes anaerobic digestion and p recovery is not implemented d wild et al 1996 doyle and parsons 2002 the repair of this clogging is costly due to the need to shut down and clean the clogged equipment in a modelling study lizarralde et al 2019 constructed a plant wide model to understand the effect of several operational parameters on the uncontrolled struvite precipitation when ebpr was implemented they concluded that struvite recovery has many benefits for the plant not only for its commercial value but also for the reduction of sludge production ferric chloride dosage and the prevention of uncontrolled struvite precipitation 1 2 most studied technologies for p recovery in wwtps different technologies have been proposed for p recovery from flows containing phosphorus in wwtp i e effluent sewage sludge sludge ash dewatering liquor and digester supernatant providing different operability costs and potential uses of the recovered material cieślik and konieczka 2017 desmidt et al 2015 egle et al 2016 law and pagilla 2018 egle et al 2016 indicated that an ideal technology should provide good p removal from wastewater maximize p recovery rate destroy hazardous substances and produce a material that could be applied with low environmental risks good fertilizing effects and high economic efficiency they also studied all these characteristics from 19 different p recovery technologies and concluded that the choice of a specific recovery technology is a compromise amongst these factors furthermore the lca analysis by amann et al 2018 showed wide range of changes in gaseous emissions energy demand and p recovery potential of different technologies based on liquid phase sewage sludge and ash and concluded that lca should be combined with additional environmental criteria to put the performance of the technologies into perspective considering the wide range of existing p recovery processes this section presents the most studied ones classified in two groups depending on whether they can be obtained from primary secondary effluents or from the sludge line and includes another subsection showing the crystallisation processes that could be applied to p enriched streams to make p recovery effective section 2 then presents the p recovery processes related to mainstream strategies that are the focus of this review 1 2 1 p recovery from primary or secondary effluents p recovery from primary or secondary effluents using chemical precipitation does not seem to be a cost effective alternative because it would require a large amount of chemicals cornel and schaum 2009 desmidt et al 2015 egle et al 2016 several alternative methodologies have been described previously egle et al 2015 kabdaşlı and tünay 2018 for instance liberti et al 1979 reported a methodology based on the combination of ion exchange ix for phosphate selective exchange and p recovery from the concentrated stream by struvite precipitation which was further evaluated in subsequent works liberti et al 2001 petruzzelli et al 2003 williams et al 2015 studied p and n removal with media based on fe cu and al and then precipitation columns with clinoptilolite ix they achieved almost 84 of p recovery and a regeneration eluate with concentration up to 560 mg p l 1 beaudry and sengupta 2021 used a novel pyridine based polymeric ion exchanger and three different fixed bed columns producing an effluent concentration with p 6 μg l and recovering about 90 of the phosphorus the hybrid anion exchanger haix which consists of a hybrid polymeric base dispersed with hydrated ferric oxide hfo nanoparticles has also been reported for p removal martin et al 2018 2009 sendrowski and boyer 2013 phosphate uptake is based on the selective sorption sites with hfo nanoparticles which form sphere complexes with fe iii and phosphate blaney et al 2007 after long term sorption phosphate breakthrough occurs but the exhausted haix can be reused with a regeneration phase with naoh nacl solution and finally a rinse with co2 sparged filtered water blaney et al 2007 a recent work by guida et al 2021 evaluated a large 10 m3 d haix system for 2 5 years using treated municipal wastewater showing high p removal 95 i e from 6 to 0 3 mg po4 3 p l and recovery efficiency 95 of phosphate from the wastewater recovered as hydroxyapatite in subsequent work the regeneration of the media and the modelling of this system were also studied pinelli et al 2022 however the feasibility of this methodology at full scale has not been proved yet egle et al 2015 rufí salís et al 2020 siciliano et al 2020 apart from the above mentioned approach microalgae cultivation has been proposed as a promising technology for p recovery from secondary effluents due to its low cost eco friendliness and low technology dependence yang et al 2017 p is taken up biologically by algal growth by assimilation accompanied by oxygen generation that supports aerobic bacteria growth algae can also be used either as a feedstock for biofuel production or directly as a biofertilizer chisti 2013 2008 el hamouri 2009 showed that 63 of influent p could be removed and incorporated into algae as a tertiary treatment using a high rate algal pond xu et al 2016 2015 also showed that algae could remove about 60 of influent phosphorus for secondary wastewater effluent however the application of algae for p recovery is still limited in large scale wastewater treatment gebremariam et al 2011 1 2 2 p recovery from the sludge line as mentioned above the maximum p recovery potential is from ebpr based sludge however this option is not straightforward for instance the agricultural application of stabilized sludge with high p content hester and harrison 2013 has to consider the strict national health and safety restrictions on nutrients and heavy metals this hinders the agricultural application of sludge and thus this pathway of p recovery law and pagilla 2018 another option is the incinerated sludge ashes which may contain 4 to 11 of p biswas et al 2009 donatello et al 2010 franz 2008 ottosen et al 2013 however as a result of the organic matter oxidation the heavy metal content in these ashes may be even higher than the sludge itself therefore a chemical franz 2008 ottosen et al 2013 or thermochemical adam et al 2007 process is needed to separate the p from the heavy metals of the ashes wet chemical treatment by acid alkaline or both have been proposed for the dissolution of p law and pagilla 2018 acid leaching sulphuric or nitric acid is proposed for fe rich ashes ottosen et al 2013 while the combination of both acid and alkaline treatment is proposed for al rich ashes petzet et al 2012 the most reported location to recover p is a liquid stream from the sludge line either from the sludge treatment or the anaerobic digestion egle et al 2015 the treatment of the purged secondary sludge releases soluble phosphate and ammonium resulting in a supernatant with increased concentrations of these compounds these streams can contain up to 30 of the influent p loads levlin and hultman 2003 reviewed several side stream based p recovery strategies and concluded that p recovery efficiency about 60 65 is achieved from these streams 1 2 3 crystallization processes for p recovery crystallization is nowadays the most accepted strategy for recovering p from these enriched liquors being struvite the preferred precipitation product le corre et al 2009 li et al 2019 rittmann et al 2011 struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o can be applied directly to the field as a slow release fertiliser also providing nitrogen n and magnesium mg to the soil and has been reported to be a good option for agricultural uses hu et al 2016 sometimes ammonium in struvite can be replaced by potassium and then the precipitate is known as k struvite ronteltap et al 2007 the reactions to precipitate struvite and k struvite and their corresponding solubility are presented in table 2 fig 1 presents a graphical representation of the minimum magnesium mg2 concentration needed to reach the struvite solubility product at different ph as a function of phosphate and ammonium concentration as observed significant concentrations of p mg2 nh4 and high ph around 9 10 are needed so that struvite crystallisation becomes thermodynamically favourable struvite precipitation in streams with low concentration of phosphate or ammonium or low ph as the influent or effluent of wwtps becomes an unaffordable option because of the requirement of adding high amount of magnesium e g see fig 1 at the condition of ph 7 in any case there are successful reports of p recovery as struvite under full scale conditions using side streams obtained from the sludge line desmidt et al 2015 jabr et al 2019 law and pagilla 2018 le corre et al 2009 mayer et al 2016 and successfully marketed technologies for the recovery of struvite include amongst others ostara airprex multiform dhv crystalactor and nuresys law and pagilla 2018 however struvite crystallization also has some drawbacks in its practical application for example an unsatisfactory recovery efficiency related to the total p load in the raw sludge in the range 45 80 in some full scale projects for p recovery from digested sludge or liquor as reported by remy and jossa 2015 vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is an alternative valuable product for p recovery it has a high market value table 1 as it is a relatively slow release fertilizer widely found in soils lake sediments hydrothermal deposits or bogs wu et al 2019 moreover the precipitating agent iron is a common dissolved mineral in natural water and fe iii salts are commonly used for improving sludge settleability li et al 2014 and odour control zhang et al 2009 the reaction to precipitate vivianite and its solubility is presented in table 2 the theoretical molar ratio of fe p to form vivianite is 1 5 1 but the optimal stoichiometric ratio range applied is 1 5 2 considering some of fe ii could be transformed to fe oh 2 or oxidized to fe iii priambodo et al 2017 the formation condition of vivianite is less dependant on ph i e adequate range is 6 9 compared to struvite 8 9 5 vivianite can be precipitated from the digested sewage sludge prot et al 2020 wilfert et al 2018 wastewater wu et al 2019 and aqueous solutions liu et al 2018 some researchers have shown that about 62 of p could be precipitated to vivianite from an anaerobic digestate with a ph around 8 li li and li 2018 priambodo et al 2017 however the p recovery process as vivianite also has disadvantages i the formation of vivianite in the sludge produces small crystals or aggregates 10 150 μm resulting in a complex separation from sludge and ii vivianite usually contains calcium or magnesium impurities robles et al 2020 impure vivianite is less stable since it can be oxidized within 48 h in contrast to the several weeks of stability reported for pure vivianite wilfert et al 2018 in addition separation and purification methods for vivianite still need further development robles et al 2020 another alternative to struvite is hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh hap can be directly used as a fertilizer in the field of agriculture johansson et al 2017 mayer et al 2016 and as an adsorbent for removing dyes emerging pollutants and heavy metals maity et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 it is of great potential for p recovery since calcium phosphate has a large market driver et al 1999 and thus it is expected to be of essential importance for the closure of p cycle leinweber et al 2018 the reaction to precipitate hap and its solubility is presented in table 2 hap is thermodynamically the most stable phase for orthophosphate and calcium in solution within a broad range of ph of 4 12 cichy et al 2019 oubagha et al 2017 when dealing with the common problem of low p concentration in municipal wastewater hap is a more attractive option than struvite since struvite demands higher enriched p for example although this is highly specific depending on the ph and species concentration for a typical wastewater composition 8 mgpo4 3 p l and 40 mgnh4 n l and based on the hap and struvite solubility the addition of 10 mgca2 l and 10 mgmg2 l at ph 8 or higher leads to almost complete precipitation of ca to produce hap whereas struvite is not formed even at a higher ph thus some works have exploited this facility of hap to precipitate and evaluated p recovery strategies in lab scale systems berg et al 2005 zou and wang 2016 however hap could lose advantage over struvite precipitation when aiming at a simultaneous recovery of n and p in real industrial wastewater treatment cichy et al 2019 in addition hap has lower potential for fertilizer use robles et al 2020 2 potential p recovery from mainstream p recovery via precipitation e g struvite k struvite hap vivianite requires a high concentration of p for displacing the solubility equilibrium to the precipitation side fig 1 as described before in ebpr based wwtps digestate is a common option to precipitate recover p since the sludge entering anaerobic digestion contains a high amount of internally stored p as poly p that can be easily released inside the digester and results in a high concentration of p into the digestate the digestate also contains high ammonia concentration and thus seems to be a favourable option for struvite precipitation however these systems also bring disadvantages such as undesired precipitation in the anaerobic digester or in the downstream tubing and instrumentation doyle and parsons 2002 on the other hand the high concentration of some ions in the anaerobic digestion sludge e g calcium could hinder the precipitation of p as struvite since when p is released it can precipitate as other compounds such as hap brushite and other calcium phosphates in any case to determine the actual precipitation competition in a given anaerobic digestion scenario not only solubility has to be taken into account but also kinetics d wild et al 1996 apart from the digestate the other location with the highest p concentration in an ebpr plant is the anaerobic reactor and thus it can be an alternative for p recovery during the anaerobic phase pao have taken up most of the readily biodegradable cod and most of the p has been released into the bulk liquid reaching levels from 30 to 70 mg p l acevedo et al 2015 izadi et al 2021 2020 zhang et al 2020 zou and wang 2016 therefore the anaerobic reactor appears as a good point to implement mainstream p recovery whilst the digestate seems to be the ideal point for side stream p recovery the integration of ebpr and mainstream p recovery as struvite would be beneficial to prevent undesired precipitation throughout the plant and to reduce n load when treating wastewater with high ammonium concentration 1 g of p removed as struvite yields 7 92 g of struvite containing 0 45 g of n thus it shows a good potential for improving system performance and for this reason it has recently received the attention of researchers e g acevedo et al 2015 larriba et al 2020 shi et al 2016 zou and lu 2016 the first proposal on the potential to obtain a p rich liquor from the mainstream anaerobic reactor was reported by van loosdrecht et al 1998 the biological chemical p and n removal bcfs process fig 2 a bcfs was a modification of the uct design where a stream from the anaerobic reactor for instance an average flow of 10 of the influent flow was sent to a sludge thickener and a phosphate stripper where fecl3 was dosed for p precipitation thus a continuous ebpr operation and a p chemical precipitation system were combined modelling was used to better understand this process and to assess its performance under different scenarios barat and van loosdrecht 2006 hao and van loosdrecht 2006 hao and van loosdrecht 2006 simulated the effect of anaerobic stripping on the p removal and recovery performance within the bcfs frame and reported an optimal stripping flow rate ratio flow rate of supernatant flow rate of influent of 0 2 to favour p recovery higher values resulted in decreased pao activity and lower values in low p recovery see section 3 2 for the discussion of this effect moreover they showed that the system could operate with a lower influent cod p ratio without hindering pao activity the ratio could be decreased from 20 to 10 g cod g p and the system could still meet the discharge requirements of p 1 mg p l and maintain 36 of p recovery this first experimental attempt of mainstream p recovery already showed that there is a maximum threshold value for the amount of p extracted barat and van loosdrecht 2006 implemented the model of the hardenberg wwtp and simulated different control strategies to explore the p recovery potential of the bcfs configuration they stated that the maximum potential p recovery without affecting pao activity was 60 of the influent p following this first report several other works have presented configurations taking advantage of the pao capability to increase p concentration under anaerobic conditions baeza et al 2017 shi et al 2016 wong et al 2013 the p recovery efficiencies of the evaluated works were calculated according to eqs 1 2 and 3 1 p o u t p e f f p b i o 2 p a s p i n f p o u t 3 p r p a s p i n f 100 where pout represents the p output per day in the effluent peff plus in the purged biomass pbio pas the p in the anaerobic supernatant thus available for p recovery pinf the total input of p in the influent to the secondary treatment per day and pr the p recovery efficiency pinf is highly influenced by the configuration of the primary treatment typical p removal values around 11 have been reported for conventional primary treatments cornel and schaum 2009 but these values can be increased considerably to values of 40 99 if chemical dosing is used in the primary settler as in the chemically enhanced primary treatment cept processes shewa and dagnew 2020 the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows the studies related to mainstream p recovery currently available in the literature are briefly described in the following two subsections classified by their operation mode section 2 1 for sequencing batch reactors sbrs and section 2 2 for continuous systems this classification separates sbr configurations which offer greater configurability than continuous systems although they are typically used for lab scale evaluation of different operating strategies from continuous systems which offer more stable operation and are more suitable for full scale implementation although the achievable p concentration is typically lower after this schematic description section 3 critically discusses the most important factors affecting p recovery sbr vs continuous configurations extraction ratio influent cod p ratio concentration of p in the recovered stream carbon source needs and future outlook 2 1 sbr configurations most of the configurations for mainstream p recovery studied in previous works have been based on sbr operation table 3 fig 3 the supernatant after the anaerobic phase is used for p recovery since it has the highest p concentration in all the cycle sbrs provide greater flexibility than continuous systems for research studies and the fact that particular actions can be taken in a single cycle such as extra cod dosing or supernatant extraction facilitates the understanding of p recovery performance under different operation modes for example some authors have evaluated the effects of sporadic extractions of anaerobic supernatant and others have tested the automated extraction every single cycle long term operation is in general required to demonstrate the ability of these two different approaches to maintain stable pao activity despite the extractions as a decrease in p availability may hinder pao metabolism wong et al 2013 reported a novel two step biofilm fig 3c process to facilitate anoxic p recovery in the first step the pao enriched biofilm was immersed into a diluted wastewater stream f1 so that the biomass could take up p and nitrate to remove p and n of the wastewater in a second step the biofilm was subjected to a carbon enriched stream f2 under anaerobic conditions where acetate was taken up and p was released then the biofilm acted under aerobic condition storing p from wastewater and under anaerobic condition releasing p and hence allowing the generation of an enriched p recovery stream the anaerobic supernatant volume 1 8 l was four times lower than the initial volume of wastewater 7 2 l and achieved a p concentration almost 4 times higher 28 vs 7 mg p l an additional experiment was conducted to improve the system efficiency they applied a highly enriched carbon stream after 10 cycles of normal operation and they obtained an anaerobic supernatant around 100 mg p l which is theoretically high enough for an efficient p recovery by struvite rittmann et al 2011 nevertheless they did not test the effect of extracting this p on pao survival neither in a short term nor a long term basis xia et al 2014 studied a configuration where a fraction of the anaerobic mixed liquor from a parent ebpr sbr was treated in a separate batch reactor and intermittent external carbon source was dosed to stimulate p release in view of p recovery the sludge from this batch reactor was separated with a non woven cloth and recycled to the parent sbr whereas the supernatant was treated with mgcl2 6h2o to recover p as mg3 po4 2 thus dosing 10 of additional carbon source in the batch reactor resulted in the recovery of 79 of the p in the influent in single cycle the authors applied this new p recovery sequence for nearly one month in only one out of four cycles although recommended to evaluate this approach in a longer period acevedo et al 2015 investigated a comparable ebpr sbr configuration but the extra carbon was dosed in situ in the anaerobic phase the frequency of this extra carbon addition and subsequent anaerobic extraction for potential p recovery was varied in different sets of experiments two times per week with low p extraction or once per week but with high p extraction their results were promising since they obtained 59 recovery of the influent p when extracting p two times per week and 81 when they extracted once per week in the latter case they used an extra vfa addition of 9 of the usual load no p removal deterioration was observed in the cycle after both extractions but the long term impact of a p recovery strategy with continuous extraction of p was not investigated lv et al 2014 studied a 10 l ebpr sbr system to investigate the effect of the extraction of 5 l of supernatant enriched in p for subsequent chemical precipitation supernatant that was obtained after an additional anaerobic settling period the supernatant was treated with fecl3 for p precipitation and the treated supernatant was returned to the aerobic stage this extraction was applied to the sbr once every 3 cycles for a long term and observed the decrease of p release p uptake and the concentration of intracellular poly p ebpr activity was deteriorated and p removal efficiency decreased to about 75 they disabled the p recovery strategy and tried to recover the ebpr activity by operating under conventional anaerobic aerobic conditions but the system did not recover after that work lv and yuan 2015 demonstrated that the same system could have a successful short term performance 40 d when 50 of anaerobic supernatant with a concentration of 39 4 mg p l was extracted the recovery process was operated in another separated reaction sedimentation basin with fecl3 as a precipitating agent and half of the anaerobic supernatant was removed for p recovery ebpr activity was strongly limited because of the shortage of poly p as a continuous stripping of 40 d and it could not be recovered even though the stripping was stopped for 60 d in the same direction guisasola et al 2019 proposed the operation with an automated extraction of anaerobic supernatant every cycle to understand the p recovery capacity in a long term basis but without any external dose of additional organic carbon fig 3a thus the anaerobic p concentration was lower than in the previous reports since it was the routine anaerobic p concentration of the system they demonstrated that a successful p recovery strategy could be maintained with 1 l 10 of reactor volume 20 of the influent of automated anaerobic extraction per cycle during more than 120 days without any deleterious effect on ebpr activity they tried to push the system into the limits and operated with other cod p ratios and different extraction conditions in order to investigate two different aspects the minimum initial cod p ratio and the maximum amount of p extraction that the system could tolerate without the loss of the pao activity they demonstrated that up to 60 of the influent p could be recovered when extracting 10 of the anaerobic volume per cycle without any harmful effect on pao activity and that the system could be operated under low cod p ratios i e 7 5 gcod gp zu nan he and liu 2020 also used a lab scale sbr to study the effect of the volume of anaerobic extraction on the biological c and p removal performance different extraction ratio of anaerobic supernatant 30 60 and 90 were tested for p recovery as vivianite extraction was carried out every fourth cycle p removal efficiency was improved when increasing from 30 to 60 of the extraction volume however the phosphorus balance and the pao population severely deceased under the extraction ratio of 90 the harm was irreversible even after a long term normal operation without stripping process in addition to p removal and p recovery some researchers have studied the simultaneous p and n recovery from mainstream in a batch system configuration shi et al 2016 proposed an anaerobic anoxic nitrifying induced crystallization ic sbr configuration fig 3b named as a2n ic sbr for n p removal and p recovery which was composed of three different sbrs a a o sbr n sbr and ic sbr with 10 10 and 1 3 l nitrifiers oxidised ammonium to nitrate which was denitrified by denitrifying pao dpao linked to p uptake during this process 1 3 l of anaerobic supernatant extraction was sent to the ic column with calcite seeds for p recovery the percentage of chemical p removal with respect to the total p removal was 14 9 17 1 similarly zou and wang 2016 implemented a lab scale ebpr p recovery process aiming at removing cod nutrients and recovering p which consisted of a dpao enriched sbr operated with anaerobic aerobic anoxic mode and an ic p recovery column the ic column received part of the supernatant obtained after a post anaerobic settling phase and the ic supernatant was returned to the anoxic phase with external nitrate solution dosage the system was operated with either synthetic around 250 mg cod l or real domestic wastewater cod concentration between 153 and 223 mg cod l they achieved successful n and p removal and p recovery efficiency via hap precipitation the average removal efficiencies were 82 6 87 5 and 91 6 for cod p and n respectively the flow ratio of anaerobic supernatant to influent from 0 to 0 5 was varied and the maximum p recovery as hap up to 59 was achieved at a ratio of 0 3 salehi et al 2019 explored the possibility of a simultaneous nitrification denitrification and p removal sndpr process for nutrient removal and p recovery a lab scale anaerobic aerobic sbr was employed with synthetic wastewater feeding they achieved anaerobic liquor with high p concentration i e around 100 mg l in granular sndpr process with an influent p of 10 mg l and a low cod 200 mg l yu et al 2021 used an anaerobic aerobic lab scale sbr 5 4 l to promote biological c n and p removal biological nitrogen removal bnr was achieved with low do during the aerobic phase and thus simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was promoted successful nutrient removal was stable for a long period 310 d under different anaerobic supernatant extraction ratios 0 1 12 1 9 1 6 and low do conditions 0 6 and 1 mg l more than 40 of p could be recovered as struvite due to these extractions the reactor began to deteriorate and the efficiency of p removal decreased to 60 when operating the system with the lowest do of 0 2 mg l and a relatively high extraction ratio 1 9 and no p recovery was found afterwards they proposed a do of 0 6 mg l and an extraction ratio of 1 6 in view of saving energy and an optimal condition of do of 1 mg l and extraction ratio of 1 9 to maximise the process performance some modelling studies have been reported about mainstream p recovery with sbr systems baeza et al 2017 simulated an ebpr based sbr configuration for p recovery named ebpr2 a typical ebpr anaerobic aerobic cycle configuration was modified including after the anaerobic phase a settling and decanting phase where the p enriched stream was extracted for p recovery fig 3a they simulated different scenarios and showed that it was possible to obtain a stable operation with a high amount of p recovered up to 63 when the supernatant extraction in each cycle was 5 of the reactor volume moreover total p removal was achieved regardless of cod fractionation in the wastewater in addition they proposed the inclusion of anaerobic sludge purging which could be a good option in view of a higher energy recovery i e increasing biochemical methane potential per gram of volatile suspended solid sludge obtained from the anaerobic phase contains a higher concentration of poly hydroxyalkanoate pha which would boost the production of methane during anaerobic digestion chan et al 2020a the highest pha production was obtained by extracting 4 3 of the reactor volume per cycle taking into account the previous simulations and the pilot plant experiments of a two sludge configuration with ebpr and via nitrite n removal marcelino et al 2011 a new two sludge process including p recovery was designed larriba et al 2020 this novel configuration fig 3d was named shortcut enhanced p and pha recovery mainstream scepphar and was tested in a large demo pilot scale total volume of 7 8 m3 fed with real primary influent larriba et al 2020 it consisted of a two sludge sbr system het sbr was operated as a conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o ebpr sbr and aut sbr was aerobic and aimed at a complete or partial nitrification a third crystallization reactor pre sbr was designed so that the supernatant extracted after the anaerobic phase of het sbr could be used for p recovery an additional interchange vessel was required to interchange supernatants amongst these reactors in order to avoid idle phases and to ensure that all three reactors could operate simultaneously rather than sequentially this configuration was operated successfully for a long term for c n and p removal 86 12 93 9 and 79 6 with either full nitrification or nitrite shortcut p recovery as struvite was carried out in this third reactor by mg2 dosing at a ph of 8 5 allowing the recovery of an average of 45 of the influent p as struvite precipitate with a maximum peak of 63 2 2 continuous configurations this section details the reported alternatives for p recovery from mainstream with continuous configurations in addition to the seminal bcfs process discussed above van loosdrecht et al 1998 continuous systems are often used to test the p recovery strategies previously developed in sbr mode under these conditions part of the anaerobic supernatant is diverted to a p recovery equipment and in some cases the flow is returned to the system after p is recovered for instance an anaerobic anoxic nitrifying a2n continuous configuration combined with an induced p crystallisation ic column was proposed by shi et al 2012 for mainstream p recovery in addition to removal of cod n and p fig 2b part of the p enriched anaerobic supernatant was extracted to precipitate calcium phosphate crystals in the ic column the conventional a2n system performance was compared to that of a2n ic a2n ic showed a more stable performance than a2n the authors used a wide range of cod p ratios from 17 7 to 67 4 g cod gp and found that the p removal efficiency was consistently maintained at 99 2 for a2n ic regardless of the influent cod p ratio tested however the a2n process reduced p removal efficiency from 93 0 to 65 7 when the influent cod p ratio was decreased from 67 4 to 17 7 gcod gp p recovery in the a2n ic process ranged from 8 9 to 12 9 when the influent cod p ratio was reduced from 67 4 to 19 9 gcod gp later zou and wang 2017 used the same configuration and studied the effect of various operational conditions on the ic performance and optimized the crystal dose acting as a seed ph temperature do molar ca p ratio and reaction time in view of boosting p recovery they showed that on the optimal conditions 80 min ph of 8 5 molar ca p ratio of 2 0 60 g l seed crystal loads and 4 0 l min of aeration flow the system reached an excellent p recovery of 92 3 in addition they found that the temperature had a slight effect on induced hap crystallization thus benefiting the integration of ebpr with induced hap crystallization in a similar configuration dai et al 2017 evaluated the influence of the flow of the anaerobic supernatant to ic in a long run over 180 d and found that the optimal ratio of anaerobic supernatant extracted to influent was 0 3 under these conditions p recovery efficiency reached 72 4 at the optimal hrt 0 5 h in ic reactor higher extraction ratios could disrupt system stability without enhancing p recovery and could induce a change of the activated sludge characteristics since it favoured the percentage of extracellular polymeric substances of the sludge the same authors reported a modelling study about the continuous a2n ic aiming at finding the optimal conditions to maximize energy savings and minimize emission reduction dai et al 2019 their results indicated that p recovery decreased with the reduction of the extraction ratio and the ic volume kodera et al 2013 studied a configuration based on a pao enriched biotrickling filter exposed alternatively to anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig 2d p uptake by pao was promoted under aerobic conditions when the filter treated by recirculation a synthetic stream emulating an urban wastewater which contained a low concentration of p 5 mg p l for the anaerobic phase the system required a stream with vfa to enhance p release with up to 2000 mg cod l which could be generated by primary sludge fermentation although in this work a synthetic stream was used the effluent from the anaerobic phase had a high concentration of p 125 mg p l that was adequate for p recovery the system operated for a long period of time 250 d with this configuration obtaining a p recovery of almost 60 of the influent p in the frame of the cultivation of microalgae for p recovery valverde pérez et al 2015 proposed a novel model based design of p removal and recovery system consisting of a conventional continuous a2o operation where nitrification was suppressed at low do fig 2c the objective was to produce a nutrient medium for microalgae cultivation to produce biofuel or a natural fertiliser for direct use in agriculture the p recovered for algae cultivation was obtained from the anaerobic effluent as a stream with high p concentration they investigated the potential p recovery under different scenarios of do and srt and obtained a maximum of 70 p recovery of influent p when 30 of the influent flow was diverted as a p stream and the system was operated at srt 5 d at do 1 5 mg l nitrification was still being inhibited due to this low do and p uptake was favoured increasing p recovery up to 75 3 discussion amongst the different locations for p recovery in ebpr based wwtps the supernatant of the anaerobic reactor has recently gained attention since mainstream p recovery would i mitigate undesired precipitation of p in the sludge line ii reduce the cod requirements for p removal iii enable the treatment of wastewater with lower cod p ratio and iv depending on the recovery agent decrease the n load to the plant and thus its operational costs as detailed above mainstream p recovery can be achieved with different configurations and thus several operation parameters are essential for an efficient p recovery performance tables 3 and 4 summarize the different reported proposals for the implementation of p recovery from mainstream and lists for each case the applied equipment and recovery methods basic operation parameters srt hrt operation temperature aeration ph extraction volume and frequency and influent characteristics 3 1 sbr vs continuous configurations for mainstream p recovery mainstream p recovery under sbr conditions is based on extracting part of the supernatant once the anaerobic phase is finished whereas it consists of diverting part of the anaerobic liquid to a p recovery unit under continuous conditions most reports on mainstream p recovery employed lab scale sbrs table 3 as sbrs have several advantages compared to continuous systems on the one hand it is easier to obtain a biomass free anaerobic supernatant as a settling phase can be easily included after the anaerobic phase whereas in the case of continuous system a membrane or a combined settling reactor biomass recycle would be needed sekine et al 2018 moreover sbrs show a lower space requirement and lower configuration and installation costs as well as the flexibility to face operational or influent variations jiang et al 2016 tomei et al 2016 however it can also lead to higher operational costs and capital expenditures due to its discontinuous operation as reported in larriba et al 2020 when comparing the mainstream scepphar configuration to a conventional continuous a2o configuration 3 2 extraction ratio as mentioned before the key operational parameter for efficient p recovery is the extraction ratio i e the percentage of anaerobic volume extracted for an sbr or the flow diverted from the anaerobic reactor to the p recovery unit for a continuous system high anaerobic extraction volumes should be chosen to maximise p recovery but too high values may hinder p storage activity of pao the rationale is that the effect of internal poly p limitations is not observed with single periodic extraction or in the short term but after several cycles high p extraction values would deplete the internal poly p reserves and pao would lose the competitive advantage versus other microorganisms such as glycogen accumulating organisms gao which are able to uptake vfa as pha without requiring poly p reserves for this reason many authors have opted for sporadic extraction of anaerobic liquid thus the reported p recovery efficiencies for single short term experiments can be very high particularly if an extra dose of carbon is added under anaerobic conditions to boost p release in this sense as observed in table 3 the p recovery efficiency ranges from 30 to 90 as a function of the sbr operational conditions for example acevedo et al 2015 reported p recovery efficiencies around 80 in a single cycle with extraction values of nearly 75 and an external carbon dosage of 350 mg cod l as acetate however it must be carefully considered that even if 100 p recovery from one out of four cycles was achieved the average extraction per treated cycle in the plant would only be about 25 of the p input moreover one should realise that these high p extractions are sporadic and could not be sustained in a routine basis due to loss of pao activity for example lv et al 2014 operated an ebpr sbr with an extraction ratio of 0 5 once every 3 cycles after 83 days of p stripping p removal performance decreased observing a metabolic shift from pao to gao and pao declined to less than 1 of the population in a subsequent study lv and yuan 2015 extracted half of the anaerobic supernatant every cycle and reached a p recovery efficiency of 50 in 40 days of operation without additional vfa dosage in the anaerobic stage but again the internal poly p levels decreased and the system failed in the next 20 days on the other hand if the extraction ratio is properly selected to avoid over extraction pao activity can be maintained for a longer period of time in this sense a maximum automated cycle extraction ratio of 10 was suggested to ensure the stability of pao activity and thus the feasibility of a long term p recovery process guisasola et al 2019 which allowed the recovery of 60 of influent p without any harmful effect on pao in a modelling study baeza et al 2017 evaluated the impact of the anaerobic supernatant extraction ratio on the performance of an ebpr sbr p recovery system if the objective was achieving the highest concentration of p in the supernatant to facilitate precipitation an extraction ratio lower than 5 of the reactor volume 10 of the influent was recommended for which a concentration of 61 mg p l was obtained lower ratios did not increase p concentration and resulted in a lower amount of p redirected to the p recovery system due to the lower volume on the other hand higher ratios led to a decrease of pao activity and hence lower p concentration hindering p precipitation regarding the experimental studies the range of extraction ratios that led to a successful long term p recovery was 8 15 of reactor volume in batch mode and 20 to 35 of flowrate under continuous mode moreover lower extraction ratios lead to higher anaerobic p concentrations which from a practical point of view is very interesting since precipitation becomes more feasible i e with less chemical dosage requirements on the other side higher extraction ratios enable a higher amount of p recovery but at expenses of higher costs since the anaerobic p concentration is lower in summary choosing the optimal extraction ratio requires a balance between a optimal pao activity high anaerobic p concentration and a low amount of p recovered vs b hindering pao activity low anaerobic p concentration and a high amount of p recovered thus it is difficult to suggest a general optimal value but based on the results reported in the literature we propose 10 as a first initial guess for the extraction ratio when designing batch systems and 25 when designing continuous systems 3 3 influent cod p ratio and n removal another significant parameter is the influent cod p ratio the theoretical studies on mainstream p recovery indicate that wastewater with a low cod p ratio could be successfully treated in systems where mainstream p recovery is implemented due to a much better utilisation of the influent c the range of influent cod p ratios in tables 3 and 4 is very wide from 7 5 to 80 gcod gp since few reports aimed at finding the minimum cod requirements for a successful mainstream p removal recovery in general continuous systems are reported with a higher cod p ratio in addition some of the reports include simultaneous n and p removal and hence a higher amount of cod is needed other reports somehow prevent nitrification from occurring either with a low srt with allylthiourea atu addition low do setpoint or with a very low influent nitrogen load for example valverde pérez et al 2015 fixed a do setpoint of 1 5 mg l and p recovery efficiency improved up to 75 of the influent p because the activity of nitrifiers was being limited at low oxygen concentrations and p uptake was favoured in any case the choice of the do setpoint is not straightforward since too low do values may also hinder pao activity guisasola et al 2019 prevented nitrifying activity using atu tested different influent cod p ratio and showed that the minimum initial cod p ratio 7 5 gcod gp allowed 60 of the p recovery without any harmful effect on pao activity which is the value that agrees with the first experiments conducted with the bcfs methodology barat and van loosdrecht 2006 this value also agrees with the modelling work of baeza et al 2017 where a supernatant extraction of 5 of the reactor volume in each sbr cycle led to a stable operation with up to 63 of p recovered the rest of p removed was incorporated to the purged biomass where additional p recovery strategies reported for the sludge line i e as sewage sewage ash or digestate could also be applied in view of boosting the global p recovery efficiency the interaction between mainstream p recovery and nitrogen removal deserves more attention if p is recovered as struvite part of the influent ammonium 1 1 molar p n ratio would be directly recovered without nitrification denitrification needed this would decrease the n load to the plant and thus the operation costs e g those related to aeration or biomass handling to the best of our knowledge an experimental study that analyses these interactions has not been reported yet when aiming at simultaneous n and p removal a higher cod p ratio is needed in order to divert some electron donor to bnr bnr results in a certain entrance of nitrate to the anaerobic reactor and if cod limitations exist that would hinder the amount of p to be released and thus the amount of p to be recovered guerrero et al 2011 already demonstrated that pao can outcompete denitrifiers under certain operational conditions salehi et al 2019 showed that p recovery could be achieved together with bnr with synthetic wastewater of only 200 mg cod l and a cod p ratio of 20 gcod gp 3 4 concentration of p in the recovered stream a high p concentration is critical to guarantee a high p recovery performance the phostrip and bcfs processes report a minimum phosphate concentration in the stripper stream of 25 mg p l for an efficient p recovery during the crystallization process barat and van loosdrecht 2006 hao and van loosdrecht 2006 other works report a higher minimum p concentration more than 50 mg l for the struvite precipitation cordell et al 2009 kodera et al 2013 most of the mainstream p recovery processes listed in tables 3 and 4 report p concentrations higher than 50 mg l in the recovery stream even so some works report more than 100 mg l of p in the enriched stream by repeated exposure of the biofilm to external cod source acetate or propionate the typical reported anaerobic p concentrations in ebpr systems are in the range of 30 to 70 mg p l so they are in the bottom limit and this is why some of these reports use an external carbon dosage under anaerobic conditions to increase anaerobic p release in a real environment external cod dosage under anaerobic conditions boosts p release at expenses of higher operating cost moreover this addition should be sporadic or otherwise the internal poly p reserves will be depleted and thus this operation would not be sustained in a long term basis 3 5 carbon source needs most of the works in table 3 and 4 were conducted at lab scale and used synthetic wastewater to mimic urban wastewater however some of them prepared a highly loaded wastewater with an extra c inlet normally acetic acid or propionic acid acevedo et al 2015 guisasola et al 2019 wong et al 2013 and there was no need for a sporadic carbon dosage in the case of the reports with real wastewater the additional carbon source was only supplemented when the influent cod was relatively low zou and lu 2016 the only work with external cod amendment and a real environment is presented by larriba et al 2020 they treated the effluent from the primary settler of a full sale wwtp by the mainstream scepphar configuration aiming at p recovery in a demo scale and studied different strategies such as nitrite pathway to improve the efficiency of c usage in view of decreasing the carbon footprint and the operational costs this external carbon can also be obtained in a more sustainable way from the own internal plant resources though the fermentation of waste sludge which is an environmental way to obtain the vfa required to boost anaerobic p release in the work of kodera et al 2013 an additional fermentation tank was conceptually proposed to obtain enriched vfa by primary sludge fermentation which was supposed to provide enough cod for anaerobic p release and subsequent p recovery nowadays the use of side stream sludge fermenters to provide cod to fulfil the carbon needs for biological nutrient removal is becoming a trend ali et al 2021 li li and li 2018 wang et al 2019 thus it could also be used as a source for extra carbon dosage in view of p recovery 3 6 effect of other operational parameters regarding the effect of other operational parameters on the observed performance the main general recommendation would be to select them to ensure good pao activity the same conditions that would maintain pao activity in a conventional sbr or a2o continuous system would be recommended in a mainstream p recovery configuration for example baeza et al 2017 reported the effect of srt in an sbr configuration with p recovery and found a minimum of srt 4 d was required to achieve complete p removal but to achieve maximum pha production srt 10 d was recommended therefore for the specific wastewater composition used and the other particular experimental conditions e g t do ph volume exchange ratio operation objective these results were obtained but they are case specific and hence for each scenario they should be determined experimentally or using a proper modelling approach in fact mainstream p recovery is adding an additional limitation to the typical needs that pao microorganisms also require such as a minimal t dependent srt brdjanovic et al 1998 chan et al 2020b enough do and aerobic phase length and typical aerobic and anaerobic hrt tchobanoglous et al 2014 3 7 future outlook p recovery from the anaerobic supernatant of the mainstream ebpr process is a novel and promising process as in addition to the advantages of other p recovery configurations such as alleviating the problem of undesired p precipitation and recovering a valuable resource it has additional advantages that help to reduce the cod requirements for p removal allowing the treatment of wastewaters with lower cod p ratio and maintaining high p removal activity however most of the investigations concentrated on lab scale sbr and almost all recovery processes were based on p crystallization in order to optimize these systems the extraction ratio is the most basic and important operating parameter to achieve high p recovery without impairing the long term stability of the system anyway proper simulation studies should be performed as the operating parameters are case specific and highly dependant on the operating objective to demonstrate that this is a reliable technology for p recovery future works should focus on continuous configurations which seem more suitable for full scale application and using real municipal wastewater the objective is challenging as it is necessary to obtain an enriched stream with high p concentration to facilitate p recovery but without requiring the addition of an external carbon source that would compromise the economics of the process moreover lca and cost analysis should be used to demonstrate the overall positive effect of p recovery systems in wrrfs in any case policy decisions will be of paramount importance for the implementation of p recovery as it has been shown that the costs are affordable but like many environmental technologies it is not cost effective unless it is driven by policy nättorp et al 2017 4 conclusions this paper critically reviews for the first time the performance of the current reported strategies for mainstream p recovery in ebpr wwtps and provides the main points to be addressed for its successful implementation furthermore it shows that full scale mainstream p recovery is a medium term possibility it is based on the pao capability of producing a p enriched supernatant that enables p recovery and sbr and continuous configurations at different scales have been reported it can improve p removal performance and enable a successful treatment of influents with a relatively low cod p ratio configurations combining ebpr with mainstream p recovery are still at an early stage and their successful full scale application has not yet been reported the most important parameter to describe these systems is the extraction ratio the amount of anaerobic supernatant to be extracted or derived to recover p the choice of this value is a compromise between i having a low amount of p recovered with high pao activity and anaerobic p concentration i e easing precipitation and ii having a high amount of p recovered with a potential deleterious effect to pao activity and low anaerobic p concentration a maximum value for the p recovery efficiency of 60 of influent p seems the most sensitive goal for a long term operation of these systems however higher values can be used for sporadic or single extractions regarding the preferred agent for p recovery most of the works opted for struvite while vivianite or hap are less common at this point declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16247,activated sludge in wastewater treatment bioreactors contains diverse bacteria while little is known about the community structure of bacteria responsible for degradation of refractory organic compounds rocs in this study 10 rocs frequently detected in sewage were investigated and the potential bacteria degrading these rocs were analyzed by dna stable isotope probing and high throughput sequencing the results showed that the bacterial communities responsible for degradation of different rocs were largely different a total of 84 bacterial genera were found to be involved in degrading at least one of the 10 rocs however only six genera acinetobacter bacteroides bosea brevundimonas lactobacillus and pseudomonas were common to all 10 rocs this suggests that different rocs may have specific assimilating bacteria in the activated sludge our results also showed that these roc degrading bacteria are difficult to isolate by conventional methods and that most of them have relatively low relative abundance in municipal wastewater treatment bioreactors development of new technologies to increase the abundance and activity of these bacteria may significantly improve the removal efficiency of rocs from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated sludge refractory organic compounds dna sip bacterial community 1 introduction the occurrence of refractory organic compounds rocs in natural environments have received growing concerns due to their environmental persistence bioaccumulation and potential toxicity petrie et al 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 many of these rocs enter the natural environments through wastewater treatment and discharge systems liu and wong 2013 mhuka et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 for example various antibiotics and antimicrobial agents such as sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz amoxicillin amx triclosan tcs triclocarban tcc butylparaben bp and ethylparaben ep have been detected in surface waters adeleye et al 2022 petrie et al 2015 wang et al 2021b and these substances were all present in the wastewater because they were widely used as pharmaceuticals and personal care products petrie et al 2015 yang et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa and nonylphenol np are widely used in industries wastewater generated during the their production and application may contaminate the natural waters if the degradation is not completed during wastewater treatment processes petrie et al 2015 soares et al 2008 most of the rocs have strong structural stability and biological toxicity which makes them difficult to be removed from wastewater a variety of treatment technologies including biodegradation advanced oxidation membrane separation and adsorption have been investigated to remove rocs from wastewater du et al 2017b francisco et al 2018 li et al 2011 as the most cost effective approach biotechnologies have drawn wide and increasing attention and many studies have been conducted on roc removal by biological processes in recent years ashfaq et al 2017 tran et al 2016 wolff et al 2018 researchers have identified and isolated several roc degrading bacteria from wastewater treatment bioreactors for example bacillus firmus pseudomonas putida achromobacter denitrificans pr1 pseudomonas psychrophile ha 4 alcaligenes faecalis ochrobactrum sp sa1 labrys sp sc11 and gordonia sp scd14 can degrade smx jiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 lactococcus lactis subsp lactis 712 sphingomonas sp and bacillus sp gzb were shown to be able to degrade bpa endo et al 2007 xiong et al 2017 yu et al 2019 however because the majority of microbes resist cultivation as isolated bacteria it is difficult to fully understand the community structures and functions of roc degrading bacteria in wastewater treatment systems the lack of knowledge on bacterial population and their pollutant degradation ability in engineered systems hinders the development of strategies to improve roc removal from wastewater high throughput metagenomic sequencing is a promising technology to unravel the microbial community structure however the phylogenetic and taxonomic information obtained from metagenomic sequencing provides little information on the functions of microbes schloss and handelsman 2004 furthermore it is very challenging to link functions to specific microorganisms based only on metagenomic sequencing wellington et al 2003 dna stable isotope probing dna sip provides an effective approach to study functional microorganisms in complex environments yi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 by applying this method stable isotopes e g 13c or 15n isotopes are first labeled to substrates of interest and microorganisms utilizing a stable isotope labeled substrate incorporate the stable isotopes into their dna which can then be separated from the dna of other bacteria by using density gradient centrifugation wang et al 2020 ziels et al 2018 analyzing the separated dna can provide detailed information about the bacteria utilizing the substrate dna sip has been used to investigate functional bacteria in various samples from complex environments teng et al 2021 wang et al 2021a several studies sathyamoorthy et al 2018 ziels et al 2018 have also been performed to explore the functional bacteria in activated sludge however to the best of our knowledge most of the previous studies only focused on one specific organic substance and a comprehensive comparison of bacteria degrading different rocs has not been conducted the bacterial community in activated sludge is highly diverse zhang et al 2018 but it is not clear which bacteria are involved in roc degradation and assimilation and the specificity of roc degrading bacteria has also not been reported fully answering these questions may improve our understanding of the microbial ecology of activated sludge and may be helpful for developing novel bioaugmentation strategies in this study we investigated the biodegradation process of 10 common rocs in activated sludge systems the 12c in the benzene ring of each roc was replaced by 13c and each 13c labeled roc was used as the sole carbon source to cultivate activated sludge dna sip technology and high throughput sequencing were applied to identify roc degrading bacteria in the activated sludge to analyze the specific and shared degrading bacteria of the rocs and also to reveal the associations among bacteria degrading different rocs moreover based on the published high throughput sequencing data of the activated sludge samples we also investigated the distribution of roc degrading bacteria in different wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge enriched with rocs in this study 10 rocs table s1 were used to enrich activated sludge with seeding sludge taken from the aerobic zone of the bioreactor of a full scale municipal wwtp in nanjing china the composition of the feed water is shown in table s2 to enhance the enrichment process the initial concentration of each roc in the batch experiments was set to 10 mg l as performed in a previous study song et al 2019 because of the low solubility of some rocs in water the rocs were first dissolved in acetone and the solutions were used to prepare feed water sathyamoorthy et al 2018 the enrichment process lasted for 60 days and then sludge samples were collected for the dna sip experiments in addition a portion of the sludge samples were collected for dna extraction 2 2 dna stable isotope probing sludge samples from the enriched treatments were centrifuged for 5 min 5000 xg 4 c and the sludge pellets were washed three times with 1 pbs and resuspended in the medium table s2 for dna sip experiments for each roc batch experiments included triple 12c roc controls triple 12c roc sip controls and triple 13c roc sip experiments were conducted to explore the bacterial communities involved in degrading these rocs in the activated sludge all rocs had at least one benzene ring where 12c was substituted by 13c and each 12c roc and 13c roc was separately used to feed the enriched activated sludge each of the experiments was conducted in a 250 ml glass container with a liquid volume of 100 ml the initial sludge concentration was 200 mg vss l and the initial concentration of each roc was 10 mg l this concentration was relatively higher than the typical roc concentrations detected in wastewater applied in the experiments the purpose of applying such a high concentration was to ensure the availability of labeled 13c dna because the biomass yields from low concentrations of rocs are not sufficient for dna extraction and other downstream analyses the 12c roc and 12c roc sip control experiments were spiked with unlabeled rocs 12c roc 99 9 toronto research chemicals north york canada and 13c roc sip experiments were spiked with labeled rocs 99 toronto research chemicals north york canada for 12c roc control experiments the roc concentrations were measured periodically to determine the appropriate time at which to terminate the sip experiments sludge samples were collected at an roc removal efficiency 90 to maximize the biodegradation and assimilation of 13c rocs while minimizing cross feeding of 13c roc metabolites sathyamoorthy et al 2018 all experiments were conducted in a magnetic stirring apparatus operating at 250 rpm at 20 1 c the sludge samples collected during the experimental process were temporarily stored at 20 c for dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and density gradient ultracentrifugation the dna of each sludge 12c roc sip controls and 13c roc sip experiments sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the purity and concentration of the extracted dna were determined using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific de usa and confirmed by agarose gel 1 electrophoresis and the extracted dna was stored at 20 c approximately 5 μg

72 g ml neufeld et al 2007 the density was determined using a digital refractometer model ar200 leica microsystems inc usa and adjusted using a cscl solution or tris edta buffer after balancing and sealing the tubes were centrifuged at 180 000 xg 20 c for 48 h in an optima l 100 xp ultracentrifuge beckman coulter with a beckman vti 90 centrifuge rotor neufeld et al 2007 ouyang et al 2019 after centrifugation ten gradient fractions 500 μl each were collected from the ultracentrifuge tube using a syringe pump the density of each fraction was determined using a digital refractometer dna was recovered from each fraction using ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 60 μl dna free water 2 4 16s rrna gene sequencing to analyze the bacterial community in the samples the bacterial 16s rrna

purified pcr products were used to construct a 16s library then the 16s library pools were analyzed by agilent 2100 agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa to ascertain library quality and average size distribution the concentration of the pools was determined via qubit 2 0 life technologies ca usa and then diluted to 2 nm the qualified 16s library was sequenced on a miseq sequencer illumina san diego ca usa 2 5 sequencing data analysis the 16s rrna gene sequencing data were processed with qiime caporaso et al 2010 to remove low quality reads and to merge the forward and reverse reads the operation taxonomic unit otu and alpha diversity indices of the clean data were also calculated by using this software principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted using the vegan and ggplott2 packages in r and was applied to depict the similarities and differences between the microbial communities of all samples based on the relative abundance of otus wilcoxon test was performed on the heavy layers of 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples to explore the otus with significant differences p 0 05 then tbtools chen et al 2020 was used to generate an upset plot to show the quantitative relationships among the roc degrading bacteria in different samples network analysis was performed by gephi heymann 2014 to investigate the cooccurrence of roc degrading bacteria in different rocs jitter plot was generated by the ggplot2 package in r and was used to reflect the relative abundance distribution of degrading otus in each roc sample we used the pheatmap and ggplot2 packages in r to obtain a heatmap to show the relative abundance of all roc degrading bacteria in addition we also analyzed the 16s rrna gene sequencing data of activated sludge from wwtps globally and used pcoa and heatmaps to reflect the correlation of roc degrading bacteria in activated sludge from wwtps on different continents 2 6 roc concentration analysis the concentrations of rocs in water samples were

rocs in this study the degradation process of 10 rocs i e bisphenol a bpa ibuprofen ibu triclosan tcs triclocarban tcc butylparaben bp ethylparaben ep nonyl phenol np sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz and amoxicillin amx were investigated in bioreactors seeded with municipal wastewater treatment activated sludge these compounds are widely used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products and are commonly found in wastewater petrie et al 2015 detailed information on these rocs was listed in table s1 as shown in fig 1 after an enrichment period all 10 rocs could be degraded to relatively low concentrations 1 mg l however the degradation efficiencies of different rocs were obviously different at the linear degradation stage ep had the highest degradation efficiency which was estimated to be 1 40 μg mg vss h the degradation rates of tcc np and smx were 0 66 0 76 and 0 70 μg mg vss h respectively which were relatively lower than that of ep consequently 90 of the ep was removed over 40 h while it took over 72 h for tcc np and smx to achieve 90 removal efficiency for other rocs 90 removal efficiencies were achieved over approximately 48 h sdz bpa ibu and tcs and 56 h amx and np the different removal efficiencies may have resulted from the different structures and toxicities of the compounds additionally this implies that the microbial communities involved in the degradation process of these rocs could have been different 3 2 microbial community structures of roc enriched sludge after the activated sludge was enriched with different rocs we analyzed the overall microbial community in each sludge sample based on 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing through principal coordinate analysis fig s1 it was found that the bacterial communities in the tcc and ibu enriched samples were distinctly different from those in the other samples more specifically as shown in fig s2 the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in the bpa and tcc enriched sludge was significantly higher than that in the other samples oxyphotobacteria was only abundant in the ibu enriched sludge and gammaproteobacteria in the tcs enriched sludge was dominant with the enriched sludge 12c roc control and 12c roc sip experiments were conducted by using 12c roc and 13c roc sip experiments were conducted by using 13c rocs then the dna was extracted from 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples and stratified by using density gradient ultracentrifugation after centrifugation the density of the gradient solution at different heights of the centrifuge tubes was measured and shown in table s4 obviously the density of the liquid gradually decreased from 1 75 1 80 g ml in the lower layers to 1 56 1 64 g ml in the upper layers this suggests that the density gradient ultracentrifugation process was sufficient to achieve the separation of heavy and light dna the separated dna was subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing to investigate the microbial communities according to the clustering analysis performed with 16s rrna gene sequences fig 2 a the heavy layer of 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples can be clearly clustered into different groups indicating that the microbial compositions of the samples were significantly different as shown in fig s3 the alpha diversity indices of the 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples were also significantly different wilcoxon test on samples with replication p 0 05 the index values of the 13c roc sip samples were obviously higher than the 12c roc sip samples suggesting that the bacterial community diversities were higher in the 13c roc sip samples the alpha diversity indices among different 13c roc sip samples were also obviously different which to some extent indicates that the diversity and composition of degrading bacteria of different rocs may have been very different further microbial composition analysis confirmed the differences fig 2b the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria and clostridia in the 13c bpa heavy layer was approximately 50 and 20 respectively which was significantly higher than that in the 12c bpa heavy layer the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria in the 13c ibu heavy layer was as high as 90 which was significantly higher than the 10 in the 12c ibu heavy layer for the tcs sample the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria in the 12c heavy layer was significantly higher than that in the 13c heavy layer betaproteobacteria was abundant in the 13c heavy layers of tcc bp ep and np for smx and sdz the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in the 13c heavy layer was higher than that in the 12c heavy layer although the bacterial compositions of the heavy layers of the different samples were different alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were abundant in most samples on the other hand some bacteria were specific to certain rocs for example vadinha49 was only abundant in the 13c heavy layers of the tcc enriched samples fig 2b 3 3 comparison of the assimilating bacteria of different rocs to further investigate the relationships of the bacterial communities involved in roc degradation we systematically analyzed the potential roc assimilating bacteria at different taxonomic ranks as expected the numbers of bacterial taxonomic ranks shared by different roc samples decreased distinctly with increasing sample number while the average relative abundances of the shared bacteria gradually increased fig s4 and table s5 in total 84 genera were identified as roc assimilating bacteria and 50 of them were found to assimilate only one of the 10 rocs besides only six genera acinetobacter bacteroides bosea brevundimonas lactobacillus pseudomonas can assimilate all 10 rocs the total relative abundance of the six genera was 6 0 while the relative abundance of the 50 genera assimilating one roc was less than 0 08 in addition we also investigated roc degrading bacteria based on otus fig 3 a shows the number of otus observed in different samples the numbers of otus that appeared only in one sample ranked higher the number of specific otus in the ibu sample was as high as 175 and the number of specific otus in the bpa sample was only 15 however it was still higher than the number of the otus shared by two or more specific samples in addition it was also found that the otus involved in the degradation of multiple rocs are limited and the number of otus decreased as the number of rocs increased for example the number of most otus that were involved in two rocs was greater than three however when the number of rocs increased to three or four the corresponding otu number was lower than three only one otu was found to be present in the samples of four or more different rocs moreover fig s5 shows that the proportion of specific otu numbers in all samples was greater than 60 these results suggest that most assimilating bacteria were specific to the rocs furthermore we investigated the shared and specific degrading bacteria of different rocs based on the otu analysis results in total we obtained 1059 otus that were specific to only one roc while only 141 otus were shared by 2 rocs as shown in fig 3b some otus were shared by different rocs but no otu was associated with all 10 rocs moreover the numbers of shared otus corresponding to different rocs were also significantly different among them the bp sample contained the largest number of shared otus 61 followed by the tcc 54 and smx 50 samples while for the tcs sample the number was only two according to the taxonomic annotation results fig 3b 76 2 of the shared otus among the different rocs were affiliated with proteobacteria followed by chloroflexi 6 7 actinobacteria 5 4 firmicutes 0 6 etc for the otus specific to only one roc the taxonomic annotation results are shown in fig s6 among them the most dominant otus were also affiliated with proteobacteria with a relative abundance of 66 40 followed by chloroflexi and bacteroidetes with relative abundances of 8 20 and 6 25 respectively figs 3c and s7 show the relative abundance of specific and shared otus in the different samples for eight of the 10 rocs including bpa ibu tcs ep np smx sdz and amx the specific otus were dominant and the largest relative abundance value of specific otus appeared in the bpa sample 80 however the relative abundances of shared otus of these rocs were relatively lower 10 in contrast the relative abundances of shared otus in the tcc and bp samples were approximately 70 and 50 which were much higher than those of the specific otus these results suggest that most of the assimilating bacteria involved in the degradation process were specific to rocs and the proportion of shared assimilating bacteria was relatively low in addition to the shared and specific otus we also analyzed the dominant bacteria involved in the assimilation of different rocs the relative abundances of these otus were shown in fig 4 a and their taxonomic assignment results at the genus level are summarized in fig 4b ibu bp and sdz samples had only one dominant genus i e pseudomonas thauera and azohydromonas respectively their relative abundances in the ibu bp and tcc heavy samples were 88 2 6 8 and 5 6 respectively for the bpa tcs tcc and np samples two dominant assimilating bacterial genera were observed these dominant assimilating bacteria included sphingomonas pseudomonas methyloversatilis phenylobacterium parvibaculum prosthecobacter and hydrogenophaga their relative abundances ranged from 2 8 to 58 3 although the number of dominant assimilating bacteria of rocs was limited shared assimilating bacteria were widely observed among different rocs for example hydrogenophaga could assimilate ep and amx while pseudomonas could assimilate bpa ibu and tcs 3 4 isolation of roc degrading bacteria to verify the functions of roc degrading bacteria identified by dna sip we performed isolation and obtained several pure cultured bacterial species as shown in table s6 although only a few bacteria were successfully isolated in this study the isolated roc degrading bacteria were generally consistent with the dna sip results according to table s6 sphingomonas and pseudomonas were isolated with bpa as the carbon source while pseudomonas identified by dna sip was not isolated in this study but has been reported to be successfully isolated in previous studies mita et al 2015 vijayalakshmi et al 2018 for ibu pseudomonas bacillus sphingomonas and methylobacterium were isolated in this study and in previous studies marchlewicz et al 2016 murdoch and hay 2013 sordelli et al 1985 however only pseudomonas was identified by dna sip as shown in table s6 pseudomonas and sphingomonas were identified as tcs degrading bacteria by dna sip and this is consistent with the degradation functions of these two genera reported in previous studies mulla et al 2016 thelusmond et al 2019 3 5 distribution of different roc degrading bacteria in wwtps based on the analysis results of the roc assimilating and degrading bacteria we also investigated their distribution and relative abundance in different wwtps from around the world by using the data published by wu et al 2019 according to the pcoa fig s8 the samples from africa are very special and almost all are clustered together however samples from other continents are widely scattered and there is no obvious clustering among them this pattern was confirmed by the correlation analysis results in fig 5 a the average correlation coefficient among wwtps in africa is 0 85 which is higher than that in other continents the average correlation coefficient among wwtps in asia is 0 76 and the values among asia and other continents are all lower than 0 75 in addition the relative abundances of assimilating and degrading bacteria of different rocs are different according to fig 5b the relative abundance of amx degrading bacteria in the wwtps is distinctly higher than that of other rocs bacteria related to bpa ibu tcs bp and ep are also highly present in some wwtps consistently the concentrations of these substances in the influent of wwtps are generally higher than those of other rocs table s8 among the bacteria related to bpa ibu and tcs pseudomonas is the most abundant genus and its relative abundance in some wwtps reaches up to 60 thaurea which is related to the assimilation and degradation of bp was found to be present as high as 40 in some wwtps fig s9 since the roc concentration in wastewater is usually relatively low roc assimilation is probably due to the functions of these bacteria and they may also live on a variety of other organic matter 4 discussion in this study we investigated the bacterial community involved in the degradation process of 10 refractory organics which are the frequently detected personal care products tcs tcc bp and ep pharmaceutical ibu smx sdz and amx and chemicals bpa and np in wwtps the concentrations of these organics in the wastewater are relatively high and the traditional treatment processes in wwtps usually have a poor removal efficiency on them petrie et al 2015 compared with sequencing only technology dna sip can effectively identify the bacteria responsible for the assimilation and degradation of organic matter our results showed that the communities of different roc degrading bacteria were largely different indicating that these bacteria in activated sludge were specific to the rocs this could be attributed to the biodegradability of the rocs some rocs are relatively easier to biodegrade therefore more bacteria can participate in their degradation process seo et al 2009 however the degradation process of some other rocs may require the cooperation of several different bacterial species seo et al 2009 leading to a higher diversity of degrading bacterial communities although the diversity of the degrading bacteria of the rocs was different proteobacteria had an absolute predominance 80 in most of the enriched sludge samples obtained in this study it is well known that proteobacteria is dominant in municipal wastewater treatment activated sludge ye et al 2012 their contribution to the roc degradation process may be attributed to their high diversity in activated sludge although the bacterial communities responsible for different roc assimilation and degradation were different we still observed some bacterial species involved in the degradation of multiple rocs fig 3a and b the chemical structures of rocs may be one of the main factors affecting the community of degrading bacteria for example tcs and tcc share degrading bacteria because they have similar chemical structures and belong to the same class of antibacterial drugs lenz et al 2017 the two substances bp and ep share degrading bacteria comamonadaceae hydrogenophaga methyloversatilis etc with a variety of rocs such as bpa ibu tcc np smx sdz and amx this may be because these substances have simple chemical structures and relatively low toxicity blair et al 2000 and can be degraded by a variety of microorganisms which was confirmed by the bacterial community analysis results although smx sdz and amx are all antibiotics their chemical structures are very different li and zhang 2013 pereira et al 2014 therefore as expected there were few shared degrading bacteria among them although shared degrading bacteria among different rocs were present their quantity was very limited i e the community composition was relatively simple moreover their relative abundance in the total community was also relatively low therefore the shared degrading bacteria among different substances may not play a significant role in the roc degradation process most roc degrading bacteria were specific to the corresponding rocs and the relative abundance of specific degrading bacteria was higher these results indicate that the biodegradation process of rocs relies on the synergistic effect of multiple specific bacteria and to enhance the removal efficiency these specific bacteria should be considered when bioaugmentation or other new technologies are developed and applied in wastewater treatment facilities treating wastewater containing rocs in addition the detailed functions and characteristics of these bacteria should be further investigated in future better understanding of the characteristics may provide more useful information for the operation of the wastewater treatment systems and improve the roc removal efficiency through dna sip data analysis we identified the assimilating bacteria of each roc and we also confirmed their identification through bacterial isolation generally the assimilating bacteria had a low diversity and were specific to corresponding rocs although most degrading bacteria have not been successfully isolated in this study and the previous studies the dna sip results were partially verified according to the bacterial isolation experiments of this study the bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas and pseudomonas were isolated and cultivated and their bpa degradation ability has been reported in multiple studies eio et al 2014 sakai et al 2007 for ibu only pseudomonas was identified as degrading bacteria by dna sip and other ibu degrading bacteria including bacillus sphingomonas and methylobacterium could also be isolated from activated sludge marchlewicz et al 2016 murdoch and hay 2013 this suggests that there are still some inconsistency between the results of these two methods it is well known that most bacteria in natural and engineering systems resist cultivation amann et al 1995 this is probably the major reason for the inconsistency in the dna sip and isolation results some rocs may not be degraded by only one specific bacterium during the isolation process the bacteria were spread on the surface of the solid medium and therefore co metabolisms are difficult to be achieved by different bacteria species this could be the reason leading to the unsuccessful isolation of roc degrading bacteria on the other hand the degrading bacteria identified by dna sip may have been the bacteria only involved in the first step of roc degradation assimilation friedrich 2006 in this study we tried to avoid involving nonsignificant bacteria by terminating the experiment within a given period of time roc removal efficiency reaching 90 sathyamoorthy et al 2018 we applied rocs with 13c in the benzene rings because for most aromatic compounds the benzene ring breaking process determines the difficulty of degradation fuchs et al 2011 however some bacteria living on the intermediate products of the 13c compounds may still be introduced therefore although the isolation results partially confirmed the dna sip results they also have obvious limitations due to the cultural resistance of bacteria more advanced omics and isolation approaches are required to further investigate the roc degrading mechanisms and the bacteria involved in the degradation process by exploring the distribution of roc assimilating and roc degrading bacteria in wwtps it was found that their differences among different wwtps were not significant the reason for this observation may be that rocs are low concentration pollutants in most wastewater especially municipal wastewater therefore the concentration of rocs has little effect on roc assimilating and roc degrading bacteria in different wwtps furthermore due to the low concentration of rocs and their low biodegradability oliveira et al 2015 only a small number of the microorganisms in the sludge are involved in the roc degradation process therefore the environmental factors and operation of wwtps may have very limited impacts on the bacterial composition by comparing the relative abundance of the degrading bacteria of the rocs we found that the degrading bacteria of some rocs including bpa ibu tcs bp and amx were relatively abundant in the wwtps probably because the concentrations of these substances in the wwtps were also relatively high petrie et al 2015 table s8 moreover it is also possible that these bacteria have other functions in addition to roc degradation for example pseudomonas has been widely reported to degrade complex organic matter furmanczyk et al 2018 park and oh 2020 safari et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 thaurea not only has the ability to degrade organic matter folwell et al 2016 ramos et al 2016 but also plays an important role in the denitrification process du et al 2017a ma et al 2017 skleničková et al 2020 and dechloromonas has both the ability to degrade organic matter shi et al 2020 xu et al 2018 it is also worth noting that a high relative abundance of roc degrading bacteria may not guarantee the high removal efficiency of rocs in wastewater treatment bioreactors their functional gene expression activities and synergistic relationships within the bacterial community co metabolisms may also affect the roc removal process therefore further studies are warranted to investigate the detailed functions of these roc degrading bacteria and develop new technologies to improve their performance in activated sludge systems 5 conclusions the bacterial communities responsible for the assimilation and degradation of different rocs are largely different in activated sludge the number of bacterial taxa that can assimilate different rocs is quite limited only six bacterial genera were found to be able to assimilate all 10 rocs investigated in this study the roc assimilating bacteria are difficult to be isolated using common isolation methods most of the roc assimilating bacteria remain uncultured most of the roc assimilating bacteria have relatively low abundance in municipal wastewater treatment bioreactors while the relative abundance of amx degrading bacteria in the wwtps is distinctly higher than that for other rocs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16247,activated sludge in wastewater treatment bioreactors contains diverse bacteria while little is known about the community structure of bacteria responsible for degradation of refractory organic compounds rocs in this study 10 rocs frequently detected in sewage were investigated and the potential bacteria degrading these rocs were analyzed by dna stable isotope probing and high throughput sequencing the results showed that the bacterial communities responsible for degradation of different rocs were largely different a total of 84 bacterial genera were found to be involved in degrading at least one of the 10 rocs however only six genera acinetobacter bacteroides bosea brevundimonas lactobacillus and pseudomonas were common to all 10 rocs this suggests that different rocs may have specific assimilating bacteria in the activated sludge our results also showed that these roc degrading bacteria are difficult to isolate by conventional methods and that most of them have relatively low relative abundance in municipal wastewater treatment bioreactors development of new technologies to increase the abundance and activity of these bacteria may significantly improve the removal efficiency of rocs from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated sludge refractory organic compounds dna sip bacterial community 1 introduction the occurrence of refractory organic compounds rocs in natural environments have received growing concerns due to their environmental persistence bioaccumulation and potential toxicity petrie et al 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 many of these rocs enter the natural environments through wastewater treatment and discharge systems liu and wong 2013 mhuka et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 for example various antibiotics and antimicrobial agents such as sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz amoxicillin amx triclosan tcs triclocarban tcc butylparaben bp and ethylparaben ep have been detected in surface waters adeleye et al 2022 petrie et al 2015 wang et al 2021b and these substances were all present in the wastewater because they were widely used as pharmaceuticals and personal care products petrie et al 2015 yang et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa and nonylphenol np are widely used in industries wastewater generated during the their production and application may contaminate the natural waters if the degradation is not completed during wastewater treatment processes petrie et al 2015 soares et al 2008 most of the rocs have strong structural stability and biological toxicity which makes them difficult to be removed from wastewater a variety of treatment technologies including biodegradation advanced oxidation membrane separation and adsorption have been investigated to remove rocs from wastewater du et al 2017b francisco et al 2018 li et al 2011 as the most cost effective approach biotechnologies have drawn wide and increasing attention and many studies have been conducted on roc removal by biological processes in recent years ashfaq et al 2017 tran et al 2016 wolff et al 2018 researchers have identified and isolated several roc degrading bacteria from wastewater treatment bioreactors for example bacillus firmus pseudomonas putida achromobacter denitrificans pr1 pseudomonas psychrophile ha 4 alcaligenes faecalis ochrobactrum sp sa1 labrys sp sc11 and gordonia sp scd14 can degrade smx jiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 lactococcus lactis subsp lactis 712 sphingomonas sp and bacillus sp gzb were shown to be able to degrade bpa endo et al 2007 xiong et al 2017 yu et al 2019 however because the majority of microbes resist cultivation as isolated bacteria it is difficult to fully understand the community structures and functions of roc degrading bacteria in wastewater treatment systems the lack of knowledge on bacterial population and their pollutant degradation ability in engineered systems hinders the development of strategies to improve roc removal from wastewater high throughput metagenomic sequencing is a promising technology to unravel the microbial community structure however the phylogenetic and taxonomic information obtained from metagenomic sequencing provides little information on the functions of microbes schloss and handelsman 2004 furthermore it is very challenging to link functions to specific microorganisms based only on metagenomic sequencing wellington et al 2003 dna stable isotope probing dna sip provides an effective approach to study functional microorganisms in complex environments yi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 by applying this method stable isotopes e g 13c or 15n isotopes are first labeled to substrates of interest and microorganisms utilizing a stable isotope labeled substrate incorporate the stable isotopes into their dna which can then be separated from the dna of other bacteria by using density gradient centrifugation wang et al 2020 ziels et al 2018 analyzing the separated dna can provide detailed information about the bacteria utilizing the substrate dna sip has been used to investigate functional bacteria in various samples from complex environments teng et al 2021 wang et al 2021a several studies sathyamoorthy et al 2018 ziels et al 2018 have also been performed to explore the functional bacteria in activated sludge however to the best of our knowledge most of the previous studies only focused on one specific organic substance and a comprehensive comparison of bacteria degrading different rocs has not been conducted the bacterial community in activated sludge is highly diverse zhang et al 2018 but it is not clear which bacteria are involved in roc degradation and assimilation and the specificity of roc degrading bacteria has also not been reported fully answering these questions may improve our understanding of the microbial ecology of activated sludge and may be helpful for developing novel bioaugmentation strategies in this study we investigated the biodegradation process of 10 common rocs in activated sludge systems the 12c in the benzene ring of each roc was replaced by 13c and each 13c labeled roc was used as the sole carbon source to cultivate activated sludge dna sip technology and high throughput sequencing were applied to identify roc degrading bacteria in the activated sludge to analyze the specific and shared degrading bacteria of the rocs and also to reveal the associations among bacteria degrading different rocs moreover based on the published high throughput sequencing data of the activated sludge samples we also investigated the distribution of roc degrading bacteria in different wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge enriched with rocs in this study 10 rocs table s1 were used to enrich activated sludge with seeding sludge taken from the aerobic zone of the bioreactor of a full scale municipal wwtp in nanjing china the composition of the feed water is shown in table s2 to enhance the enrichment process the initial concentration of each roc in the batch experiments was set to 10 mg l as performed in a previous study song et al 2019 because of the low solubility of some rocs in water the rocs were first dissolved in acetone and the solutions were used to prepare feed water sathyamoorthy et al 2018 the enrichment process lasted for 60 days and then sludge samples were collected for the dna sip experiments in addition a portion of the sludge samples were collected for dna extraction 2 2 dna stable isotope probing sludge samples from the enriched treatments were centrifuged for 5 min 5000 xg 4 c and the sludge pellets were washed three times with 1 pbs and resuspended in the medium table s2 for dna sip experiments for each roc batch experiments included triple 12c roc controls triple 12c roc sip controls and triple 13c roc sip experiments were conducted to explore the bacterial communities involved in degrading these rocs in the activated sludge all rocs had at least one benzene ring where 12c was substituted by 13c and each 12c roc and 13c roc was separately used to feed the enriched activated sludge each of the experiments was conducted in a 250 ml glass container with a liquid volume of 100 ml the initial sludge concentration was 200 mg vss l and the initial concentration of each roc was 10 mg l this concentration was relatively higher than the typical roc concentrations detected in wastewater applied in the experiments the purpose of applying such a high concentration was to ensure the availability of labeled 13c dna because the biomass yields from low concentrations of rocs are not sufficient for dna extraction and other downstream analyses the 12c roc and 12c roc sip control experiments were spiked with unlabeled rocs 12c roc 99 9 toronto research chemicals north york canada and 13c roc sip experiments were spiked with labeled rocs 99 toronto research chemicals north york canada for 12c roc control experiments the roc concentrations were measured periodically to determine the appropriate time at which to terminate the sip experiments sludge samples were collected at an roc removal efficiency 90 to maximize the biodegradation and assimilation of 13c rocs while minimizing cross feeding of 13c roc metabolites sathyamoorthy et al 2018 all experiments were conducted in a magnetic stirring apparatus operating at 250 rpm at 20 1 c the sludge samples collected during the experimental process were temporarily stored at 20 c for dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and density gradient ultracentrifugation the dna of each sludge 12c roc sip controls and 13c roc sip experiments sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the purity and concentration of the extracted dna were determined using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific de usa and confirmed by agarose gel 1 electrophoresis and the extracted dna was stored at 20 c approximately 5 μg

72 g ml neufeld et al 2007 the density was determined using a digital refractometer model ar200 leica microsystems inc usa and adjusted using a cscl solution or tris edta buffer after balancing and sealing the tubes were centrifuged at 180 000 xg 20 c for 48 h in an optima l 100 xp ultracentrifuge beckman coulter with a beckman vti 90 centrifuge rotor neufeld et al 2007 ouyang et al 2019 after centrifugation ten gradient fractions 500 μl each were collected from the ultracentrifuge tube using a syringe pump the density of each fraction was determined using a digital refractometer dna was recovered from each fraction using ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 60 μl dna free water 2 4 16s rrna gene sequencing to analyze the bacterial community in the samples the bacterial 16s rrna

size distribution the concentration of the pools was determined via qubit 2 0 life technologies ca usa and then diluted to 2 nm the qualified 16s library was sequenced on a miseq sequencer illumina san diego ca usa 2 5 sequencing data analysis the 16s rrna gene sequencing data were processed with qiime caporaso et al 2010 to remove low quality reads and to merge the forward and reverse reads the operation taxonomic unit otu and alpha diversity indices of the clean data were also calculated by using this software principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted using the vegan and ggplott2 packages in r and was applied to depict the similarities and differences between the microbial communities of all samples based on the relative abundance of otus wilcoxon test was performed on the heavy layers of 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples to explore the otus with significant differences p 0 05 then tbtools chen et al 2020 was used to generate an upset plot to show the quantitative relationships among the roc degrading bacteria in different samples network analysis was performed by gephi heymann 2014 to investigate the cooccurrence of roc degrading bacteria in different rocs jitter plot was generated by the ggplot2 package in r and was used to reflect the relative abundance distribution of degrading otus in each roc sample we used the pheatmap and ggplot2 packages in r to obtain a heatmap to show the relative abundance of all roc degrading bacteria in addition we also analyzed the 16s rrna gene sequencing data of activated sludge from wwtps globally and used pcoa and heatmaps to reflect the correlation of roc degrading bacteria in activated sludge from wwtps on different continents 2 6 roc concentration analysis the concentrations of rocs in water samples were

rocs in this study the degradation process of 10 rocs i e bisphenol a bpa ibuprofen ibu triclosan tcs triclocarban tcc butylparaben bp ethylparaben ep nonyl phenol np sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz and amoxicillin amx were investigated in bioreactors seeded with municipal wastewater treatment activated sludge these compounds are widely used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products and are commonly found in wastewater petrie et al 2015 detailed information on these rocs was listed in table s1 as shown in fig 1 after an enrichment period all 10 rocs could be degraded to relatively low concentrations 1 mg l however the degradation efficiencies of different rocs were obviously different at the linear degradation stage ep had the highest degradation efficiency which was estimated to be 1 40 μg mg vss h the degradation rates of tcc np and smx were 0 66 0 76 and 0 70 μg mg vss h respectively which were relatively lower than that of ep consequently 90 of the ep was removed over 40 h while it took over 72 h for tcc np and smx to achieve 90 removal efficiency for other rocs 90 removal efficiencies were achieved over approximately 48 h sdz bpa ibu and tcs and 56 h amx and np the different removal efficiencies may have resulted from the different structures and toxicities of the compounds additionally this implies that the microbial communities involved in the degradation process of these rocs could have been different 3 2 microbial community structures of roc enriched sludge after the activated sludge was enriched with different rocs we analyzed the overall microbial community in each sludge sample based on 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing through principal coordinate analysis fig s1 it was found that the bacterial communities in the tcc and ibu enriched samples were distinctly different from those in the other samples more specifically as shown in fig s2 the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in the bpa and tcc enriched sludge was significantly higher than that in the other samples oxyphotobacteria was only abundant in the ibu enriched sludge and gammaproteobacteria in the tcs enriched sludge was dominant with the enriched sludge 12c roc control and 12c roc sip experiments were conducted by using 12c roc and 13c roc sip experiments were conducted by using 13c rocs then the dna was extracted from 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples and stratified by using density gradient ultracentrifugation after centrifugation the density of the gradient solution at different heights of the centrifuge tubes was measured and shown in table s4 obviously the density of the liquid gradually decreased from 1 75 1 80 g ml in the lower layers to 1 56 1 64 g ml in the upper layers this suggests that the density gradient ultracentrifugation process was sufficient to achieve the separation of heavy and light dna the separated dna was subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing to investigate the microbial communities according to the clustering analysis performed with 16s rrna gene sequences fig 2 a the heavy layer of 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples can be clearly clustered into different groups indicating that the microbial compositions of the samples were significantly different as shown in fig s3 the alpha diversity indices of the 12c roc sip and 13c roc sip samples were also significantly different wilcoxon test on samples with replication p 0 05 the index values of the 13c roc sip samples were obviously higher than the 12c roc sip samples suggesting that the bacterial community diversities were higher in the 13c roc sip samples the alpha diversity indices among different 13c roc sip samples were also obviously different which to some extent indicates that the diversity and composition of degrading bacteria of different rocs may have been very different further microbial composition analysis confirmed the differences fig 2b the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria and clostridia in the 13c bpa heavy layer was approximately 50 and 20 respectively which was significantly higher than that in the 12c bpa heavy layer the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria in the 13c ibu heavy layer was as high as 90 which was significantly higher than the 10 in the 12c ibu heavy layer for the tcs sample the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria in the 12c heavy layer was significantly higher than that in the 13c heavy layer betaproteobacteria was abundant in the 13c heavy layers of tcc bp ep and np for smx and sdz the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in the 13c heavy layer was higher than that in the 12c heavy layer although the bacterial compositions of the heavy layers of the different samples were different alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were abundant in most samples on the other hand some bacteria were specific to certain rocs for example vadinha49 was only abundant in the 13c heavy layers of the tcc enriched samples fig 2b 3 3 comparison of the assimilating bacteria of different rocs to further investigate the relationships of the bacterial communities involved in roc degradation we systematically analyzed the potential roc assimilating bacteria at different taxonomic ranks as expected the numbers of bacterial taxonomic ranks shared by different roc samples decreased distinctly with increasing sample number while the average relative abundances of the shared bacteria gradually increased fig s4 and table s5 in total 84 genera were identified as roc assimilating bacteria and 50 of them were found to assimilate only one of the 10 rocs besides only six genera acinetobacter bacteroides bosea brevundimonas lactobacillus pseudomonas can assimilate all 10 rocs the total relative abundance of the six genera was 6 0 while the relative abundance of the 50 genera assimilating one roc was less than 0 08 in addition we also investigated roc degrading bacteria based on otus fig 3 a shows the number of otus observed in different samples the numbers of otus that appeared only in one sample ranked higher the number of specific otus in the ibu sample was as high as 175 and the number of specific otus in the bpa sample was only 15 however it was still higher than the number of the otus shared by two or more specific samples in addition it was also found that the otus involved in the degradation of multiple rocs are limited and the number of otus decreased as the number of rocs increased for example the number of most otus that were involved in two rocs was greater than three however when the number of rocs increased to three or four the corresponding otu number was lower than three only one otu was found to be present in the samples of four or more different rocs moreover fig s5 shows that the proportion of specific otu numbers in all samples was greater than 60 these results suggest that most assimilating bacteria were specific to the rocs furthermore we investigated the shared and specific degrading bacteria of different rocs based on the otu analysis results in total we obtained 1059 otus that were specific to only one roc while only 141 otus were shared by 2 rocs as shown in fig 3b some otus were shared by different rocs but no otu was associated with all 10 rocs moreover the numbers of shared otus corresponding to different rocs were also significantly different among them the bp sample contained the largest number of shared otus 61 followed by the tcc 54 and smx 50 samples while for the tcs sample the number was only two according to the taxonomic annotation results fig 3b 76 2 of the shared otus among the different rocs were affiliated with proteobacteria followed by chloroflexi 6 7 actinobacteria 5 4 firmicutes 0 6 etc for the otus specific to only one roc the taxonomic annotation results are shown in fig s6 among them the most dominant otus were also affiliated with proteobacteria with a relative abundance of 66 40 followed by chloroflexi and bacteroidetes with relative abundances of 8 20 and 6 25 respectively figs 3c and s7 show the relative abundance of specific and shared otus in the different samples for eight of the 10 rocs including bpa ibu tcs ep np smx sdz and amx the specific otus were dominant and the largest relative abundance value of specific otus appeared in the bpa sample 80 however the relative abundances of shared otus of these rocs were relatively lower 10 in contrast the relative abundances of shared otus in the tcc and bp samples were approximately 70 and 50 which were much higher than those of the specific otus these results suggest that most of the assimilating bacteria involved in the degradation process were specific to rocs and the proportion of shared assimilating bacteria was relatively low in addition to the shared and specific otus we also analyzed the dominant bacteria involved in the assimilation of different rocs the relative abundances of these otus were shown in fig 4 a and their taxonomic assignment results at the genus level are summarized in fig 4b ibu bp and sdz samples had only one dominant genus i e pseudomonas thauera and azohydromonas respectively their relative abundances in the ibu bp and tcc heavy samples were 88 2 6 8 and 5 6 respectively for the bpa tcs tcc and np samples two dominant assimilating bacterial genera were observed these dominant assimilating bacteria included sphingomonas pseudomonas methyloversatilis phenylobacterium parvibaculum prosthecobacter and hydrogenophaga their relative abundances ranged from 2 8 to 58 3 although the number of dominant assimilating bacteria of rocs was limited shared assimilating bacteria were widely observed among different rocs for example hydrogenophaga could assimilate ep and amx while pseudomonas could assimilate bpa ibu and tcs 3 4 isolation of roc degrading bacteria to verify the functions of roc degrading bacteria identified by dna sip we performed isolation and obtained several pure cultured bacterial species as shown in table s6 although only a few bacteria were successfully isolated in this study the isolated roc degrading bacteria were generally consistent with the dna sip results according to table s6 sphingomonas and pseudomonas were isolated with bpa as the carbon source while pseudomonas identified by dna sip was not isolated in this study but has been reported to be successfully isolated in previous studies mita et al 2015 vijayalakshmi et al 2018 for ibu pseudomonas bacillus sphingomonas and methylobacterium were isolated in this study and in previous studies marchlewicz et al 2016 murdoch and hay 2013 sordelli et al 1985 however only pseudomonas was identified by dna sip as shown in table s6 pseudomonas and sphingomonas were identified as tcs degrading bacteria by dna sip and this is consistent with the degradation functions of these two genera reported in previous studies mulla et al 2016 thelusmond et al 2019 3 5 distribution of different roc degrading bacteria in wwtps based on the analysis results of the roc assimilating and degrading bacteria we also investigated their distribution and relative abundance in different wwtps from around the world by using the data published by wu et al 2019 according to the pcoa fig s8 the samples from africa are very special and almost all are clustered together however samples from other continents are widely scattered and there is no obvious clustering among them this pattern was confirmed by the correlation analysis results in fig 5 a the average correlation coefficient among wwtps in africa is 0 85 which is higher than that in other continents the average correlation coefficient among wwtps in asia is 0 76 and the values among asia and other continents are all lower than 0 75 in addition the relative abundances of assimilating and degrading bacteria of different rocs are different according to fig 5b the relative abundance of amx degrading bacteria in the wwtps is distinctly higher than that of other rocs bacteria related to bpa ibu tcs bp and ep are also highly present in some wwtps consistently the concentrations of these substances in the influent of wwtps are generally higher than those of other rocs table s8 among the bacteria related to bpa ibu and tcs pseudomonas is the most abundant genus and its relative abundance in some wwtps reaches up to 60 thaurea which is related to the assimilation and degradation of bp was found to be present as high as 40 in some wwtps fig s9 since the roc concentration in wastewater is usually relatively low roc assimilation is probably due to the functions of these bacteria and they may also live on a variety of other organic matter 4 discussion in this study we investigated the bacterial community involved in the degradation process of 10 refractory organics which are the frequently detected personal care products tcs tcc bp and ep pharmaceutical ibu smx sdz and amx and chemicals bpa and np in wwtps the concentrations of these organics in the wastewater are relatively high and the traditional treatment processes in wwtps usually have a poor removal efficiency on them petrie et al 2015 compared with sequencing only technology dna sip can effectively identify the bacteria responsible for the assimilation and degradation of organic matter our results showed that the communities of different roc degrading bacteria were largely different indicating that these bacteria in activated sludge were specific to the rocs this could be attributed to the biodegradability of the rocs some rocs are relatively easier to biodegrade therefore more bacteria can participate in their degradation process seo et al 2009 however the degradation process of some other rocs may require the cooperation of several different bacterial species seo et al 2009 leading to a higher diversity of degrading bacterial communities although the diversity of the degrading bacteria of the rocs was different proteobacteria had an absolute predominance 80 in most of the enriched sludge samples obtained in this study it is well known that proteobacteria is dominant in municipal wastewater treatment activated sludge ye et al 2012 their contribution to the roc degradation process may be attributed to their high diversity in activated sludge although the bacterial communities responsible for different roc assimilation and degradation were different we still observed some bacterial species involved in the degradation of multiple rocs fig 3a and b the chemical structures of rocs may be one of the main factors affecting the community of degrading bacteria for example tcs and tcc share degrading bacteria because they have similar chemical structures and belong to the same class of antibacterial drugs lenz et al 2017 the two substances bp and ep share degrading bacteria comamonadaceae hydrogenophaga methyloversatilis etc with a variety of rocs such as bpa ibu tcc np smx sdz and amx this may be because these substances have simple chemical structures and relatively low toxicity blair et al 2000 and can be degraded by a variety of microorganisms which was confirmed by the bacterial community analysis results although smx sdz and amx are all antibiotics their chemical structures are very different li and zhang 2013 pereira et al 2014 therefore as expected there were few shared degrading bacteria among them although shared degrading bacteria among different rocs were present their quantity was very limited i e the community composition was relatively simple moreover their relative abundance in the total community was also relatively low therefore the shared degrading bacteria among different substances may not play a significant role in the roc degradation process most roc degrading bacteria were specific to the corresponding rocs and the relative abundance of specific degrading bacteria was higher these results indicate that the biodegradation process of rocs relies on the synergistic effect of multiple specific bacteria and to enhance the removal efficiency these specific bacteria should be considered when bioaugmentation or other new technologies are developed and applied in wastewater treatment facilities treating wastewater containing rocs in addition the detailed functions and characteristics of these bacteria should be further investigated in future better understanding of the characteristics may provide more useful information for the operation of the wastewater treatment systems and improve the roc removal efficiency through dna sip data analysis we identified the assimilating bacteria of each roc and we also confirmed their identification through bacterial isolation generally the assimilating bacteria had a low diversity and were specific to corresponding rocs although most degrading bacteria have not been successfully isolated in this study and the previous studies the dna sip results were partially verified according to the bacterial isolation experiments of this study the bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas and pseudomonas were isolated and cultivated and their bpa degradation ability has been reported in multiple studies eio et al 2014 sakai et al 2007 for ibu only pseudomonas was identified as degrading bacteria by dna sip and other ibu degrading bacteria including bacillus sphingomonas and methylobacterium could also be isolated from activated sludge marchlewicz et al 2016 murdoch and hay 2013 this suggests that there are still some inconsistency between the results of these two methods it is well known that most bacteria in natural and engineering systems resist cultivation amann et al 1995 this is probably the major reason for the inconsistency in the dna sip and isolation results some rocs may not be degraded by only one specific bacterium during the isolation process the bacteria were spread on the surface of the solid medium and therefore co metabolisms are difficult to be achieved by different bacteria species this could be the reason leading to the unsuccessful isolation of roc degrading bacteria on the other hand the degrading bacteria identified by dna sip may have been the bacteria only involved in the first step of roc degradation assimilation friedrich 2006 in this study we tried to avoid involving nonsignificant bacteria by terminating the experiment within a given period of time roc removal efficiency reaching 90 sathyamoorthy et al 2018 we applied rocs with 13c in the benzene rings because for most aromatic compounds the benzene ring breaking process determines the difficulty of degradation fuchs et al 2011 however some bacteria living on the intermediate products of the 13c compounds may still be introduced therefore although the isolation results partially confirmed the dna sip results they also have obvious limitations due to the cultural resistance of bacteria more advanced omics and isolation approaches are required to further investigate the roc degrading mechanisms and the bacteria involved in the degradation process by exploring the distribution of roc assimilating and roc degrading bacteria in wwtps it was found that their differences among different wwtps were not significant the reason for this observation may be that rocs are low concentration pollutants in most wastewater especially municipal wastewater therefore the concentration of rocs has little effect on roc assimilating and roc degrading bacteria in different wwtps furthermore due to the low concentration of rocs and their low biodegradability oliveira et al 2015 only a small number of the microorganisms in the sludge are involved in the roc degradation process therefore the environmental factors and operation of wwtps may have very limited impacts on the bacterial composition by comparing the relative abundance of the degrading bacteria of the rocs we found that the degrading bacteria of some rocs including bpa ibu tcs bp and amx were relatively abundant in the wwtps probably because the concentrations of these substances in the wwtps were also relatively high petrie et al 2015 table s8 moreover it is also possible that these bacteria have other functions in addition to roc degradation for example pseudomonas has been widely reported to degrade complex organic matter furmanczyk et al 2018 park and oh 2020 safari et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 thaurea not only has the ability to degrade organic matter folwell et al 2016 ramos et al 2016 but also plays an important role in the denitrification process du et al 2017a ma et al 2017 skleničková et al 2020 and dechloromonas has both the ability to degrade organic matter shi et al 2020 xu et al 2018 it is also worth noting that a high relative abundance of roc degrading bacteria may not guarantee the high removal efficiency of rocs in wastewater treatment bioreactors their functional gene expression activities and synergistic relationships within the bacterial community co metabolisms may also affect the roc removal process therefore further studies are warranted to investigate the detailed functions of these roc degrading bacteria and develop new technologies to improve their performance in activated sludge systems 5 conclusions the bacterial communities responsible for the assimilation and degradation of different rocs are largely different in activated sludge the number of bacterial taxa that can assimilate different rocs is quite limited only six bacterial genera were found to be able to assimilate all 10 rocs investigated in this study the roc assimilating bacteria are difficult to be isolated using common isolation methods most of the roc assimilating bacteria remain uncultured most of the roc assimilating bacteria have relatively low abundance in municipal wastewater treatment bioreactors while the relative abundance of amx degrading bacteria in the wwtps is distinctly higher than that for other rocs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16248,real time in situ monitoring of adsorption processes in activated carbon ac filters may advance the effectiveness reliability and economical value of such systems in this study the applicability of spectral induced polarization sip as a real time monitoring tool was examined the adsorption of anionic and cationic organic dyes to commercial ac filter was examined using a set of breakthrough experiments combined with continuous sip monitoring the imaginary part of the complex electrical conductivity decreased in the range of 0 25 2 5 hz for both dyes during the adsorption of the cationic dye a new peak developed in the range of 7 40 hz suggesting the dominance of surface processes that are not explained by the classic stern layer polarization theory the recorded imaginary conductivity values were used as a proxy for adsorbed dye concentration in the calibration process of a reactive transport model the model confirmed that sip can successfully be used for real time monitoring of the dye progression through the filter the applicability of sip as an effective monitoring tool was also shown for cyclic operation adsorption desorption cycles keywords water purification activated

electrical double layer mo methyl orange sac sludge based activated carbon sip spectral induced polarization uv ultraviolet 1 introduction activated carbon ac has been widely used for the past decades as an efficient and economic adsorbent in water and wastewater treatment processes bansal and goyal 2005 ac is a commonly used term that refers to carbon based materials that contain a well developed internal pore structure ac usually contains multiple types of functional groups e g carboxyl carbonyl phenols lactones quinones enabling the adsorption of a wide range of pollutants through a variety of chemical interactions bansal and goyal 2005 although the efficiency of ac as an adsorbent for metals and inorganic molecules has been proven kadirvelu et al 2001 netzer and hughes 1984 its efficiency for organic compound adsorption is greater bhatnagar et al 2013 organic dyes have been used extensively as model organic compounds with the aim of improving the mechanistic understanding of organic compound adsorption onto ac and biochar li et al 2011 tran et al 2017 the presence of dyes and pigments in effluents has been a public health concern due to their their toxic carcinogenic and allergenic nature organic dyes are traditionally classified into different types based on their application acidic anionic basic cationic dispersive direct reactive solvent sulfur and vat dyes gupta et al 2009 the efficiency of ac as an adsorbent for charged organic dyes have been repeatedly proven for a wide range of ac types li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the relative abundance of positively and negatively charged functional groups on the ac surface affects the overall affinity of the media to cationc and anionic dyes for example li et al 2011 produced an environmentally friendly ac from paper mill sewage sludge sac and tested its potential to remove a cationic methylene blue and anionic reactive red 24 dyes in a series of continuous fixed bed experiments the zeta potential of the sac was measured at 44 mv and the results showed a 2 5 fold difference in maximum adsorption capacity in favor of the cationic methylene blue operation of full scale ac filters i e effluent flow rate regeneration timing is usually based on preliminary laboratory scale experiments and frequent assessments of the contaminant s concentration in the outflow solution anumol et al 2015 while the combination of the two can lead to successful operation of full scale systems the need for multiple preliminary experiments and extensive sample analysis makes this approach inferior to real time monitoring of the filter s state real time monitoring methods of ac filters based on fluorescence and uv absorption were proposed and demonstrated by anumol et al 2015 guillossou et al 2021 and others these methods are able to assemble the breakthrough curve of organic pollutants based on spectroscopic measurements of the outflow solution in real time however for optimal performance of full scale systems information regarding the dynamics of the pollutant progression through the filter is needed rather than outflow based analysis only the electrical properties of activated carbon have been studied since the beginning of the 20 t h century both direct and alternating current methods have been used to study the effect of factors such as ph activation method and surface chemistry among others on the conductivity of ac in many cases the motivation for the study of the electrical properties of ac stems from its use as an electrode in electrochemical storage devices fuel cells or as a capacitor generally the experimental setup for such studies includes a non conductive cell in which the ac is placed and two metal plates for the current injection the measurement of the electrical conductivity is performed at a single or several frequencies in the range of 10 3 10 8 hz and is employed using either a two probe or a four probe measurement method barroso bogeat 2021 some clear correlations between the ac s surface chemistry and its electrical conductivity have been shown for example it has been shown that increasing amounts of oxygen containing surface groups correlates with decreased electrical conductivity i e enhanced resistivity barton and koresh 1984 hashisho et al 2009 the use of electrical conductivity measurements for monitoring of adsorption processes in ac have also been studied hu et al 2017 used electrical resistance measurements of ac filter during organic gas adsorption to predict the breakthrough of the gas before it occurred they employed adsorption regeneration cycles of three organic gases isobutane acetone and toluene and used the electrical resistance measurements recorded over time to determine the capacity of the filter kante et al 2019 reported similar results for adsorption of toluene chloroform and methanol vapors onto wood based chemically activated carbon they presented a linear correlation between vapor concentration and the relative resistance for all three compounds both studies concluded that electrical resistance may serve as a monitoring tool for gas adsorption in ac filters and potentially eliminate the need for continuous use of expensive sensing equipment however the high frequency range used in those studies does not capture processes that occur in the length scale of typical granulated ac particle size such as electrical double layer edl polarization such processes that are detectable in the lower frequency range 0 01 10 3 hz are routinely monitored by geo electrical methods in the context of hydrology and soil science geo electrical methods are widely used in environmental studies as minimally invasive minimally destructive methods to measure and infer hydrological properties and system state based on their electrical properties binley et al 2015 the spectral induced polarization sip method involves the injection of an alternating current in a range of frequencies usually between 0 01 10 3 hz and measurement of the obtained potential using a set or multiple sets of potential electrodes working at that frequency range sip is mostly sensitive to ionic mobility with dominating mechanisms including electrolyte conductivity stern layer polarization and membrane polarization binley and slater 2020 this is in contrast to high frequency methods that are more sensitive to the conductivity of the solid phase through tunneling and constriction barroso bogeat 2021 and through dielectric interfaces i e maxwell wagner polarization alvarez 1973 sip is increasingly used for the exploration of the subsurface at all scales abdel aal et al 2006 atekwana et al 2005 slater and lesmes 2002 and its sensitivity to the physical geochemical and biogeochemical properties of the subsurface together with its ability to provide a spatio temporal perspective make it appealing for many environmental applications atekwana and slater 2009 sip signatures of natural systems are a composite signature of the porous media itself the chemical composition of the aqueous phase the non aqueous liquid phases if such exist e g air oil shefer et al 2013 exchange processes ben moshe et al 2021 schwartz et al 2012 degradation byproducts abdel aal and atekwana 2013 and the soil microbial community mellage et al 2018b as such sip was used for the monitoring and characterization of processes such as mineral precipitation izumoto et al 2020 nanoparticle transport mellage et al 2018a and remediation deng et al 2020 flores orozco et al 2015 the sip based analysis of such processes is based on changes in the real and imaginary parts of the recorded complex conductivity over time while real conductivity changes mainly reflect changes in pore water conductivity variations in imaginary conductivity spectra are attributed to respective changes in surface characteristics for example ben moshe et al 2021 investigated the sip signature of a saturated soil profiles during ca and zn flow through experiments in a previously nacl equilibrated profile as the inflow ca 2 or zn 2 solution was introduced these ions were adsorbed to the soil mainly as inner sphere species through a gradual na ca 2 na zn 2 exchange that reduced the overall ion mobility in the stern layer and caused a decrease in the imaginary conductivity similar results were obtained by vaudelet et al 2011 for na cu 2 exchange processes during flow through experiments in sand a few studies looked into the effect of carbon based porous media on the spectral signature of soils gao et al 2019 2017 carbon based porous materials such as biochar and ac are very conductive compared to the soil grains that are considered non conductive other than edl related surface processes gao et al 2019 gao et al 2017 performed sip measurements on soil mixed with four types of biochar at different mass fractions biochar amended soil they investigated the dependence of the sip signature on the biochar s particle size and the pore water electrical conductivity they showed that the peak polarization frequency decreased in response to the increase in grain size this observation is consistent with the stern layer polarization theory developed by schwarz 1962 that connects characteristic relaxation times calculated from peak polarization frequencies to grain or pore size they concluded that the sip response of pyrolytic biochars resembled that of a conductor or semiconductor whereas the sip response of hydrothermal carbonisation biochar more closely resembled that of clay overall the findings of this study suggest that sip is a promising method for the detection and characterization of biochar in soil a globally widening practice to improve soil fertility ding et al 2016 recently three additional studies looked into sip monitoring of reactive transport processes in ac ac amended columns kirmizakis et al 2020 presented preliminary results of sip monitoring of olive mill wastewater adsorption onto biochar amended soil 0 5 10 and 25 biochar mixed with sand w w under static no flow conditions sip monitoring over the duration of the experiment 10 days showed that changes in the polarization signal were consistent with phenol removal siddiq et al 2021 presented a somewhat similar setup for arsenic adsorption a constant flow of arsenic was injected into sand columns mixed with fe functionalized biochar they reported changes in both the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity over the course of the adsorption process and attributed them to surface alteration of the adsorbing media to the best of our knowledge hao et al 2021 was the first to present a flow through sip monitored experiment of contaminant adsorption in ac and biochar columns specifically they investigated lead removal they showed a correlation between the characteristic relaxation time and the pore size as measured by sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry additionally they linked the changes in polarization frequency over time to both precipitation and surface adsorption of lead onto the ac and biochar as noted above electrical properties of ac were studied mostly at the high frequency range where molecule polarity and electron mobility dominate the signal very few studies looked at the low frequency range i e below 10 3 hz where ionic and molecular mobility dominate the electrical signature following the sip based breakthrough analysis suggested by ben moshe et al 2021 for solutes in soil columns in this work the applicability of sip as a real time monitoring method for adsorption of organic molecules to ac filters was examined in a laboratory setting we aim to explore the evolution of the electrical signature during adsorption of aromatic charged molecules and analyze the effects of different adsorption mechanisms on the signal a combination of breakthrough experiments and reactive transport modeling was used in order to connect the imaginary conductivity changes during the adsorption process to the dynamics of the solute progression through the filter this type of combination between real time monitoring and sip based modeling provides an indication of the filter s state at each point in time to the best of our knowledge such approach have not yet been presented or demonstrated in addition adsorption desorption experiments were performed to asses the applicability of sip as a monitoring tool in a standard operation of loading regeneration cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials granulated activated carbon norit pk 3 5 sigma aldrich was washed with deionized water dw and used without further treatment mean particle size 4 14 mesh and surface area 875 m 2 g values were provided by the manufacturer and ph of zero charge ph pzc 9 was determined experimentally see section s1 of the supplement crystal violet cv c 25 h 30 n 3 cl methyl orange mo c 14 h 14 n 3 nao 3 s and nacl solution were prepared in dw 2 2 spectral induced polarization sip time domain ip involves the injection of an electrical current into the porous medium through two electrodes the electrical potential is measured between two other electrodes focusing on the potential build up or its cease after the initiation of the current in sip the method used here an alternating current in wide range of frequencies is injected and the phase and amplitude difference between the injected and induced potential is measured the complex conductivity signal can be expressed as 1 σ 1 ρ σ e x p i ϕ σ i σ where ρ ω m is the complex electrical resistivity i e the reciprocal of the conductivity σ i 2 1 is the imaginary unit ϕ r a d is the phase shift and σ s m and σ s m are the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity respectively since sip have been widely used in the field of hydrology and soil study the effect of different environmental conditions on the components of the complex conductivity have been studied over the years in the context of soil grains as the polarized porous medium negatively charged and mostly non conductive both the real and the imaginary parts of the complex conductivity have been connected to grain surface interactions and grain size and the real part is also related to the conductivity of the pore water electrolyte grunat et al 2013 2 σ σ e l σ s u r f i σ s u r f where σ e l s m is the electrolyte conductivity σ s u r f s m and σ s u r f s m represent the contribution of surface processes to the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity respectively since sip is often used for soil study the link between surface processes and the complex conductivity signal is described through the nernst plank equation considering the influence of the external electric field expressed by ohm s law the resulting expression connects the mobility of ions in the soil s edl to the complex surface conductivity leroy and revil 2009 3 σ s 2 r 0 σ s σ d 2 r 0 σ s 1 i ω τ 0 where r 0 m is the grain

diameter 32 cm long equipped with 4 brass electrodes at equal spacing of 4 cm located at the lower half of the column see fig 1 columns were packed with commercial ac sigma with porosity of 45 the top and the bottom electrodes were used to inject the electrical current and were fully penetrating the porous medium and the remaining two electrodes were used to measure the potential the column was connected through the electrodes to a portable sip device ontash and ermac inc nj using alligator clips inflow solution entered the column through its bottom using a peristaltic pump to create saturated flow a constant flow of 2 ml min and outflow fractions were collected throughout the experiments total duration of 70h the sip signal was recorded at frequencies of 0 01 10 000 hz the impedance and phase shift data were used to calculate the real and imaginary conductivity experiments started with the injection of a background solution 300 mg l of nacl the background solution injection proceeded until equilibrium between the inlet and the outlet ec was obtained subsequently to the ec stabilization the background solution was replaced by a the inflow solution 100 mg l of either mo or cv in 300 mg l of nacl the dc electrical conductivity of the background and inflow solutions were 600 μ s cm and 635 μ s cm respectively equal volume fractions were collected at the outflow and analysed for dye concentration using a uv vis spectrometer genesys 150 thermo scientific 2 3 2 loading adsorption regeneration cycles four loading regeneration cycles were performed in polycarbonate column 3 cm inner diameter 23 cm long equipped with 4 brass electrodes at equal spacing of 4 cm column content background solution sample collection and sip measurements were the same as reported for the breakthrough experiments during the loading parts of the experiment the inflow solution 100 mg l of cv in 300 mg l of nacl was injected for a duration of 24 h subsequently the filter was washed with the regeneration mixture for 10 h 40 ethanol in dw based on lu et al 2011 then the background nacl solution was injected for another 14 h before the beginning of the next loading cycle this step re equilibration of the ac in the column with the background nacl solution was used in order to restore a clear sip signal before starting a new adsorption period 2 4 solute transport modeling a reactive solute transport model was constructed based on hydrus 1d simunek et al 1998 hydrus 1d is a computer program for numerical solution of water flow and solute transport equations in porous media the appropriate mass balance equation is given by the advection dispersion equation ade 6 c t ρ b θ s t z d h c z z ν c where c mg l is the dissolved species concentration t min is time z cm is the vertical coordinate v cm min is the water velocity computed by hydrus using darcy s law d h α ν d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient cm 2 min α cm is the dispresivity d cm 2 min is the diffusion coefficient ρ b is the bulk density g cm 3 and s is adsorbed concentration mg g considering the moderate flow rate equilibrium adsorption is considered the adsorbed concentration can hence be expressed in terms of c using an adsorption isotherm for langmuir adsorption model s can be expressed as 7 s k l q c 1 k l c where k l l mg is the langmuir adsorption coefficient and q mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity here we considered saturated flow the boundary flux was set to match the experimental setup for each dye the imaginary conductivity values that were recorded between the two potential electrodes served as a proxy for the adsorbed concentrations the imaginary conductivity values at a chosen frequency 25 hz for the cv and 2 5 hz for the mo along time were used a basic model was first constructed based on the known hydraulic and geometric parameters of the filter the dispersivity α was initially estimated the diffusion coefficient d was neglected and the filter s porosity n was set based on preliminary testing see section s2 of the supplement the imaginary conductivity values were then used for calibration the fit r 2 value between the imaginary conductivity values and the calculated adsorbed concentrations was iteratively enhanced by modification of the adsorption coefficients k l and q the fit was then further improved by slight modifications to the α parameter the calibrated model was validated by a comparison of the predicted outflow dye concentration to the measured outflow concentration and b comparison of the calculated adsorption coefficients to the values obtained by a batch adsorption isotherm experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 sip signature of granulated activated carbon the complex conductivity of the granulated ac filter was measured in equilibrium with 300 mg l of nacl and under constant flux conditions both the real and imaginary components of the complex conductivity were 2 orders of magnitude larger compared to a loamy textured hamra soil equilibrated with the same nacl solution under similar flux fig 2 this range of conductivity values is consistent with the few studies that used sip with carbon based porous media hao et al 2021 observed conductivity values of 0 004 0 01 s cm and 4 10 4 9 10 4 s cm for the real and imaginary components respectively during a 1 4 g l p b c l 2 solution flow through experiment in a commercial ac filter with grain size of 1 2 mm gao et al 2017 investigated the sip response of sand biochar mixtures they reported conductivity values of 1 3 10 4 2 10 4 s cm and 4 10 6 1 7 10 5 s cm for the real and imaginary components respectively in a 2 sand biochar sample biochar was 2 of the total mass of the mixture equilibrated with 240 mg l of nacl the imaginary conductivity peak of the ac was observed at a lower frequency compared to the hamra soil 0 25 hz compared to 1 hz in the hamra which is indicative of a longer characteristic relaxation time and is consistent with the larger mean grain size 2 mm for the ac compared to 0 5 mm for the hamra 3 2 sip signature of activated carbon during dye adsorption the evolution of the imaginary conductivity specrta of the ac filters during dye adsorption displayed different characteristics for the cv fig 3 a and mo fig 3b breakthrough experiments the initial signal recorded at the beginning of both experiments ac in equilibrium with 300 mg l of nacl displayed a single peak at 0 25 hz as cv progressed through the ac filter the original peak flattened and a secondary peak developed at 25 hz spectra recorded at additional times are presented in section s3 of the supplement changes in polarization magnitude during adsorption i e either an increase or a decrease of the imaginary conductivity at its peak frequency was observed and reported by many for soil or glass beads systems it is well accepted that such changes stem from the change in ion mobility at the edl due to ion exchange ben moshe et al 2021 vaudelet et al 2011 however the emergence of a new peak at a different frequency range is highly unusual the attachment of cv to the surface of the ac grains occurs through a variety of chemical interactions bansal and goyal 2005 to fully understand the effect of specific forms of interactions on the obtained sip signature further investigation is required however based on the current understanding of the effect of surface interactions on sip signature in porous media a mechanistic explanation can be hypothesized the decrease in imaginary conductivity around the 0 25 hz peak as cv progressed through the filter likely indicates decreased polarization of the ac surface under the induced electrical field a similar pattern of imaginary conductivity decrease around the polarization peak was observed by schwartz and furman 2012 in a cv flow through experiment in a soil column they observed a four fold decrease in imaginary conductivity during the first 100 pvs of the cv injection into the column this decrease in imaginary conductivity is related to the lower mobility of the large cv molecule around the edl of the soil grain compared to the smaller and more mobile na ions previously occupying the edl since in soil cv adsorption is mostly the result of such electrostatic interactions it is possible that the same mechanism caused the imaginary conductivity decrease observed here i e attachment of the positively charged cv to negatively charged functional groups on the ac s surface the emerging peak at 25 hz indicates increased polarization at higher frequencies this observation is unique to the ac dye system is not observed in adsorption of cv to mineral soil see schwartz and furman 2012 and section s4 of the supplement it suggests that the attachment of the cv to the ac had an effect on the electrical traits of the ac s surface this increased polarization at 25 hz can potentially be attributed to the movement of dye molecules that are attached to the ac surface through non electrostatic interactions such as π π interactions between the aromatic rings of the cv and the ac the dominance of π π interactions in the adsorption of charged organic dyes to ac is still uncertain tran et al 2017 studied the adsorption mechanism of a cationic organic dye methylene green to commercial ac their study evaluated the dominance of π π interactions in the adsorption process through surface oxygenation of the ac the adsorption of methylene green decreased dramatically upon the addition of oxygen groups to the aromatic ring structure of ac and concluded that this decrease strongly indicates that π π interactions are the primary interaction in the adsorption mechanism of methylene green to ac they also stated that the dominance of the π π interactions in the ac methylene green system is enhanced by the presence of the electron withdrawing nitro group attached to one of the benzene rings of the methylene green gupta and khatri 2019 studied the adsorption of the cationic methylene blue and malachite green to ac and concluded that the π π interactions govern the adsorption of organic dyes to ac together with electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds sayğılı and güzel 2018 also investigated the adsorption of malachite green to ac they used ftir and xps analyses to evaluate surface interactions and emphasized the dominance of malachite green attachment to the ac surface through its amine group polarization of aromatic π systems and π π bonds under an applied alternating field occur due to movement of electrons and is thus observed at very high frequencies in the megahertz to terahertz range busl et al 2012 and is not likely to be the cause of the polarization at 10 hz however a possible polarization mechanism might involve the movement of cv molecules that are attached to the ac through one of their aromatic rings according to the direction of the applied field during mo progression through the filter imaginary conductivity values decreased in the lower frequency range 0 01 1 hz and increased between 1 and 100 hz compared to the cv breakthrough experiment the overall change in imaginary conductivity values during the mo experiment was minor after 30 h from the beginning of the experiment only around sixth of the increase observed for cv adsorption in the 25 hz peak was observed in the peak of the mo experiment spectra formation of a new peak was not observed for the mo rather a shift of the initial polarization peak frequency from 0 25 hz to 2 5 hz an opposite peak shift trend a shift to lower frequencies which corresponds to an increase in relaxation time is often seen in soil systems when an outer sphere weakly adsorbed ion is replaced by an inner sphere one stronger attachment in the soil s edl ben moshe et al 2021 however due to the fact that adsorption of charged molecules to ac occurs through multiple types of functional groups this mechanism can t be directly assumed here the fact that a new peak did not emerge during mo adsorption may imply that the non electrostatic interactions that are assumed to cause the development of the peak at 25 hz for the cv are less prominent for the mo this suggests that the main adsorption mechanism of mo to the ac is electrostatic interactions of the mo with positively charged surface groups which is consistent with previous research mahmoudi et al 2015 3 3 using sip to monitor and predict filter state changes to the imaginary part of the complex conductivity during solute transport through a filter are indicative of surface alteration due to surface processes such as adsorption hence our modeling approach involved the calibration of a reactive solute transport model based on the fit between the imaginary conductivity values and simulated adsorbed concentrations over time the values of the imaginary conductivity recorded throughout the cv and mo breakthrough experiments displayed a shape of a saturation curve fig 4 a the reactive solute transport model calibrated using these values r 2 is 0 982 and 0 967 for the cv and mo respectively is used here to predict the dyes outflow concentration and displays a good fit to the measured concentrations r 2 is 0 977 and 0 962 for the cv and mo respectively the positive charge of the cv and its high affinity towards the ac surface dictated its delayed progression through the filter i e high retardation factor the values of its maximum adsorption capacity q calculated by the model is 4 times higher compared to that of the mo see table 1 maximum adsorption capacity and k l values were also obtained from a batch adsorption isotherms see section s5 of the supplement and were within 5 of the model calibrated values the good agreement between the calibrated adsorption coefficients and their measured values obtained from the adsorption isotherms confirmed that the implementation of equilibrium adsorption in the solute transport model was appropriate 3 4 loading adsorption regeneration cycles four loading adsorption regeneration cycles were performed with cv in order to asses the ability of sip to continuously monitor dye adsorption processes the change in imaginary conductivity values during the four 24 hour adsorption periods at two frequency ranges 0 25 2 5 hz and 7 40 hz see dashed lines in figs 5 d and 5e was monitored over a total of 170 h figs 5a and 5b show the imaginary conductivity values at the lower 5a and higher 5b frequency ranges along time a clear difference in imaginary conductivity values is visible between the first cycle light blue rectangles and cycles two to four purple rectangles this difference is expressed in both the location and the magnitude of the primary and emerging polarization peaks see figs 5d and 5e the cause of this difference is likely to be related to the effect of the regeneration solution a dw ethanol mixture on the polarization of the ac but it was not investigated in this study note that although the term frequency ranges is used the imaginary conductivity values at a single frequency were used in each cycles the use of range here refers to the fact that this chosen frequency was different between the first and the rest of the cycles due to the change in the peak frequency after the first regeneration period as suggested by fig 5a as the cv adsorption process progressed the imaginary conductivity in the lower frequency range steadily decreased overall the imaginary conductivity values at this frequency range ranged from 0 002 s cm to 0 0015 s cm each adsorption cycle ended at a similar imaginary conductivity value but after each regeneration period the imaginary conductivity increased to a lower value compared to the former cycle in the higher frequency range fig 5b the imaginary conductivity values increased with the progression of the adsorption process and decreased after each regeneration period here each of the adsorption cycles ended around the same imaginary conductivity value and each of the regeneration periods excluding the first resulted in a similar initial imaginary conductivity value i e the imaginary conductivity values at this frequency range at the end of each adsorption cycle was similar to deduce to cause for this observation further investigation is required however it might be connected to either the effect of the adsorption regeneration cycles on the capacity of the different dominant adsorption mechanisms electrostatic versus non electrostatic or to the effect of the regeneration mixture on the ac surface itself both the former and the latter may cause a decrease in the overall capacity of the filter such decrease along adsorption regeneration cycles has been reported in many studies e g pak and jeon 2017 sayğılı and güzel 2018 and is confirmed by the outflow dye concentration measurements presented in fig 5c the normalized concentration values at the end of each adsorption period increases over the cycles from 0 04 to 0 22 despite of the adsorption period duration being the same for all cycles 4 summary and conclusions the applicability of sip as a real time monitoring method for adsorption processes in ac filters has been shown in a laboratory setup imaginary conductivity values were used for real time determination of filter s state at high temporal resolution in a continuous and cyclic loading regeneration settings the sensitivity of sip to surface processes have the potential to advance both the mechanistic understanding of organic compound adsorption to ac and the effectiveness and economical value of full scale ac filters the evolution of the imaginary conductivity for the cv compared to the mo was unexpected and we speculate that it may indicate a difference in the dominant adsorption mechanism which will be the subject of future work the ability to use a non invasive method such as sip for the monitoring of adsorption processes in ac filters is of great importance in the context of process engineering application of in situ real time monitoring of adsorption processes in industrial water purification systems can enhance their effectiveness and economical value specifically it can eliminate the need for pre determined regeneration campaigns at fixed times and hence maximize the ability to use the filter up to its capacity further it can eliminate the tedious frequent analysis of outflow solution these two changes have the potential to improve the operation of water treatment filters in general and specifically ac filters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16248,real time in situ monitoring of adsorption processes in activated carbon ac filters may advance the effectiveness reliability and economical value of such systems in this study the applicability of spectral induced polarization sip as a real time monitoring tool was examined the adsorption of anionic and cationic organic dyes to commercial ac filter was examined using a set of breakthrough experiments combined with continuous sip monitoring the imaginary part of the complex electrical conductivity decreased in the range of 0 25 2 5 hz for both dyes during the adsorption of the cationic dye a new peak developed in the range of 7 40 hz suggesting the dominance of surface processes that are not explained by the classic stern layer polarization theory the recorded imaginary conductivity values were used as a proxy for adsorbed dye concentration in the calibration process of a reactive transport model the model confirmed that sip can successfully be used for real time monitoring of the dye progression through the filter the applicability of sip as an effective monitoring tool was also shown for cyclic operation adsorption desorption cycles keywords water purification activated

electrical double layer mo methyl orange sac sludge based activated carbon sip spectral induced polarization uv ultraviolet 1 introduction activated carbon ac has been widely used for the past decades as an efficient and economic adsorbent in water and wastewater treatment processes bansal and goyal 2005 ac is a commonly used term that refers to carbon based materials that contain a well developed internal pore structure ac usually contains multiple types of functional groups e g carboxyl carbonyl phenols lactones quinones enabling the adsorption of a wide range of pollutants through a variety of chemical interactions bansal and goyal 2005 although the efficiency of ac as an adsorbent for metals and inorganic molecules has been proven kadirvelu et al 2001 netzer and hughes 1984 its efficiency for organic compound adsorption is greater bhatnagar et al 2013 organic dyes have been used extensively as model organic compounds with the aim of improving the mechanistic understanding of organic compound adsorption onto ac and biochar li et al 2011 tran et al 2017 the presence of dyes and pigments in effluents has been a public health concern due to their their toxic carcinogenic and allergenic nature organic dyes are traditionally classified into different types based on their application acidic anionic basic cationic dispersive direct reactive solvent sulfur and vat dyes gupta et al 2009 the efficiency of ac as an adsorbent for charged organic dyes have been repeatedly proven for a wide range of ac types li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the relative abundance of positively and negatively charged functional groups on the ac surface affects the overall affinity of the media to cationc and anionic dyes for example li et al 2011 produced an environmentally friendly ac from paper mill sewage sludge sac and tested its potential to remove a cationic methylene blue and anionic reactive red 24 dyes in a series of continuous fixed bed experiments the zeta potential of the sac was measured at 44 mv and the results showed a 2 5 fold difference in maximum adsorption capacity in favor of the cationic methylene blue operation of full scale ac filters i e effluent flow rate regeneration timing is usually based on preliminary laboratory scale experiments and frequent assessments of the contaminant s concentration in the outflow solution anumol et al 2015 while the combination of the two can lead to successful operation of full scale systems the need for multiple preliminary experiments and extensive sample analysis makes this approach inferior to real time monitoring of the filter s state real time monitoring methods of ac filters based on fluorescence and uv absorption were proposed and demonstrated by anumol et al 2015 guillossou et al 2021 and others these methods are able to assemble the breakthrough curve of organic pollutants based on spectroscopic measurements of the outflow solution in real time however for optimal performance of full scale systems information regarding the dynamics of the pollutant progression through the filter is needed rather than outflow based analysis only the electrical properties of activated carbon have been studied since the beginning of the 20 t h century both direct and alternating current methods have been used to study the effect of factors such as ph activation method and surface chemistry among others on the conductivity of ac in many cases the motivation for the study of the electrical properties of ac stems from its use as an electrode in electrochemical storage devices fuel cells or as a capacitor generally the experimental setup for such studies includes a non conductive cell in which the ac is placed and two metal plates for the current injection the measurement of the electrical conductivity is performed at a single or several frequencies in the range of 10 3 10 8 hz and is employed using either a two probe or a four probe measurement method barroso bogeat 2021 some clear correlations between the ac s surface chemistry and its electrical conductivity have been shown for example it has been shown that increasing amounts of oxygen containing surface groups correlates with decreased electrical conductivity i e enhanced resistivity barton and koresh 1984 hashisho et al 2009 the use of electrical conductivity measurements for monitoring of adsorption processes in ac have also been studied hu et al 2017 used electrical resistance measurements of ac filter during organic gas adsorption to predict the breakthrough of the gas before it occurred they employed adsorption regeneration cycles of three organic gases isobutane acetone and toluene and used the electrical resistance measurements recorded over time to determine the capacity of the filter kante et al 2019 reported similar results for adsorption of toluene chloroform and methanol vapors onto wood based chemically activated carbon they presented a linear correlation between vapor concentration and the relative resistance for all three compounds both studies concluded that electrical resistance may serve as a monitoring tool for gas adsorption in ac filters and potentially eliminate the need for continuous use of expensive sensing equipment however the high frequency range used in those studies does not capture processes that occur in the length scale of typical granulated ac particle size such as electrical double layer edl polarization such processes that are detectable in the lower frequency range 0 01 10 3 hz are routinely monitored by geo electrical methods in the context of hydrology and soil science geo electrical methods are widely used in environmental studies as minimally invasive minimally destructive methods to measure and infer hydrological properties and system state based on their electrical properties binley et al 2015 the spectral induced polarization sip method involves the injection of an alternating current in a range of frequencies usually between 0 01 10 3 hz and measurement of the obtained potential using a set or multiple sets of potential electrodes working at that frequency range sip is mostly sensitive to ionic mobility with dominating mechanisms including electrolyte conductivity stern layer polarization and membrane polarization binley and slater 2020 this is in contrast to high frequency methods that are more sensitive to the conductivity of the solid phase through tunneling and constriction barroso bogeat 2021 and through dielectric interfaces i e maxwell wagner polarization alvarez 1973 sip is increasingly used for the exploration of the subsurface at all scales abdel aal et al 2006 atekwana et al 2005 slater and lesmes 2002 and its sensitivity to the physical geochemical and biogeochemical properties of the subsurface together with its ability to provide a spatio temporal perspective make it appealing for many environmental applications atekwana and slater 2009 sip signatures of natural systems are a composite signature of the porous media itself the chemical composition of the aqueous phase the non aqueous liquid phases if such exist e g air oil shefer et al 2013 exchange processes ben moshe et al 2021 schwartz et al 2012 degradation byproducts abdel aal and atekwana 2013 and the soil microbial community mellage et al 2018b as such sip was used for the monitoring and characterization of processes such as mineral precipitation izumoto et al 2020 nanoparticle transport mellage et al 2018a and remediation deng et al 2020 flores orozco et al 2015 the sip based analysis of such processes is based on changes in the real and imaginary parts of the recorded complex conductivity over time while real conductivity changes mainly reflect changes in pore water conductivity variations in imaginary conductivity spectra are attributed to respective changes in surface characteristics for example ben moshe et al 2021 investigated the sip signature of a saturated soil profiles during ca and zn flow through experiments in a previously nacl equilibrated profile as the inflow ca 2 or zn 2 solution was introduced these ions were adsorbed to the soil mainly as inner sphere species through a gradual na ca 2 na zn 2 exchange that reduced the overall ion mobility in the stern layer and caused a decrease in the imaginary conductivity similar results were obtained by vaudelet et al 2011 for na cu 2 exchange processes during flow through experiments in sand a few studies looked into the effect of carbon based porous media on the spectral signature of soils gao et al 2019 2017 carbon based porous materials such as biochar and ac are very conductive compared to the soil grains that are considered non conductive other than edl related surface processes gao et al 2019 gao et al 2017 performed sip measurements on soil mixed with four types of biochar at different mass fractions biochar amended soil they investigated the dependence of the sip signature on the biochar s particle size and the pore water electrical conductivity they showed that the peak polarization frequency decreased in response to the increase in grain size this observation is consistent with the stern layer polarization theory developed by schwarz 1962 that connects characteristic relaxation times calculated from peak polarization frequencies to grain or pore size they concluded that the sip response of pyrolytic biochars resembled that of a conductor or semiconductor whereas the sip response of hydrothermal carbonisation biochar more closely resembled that of clay overall the findings of this study suggest that sip is a promising method for the detection and characterization of biochar in soil a globally widening practice to improve soil fertility ding et al 2016 recently three additional studies looked into sip monitoring of reactive transport processes in ac ac amended columns kirmizakis et al 2020 presented preliminary results of sip monitoring of olive mill wastewater adsorption onto biochar amended soil 0 5 10 and 25 biochar mixed with sand w w under static no flow conditions sip monitoring over the duration of the experiment 10 days showed that changes in the polarization signal were consistent with phenol removal siddiq et al 2021 presented a somewhat similar setup for arsenic adsorption a constant flow of arsenic was injected into sand columns mixed with fe functionalized biochar they reported changes in both the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity over the course of the adsorption process and attributed them to surface alteration of the adsorbing media to the best of our knowledge hao et al 2021 was the first to present a flow through sip monitored experiment of contaminant adsorption in ac and biochar columns specifically they investigated lead removal they showed a correlation between the characteristic relaxation time and the pore size as measured by sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry additionally they linked the changes in polarization frequency over time to both precipitation and surface adsorption of lead onto the ac and biochar as noted above electrical properties of ac were studied mostly at the high frequency range where molecule polarity and electron mobility dominate the signal very few studies looked at the low frequency range i e below 10 3 hz where ionic and molecular mobility dominate the electrical signature following the sip based breakthrough analysis suggested by ben moshe et al 2021 for solutes in soil columns in this work the applicability of sip as a real time monitoring method for adsorption of organic molecules to ac filters was examined in a laboratory setting we aim to explore the evolution of the electrical signature during adsorption of aromatic charged molecules and analyze the effects of different adsorption mechanisms on the signal a combination of breakthrough experiments and reactive transport modeling was used in order to connect the imaginary conductivity changes during the adsorption process to the dynamics of the solute progression through the filter this type of combination between real time monitoring and sip based modeling provides an indication of the filter s state at each point in time to the best of our knowledge such approach have not yet been presented or demonstrated in addition adsorption desorption experiments were performed to asses the applicability of sip as a monitoring tool in a standard operation of loading regeneration cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials granulated activated carbon norit pk 3 5 sigma aldrich was washed with deionized water dw and used without further treatment mean particle size 4 14 mesh and surface area 875 m 2 g values were provided by the manufacturer and ph of zero charge ph pzc 9 was determined experimentally see section s1 of the supplement crystal violet cv c 25 h 30 n 3 cl methyl orange mo c 14 h 14 n 3 nao 3 s and nacl solution were prepared in dw 2 2 spectral induced polarization sip time domain ip involves the injection of an electrical current into the porous medium through two electrodes the electrical potential is measured between two other electrodes focusing on the potential build up or its cease after the initiation of the current in sip the method used here an alternating current in wide range of frequencies is injected and the phase and amplitude difference between the injected and induced potential is measured the complex conductivity signal can be expressed as 1 σ 1 ρ σ e x p i ϕ σ i σ where ρ ω m is the complex electrical resistivity i e the reciprocal of the conductivity σ i 2 1 is the imaginary unit ϕ r a d is the phase shift and σ s m and σ s m are the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity respectively since sip have been widely used in the field of hydrology and soil study the effect of different environmental conditions on the components of the complex conductivity have been studied over the years in the context of soil grains as the polarized porous medium negatively charged and mostly non conductive both the real and the imaginary parts of the complex conductivity have been connected to grain surface interactions and grain size and the real part is also related to the conductivity of the pore water electrolyte grunat et al 2013 2 σ σ e l σ s u r f i σ s u r f where σ e l s m is the electrolyte conductivity σ s u r f s m and σ s u r f s m represent the contribution of surface processes to the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity respectively since sip is often used for soil study the link between surface processes and the complex conductivity signal is described through the nernst plank equation considering the influence of the external electric field expressed by ohm s law the resulting expression connects the mobility of ions in the soil s edl to the complex surface conductivity leroy and revil 2009 3 σ s 2 r 0 σ s σ d 2 r 0 σ s 1 i ω τ 0 where r 0 m is the grain

the relaxation time constant s and d m 2 s is the diffusion coefficient of the counter ion at the stern layer the value of both σ s and σ d depend upon the mobility of ions in the edl assuming that only one species is adsorbed to the porous media s surface i e mono ionic system and that the pore electrolyte is composed of n species the stern and diffuse layer conductance can be expressed as 4 σ

of the stern and diffuse layer respectively 2 3 laboratory setup 2 3 1 breakthrough experiments the laboratory setup for the breakthrough experiments included a polycarbonate column 3 cm inner diameter 32 cm long equipped with 4 brass electrodes at equal spacing of 4 cm located at the lower half of the column see fig 1 columns were packed with commercial ac sigma with porosity of 45 the top and the bottom electrodes were used to inject the electrical current and were fully penetrating the porous medium and the remaining two electrodes were used to measure the potential the column was connected through the electrodes to a portable sip device ontash and ermac inc nj using alligator clips inflow solution entered the column through its bottom using a peristaltic pump to create saturated flow a constant flow of 2 ml min and outflow fractions were collected throughout the experiments total duration of 70h the sip signal was recorded at frequencies of 0 01 10 000 hz the impedance and phase shift data were used to calculate the real and imaginary conductivity experiments started with the injection of a background solution 300 mg l of nacl the background solution injection proceeded until equilibrium between the inlet and the outlet ec was obtained subsequently to the ec stabilization the background solution was replaced by a the inflow solution 100 mg l of either mo or cv in 300 mg l of nacl the dc electrical conductivity of the background and inflow solutions were 600 μ s cm and 635 μ s cm respectively equal volume fractions were collected at the outflow and analysed for dye concentration using a uv vis spectrometer genesys 150 thermo scientific 2 3 2 loading adsorption regeneration cycles four loading regeneration cycles were performed in polycarbonate column 3 cm inner diameter 23 cm long equipped with 4 brass electrodes at equal spacing of 4 cm column content background solution sample collection and sip measurements were the same as reported for the breakthrough experiments during the loading parts of the experiment the inflow solution 100 mg l of cv in 300 mg l of nacl was injected for a duration of 24 h subsequently the filter was washed with the regeneration mixture for 10 h 40 ethanol in dw based on lu et al 2011 then the background nacl solution was injected for another 14 h before the beginning of the next loading cycle this step re equilibration of the ac in the column with the background nacl solution was used in order to restore a clear sip signal before starting a new adsorption period 2 4 solute transport modeling a reactive solute transport model was constructed based on hydrus 1d simunek et al 1998 hydrus 1d is a computer program for numerical solution of water flow and solute transport equations in porous media the appropriate mass balance equation is given by the advection dispersion equation ade 6 c t ρ b θ s t z d h c z z ν c where c mg l is the dissolved species concentration t min is time z cm is the vertical coordinate v cm min is the water velocity computed by hydrus using darcy s law d h α ν d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient cm 2 min α cm is the dispresivity d cm 2 min is the diffusion coefficient ρ b is the bulk density g cm 3 and s is adsorbed concentration mg g considering the moderate flow rate equilibrium adsorption is considered the adsorbed concentration can hence be expressed in terms of c using an adsorption isotherm for langmuir adsorption model s can be expressed as 7 s k l q c 1 k l c where k l l mg is the langmuir adsorption coefficient and q mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity here we considered saturated flow the boundary flux was set to match the experimental setup for each dye the imaginary conductivity values that were recorded between the two potential electrodes served as a proxy for the adsorbed concentrations the imaginary conductivity values at a chosen frequency 25 hz for the cv and 2 5 hz for the mo along time were used a basic model was first constructed based on the known hydraulic and geometric parameters of the filter the dispersivity α was initially estimated the diffusion coefficient d was neglected and the filter s porosity n was set based on preliminary testing see section s2 of the supplement the imaginary conductivity values were then used for calibration the fit r 2 value between the imaginary conductivity values and the calculated adsorbed concentrations was iteratively enhanced by modification of the adsorption coefficients k l and q the fit was then further improved by slight modifications to the α parameter the calibrated model was validated by a comparison of the predicted outflow dye concentration to the measured outflow concentration and b comparison of the calculated adsorption coefficients to the values obtained by a batch adsorption isotherm experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 sip signature of granulated activated carbon the complex conductivity of the granulated ac filter was measured in equilibrium with 300 mg l of nacl and under constant flux conditions both the real and imaginary components of the complex conductivity were 2 orders of magnitude larger compared to a loamy textured hamra soil equilibrated with the same nacl solution under similar flux fig 2 this range of conductivity values is consistent with the few studies that used sip with carbon based porous media hao et al 2021 observed conductivity values of 0 004 0 01 s cm and 4 10 4 9 10 4 s cm for the real and imaginary components respectively during a 1 4 g l p b c l 2 solution flow through experiment in a commercial ac filter with grain size of 1 2 mm gao et al 2017 investigated the sip response of sand biochar mixtures they reported conductivity values of 1 3 10 4 2 10 4 s cm and 4 10 6 1 7 10 5 s cm for the real and imaginary components respectively in a 2 sand biochar sample biochar was 2 of the total mass of the mixture equilibrated with 240 mg l of nacl the imaginary conductivity peak of the ac was observed at a lower frequency compared to the hamra soil 0 25 hz compared to 1 hz in the hamra which is indicative of a longer characteristic relaxation time and is consistent with the larger mean grain size 2 mm for the ac compared to 0 5 mm for the hamra 3 2 sip signature of activated carbon during dye adsorption the evolution of the imaginary conductivity specrta of the ac filters during dye adsorption displayed different characteristics for the cv fig 3 a and mo fig 3b breakthrough experiments the initial signal recorded at the beginning of both experiments ac in equilibrium with 300 mg l of nacl displayed a single peak at 0 25 hz as cv progressed through the ac filter the original peak flattened and a secondary peak developed at 25 hz spectra recorded at additional times are presented in section s3 of the supplement changes in polarization magnitude during adsorption i e either an increase or a decrease of the imaginary conductivity at its peak frequency was observed and reported by many for soil or glass beads systems it is well accepted that such changes stem from the change in ion mobility at the edl due to ion exchange ben moshe et al 2021 vaudelet et al 2011 however the emergence of a new peak at a different frequency range is highly unusual the attachment of cv to the surface of the ac grains occurs through a variety of chemical interactions bansal and goyal 2005 to fully understand the effect of specific forms of interactions on the obtained sip signature further investigation is required however based on the current understanding of the effect of surface interactions on sip signature in porous media a mechanistic explanation can be hypothesized the decrease in imaginary conductivity around the 0 25 hz peak as cv progressed through the filter likely indicates decreased polarization of the ac surface under the induced electrical field a similar pattern of imaginary conductivity decrease around the polarization peak was observed by schwartz and furman 2012 in a cv flow through experiment in a soil column they observed a four fold decrease in imaginary conductivity during the first 100 pvs of the cv injection into the column this decrease in imaginary conductivity is related to the lower mobility of the large cv molecule around the edl of the soil grain compared to the smaller and more mobile na ions previously occupying the edl since in soil cv adsorption is mostly the result of such electrostatic interactions it is possible that the same mechanism caused the imaginary conductivity decrease observed here i e attachment of the positively charged cv to negatively charged functional groups on the ac s surface the emerging peak at 25 hz indicates increased polarization at higher frequencies this observation is unique to the ac dye system is not observed in adsorption of cv to mineral soil see schwartz and furman 2012 and section s4 of the supplement it suggests that the attachment of the cv to the ac had an effect on the electrical traits of the ac s surface this increased polarization at 25 hz can potentially be attributed to the movement of dye molecules that are attached to the ac surface through non electrostatic interactions such as π π interactions between the aromatic rings of the cv and the ac the dominance of π π interactions in the adsorption of charged organic dyes to ac is still uncertain tran et al 2017 studied the adsorption mechanism of a cationic organic dye methylene green to commercial ac their study evaluated the dominance of π π interactions in the adsorption process through surface oxygenation of the ac the adsorption of methylene green decreased dramatically upon the addition of oxygen groups to the aromatic ring structure of ac and concluded that this decrease strongly indicates that π π interactions are the primary interaction in the adsorption mechanism of methylene green to ac they also stated that the dominance of the π π interactions in the ac methylene green system is enhanced by the presence of the electron withdrawing nitro group attached to one of the benzene rings of the methylene green gupta and khatri 2019 studied the adsorption of the cationic methylene blue and malachite green to ac and concluded that the π π interactions govern the adsorption of organic dyes to ac together with electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds sayğılı and güzel 2018 also investigated the adsorption of malachite green to ac they used ftir and xps analyses to evaluate surface interactions and emphasized the dominance of malachite green attachment to the ac surface through its amine group polarization of aromatic π systems and π π bonds under an applied alternating field occur due to movement of electrons and is thus observed at very high frequencies in the megahertz to terahertz range busl et al 2012 and is not likely to be the cause of the polarization at 10 hz however a possible polarization mechanism might involve the movement of cv molecules that are attached to the ac through one of their aromatic rings according to the direction of the applied field during mo progression through the filter imaginary conductivity values decreased in the lower frequency range 0 01 1 hz and increased between 1 and 100 hz compared to the cv breakthrough experiment the overall change in imaginary conductivity values during the mo experiment was minor after 30 h from the beginning of the experiment only around sixth of the increase observed for cv adsorption in the 25 hz peak was observed in the peak of the mo experiment spectra formation of a new peak was not observed for the mo rather a shift of the initial polarization peak frequency from 0 25 hz to 2 5 hz an opposite peak shift trend a shift to lower frequencies which corresponds to an increase in relaxation time is often seen in soil systems when an outer sphere weakly adsorbed ion is replaced by an inner sphere one stronger attachment in the soil s edl ben moshe et al 2021 however due to the fact that adsorption of charged molecules to ac occurs through multiple types of functional groups this mechanism can t be directly assumed here the fact that a new peak did not emerge during mo adsorption may imply that the non electrostatic interactions that are assumed to cause the development of the peak at 25 hz for the cv are less prominent for the mo this suggests that the main adsorption mechanism of mo to the ac is electrostatic interactions of the mo with positively charged surface groups which is consistent with previous research mahmoudi et al 2015 3 3 using sip to monitor and predict filter state changes to the imaginary part of the complex conductivity during solute transport through a filter are indicative of surface alteration due to surface processes such as adsorption hence our modeling approach involved the calibration of a reactive solute transport model based on the fit between the imaginary conductivity values and simulated adsorbed concentrations over time the values of the imaginary conductivity recorded throughout the cv and mo breakthrough experiments displayed a shape of a saturation curve fig 4 a the reactive solute transport model calibrated using these values r 2 is 0 982 and 0 967 for the cv and mo respectively is used here to predict the dyes outflow concentration and displays a good fit to the measured concentrations r 2 is 0 977 and 0 962 for the cv and mo respectively the positive charge of the cv and its high affinity towards the ac surface dictated its delayed progression through the filter i e high retardation factor the values of its maximum adsorption capacity q calculated by the model is 4 times higher compared to that of the mo see table 1 maximum adsorption capacity and k l values were also obtained from a batch adsorption isotherms see section s5 of the supplement and were within 5 of the model calibrated values the good agreement between the calibrated adsorption coefficients and their measured values obtained from the adsorption isotherms confirmed that the implementation of equilibrium adsorption in the solute transport model was appropriate 3 4 loading adsorption regeneration cycles four loading adsorption regeneration cycles were performed with cv in order to asses the ability of sip to continuously monitor dye adsorption processes the change in imaginary conductivity values during the four 24 hour adsorption periods at two frequency ranges 0 25 2 5 hz and 7 40 hz see dashed lines in figs 5 d and 5e was monitored over a total of 170 h figs 5a and 5b show the imaginary conductivity values at the lower 5a and higher 5b frequency ranges along time a clear difference in imaginary conductivity values is visible between the first cycle light blue rectangles and cycles two to four purple rectangles this difference is expressed in both the location and the magnitude of the primary and emerging polarization peaks see figs 5d and 5e the cause of this difference is likely to be related to the effect of the regeneration solution a dw ethanol mixture on the polarization of the ac but it was not investigated in this study note that although the term frequency ranges is used the imaginary conductivity values at a single frequency were used in each cycles the use of range here refers to the fact that this chosen frequency was different between the first and the rest of the cycles due to the change in the peak frequency after the first regeneration period as suggested by fig 5a as the cv adsorption process progressed the imaginary conductivity in the lower frequency range steadily decreased overall the imaginary conductivity values at this frequency range ranged from 0 002 s cm to 0 0015 s cm each adsorption cycle ended at a similar imaginary conductivity value but after each regeneration period the imaginary conductivity increased to a lower value compared to the former cycle in the higher frequency range fig 5b the imaginary conductivity values increased with the progression of the adsorption process and decreased after each regeneration period here each of the adsorption cycles ended around the same imaginary conductivity value and each of the regeneration periods excluding the first resulted in a similar initial imaginary conductivity value i e the imaginary conductivity values at this frequency range at the end of each adsorption cycle was similar to deduce to cause for this observation further investigation is required however it might be connected to either the effect of the adsorption regeneration cycles on the capacity of the different dominant adsorption mechanisms electrostatic versus non electrostatic or to the effect of the regeneration mixture on the ac surface itself both the former and the latter may cause a decrease in the overall capacity of the filter such decrease along adsorption regeneration cycles has been reported in many studies e g pak and jeon 2017 sayğılı and güzel 2018 and is confirmed by the outflow dye concentration measurements presented in fig 5c the normalized concentration values at the end of each adsorption period increases over the cycles from 0 04 to 0 22 despite of the adsorption period duration being the same for all cycles 4 summary and conclusions the applicability of sip as a real time monitoring method for adsorption processes in ac filters has been shown in a laboratory setup imaginary conductivity values were used for real time determination of filter s state at high temporal resolution in a continuous and cyclic loading regeneration settings the sensitivity of sip to surface processes have the potential to advance both the mechanistic understanding of organic compound adsorption to ac and the effectiveness and economical value of full scale ac filters the evolution of the imaginary conductivity for the cv compared to the mo was unexpected and we speculate that it may indicate a difference in the dominant adsorption mechanism which will be the subject of future work the ability to use a non invasive method such as sip for the monitoring of adsorption processes in ac filters is of great importance in the context of process engineering application of in situ real time monitoring of adsorption processes in industrial water purification systems can enhance their effectiveness and economical value specifically it can eliminate the need for pre determined regeneration campaigns at fixed times and hence maximize the ability to use the filter up to its capacity further it can eliminate the tedious frequent analysis of outflow solution these two changes have the potential to improve the operation of water treatment filters in general and specifically ac filters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16249,interfacial solar steam generation is an efficient way to produce freshwater from saline water this technology was further harnessed here for simultaneous saline soil remediation and enhanced agricultural sustainability an interfacial solar evaporation and planting system was designed that uses treated seawater for saline soil washing and agricultural irrigation in outdoor experiments the evaporator realized high freshwater production 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 with a soil washing efficiency 3 times greater than traditional distillation post treatment plant assays showed that initially highly saline soils could be restored to functional agricultural soils with germination rates of 65 after soil washing where solar evaporation could continuously provide irrigation water for plant growth this system is fully automated and uses only solar energy and seawater for saline soil remediation and irrigation the development of this system provides a potentially useful solution to alleviate global problems associated with water scarcity soil salinization and desertification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photothermal evaporation solar steam generation saline soil remediation seawater irrigation 1 introduction while water is an essential resource for all life on earth having an irreplaceable role in sustaining the environment and the function of society it is also a limited diminishing resource lack of freshwater resources leads to many environmental problems such as reduced plant and animal activity soil salinization and reduced crop yields richter et al 2020 converting seawater to freshwater is one possible way to solve the emerging water crisis elimelech and phillip 2011 current commercial desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis and vacuum distillation suffer from high energy consumption and maintenance costs which to date has limited their widespread application for daily clean water production in remote and rural areas subramani and jacangelo 2015 as one of the earth s most abundant free energy resources hernandez et al 2019 the broad availability of solar energy in sunny regions makes investment in large scale solar based desalination facilities feasible moustafa 2016 in fact solar driven evaporation is often regarded as one of the most reliable approaches for potable water production gao et al 2020 li et al 2020 qi et al 2019 wang et al 2021b yang et al 2020 while much work has been initiated in this area traditional solar energy distillation is still of low efficiency and often requires extremely complex heat collection systems where the associated high economic cost has limited wider application wang et al 2018 compared with traditional direct solar water evaporation interfacial solar evaporation has thus been proposed as a reliable alternative to conventional bulk heating evaporation and offers a new approach to dynamically tune evaporation performance gao et al 2019 ma et al 2021 wang et al 2021b 2021c zhou et al 2019 this emerging technology not only addresses the issue of low freshwater productivity by traditional disk type stills but also does not require expensive equipment wang et al 2021a 2019 interfacial solar evaporation driven seawater desalination is also particularly attractive due to the abundance of solar energy and its negligible environmental impacts ghasemi et al 2014 ni et al 2016 zeng et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 recent rapid development of this technology has been witnessed in many different areas including wastewater treatment seawater desalination sterilization moisture harvest solar panel cooling and soil remediation li et al 2018 song et al 2020 wang et al 2021a wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 as a potentially reliable and robust technology for clean water production investigations into broader applications are thus warranted saline soil is a serious constraint to agricultural production chen and mueller 2018 where excessive accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone detrimentally impacts native vegetation agricultural crops and human livelihoods hassani et al 2020 while soil washing is widely proposed and used for saline soil remediation shaygan et al 2017 this technique does require a large amount of freshwater which is often extremely scarce in saline soil areas phogat et al 2020 where the water resources most commonly present tend to be salt lakes or marine sources however with proper treatment these saline water resources have the potential to be applied for saline soil washing and agricultural irrigation ahmadinik et al 2020 aliste et al 2020 pistocchi et al 2020 this has a twofold benefit in simultaneously providing an amount water suitable for irrigation and alleviating the detrimental environmental impact of excessive exposure to saline waters thus the concept of seawater agriculture which includes seawater desalination to produce clean water for irrigation was recently developed moustafa 2017 zou et al 2021 and has gained increasing attention as a reliable approach for agricultural water supply in water scarce areas however traditional approaches to date have concentrated primarily on water desalinization which is often just a symptom of a saline soil environment rather than addressing soil salinization directly a more efficient approach capable of realizing long term agriculture sustainability would be to desalinate seawater and simultaneously remediate saline soil zou et al 2021 however one disadvantage of traditional solar distillation based seawater desalination approaches is that water production is relatively low in this work an interfacial solar steam generation technology was applied for the first time to enable seawater to be used for saline soil remediation and to enhance agricultural sustainability the system design fig 1 consists of three subsystems 1 a seawater tank 2 a photothermal evaporator and 3 saline soil under a transparent cover once solar light is transmitted through the transparent cover it is absorbed and converted into heat by the photothermal evaporator the generated heat drives seawater evaporation and vapor which condenses on the cover surfaces and drips down to the soil the main advantage of this design is that no additional power input is required other than free solar light the freshwater produced is directly transferred into the soil where it can be used for soil washing and or agricultural irrigation this approach requires minimal land area and avoids complex maintenance issues as the system is simple with few moving parts in outdoor experiments the evaporator design realized high freshwater production of 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 with a soil washing efficiency 3 times greater than traditional distillation this process is much quicker and far more efficient than traditional soil leaching as it generates the wash solution in situ from a saline water source this allows for poorer quality water resources to be harnessed and recycled to enhance soil washing where as an in situ technique it also involves minimal soil disturbance and does not introduce any potential secondary pollutants which could degrade soil quality the technique is also low cost and sustainable as the evaporator works under natural sunlight illumination with no other energy source required the main novelty of this new design is that it successfully demonstrates for the first time self sustainability of a desalination irrigation combined system and provides a paradigm shift in saline soil remediation towards agricultural sustainability the manuscript is divided into four main sections following a brief introduction section 1 the material and methods section 2 describes the experimental methods used to fabricate characterize and evaluate the evaporator and its constituent parts where the full design of the solar driven evaporator fabrication and its performance is fully detailed and discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 with details and discussion of the application of the evaporator for soil remediation following in sections 3 3 and 3 4 before concluding with an overall discussions

and cp initially a 1 mg ml 1 rgo 100 ml suspension was prepared by dispersing rgo 0 50 g into deionized water 0 5 l with sonication qsonic sonicator for 5 h thereafter sa powder 0 5 g was mixed with the rgo suspension with continual stirring at 600 rpm for 12 h to form a homogeneous solution to load rgo onto the cp the uniform suspension was then smoothly dropped onto the surface of the cut cp 25 cm width x 30 cm length thereafter the sample was frozen at 60 c for 48 h before being immersed into 5 cacl2 100 ml for another 6 h to promote crosslinking the final composite rgo sa cp was obtained after washing with deionized water and freeze drying at 60 c for another 48 h 2 3 materials characterizations a contact angle system data physics oca 20 was used to measure cp hydrophilicity internal

of different materials and evaporators initial cp and rgo sa cp were individually evaluated except for the long term experiments all water evaporation tests were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions of 25 and 34 relative humidity using an air conditioner and dehumidifier respectively the choice of temperature and humidity was based on easily reproducible laboratory conditions which were also comparable with the daily local weather conditions during indoor water evaporation tests the evaporators were placed under 1 0 sun illumination supplied by a newport oriel solar simulator solar simulator class aba 450 w 69920 the simulated solar light intensity was measured and calibrated by a thorlabs pm400 optical power meter an electronic balance was used to record evaporation water loss during the experiment infrared photographs of the evaporator surfaces were captured using an ir camera flire64501 2 5 long term remediation long term solar evaporation based saline soil remediation was applied in a closed system firstly a beaker 9 cm radius 13 cm high was filled with seawater and placed in the middle of the device and the photothermal evaporator was placed on the surface of the seawater a device without a photothermal evaporator was used as a blank then test soil 1 kg was distributed evenly throughout the soil container 23 cm long 15 cm wide 6 5 cm high small holes 1 mm in radius were made at the two sides of the bottom of the container and closed with a filter cloth to ensures that while water could pass through this whole during the drenching process soil could not and was retained then a clear glass cover 13 cm in radius 25 cm high was placed upside down over the evaporator with the bottom of the cover in contact with the soil so that condensed water can enter directly into the soil to avoid excessive water loss during soil water evaporation the top of the container box was sealed with its original plastic cover during long term evaporation the beaker was replenished with water every three days to ensure a sufficient water supply and to maintain seawater salt concentration at a relative stability level soil samples were taken from the soil surface daily during the soil washing period leachate water was collected at both ends of the container 2 6 pot cultivation broccoli was used to evaluate relative soil phytotoxicity before and after solar evaporation based saline soil remediation broccoli 80 seeds was grown in pots containing either untreated or remediated dry soils 800 g for 25 d during pot cultivation since environmental conditions such as humidity temperature and local air pressure can all influence the soil water evaporation any potential acceleration of soil water evaporation was mitigated by covering the container with a thin plastic glad wrap film no additional nutrients or other amendments were added to the soils during broccoli growth the broccoli sprouts were harvested after planting and washed with deionized water after that the germination rate and length of sprouts was recorded 3 results and discussion 3 1 solar driven water evaporation the fabrication of a surface with a high light absorption capability is an important initial consideration to facilitate high solar evaporation efficiencies here a cp coated with sa and rgo was fabricated denoted rgo sa cp and utilized as both a light absorber and evaporation surface the rgo coating on the surface of the cp significantly increased the light absorption ability to 96 fig 2 a sem images of the untreated cp and rgo sa cp showed that while the cp initially had a relatively uniform porous structure figs 2b and s2a b after coating the pores became filled with sa and rgo figs 2c d and s2c d where the appearance of a wrinkled structure on the surface indicated that rgo was firmly adhered to cp fig 2d the obtained rgo sa cp was also highly hydrophilic due to the innate hydrophilicity of sa and cp where a single water droplet could be absorbed into the rgo sa cp surface almost immediately fig s3 moreover the rgo coating was stable on the surface of the cp with which an intimate contact was maintained so that even after 10 min of continuous ultrasound treatment no evidence of surface flacking or other deterioration was observed fig s4 the photothermal evaporator assembly process was also simple fig s5 firstly the obtained photothermal rgo sa cp was cut into different shapes fig s5a the top evaporation surfaces and the fins were assembled using plastic straws and foam as the supporting skeleton fig s5b a piece of polystyrene ps foam 1 5 cm in thickness 8 5 cm in diameter was used as the floating insulation layer the ps foam surface was also covered with rgo sa cp fig s5c to enhance light adsorbing area vertical fin like structures upper surface size is 1 5 cm width 2 0 cm length were added to the 2d surface of rgo sa cp fig s5d the bottom end of the evaporator passed through a hole in the ps foam to ensure sufficient water supply fig s5e the evaporation performance of the different materials was initially individually evaluated after illumination for 1 h the evaporation rates for bulk water cp rgo sa cp without fins and rgo sa cp with 6 fin like structures were 0 28 0 37 0 96 and 1 47 kg m 2 respectively fig 2e compared with the 2d rgo sa cp the enhanced evaporation of the 3d evaporator rgo sa cp with 6 fin like structures was attributed to an increased evaporation surface area fig s6 for the evaporator with 6 fin like structures the temperature of the top evaporation surface increased significantly within 5 min upon light irradiation fig 2f indicating rapid photothermal conversion at the same time the side surface temperature remained constant near 17 c which was lower than the environment temperature therefore the side surface could harvest extra energy from the surrounding air via convection and radiation during solar evaporation contributing to a higher evaporator evaporation efficiency wu et al 2021c this 3d design is also flexible as the different fin like structures can be reoriented in a horizontal direction to follow outdoor variability in sunlight angles to enhance light capture while the high evaporation performance of the open system would be suitable for wastewater treatment it would still need to be increased to meet the desirable production volumes for freshwater collection instead to collect freshwater a closed system was used fig s7 which showed that water collection ability increased with fin numbers fig 2g the effect of different solar intensities was also evaluated fig 2h which showed that the water condensation rate could be increased from 0 33 to 0 68 kg m 2 h 1 when solar intensity increased from 0 5 to 1 0 sun two different types of water deionized water and seawater were also evaluated during continuous evaporation over 8 h under 1 0 sun illumination the condensation rate was only 0 20 kg m 2 h 1 for the blank bulk water only which was significantly increased to 0 68 kg m 2 h 1 3 4 times higher than the blank using a 3d photothermal evaporator fig 2i the maintenance of a stable water condensation rate over 8 h illumination was considered an important criterion for practical seawater desalination as it facilitates long term water collection over repeated day and night cycles where strong light hours typically do not exceed 8 h duration 3 2 outdoor solar steam generation the evaporator design also realized excellent freshwater production performance over 10 h from 8 am to 6 pm when deployed outdoors at mawson lakes campus 34 9229 s 138 5912 e university of south australia adelaide australia on 8th march 2021 during the 10 h of solar evaporation solar flux solar incident angle humidity and environmental temperature were continually recorded figs 3 a b and s8 prior to testing water samples were equilibrated outdoors overnight where for all samples the initial water temperature 12 5 c was lower than the environment temperature about 20 0 c when the tests were initiated with illumination the temperature of the water increased steadily and surpassed the environment temperature at 11 30 am the maximum recorded water temperature reached 47 8 and 43 1 c at 4 pm for the 3d evaporator and blank only bulk water respectively confirming that in the presence of the photothermal evaporator more thermal energy was converted from sunlight to heat up the water for evaporation from 8 am to 6 pm the solar intensity varied and initially increased to a maximum of 1 08 sun at 1 pm before declining and becoming relatively stable upon sunlight irradiation increasing amounts of water vapor were generated thus on a sunny day 62 1 g of freshwater was liberated over 10 h equivalent to producing 10 95 l m 2 d 1 which is more than 3 times that of the blank fig 3c the purity of the liberated water was evaluated by analysis of alkaline ion concentrations in the condensed water which showed that the concentrations of the main ions in seawater na k ca2 and mg2 were all significantly reduced well below the world health organization who standard values for drinking water fig 3d during practical operation weather variations also affected the water production rate for example higher sunlight intensity generally enhanced water evaporation suggesting that this solar evaporator design is suitable for areas of high sun such as deserts 3 3 long term remediation performance the experimental setup used for evaluating long term saline soil remediation is shown in fig 4 a the remediation process can be divided into two functional stages during the first stage desalinated water wet the soil increasing the moisture content of the initially dry saline soil up to the soil s maximum water holding capacity during the second stage as the water content exceeded the soils water holding capacity soil washing commenced as evidenced by the appearance of leaching solution during the seawater desalination saline soil washing process seawater is initially placed in the seawater container located in the center of the condenser under sunlight illumination seawater is evaporated continuously to generate vapor which is condensed on the sidewall of the cover to generate freshwater which thereafter directly flows through the soil solar evaporation for freshwater production and saline soil washing mainly occurs during daylight hours while minimal dark evaporation occurs at night this intermittent water supply is advantageous for soil washing because as reported previously qadir et al 2000 it improves the efficiency of water use fig s9 by providing sufficient time for salts to diffuse and release from the soil so that they can be removed in subsequent washing cycles in the presence of a photothermal evaporator soil can be moistened stage 1 5 days and washed stage 2 16 days by condensed water in a shorter period fig s10 and the remediation efficiency was consequently significantly improved however for the blank stage 1 25 days and stage 2 39 days processes took much longer thus in terms of time photothermal evaporation based saline soil remediation significantly improved the efficiency 3 fold in fact by the time the soil had been completely washed by the photothermal evaporation system the blank system had not even completed stage 1 of soil water saturation the soil water content was analyzed throughout the soil remediation process fig 4b initially the soil was moisture free dry but with illumination and solar evaporation freshwater was obtained and the soil water content increased steadily becoming stable when leachate was produced throughout this process local environmental conditions such as solar flux environmental temperature and humidity were obtained from the local bureau of meteorology site fig s11 during stage 2 the amount of leachate produced varied with the outdoor weather conditions where higher solar flux accelerated soil washing as evidenced by increased leachate because the higher solar intensity enhanced solar evaporation and enhanced clean water output for saline soil washing fig s12 as soil washing commenced various soluble soil ions flowed down through the soil together with gravitational waters as leachate during this stage changes in soil conductivity as an overall indicator of ion content were detected fig 4c compared to the blank soil washed with the photothermal evaporator only required 16 days to achieve a high remediation efficiency and significantly decrease soil conductivity from 6 72 to 0 14 ms cm 1 the conductivity of the leaching solution also decreased during the washing process due to a continuous decrease in soil salt content fig s13 in contrast for the blank during the same period soil conductivity was reduced to only 0 93 ms cm 1 there was some initial concern that washing efficiency might vary across the soil area thus soil conductivity across a range of different sampling points was also analyzed which showed that after remediation soil conductivity for different sampling points was almost the same indicating the washing process was uniform with no evidence of incomplete washing at specific locations fig s14 scale up is an important consideration for practical application of solar evaporation driven remediation the advantage of using small scale evaporators is that any potential issues associated with uniformity of washing on scale up to a single larger evaporator can be avoided by using a matrix of small evaporators in parallel to cover a larger area as soil conductivity decreased so did soil ion concentrations figs 4d e and s15 where a rapid decline in soil cation content driven by soil washing occurred during the first 10 days of solar evaporation for example na which had the highest initial content 2 3 mg g 1 was reduced to only 0 10 mg g 1 after 10 days anion content was also significantly reduced during the washing process for example the contents of cl so4 2 no3 were all decreased to 2 0 mg g 1 with removal rates all 90 of practical importance was that even after long term evaporation 23 days no salt accumulation was observed on the evaporator surface fig s16 and the condensed water maintained high who drinking water standards fig s17 variation in outdoor environmental factors also affect soil washing efficiency for example during the day solar intensity affects water evaporation while during the night temperature affects vapor condensation in large scale outdoor experiments remediation efficiency is also influenced by water migration rate and water s soil residence time post remediation a broccoli plant assay conducted relative to both treated and untreated saline soil fig 4f showed that while the seeds planted in an untreated saline soil did not germinate at all due to excessive salt concentration beyond plant tolerance seeds planted in the solar evaporation remediated soil germinated well this confirmed that highly saline soils can be practically restored to productive agricultural soils with at least a 65 germination rate after applying a green and sustainable solar seawater evaporation based saline soil washing this experiment clearly demonstrates that soil washing is an effective way to reduce alkaline ion content thus alleviating salinity stress in salt sensitive plants in addition the freshwater production capacity during solar evaporation desalination was relatively high at 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 under natural sunlight illumination while the water demand for broccoli was only about 370 kg m 2 quarter 1 4 1 kg m 2 day 1 gupta et al 2021 therefore after saline soil washing the generated clean water was sufficient to continuously support further growth of broccoli realizing sustainable seawater agriculture overall this new design successfully demonstrated self sustainability of a desalination irrigation combined system and provided a paradigm shift in saline soil remediation for agricultural sustainability however for large scale practical crop production many diverse factors may affect plant survival rate including sunlight intensity air convection soil properties and precise water supply since too much or too little water can both be detrimental to plant growth future detailed studies will need to study the influence of such factors on large scale crop production 3 4 real saline soil remediation performance the above research was conducted with an artificial saline soil of extremely high salinity to simple demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this solar evaporation based saline soil remediation technology to further assess the technologies practical application potential real saline soil collected from port pirie south australia was also treated and evaluated under one sun illumination prior to initiating the long term remediation a batch experiment was initially implemented to evaluate soil washing performance this preliminary study showed that soil conductivity could be decreased from 2 2 to 1 1 ms cm 1 when soil washing water increased above 1 g g 1 fig s18 this greater water usage during soil washing improved germination rate which increased from 20 to 60 as water consumption increased from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 fig s19 thereafter the germination rate only slightly increased when soil washing water consumption increased 0 5 g g 1 during the 20 days of solar evaporation based saline soil remediation with 8 h of light illumination per day a constant amount of leaching solution was produced each day indicating the photothermal evaporator had excellent stability and was suitable for continual long term operation fig s20 soil conductivity decreased significantly after 10 days of washing from 2 26 to 1 38 ms cm 1 fig 5 a where after 18 days the alkaline ion removal rate reached 65 3 54 4 32 7 and 30 0 for na k mg2 and ca2 respectively figs 5b and s21 the content of anions also decreased during washing with the two main anions so4 2 and cl decreasing from 2 3 to 1 8 mg g 1 and from 1 1 to 0 2 mg g 1 respectively fig s22 plant assays using broccoli to evaluate remediation performance fig s23 showed germination performance was improved from 13 8 untreated saline soil to 46 3 after solar evaporation remediation fig 5c the average length of broccoli sprouts also increased from 59 4 untreated soil to 66 2 mm fig 5d indicating that use of interfacial solar driven seawater evaporation is a promising approach for real saline soil remediation and increasing agricultural sustainability since the developed prototype has proven that desalinated water can be used to recover saline soil and that thereafter sustainable plant irrigation is feasible there is great potential to manufacture large scale devices fig 5e for example the solar desert house moustafa 2017 is an emerging sustainable modern agricultural approach to meet rising water and food demands in desert areas this system has the advantage of utilizing existing land in deserts to sustainably produce food locally the solar desert house thus has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of food supplies from distant rural farms with consequential positive environmental impact since this design is a fully automated system that uses only solar and seawater for irrigation it eliminates the need for scarce human resources to operate the development of this interfacial solar evaporation based technology will also help improve the quality of life for many people living in remote and desert affected areas and provide a potentially useful solution to the problems of water scarcity and desertification while the efficiency of the protype prosed here was already relatively high the system can further be improved by redesigning some of the evaporator components to increase thermal conversion efficiency as well as the rate and the cost effectiveness of water production for example inclusion of an anti fog treatment for the transparent cover should ensure increased stability and intensity of incident light reaching the photothermal material and directly enhance water collection rate during evaporation the evaporator material could also be replaced with cheaper alternatives such as sponges towels and a variety of other biomass materials ideally depending on the locality it would be preferential to use local waste biomass as a support and in this regard waste rice husk biochar could be an attractive option storer et al 2020 likewise for photothermal materials carbon based materials such as biochar are efficient stable and capable of being manufactured on a large scale relatively cheaply indeed the economic viability of the final system is an important practical consideration and future studies should also include economic analysis to compare the cost of water production via solar evaporators to other existing systems finally as has been shown previously sleiti et al 2021 better insights into practically improvements in water production can be obtained by developing a firm theoretical framework for the entire system to better understand how heat from irradiation is harnessed to realize higher water production rates 4 conclusion the concept of a novel interfacial solar evaporation process capable of self producing freshwater from seawater to promote ecological saline soil restoration and consequent plant irrigation was proposed here for the first time this study successfully demonstrated that the basic concept of using interfacial solar evaporation to enhance seawater desalination for clean water production which could then be directly used to improve the saline soil washing efficiency was feasible the prototype system realized a high freshwater production rate of 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 in outdoor experiments and delivered a soil washing efficiency 3 times better than a traditional distillation process the 3d evaporator also exhibited excellent stability in continuous outdoor solar evaporation over 21 days where the desalinated water continually met defined who standards for safe drinking water the freshwater so generated was then successfully utilized in real time for saline soil remediation and on demand crop growth post plant assays indicated that by using this technology highly saline soils could be restored to high quality soils suitable for agricultural activity with a 65 germination rate this work highlights the significance of the application of interfacial solar evaporation technology to efficiently use seawater for saline soil remediation and

16249,interfacial solar steam generation is an efficient way to produce freshwater from saline water this technology was further harnessed here for simultaneous saline soil remediation and enhanced agricultural sustainability an interfacial solar evaporation and planting system was designed that uses treated seawater for saline soil washing and agricultural irrigation in outdoor experiments the evaporator realized high freshwater production 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 with a soil washing efficiency 3 times greater than traditional distillation post treatment plant assays showed that initially highly saline soils could be restored to functional agricultural soils with germination rates of 65 after soil washing where solar evaporation could continuously provide irrigation water for plant growth this system is fully automated and uses only solar energy and seawater for saline soil remediation and irrigation the development of this system provides a potentially useful solution to alleviate global problems associated with water scarcity soil salinization and desertification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photothermal evaporation solar steam generation saline soil remediation seawater irrigation 1 introduction while water is an essential resource for all life on earth having an irreplaceable role in sustaining the environment and the function of society it is also a limited diminishing resource lack of freshwater resources leads to many environmental problems such as reduced plant and animal activity soil salinization and reduced crop yields richter et al 2020 converting seawater to freshwater is one possible way to solve the emerging water crisis elimelech and phillip 2011 current commercial desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis and vacuum distillation suffer from high energy consumption and maintenance costs which to date has limited their widespread application for daily clean water production in remote and rural areas subramani and jacangelo 2015 as one of the earth s most abundant free energy resources hernandez et al 2019 the broad availability of solar energy in sunny regions makes investment in large scale solar based desalination facilities feasible moustafa 2016 in fact solar driven evaporation is often regarded as one of the most reliable approaches for potable water production gao et al 2020 li et al 2020 qi et al 2019 wang et al 2021b yang et al 2020 while much work has been initiated in this area traditional solar energy distillation is still of low efficiency and often requires extremely complex heat collection systems where the associated high economic cost has limited wider application wang et al 2018 compared with traditional direct solar water evaporation interfacial solar evaporation has thus been proposed as a reliable alternative to conventional bulk heating evaporation and offers a new approach to dynamically tune evaporation performance gao et al 2019 ma et al 2021 wang et al 2021b 2021c zhou et al 2019 this emerging technology not only addresses the issue of low freshwater productivity by traditional disk type stills but also does not require expensive equipment wang et al 2021a 2019 interfacial solar evaporation driven seawater desalination is also particularly attractive due to the abundance of solar energy and its negligible environmental impacts ghasemi et al 2014 ni et al 2016 zeng et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 recent rapid development of this technology has been witnessed in many different areas including wastewater treatment seawater desalination sterilization moisture harvest solar panel cooling and soil remediation li et al 2018 song et al 2020 wang et al 2021a wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 as a potentially reliable and robust technology for clean water production investigations into broader applications are thus warranted saline soil is a serious constraint to agricultural production chen and mueller 2018 where excessive accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone detrimentally impacts native vegetation agricultural crops and human livelihoods hassani et al 2020 while soil washing is widely proposed and used for saline soil remediation shaygan et al 2017 this technique does require a large amount of freshwater which is often extremely scarce in saline soil areas phogat et al 2020 where the water resources most commonly present tend to be salt lakes or marine sources however with proper treatment these saline water resources have the potential to be applied for saline soil washing and agricultural irrigation ahmadinik et al 2020 aliste et al 2020 pistocchi et al 2020 this has a twofold benefit in simultaneously providing an amount water suitable for irrigation and alleviating the detrimental environmental impact of excessive exposure to saline waters thus the concept of seawater agriculture which includes seawater desalination to produce clean water for irrigation was recently developed moustafa 2017 zou et al 2021 and has gained increasing attention as a reliable approach for agricultural water supply in water scarce areas however traditional approaches to date have concentrated primarily on water desalinization which is often just a symptom of a saline soil environment rather than addressing soil salinization directly a more efficient approach capable of realizing long term agriculture sustainability would be to desalinate seawater and simultaneously remediate saline soil zou et al 2021 however one disadvantage of traditional solar distillation based seawater desalination approaches is that water production is relatively low in this work an interfacial solar steam generation technology was applied for the first time to enable seawater to be used for saline soil remediation and to enhance agricultural sustainability the system design fig 1 consists of three subsystems 1 a seawater tank 2 a photothermal evaporator and 3 saline soil under a transparent cover once solar light is transmitted through the transparent cover it is absorbed and converted into heat by the photothermal evaporator the generated heat drives seawater evaporation and vapor which condenses on the cover surfaces and drips down to the soil the main advantage of this design is that no additional power input is required other than free solar light the freshwater produced is directly transferred into the soil where it can be used for soil washing and or agricultural irrigation this approach requires minimal land area and avoids complex maintenance issues as the system is simple with few moving parts in outdoor experiments the evaporator design realized high freshwater production of 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 with a soil washing efficiency 3 times greater than traditional distillation this process is much quicker and far more efficient than traditional soil leaching as it generates the wash solution in situ from a saline water source this allows for poorer quality water resources to be harnessed and recycled to enhance soil washing where as an in situ technique it also involves minimal soil disturbance and does not introduce any potential secondary pollutants which could degrade soil quality the technique is also low cost and sustainable as the evaporator works under natural sunlight illumination with no other energy source required the main novelty of this new design is that it successfully demonstrates for the first time self sustainability of a desalination irrigation combined system and provides a paradigm shift in saline soil remediation towards agricultural sustainability the manuscript is divided into four main sections following a brief introduction section 1 the material and methods section 2 describes the experimental methods used to fabricate characterize and evaluate the evaporator and its constituent parts where the full design of the solar driven evaporator fabrication and its performance is fully detailed and discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 with details and discussion of the application of the evaporator for soil remediation following in sections 3 3 and 3 4 before concluding with an overall discussions

in supplementary table s1 detailed methods on all analytical procedures are presented as a supplementary note 2 2 materials fabrication the composite rgo sa cp was fabricated using as supplied rgo sa and cp initially a 1 mg ml 1 rgo 100 ml suspension was prepared by dispersing rgo 0 50 g into deionized water 0 5 l with sonication qsonic sonicator for 5 h thereafter sa powder 0 5 g was mixed with the rgo suspension with continual stirring at 600 rpm for 12 h to form a homogeneous solution to load rgo onto the cp the uniform suspension was then smoothly dropped onto the surface of the cut cp 25 cm width x 30 cm length thereafter the sample was frozen at 60 c for 48 h before being immersed into 5 cacl2 100 ml for another 6 h to promote crosslinking the final composite rgo sa cp was obtained after washing with deionized water and freeze drying at 60 c for another 48 h 2 3 materials characterizations a contact angle system data physics oca 20 was used to measure cp hydrophilicity internal

of different materials and evaporators initial cp and rgo sa cp were individually evaluated except for the long term experiments all water evaporation tests were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions of 25 and 34 relative humidity using an air conditioner and dehumidifier respectively the choice of temperature and humidity was based on easily reproducible laboratory conditions which were also comparable with the daily local weather conditions during indoor water evaporation tests the evaporators were placed under 1 0 sun illumination supplied by a newport oriel solar simulator solar simulator class aba 450 w 69920 the simulated solar light intensity was measured and calibrated by a thorlabs pm400 optical power meter an electronic balance was used to record evaporation water loss during the experiment infrared photographs of the evaporator surfaces were captured using an ir camera flire64501 2 5 long term remediation long term solar evaporation based saline soil remediation was applied in a closed system firstly a beaker 9 cm radius 13 cm high was filled with seawater and placed in the middle of the device and the photothermal evaporator was placed on the surface of the seawater a device without a photothermal evaporator was used as a blank then test soil 1 kg was distributed evenly throughout the soil container 23 cm long 15 cm wide 6 5 cm high small holes 1 mm in radius were made at the two sides of the bottom of the container and closed with a filter cloth to ensures that while water could pass through this whole during the drenching process soil could not and was retained then a clear glass cover 13 cm in radius 25 cm high was placed upside down over the evaporator with the bottom of the cover in contact with the soil so that condensed water can enter directly into the soil to avoid excessive water loss during soil water evaporation the top of the container box was sealed with its original plastic cover during long term evaporation the beaker was replenished with water every three days to ensure a sufficient water supply and to maintain seawater salt concentration at a relative stability level soil samples were taken from the soil surface daily during the soil washing period leachate water was collected at both ends of the container 2 6 pot cultivation broccoli was used to evaluate relative soil phytotoxicity before and after solar evaporation based saline soil remediation broccoli 80 seeds was grown in pots containing either untreated or remediated dry soils 800 g for 25 d during pot cultivation since environmental conditions such as humidity temperature and local air pressure can all influence the soil water evaporation any potential acceleration of soil water evaporation was mitigated by covering the container with a thin plastic glad wrap film no additional nutrients or other amendments were added to the soils during broccoli growth the broccoli sprouts were harvested after planting and washed with deionized water after that the germination rate and length of sprouts was recorded 3 results and discussion 3 1 solar driven water evaporation the fabrication of a surface with a high light absorption capability is an important initial consideration to facilitate high solar evaporation efficiencies here a cp coated with sa and rgo was fabricated denoted rgo sa cp and utilized as both a light absorber and evaporation surface the rgo coating on the surface of the cp significantly increased the light absorption ability to 96 fig 2 a sem images of the untreated cp and rgo sa cp showed that while the cp initially had a relatively uniform porous structure figs 2b and s2a b after coating the pores became filled with sa and rgo figs 2c d and s2c d where the appearance of a wrinkled structure on the surface indicated that rgo was firmly adhered to cp fig 2d the obtained rgo sa cp was also highly hydrophilic due to the innate hydrophilicity of sa and cp where a single water droplet could be absorbed into the rgo sa cp surface almost immediately fig s3 moreover the rgo coating was stable on the surface of the cp with which an intimate contact was maintained so that even after 10 min of continuous ultrasound treatment no evidence of surface flacking or other deterioration was observed fig s4 the photothermal evaporator assembly process was also simple fig s5 firstly the obtained photothermal rgo sa cp was cut into different shapes fig s5a the top evaporation surfaces and the fins were assembled using plastic straws and foam as the supporting skeleton fig s5b a piece of polystyrene ps foam 1 5 cm in thickness 8 5 cm in diameter was used as the floating insulation layer the ps foam surface was also covered with rgo sa cp fig s5c to enhance light adsorbing area vertical fin like structures upper surface size is 1 5 cm width 2 0 cm length were added to the 2d surface of rgo sa cp fig s5d the bottom end of the evaporator passed through a hole in the ps foam to ensure sufficient water supply fig s5e the evaporation performance of the different materials was initially individually evaluated after illumination for 1 h the evaporation rates for bulk water cp rgo sa cp without fins and rgo sa cp with 6 fin like structures were 0 28 0 37 0 96 and 1 47 kg m 2 respectively fig 2e compared with the 2d rgo sa cp the enhanced evaporation of the 3d evaporator rgo sa cp with 6 fin like structures was attributed to an increased evaporation surface area fig s6 for the evaporator with 6 fin like structures the temperature of the top evaporation surface increased significantly within 5 min upon light irradiation fig 2f indicating rapid photothermal conversion at the same time the side surface temperature remained constant near 17 c which was lower than the environment temperature therefore the side surface could harvest extra energy from the surrounding air via convection and radiation during solar evaporation contributing to a higher evaporator evaporation efficiency wu et al 2021c this 3d design is also flexible as the different fin like structures can be reoriented in a horizontal direction to follow outdoor variability in sunlight angles to enhance light capture while the high evaporation performance of the open system would be suitable for wastewater treatment it would still need to be increased to meet the desirable production volumes for freshwater collection instead to collect freshwater a closed system was used fig s7 which showed that water collection ability increased with fin numbers fig 2g the effect of different solar intensities was also evaluated fig 2h which showed that the water condensation rate could be increased from 0 33 to 0 68 kg m 2 h 1 when solar intensity increased from 0 5 to 1 0 sun two different types of water deionized water and seawater were also evaluated during continuous evaporation over 8 h under 1 0 sun illumination the condensation rate was only 0 20 kg m 2 h 1 for the blank bulk water only which was significantly increased to 0 68 kg m 2 h 1 3 4 times higher than the blank using a 3d photothermal evaporator fig 2i the maintenance of a stable water condensation rate over 8 h illumination was considered an important criterion for practical seawater desalination as it facilitates long term water collection over repeated day and night cycles where strong light hours typically do not exceed 8 h duration 3 2 outdoor solar steam generation the evaporator design also realized excellent freshwater production performance over 10 h from 8 am to 6 pm when deployed outdoors at mawson lakes campus 34 9229 s 138 5912 e university of south australia adelaide australia on 8th march 2021 during the 10 h of solar evaporation solar flux solar incident angle humidity and environmental temperature were continually recorded figs 3 a b and s8 prior to testing water samples were equilibrated outdoors overnight where for all samples the initial water temperature 12 5 c was lower than the environment temperature about 20 0 c when the tests were initiated with illumination the temperature of the water increased steadily and surpassed the environment temperature at 11 30 am the maximum recorded water temperature reached 47 8 and 43 1 c at 4 pm for the 3d evaporator and blank only bulk water respectively confirming that in the presence of the photothermal evaporator more thermal energy was converted from sunlight to heat up the water for evaporation from 8 am to 6 pm the solar intensity varied and initially increased to a maximum of 1 08 sun at 1 pm before declining and becoming relatively stable upon sunlight irradiation increasing amounts of water vapor were generated thus on a sunny day 62 1 g of freshwater was liberated over 10 h equivalent to producing 10 95 l m 2 d 1 which is more than 3 times that of the blank fig 3c the purity of the liberated water was evaluated by analysis of alkaline ion concentrations in the condensed water which showed that the concentrations of the main ions in seawater na k ca2 and mg2 were all significantly reduced well below the world health organization who standard values for drinking water fig 3d during practical operation weather variations also affected the water production rate for example higher sunlight intensity generally enhanced water evaporation suggesting that this solar evaporator design is suitable for areas of high sun such as deserts 3 3 long term remediation performance the experimental setup used for evaluating long term saline soil remediation is shown in fig 4 a the remediation process can be divided into two functional stages during the first stage desalinated water wet the soil increasing the moisture content of the initially dry saline soil up to the soil s maximum water holding capacity during the second stage as the water content exceeded the soils water holding capacity soil washing commenced as evidenced by the appearance of leaching solution during the seawater desalination saline soil washing process seawater is initially placed in the seawater container located in the center of the condenser under sunlight illumination seawater is evaporated continuously to generate vapor which is condensed on the sidewall of the cover to generate freshwater which thereafter directly flows through the soil solar evaporation for freshwater production and saline soil washing mainly occurs during daylight hours while minimal dark evaporation occurs at night this intermittent water supply is advantageous for soil washing because as reported previously qadir et al 2000 it improves the efficiency of water use fig s9 by providing sufficient time for salts to diffuse and release from the soil so that they can be removed in subsequent washing cycles in the presence of a photothermal evaporator soil can be moistened stage 1 5 days and washed stage 2 16 days by condensed water in a shorter period fig s10 and the remediation efficiency was consequently significantly improved however for the blank stage 1 25 days and stage 2 39 days processes took much longer thus in terms of time photothermal evaporation based saline soil remediation significantly improved the efficiency 3 fold in fact by the time the soil had been completely washed by the photothermal evaporation system the blank system had not even completed stage 1 of soil water saturation the soil water content was analyzed throughout the soil remediation process fig 4b initially the soil was moisture free dry but with illumination and solar evaporation freshwater was obtained and the soil water content increased steadily becoming stable when leachate was produced throughout this process local environmental conditions such as solar flux environmental temperature and humidity were obtained from the local bureau of meteorology site fig s11 during stage 2 the amount of leachate produced varied with the outdoor weather conditions where higher solar flux accelerated soil washing as evidenced by increased leachate because the higher solar intensity enhanced solar evaporation and enhanced clean water output for saline soil washing fig s12 as soil washing commenced various soluble soil ions flowed down through the soil together with gravitational waters as leachate during this stage changes in soil conductivity as an overall indicator of ion content were detected fig 4c compared to the blank soil washed with the photothermal evaporator only required 16 days to achieve a high remediation efficiency and significantly decrease soil conductivity from 6 72 to 0 14 ms cm 1 the conductivity of the leaching solution also decreased during the washing process due to a continuous decrease in soil salt content fig s13 in contrast for the blank during the same period soil conductivity was reduced to only 0 93 ms cm 1 there was some initial concern that washing efficiency might vary across the soil area thus soil conductivity across a range of different sampling points was also analyzed which showed that after remediation soil conductivity for different sampling points was almost the same indicating the washing process was uniform with no evidence of incomplete washing at specific locations fig s14 scale up is an important consideration for practical application of solar evaporation driven remediation the advantage of using small scale evaporators is that any potential issues associated with uniformity of washing on scale up to a single larger evaporator can be avoided by using a matrix of small evaporators in parallel to cover a larger area as soil conductivity decreased so did soil ion concentrations figs 4d e and s15 where a rapid decline in soil cation content driven by soil washing occurred during the first 10 days of solar evaporation for example na which had the highest initial content 2 3 mg g 1 was reduced to only 0 10 mg g 1 after 10 days anion content was also significantly reduced during the washing process for example the contents of cl so4 2 no3 were all decreased to 2 0 mg g 1 with removal rates all 90 of practical importance was that even after long term evaporation 23 days no salt accumulation was observed on the evaporator surface fig s16 and the condensed water maintained high who drinking water standards fig s17 variation in outdoor environmental factors also affect soil washing efficiency for example during the day solar intensity affects water evaporation while during the night temperature affects vapor condensation in large scale outdoor experiments remediation efficiency is also influenced by water migration rate and water s soil residence time post remediation a broccoli plant assay conducted relative to both treated and untreated saline soil fig 4f showed that while the seeds planted in an untreated saline soil did not germinate at all due to excessive salt concentration beyond plant tolerance seeds planted in the solar evaporation remediated soil germinated well this confirmed that highly saline soils can be practically restored to productive agricultural soils with at least a 65 germination rate after applying a green and sustainable solar seawater evaporation based saline soil washing this experiment clearly demonstrates that soil washing is an effective way to reduce alkaline ion content thus alleviating salinity stress in salt sensitive plants in addition the freshwater production capacity during solar evaporation desalination was relatively high at 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 under natural sunlight illumination while the water demand for broccoli was only about 370 kg m 2 quarter 1 4 1 kg m 2 day 1 gupta et al 2021 therefore after saline soil washing the generated clean water was sufficient to continuously support further growth of broccoli realizing sustainable seawater agriculture overall this new design successfully demonstrated self sustainability of a desalination irrigation combined system and provided a paradigm shift in saline soil remediation for agricultural sustainability however for large scale practical crop production many diverse factors may affect plant survival rate including sunlight intensity air convection soil properties and precise water supply since too much or too little water can both be detrimental to plant growth future detailed studies will need to study the influence of such factors on large scale crop production 3 4 real saline soil remediation performance the above research was conducted with an artificial saline soil of extremely high salinity to simple demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this solar evaporation based saline soil remediation technology to further assess the technologies practical application potential real saline soil collected from port pirie south australia was also treated and evaluated under one sun illumination prior to initiating the long term remediation a batch experiment was initially implemented to evaluate soil washing performance this preliminary study showed that soil conductivity could be decreased from 2 2 to 1 1 ms cm 1 when soil washing water increased above 1 g g 1 fig s18 this greater water usage during soil washing improved germination rate which increased from 20 to 60 as water consumption increased from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 fig s19 thereafter the germination rate only slightly increased when soil washing water consumption increased 0 5 g g 1 during the 20 days of solar evaporation based saline soil remediation with 8 h of light illumination per day a constant amount of leaching solution was produced each day indicating the photothermal evaporator had excellent stability and was suitable for continual long term operation fig s20 soil conductivity decreased significantly after 10 days of washing from 2 26 to 1 38 ms cm 1 fig 5 a where after 18 days the alkaline ion removal rate reached 65 3 54 4 32 7 and 30 0 for na k mg2 and ca2 respectively figs 5b and s21 the content of anions also decreased during washing with the two main anions so4 2 and cl decreasing from 2 3 to 1 8 mg g 1 and from 1 1 to 0 2 mg g 1 respectively fig s22 plant assays using broccoli to evaluate remediation performance fig s23 showed germination performance was improved from 13 8 untreated saline soil to 46 3 after solar evaporation remediation fig 5c the average length of broccoli sprouts also increased from 59 4 untreated soil to 66 2 mm fig 5d indicating that use of interfacial solar driven seawater evaporation is a promising approach for real saline soil remediation and increasing agricultural sustainability since the developed prototype has proven that desalinated water can be used to recover saline soil and that thereafter sustainable plant irrigation is feasible there is great potential to manufacture large scale devices fig 5e for example the solar desert house moustafa 2017 is an emerging sustainable modern agricultural approach to meet rising water and food demands in desert areas this system has the advantage of utilizing existing land in deserts to sustainably produce food locally the solar desert house thus has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of food supplies from distant rural farms with consequential positive environmental impact since this design is a fully automated system that uses only solar and seawater for irrigation it eliminates the need for scarce human resources to operate the development of this interfacial solar evaporation based technology will also help improve the quality of life for many people living in remote and desert affected areas and provide a potentially useful solution to the problems of water scarcity and desertification while the efficiency of the protype prosed here was already relatively high the system can further be improved by redesigning some of the evaporator components to increase thermal conversion efficiency as well as the rate and the cost effectiveness of water production for example inclusion of an anti fog treatment for the transparent cover should ensure increased stability and intensity of incident light reaching the photothermal material and directly enhance water collection rate during evaporation the evaporator material could also be replaced with cheaper alternatives such as sponges towels and a variety of other biomass materials ideally depending on the locality it would be preferential to use local waste biomass as a support and in this regard waste rice husk biochar could be an attractive option storer et al 2020 likewise for photothermal materials carbon based materials such as biochar are efficient stable and capable of being manufactured on a large scale relatively cheaply indeed the economic viability of the final system is an important practical consideration and future studies should also include economic analysis to compare the cost of water production via solar evaporators to other existing systems finally as has been shown previously sleiti et al 2021 better insights into practically improvements in water production can be obtained by developing a firm theoretical framework for the entire system to better understand how heat from irradiation is harnessed to realize higher water production rates 4 conclusion the concept of a novel interfacial solar evaporation process capable of self producing freshwater from seawater to promote ecological saline soil restoration and consequent plant irrigation was proposed here for the first time this study successfully demonstrated that the basic concept of using interfacial solar evaporation to enhance seawater desalination for clean water production which could then be directly used to improve the saline soil washing efficiency was feasible the prototype system realized a high freshwater production rate of 10 95 kg m 2 day 1 in outdoor experiments and delivered a soil washing efficiency 3 times better than a traditional distillation process the 3d evaporator also exhibited excellent stability in continuous outdoor solar evaporation over 21 days where the desalinated water continually met defined who standards for safe drinking water the freshwater so generated was then successfully utilized in real time for saline soil remediation and on demand crop growth post plant assays indicated that by using this technology highly saline soils could be restored to high quality soils suitable for agricultural activity with a 65 germination rate this work highlights the significance of the application of interfacial solar evaporation technology to efficiently use seawater for saline soil remediation and
