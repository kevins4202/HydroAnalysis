4790,reservoirs play a crucial role in the drinking water supply for solving the uneven distribution of water resources reservoir bays which serve as direct source areas and initial collection areas of pollutants are crucial areas for drinking water safety systematic observations of heavy metal pollution in reservoir bays are required and urgent under different hydrological regulation water samples were collected from 65 bays in the danjiangkou reservoir which is the water source of the world s longest trans basin water diversion project during the storage and flood discharge period from 2015 to 2019 we investigated the temporal and spatial variation in eight dissolved heavy metals chromium cr manganese mn nickel ni copper cu zinc zn arsenic as cadmium cd and lead pb and assessed their human health risks the driving factors of high risk metals were identified by constructing a structural equation model sem the results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals decreased after 5 years of reservoir operation and varied significantly p 0 05 between the storage period and flood discharge period the concentrations of cr mn cd and pb were higher in the storage period but the other four metals ni cu zn as had the reverse trend notably the as mn and pb in individual bays exceeded the water quality standard threshold the human health risk assessment indicated that only as posed a potential carcinogenic risk 1 29e 04 in the flood discharge period land use and water physicochemical properties were the main factors affecting as concentrations and they explained 32 and 44 of the variability of as in the storage and flood discharge periods respectively this study provided critical insights into the periodic dynamics and driving factors of the concentration of heavy metals in reservoir bays and formulated effective management measures for water quality management keywords reservoir operation dissolved heavy metals reservoir bay health risk assessment structural equation model 1 introduction the sixth goal of the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs was proposed to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water for humans united nations 2016 to achieve the implementation of the sdgs over 1 7 billion people rely on reservoirs to ensure that drinking water is safe due to the unevenness of water resource distribution in time and space lehner et al 2011 wcd 2000 however reservoirs have altered natural hydrological rhythms and water basin environments and complicated water quality more than ever before gao et al 2016 the issue of heavy metal pollution in surface water is the focus of various debates during the processes of reservoir construction and operation liu and yang 2012 heavy metals accumulated from natural or anthropogenic contributions in the aquatic environment pose a continuous threat to human health and ecosystem services paul 2017 reservoir bays serve as sensitive initial storage areas during the dynamic changes of water quality and are the most vulnerable to pollution li et al 2020 understanding the influential mechanisms of reservoir operations on water quality is crucial for sustaining water supply services for reservoirs lurling et al 2016 the distribution characteristics risk evaluation and source identification of metal contamination are necessary for developing effective reservoir metal contamination control strategies zhu et al 2015 human health risk assessments of dissolved heavy metals constitute the main method used to assess the potential risks of environmental pollutants alves et al 2014 for example varol 2019 explored the spatial and temporal variations in heavy metals at monthly intervals in the keban dam reservoir turkey saleem et al 2019 evaluated the health risks of heavy metals in reservoirs in pakistan during three seasons however these studies were confined to short term monitoring periods which constrained the development of more reliable drinking water safety information multivariate analyses of metal sources have demonstrated significant anthropogenic contributions to the pollutant load in reservoirs saleem et al 2019 traditional multivariate methods could separate the effects of different factors when different factors are actually mutually exclusive wang et al 2019 however a structural equation model sem can identify not only direct effects but also possible indirect effects between variables compared with traditional regression analysis sem clearly provides the effect of individual indicators on the overall and interrelationships between individual indicators taka et al 2016 in addition sem is a multivariate analysis tool that can be used to address theory driven causal research questions thus sem is applied to understand the connections between heavy metals and drivers thereby improving the knowledge of water quality issues and treatment strategies bishop et al 2008 reservoir bays are zones of interfingering water and land composed of the intersection of tributaries and the main stream reservoir bays are the first recipients of external pollutants from watersheds and have higher metal concentrations than the central areas of the reservoir izydorczyk et al 2008 heavy metals in reservoir bays are influenced by hydrological characteristics spatiotemporal variability in physicochemical variables in bays impacts metal transport dynamics in vertical and lateral directions alvarez vazquez et al 2017 the ph is considered to be one of the main factors affecting the concentration and mobility of metals in water since an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration affects the migration intensity of heavy metals krol et al 2020 elevated suspended matter and ph reduce the concentration of dissolved metals shulkin and zhang 2014 in addition sediments have a capacity to store compounds absorbed from surface water and may subsequently release them previous studies have shown that the temperature mixing status and organic carbon content influence the degree of mobilization of heavy metals from sediments into overlying water columns seasonal temperature increases at the lakebed surface led to higher as concentrations in porewater which drove larger as diffusion fluxes across the sediment water interface barrett et al 2019 zaval tseva et al 2016 the mixing status caused by the concentration gradient difference between the overlying water and sediment impacts the heavy metal concentration of the water gao et al 2017 there is a positive correlation between organic carbon and several metal concentrations park 2009 some components of organic carbon in the sediment decrease to form organometallic complexes which increases the share of elements in the potential mobile fraction baran et al 2019 moreover variations in the dissolved oxygen content oxidation reduction potential electrical conductivity and other physicochemical properties could cause the release of absorbed pollutants and lead to secondary pollution palmer et al 2020 heavy metals that were previously accumulated in the reservoir bays can be transferred to overlying water through dissolution and exchange when reservoirs reach high water levels cheng et al 2017 for example the impoundment operation in the post dam period directly affected the distribution and mobilization transformation behavior of heavy metals in the three gorges reservoir zhu et al 2019 in addition land use characteristics in the local watershed influence trace metal compositions ai et al 2015 forests shrubs and grass land tend to mitigate metals in river water while agriculture urban areas and bare land tend to contribute to heavy metals li and zhang 2011 therefore the influence of the spatiotemporal characteristics on the heavy metal concentration of reservoir bays during different hydrological regulation periods needs to be identified the danjiangkou reservoir is the water source of the longest trans basin water transfer project china s south to north water transfer project in the world supplying approximately 25 billion m3 of water to north china to alleviate the water shortage crisis and 58 million inhabitants along the project have benefited nong et al 2020 since the danjiangkou dam was heightened to 176 6 m in 2014 the submerged area has formed new reservoir bays with a 307 7 km2 increase only a few studies have explored the dissolved heavy metals in surface water and sediment in the danjiangkou reservoir li et al 2008 wang et al 2015b these related studies were mostly conducted by setting a few sampling points in the center or tributaries of the reservoir moreover these investigations were mainly conducted before the official operation of this project and used short term data series so far there is still a lack of comprehensive analyses and assessments of heavy metals in the overall reservoir bays of the danjiangkou reservoir during different hydrological regulation periods after the reservoir began operating normally to achieve the sdgs and integrated management of water resources as well as to reduce the risk of heavy metal pollution in drinking water the concentrations of eight heavy metals chromium cr manganese mn nickel ni copper cu zinc zn arsenic as cadmium cd and lead pb physicochemical indices were monitored and analyzed in the danjiangkou reservoir bays from 2015 to 2019 during the storage and flood discharge periods the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks caused by different heavy metals were evaluated the relationships between as and the ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity tub electrical conductivity ec and land use were analyzed using the sem the objectives were to 1 reveal the distribution characteristics and trends of heavy metals in the storage and discharge periods 2 assess the potential human health risks of the eight metals and 3 determine the paths of processes affecting the metal concentrations in the reservoir bays under different hydrological regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir 32 36 33 48 n 110 59 111 49 e is located in the juncture of hubei province and henan province fig 1 its drainage area is approximately 95 000 km2 including the upper han river and dan river basins the elevation ranges from 86 to 2064 m with a topography dominated by mountains and steep slopes fig 1 the soil types in the reservoir drainage basin are primarily yellow brown soil and calcareous soil forestland and cultivated land are the main types of land use in this area this area is influenced by a monsoon continental subhumid climate the average annual precipitation is 750 900 mm and 70 of the precipitation is concentrated from june to october the precipitation is mainly concentrated in june to october and higher requirements are needed to discharge water to control floods hence we determined june to october as the flood discharge period the november to may period in the following year demonstrated a lack of precipitation and floods and water was stored in the reservoir thus the november to may period of the following year was defined as the storage period li et al 2020 there are 12 93 million people in the reservoir drainage area 80 of whom live in rural areas wheat corn rice and other food crops are planted in the low elevation areas economic fruit orchards such as orange trees and tea trees are mainly planted on mountains and hills the industry in the reservoir area is dominated by automobile parts processing hydropower development agricultural products water resource processing biomedicine mining and metallurgy moreover the danjiangkou reservoir also promotes the development of surrounding tourism 2 2 sample collection and analysis in total 169 soil samples were collected from the farmlands around the reservoir that formed the new submerged area because the water level was raised in 2014 the concentration of heavy metals in soil samples from the new submerged areas were monitored according to the digital elevation model dem 1 50 000 data the arcgis hydrologic analysis module was used to divide the catchment area of each reservoir bay fig 1 the land use type was generated using aerial orthoimages captured by an unmanned drone trimble ux5 the 65 reservoir bays were selected around the reservoir considering the danjiangkou reservoir topography and land use compositions fig 1 a total of eight sampling activities were conducted during the storage period may and the flood discharge period september namely september 2015 may 2016 and may and september of each year from 2017 to 2019 water samples were collected using previously acid washed 100 ml polyethylene bottles for each sampling event then the water sample was acidified using nitric acid to ph 1 and kept at 4 c then 0 45 μm millipore nitrocellulose filters were used to filter all the water samples before measurement the concentrations of dissolved elements cr mn ni cu zn as cd and pb in the water samples were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion 300x perkinelmer usa under standard operating conditions quality assurance and quality control procedures were ensured by using standard reference materials multi element calibration standard 2a 8500 6940 agilent technologies usa with each batch of samples and adding a solvent blank and a procedure blank the internal standard elements in the sample had response values between 85 and 115 of the response value of the calibration curve indicating that the amount of drift was within acceptable limits the detection limits for cr mn ni cu zn as cd and pb were 0 0086 μg l 0 0193 μg l 0 0051 μg l 0 0095 μg l 0 0172 μg l 0 0023 μg l 0 0039 μg l and 0 0073 μg l respectively the ph do tub ec and other parameters were quantified in situ with a multi parameter water quality sonde 6600 v2 ysi usa 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 risk assessment for human health the human health risk assessment us epa 2004 was applied to evaluate the possibility of harmful effects through building a conceptual model involving the source of pollution the pollutant concentration detected on site the dilution medium the exposure route and the receptor the common heavy metal exposure pathways for human beings were direct ingestion and

explore the impact factors for the high risk metals when multiple types of influencing factors exist sem reveals the chain reaction network this method allows tracking of the influence of any path or combination of paths in the model a priori model was established based on the spearman correlation between each variable for a good model fit the χ2 df ratio should be as small as possible the significance value p 0 05 from the chi squared test was determined and the root mean square error of approximation rmsea value 0 05 was considered chen et al 2008 a comparative fit index cfi value of more than 0 97 indicated a good fit relative to the independence model bentler 1990 the variation captured was expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 iacobucci 2010 2 3 3 statistical analyses the heavy metal concentration data followed non normal distribution according to the kolmogorov smirnov test therefore spatial and periodic variations in heavy metal concentrations were analyzed using kruskal wallis h the homogeneity of the data was set at a significance level of 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted in spss 22 0 ibm co armonk ny 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics of heavy metal concentration the concentrations of heavy metals displayed great periodic fluctuations fig 2 the concentrations of all metals had unconcentrated distribution between reservoir bays from 2015 to 2016 the peak values of cr cu and ni occurred in the flood discharge period of 2015 while as cd and pb appeared in the storage period of 2016 and mn and zn appeared in 2017 the ni concentration in the reservoir bays increased with sampling years reaching 4 71 μg l in 2019 but the concentrations were far less than the water quality limit 20 μg l cu and pb showed a certain degree of concentration rebound in 2019 all heavy metal concentrations varied significantly p 0 05 between the storage period and flood discharge period the spatial distribution of the heavy metal content in the two periods are shown in fig 3 and 4 no significant difference in metal concentrations was found among different bays except for mn and as which showed significant spatial variations p 0 05 reservoir bays with higher as concentrations were located mostly in the northeast fig 3 f fig 4 f the highest variation in heavy metals over the reservoir bays was found for as cv 3 06 the concentrations of mn in four individual reservoir bays were higher than those specified by china s drinking water quality standards cwqs 100 μg l fig 3 b meanwhile there were three bays with pb concentrations of 15 17 μg l 10 72 μg l and 10 05 μg l which exceeded cwqs 10 μg l in the storage period fig 3 h according to the guideline values the average concentrations of all heavy metals were safe table 1 cr ni cu zn and cd were present in extremely low concentrations compared to cwqs however the concentrations of as and pb in some reservoir bays exceeded the world health organization s who suggested level the levels recommended by the national primary drinking water regulations established by united states environmental protection agency usepa and cwqs 10 μg l for both as and pb fig 2 additionally the average concentrations of as and pb exceeded the maximum contaminant level goal mclg values 0 μg l for both as and pb compared with heavy metal concentrations in other water bodies table 1 cu 2 38 μg l cd 0 30 μg l and pb 3 22 μg l in the studied reservoirs were lower than those in the three gorges reservoir china cu 8 94 μg l cd 1 02 μg l pb 11 20 μg l the concentrations of mn 36 92 μg l and zn 18 88 μg l were much higher than those of the keban dam reservoir turkey however the metal concentrations in the bays during the same period were higher than the means of reservoirs in the hilly areas of southern china except cr and zn during the storage period and cr and pb during the flood discharge period table 1 3 2 human health risk assessment of heavy metals the hi values showed that the risk of metals was as pb mn cr cd zn cu ni table 2 as hi 0 210 and 0 286 values were relatively close to the critical level during the storage and discharge periods there was no risk of as in most reservoir bays only two bays in 2015 and five bays in 2016 showed hi risk values that exceeded 1 the average hi values of all heavy metals in the reservoir bays were smaller than 1 during the study periods table 2 these results suggested that most heavy metals via both ingestion and dermal pathways posed little or no health hazard the hq of cr mn and cd was higher through the dermal pathway than through the ingestion pathway the other five metals had higher risk values through ingestion than through dermal pathway the hi values of cr mn and cd 7 16e 03 1 23e 02 and 2 54e 03 during the storage period were higher than the values 5 29e 03 9 26e 03 and 1 34e 03 during the flood discharge period respectively however ni cu zn as and pb were present in lower concentrations than in the flood discharge period the cr value of as for the ingestion pathway was approximately 173 times higher than that for the dermal pathway in the two periods in the same situation the cr value of pb for the ingestion pathway was approximately 172 times higher than that for the dermal pathway obviously as and pb posed little hazard by dermal absorption but ingestion was the main carcinogenic pathway in this study although the cr value of as dropped below 10e 04 after 2017 the total carcinogenic risk of as 1 29e 04 in the flood discharge period exceeded the range of carcinogenic risks therefore the health risks associated with as need to be addressed 3 3 determinant of heavy metal dynamics the concentration of as in water of reservoir bays has posed hidden danger to human health and the spatiotemporal variation in as detected was large table 2 fig 2 anthropogenic land use in the corresponding catchment physicochemical water conditions and the concentration of as in farmland soil from submerged areas were selected as explanatory variables in the sem table 3 the main types of land use were a forest agricultural land and residential land forests implied the natural state of water quality before human interference the ph do tub and ec were considered in the analysis because they may be the determinant of dissolution the rising water level during the flood discharge period contacted the soil in the submerged area during the storage period all selected factors accounted for 32 of the variation of the as concentration fig 5 the concentration of as was positively correlated with agricultural land r 0 34 p 0 05 do had a significant effect on as and the path coefficient was 0 22 the results showed that the ph was negatively correlated with as r 0 41 p 0 001 the residential area tub and ec had no significant effects on as the total effect of the tub on the as concentration had a low positive value 0 01 which was opposite to the original direct effect table 4 in addition the agriculture indirectly affected as by affecting the do and tub of water bodies the total effect of agricultural land was 0 37 which was the largest among all the selected factors during the flood discharge period all selected factors accounted for 44 of the variation of the as concentration fig 6 anthropogenic land use in the corresponding catchment had no significant correlation with as however anthropogenic land use affected the physicochemical properties of water the total effects of agricultural and residential land on the as concentration were 0 17 and 0 19 respectively table 1 in the flood discharge period the correlation between water quality indices were large the ec had the highest path coefficient r 0 53 p 0 001 for the as concentration the total effect of tub was also increased by 0 23 compared with the storage period the as in the soil of the submerged area was dissolved into water which had a significant positive effect on the concentration of the as in the bays r 0 20 p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 low health risk of heavy metals after normal operation the heavy metals of the reservoir bays showed large interannual variation during the study periods fig 2 some factors might cause this large interannual variation the rapid rise of the water level in the initial stage of the reservoir s impoundment increased the disturbance between sediments and the newly submerged area which might carry more pollutants into the reservoir bays lin et al 2020 when the water level was stable this effect was reduced in addition the relevant government departments have taken measures for achieving water quality safety over the years such as banning fishing by boat and constructing landfill leachate treatment projects these measures reduced the concentrations of heavy metal to some extent however the degree of reduction in the metal concentration differed due to the various sources of heavy metals from different reservoir bays moreover the variation of annual precipitation caused a difference in the water level during the storage and drainage of reservoirs which lead to the fluctuation of the heavy metal concentration heavy metal concentrations are affected by the weathering processes of rock and soil and anthropogenic activities taka et al 2016 the very low ratios of cl cl hco3 suggested that the danjiangkou reservoir waters were dominated by the chemical weathering of carbonates li et al 2017 which caused large amounts of heavy metal elements to be leached and released and to flow into the water with the weathering solution the low concentrations of cr and ni were derived from natural sources ophiolite fragments and characterized by slow accumulation meng et al 2016 the concentration of as from bays in the northeast decreased in accordance with the distance from ore sites which suggested that as was affected by weathering processes higher background levels of trace elements and metal manufacturing furthermore the highest concentrations of mn and as were found in the danjiang river and laoguan river that flow directly into the reservoir meng et al 2016 ai et al 2015 also found that the xiang river has a higher concentration 2 89 7 00 μg l of as than other inflow tributaries of the danjiangkou reservoir these high concentrations of heavy metals from the inflow tributaries caused the bays in the northeast with the higher concentrations fig 3 and 4 however some dissolved metal cr cu as cd and pb concentrations were lower than those in 2006 li et al 2008 indicating that water quality management policies for reservoirs and input tributaries were effective table 1 heavy metals accumulated within the reservoir sediments could be released which could affect the metal concentration in the water of bays the enrichment of mn in the sediments located in the center of danjiang reservoir could also contribute to the high concentrations of mn in nearby bays fig 3 b zheng et al 2020 the reservoir as the water source could become a medium for the spread of pollution expanding the affected area and endangering the health of residents bing et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to take countermeasures for specific heavy metals to reduce the risk of high concentrations in several specific bays of the danjiangkou reservoir fig 2 fig 3 most heavy metal concentrations in our studied reservoir bays were lower than those in the three gorges reservoir gao et al 2016 because there was no large scale industrialization or urbanizations and little shipping around the danjiangkou reservoir which limited the discharge of heavy metal laden wastewater the results of water quality monitoring showed that the heavy metal levels in the reservoir bays met the drinking water quality standards set by who and china during the operation of water impoundment 2015 2019 table 1 different heavy metals in the reservoir bays had specific hi and hq values during the storage period and discharge period table 2 as and pb had considerably higher values than other metals in terms of non carcinogenic risks during the two periods and ingestion was the primary exposure pathway table 2 which was in agreement with the previous study li and zhang 2010 as and pb deserved more attention due to their concentration persistence and toxicity saleem et al 2019 varol 2019 in addition the as concentration should cause a focus on control due to the cr of as through oral intake exceeding the tolerable limit set by the usepa in the flood discharge period this result indicated that long term ingestion of reservoir water with excessive as concentration might increase the possibility of cancer however there is no need to worry about drinking reservoir water at present because the risks mainly occurred in the initial stage of reservoir operation and the concentration of as has stabilized below the recommended guidelines 10 μg l in the last three years 2017 2019 fig 2 4 2 divergent controls on heavy metals under different operation periods reservoirs alter natural hydrological rhythms and water basin environments and cause complicated changes in the water quality a significant difference p 0 05 in heavy metal concentrations occurred between the two periods this difference may be related to precipitation hydrological characteristics river inflow metal properties and the main sources of pollution wang et al 2010 additionally eutrophication and sediment resuspension in reservoirs greatly affects the distribution and periodic variation in dissolved heavy metals wu et al 2017 in this study the total concentrations of eight elements in the storage period had higher values than those in the flood discharge period the dilution effect due to the higher water level triggered the reduction of the total concentration during the flood discharge period this diluting effect was also identified in the kaban reservoir varol 2019 our results showed that the concentrations of cr mn cd and pb were higher in the storage period than in the flood discharge period and a reverse trend occurred for the other four metal concentrations table 1 the dissimilar sources of these heavy metals caused this phenomenon the concentrations of contaminants point sources i e cr mn cd and pb might decrease due to dilution by abundant water whereas the input of ni cu zn and as into the bays from diffuse sources increased in the flood discharge period wang et al 2018 in particular as enters aquatic ecosystems through many routes and affects the water quality and human health for example runoff generated from precipitation coupled with sediments and pollutants discharged into reservoir bays affected the variation in the as concentration moreover domestic sewage and industrial wastewater contained certain concentrations of as discharged into tributaries and modified the as concentration in the reservoir bays previous research revealed that as was the primary polluting element in the yangtze river and in reservoirs of southern china wang et al 2018 although the current concentration of as in the danjiangkou reservoir met the level suggested by the who and cwqs the health risks of as cannot be ignored table 1 table 2 therefore we used path analysis to consider the interactive effects among water physicochemical properties and land use on trace metal as and quantified the contributions of possible sources fig 5 and 6 the fluidity of as was mainly determined by the processes of the mineral surface especially precipitation dissolution adsorption and desorption these processes were controlled by physicochemical parameters such as the ph eh ion composition and mineral type palmer et al 2020 physicochemical parameters were significant for understanding the toxic load behavior resulting from the chemical equilibrium among different reservoir bays alvarez vazquez et al 2017 while the effects of the do and ph on metal concentrations were opposite they had a positive relationship mutually moreover the ph data had a small variation suggesting that the ph had little influence on the variation of the as concentration which was consistent with taka et al 2016 the farmland soil from newly submerged areas was equivalent to the water level fluctuation zone in the danjiangkou reservoir which was influenced by erosion and inundation the soil in submerged areas served as a source and sink for the accumulation and redistribution of heavy metals song et al 2019 wang et al 2015a the ion exchange process of the sediment and the specific substances suspended in the water column might affect the dissolution of heavy metals de melo gurgel et al 2016 the outcome of the sem also showed that the ec r 0 53 p 0 05 and soil r 0 20 p 0 05 had a positive effect on the as concentrations meanwhile the direct effect of the agri became relatively small during the flood discharge period fig 6 a previous study reported that land use located away from the riparian zone especially agriculture regardless of its relative position influenced the water metal concentration in the han river li and zhang 2011 these heavy metals would be accumulated in the soil under the long term use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers ouyang et al 2019 specifically the majority of as containing pesticides and herbicides were sprayed on winter wheat corn and rice farmland and citrus orchards from february to may during the storage period csy 2018 water coupled with sediments reached reservoir bays which indirectly increased the content of heavy metals pekey et al 2004 the proportion of agricultural land directly affected the as concentration and indirectly affected the as concentration through turbidity fig 6 the high variability 61 61 of the farmland area facilitated the largest spatial variability of as which proved that as came from human agricultural activities from another perspective in the northeastern part of the reservoir there are mining activities and a high percentage of farmland therefore the as concentrations in bays were high in the northeast fig 3 and 4 there were small effects on the as concentration in residential areas during the two periods fig 5 and 6 on one hand the proportion of residential areas was relatively small and scattered fig 1 and there was a small population density and little industrial wastewater discharge in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment on the other hand the increase in the residential area caused more sealed surfaces with less interaction between runoff and bare soil which further decreased the amount of as in the tributaries flowing into the bays furthermore hydrodynamic conditions also altered the distribution migration and transformation of as in the reservoir bays the mixing of water between the bays and reservoir affected the as concentration in the reservoir bays however we cannot provide enough information to reflect this mixing effect and further investigations are needed in the future 4 3 implication from the perspective of the heavy metal concentration our research explained and addressed some concerns about water quality safety for dammed reservoirs the concentrations of heavy metals met all standards after five years of reservoir operation although dissolved heavy metals in some reservoir bays are within the standard range they are higher than those in other reservoir bays therefore we need to take some measures to prevent the heavy metal concentration in these bays from exceeding the standard and becoming high risk danjiangkou reservoir is the first level water source protection area in china cage fish culture has been completely banned and a ten year fishing ban has been stipulated the water quality has improved markedly due to the investment in wastewater discharge treatment and the development of pollution control strategies ma et al 2020 china s water pollution prevention and control action plan needs to continue to control heavy metal risks in reservoir bays in addition farmland area has a positive effect on the metal concentration as evidenced by the sem fig 5 improving the utilization rate of fertilizers and reducing the use of high toxicity and residual pesticides in farmland which will weaken the risk of metal diffusion using some methods including phytoremediation rhizofiltration and biosorption will reduce pollutants entering the reservoir bays by setting up riparian buffers in the catchment of reservoir bays moreover for individual bays with high risks of mn as and pb fig 3 table 2 some biophysical techniques such as coagulation active carbon bioremediation ion exchange etc can be applied to the treatment and removal of heavy metals from reservoir bays ul islam 2017 as was effectively fixed by adsorption or co precipitation with metal oxides under high do levels nicomel et al 2015 thus constructing waterfall facilities on tributaries promotes do and reduces the risk of as in water overall the focus of the prevention of heavy metals in reservoir bays is to strengthen source control coordinate management of catchments and apply physiochemical techniques furthermore hydrodynamic characteristics caused by reservoir operation might also affect the process of heavy metal migration in reservoir bays and more detailed information is needed to identify these effects gao et al 2016 in addition water quality information e g the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and dominant ions for the main reservoir waterbody as well as sediment nutrient retention and release need to be obtained to comprehensively determine the impact of dammed reservoir construction on the water environment chassiot et al 2019 in the future the influence of reservoir operations on water quality can be further explored in combination with tracer technology e g stable isotope technology hydrodynamic models remote sensing inversion and other advanced technologies this study will provide a basis for ensuring the safety of the water supply and a practical path for the realization of sdgs 5 conclusion spatiotemporal variations in heavy metal concentrations in reservoir bays were investigated following the operation of the danjiangkou reservoir from 2015 to 2019 under different hydrological regulation we evaluated potential human health hazards and explored the effects of land use soil and physiochemical properties of water on heavy metals by conducting sem all heavy metals were well controlled and the average concentrations met the level recommended by the who and cwqs during the storage and discharge periods the concentrations of heavy metals in reservoir bays decreased from 2015 to 2019 indicating that the water quality improved after the reservoir operated normally the hi values of heavy metals were as pb mn cr cd zn cu ni and non carcinogenic risk of all metals did not exist hi 1 however the cancer potential of as should be concerning because the total carcinogenic risk of as in the flood discharge period exceeded the range of carcinogenic risks the influences of water physicochemical properties and land use on the as concentration in two periods were different the indirect effects further revealed the complex network of underlying processes controlling metal concentrations considering that the reservoir will continue to supply water for many years and millions of people more research work such as controlled in situ experiments are needed to understand the pollution pathways for the development of water management and maintenance

4790,reservoirs play a crucial role in the drinking water supply for solving the uneven distribution of water resources reservoir bays which serve as direct source areas and initial collection areas of pollutants are crucial areas for drinking water safety systematic observations of heavy metal pollution in reservoir bays are required and urgent under different hydrological regulation water samples were collected from 65 bays in the danjiangkou reservoir which is the water source of the world s longest trans basin water diversion project during the storage and flood discharge period from 2015 to 2019 we investigated the temporal and spatial variation in eight dissolved heavy metals chromium cr manganese mn nickel ni copper cu zinc zn arsenic as cadmium cd and lead pb and assessed their human health risks the driving factors of high risk metals were identified by constructing a structural equation model sem the results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals decreased after 5 years of reservoir operation and varied significantly p 0 05 between the storage period and flood discharge period the concentrations of cr mn cd and pb were higher in the storage period but the other four metals ni cu zn as had the reverse trend notably the as mn and pb in individual bays exceeded the water quality standard threshold the human health risk assessment indicated that only as posed a potential carcinogenic risk 1 29e 04 in the flood discharge period land use and water physicochemical properties were the main factors affecting as concentrations and they explained 32 and 44 of the variability of as in the storage and flood discharge periods respectively this study provided critical insights into the periodic dynamics and driving factors of the concentration of heavy metals in reservoir bays and formulated effective management measures for water quality management keywords reservoir operation dissolved heavy metals reservoir bay health risk assessment structural equation model 1 introduction the sixth goal of the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs was proposed to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water for humans united nations 2016 to achieve the implementation of the sdgs over 1 7 billion people rely on reservoirs to ensure that drinking water is safe due to the unevenness of water resource distribution in time and space lehner et al 2011 wcd 2000 however reservoirs have altered natural hydrological rhythms and water basin environments and complicated water quality more than ever before gao et al 2016 the issue of heavy metal pollution in surface water is the focus of various debates during the processes of reservoir construction and operation liu and yang 2012 heavy metals accumulated from natural or anthropogenic contributions in the aquatic environment pose a continuous threat to human health and ecosystem services paul 2017 reservoir bays serve as sensitive initial storage areas during the dynamic changes of water quality and are the most vulnerable to pollution li et al 2020 understanding the influential mechanisms of reservoir operations on water quality is crucial for sustaining water supply services for reservoirs lurling et al 2016 the distribution characteristics risk evaluation and source identification of metal contamination are necessary for developing effective reservoir metal contamination control strategies zhu et al 2015 human health risk assessments of dissolved heavy metals constitute the main method used to assess the potential risks of environmental pollutants alves et al 2014 for example varol 2019 explored the spatial and temporal variations in heavy metals at monthly intervals in the keban dam reservoir turkey saleem et al 2019 evaluated the health risks of heavy metals in reservoirs in pakistan during three seasons however these studies were confined to short term monitoring periods which constrained the development of more reliable drinking water safety information multivariate analyses of metal sources have demonstrated significant anthropogenic contributions to the pollutant load in reservoirs saleem et al 2019 traditional multivariate methods could separate the effects of different factors when different factors are actually mutually exclusive wang et al 2019 however a structural equation model sem can identify not only direct effects but also possible indirect effects between variables compared with traditional regression analysis sem clearly provides the effect of individual indicators on the overall and interrelationships between individual indicators taka et al 2016 in addition sem is a multivariate analysis tool that can be used to address theory driven causal research questions thus sem is applied to understand the connections between heavy metals and drivers thereby improving the knowledge of water quality issues and treatment strategies bishop et al 2008 reservoir bays are zones of interfingering water and land composed of the intersection of tributaries and the main stream reservoir bays are the first recipients of external pollutants from watersheds and have higher metal concentrations than the central areas of the reservoir izydorczyk et al 2008 heavy metals in reservoir bays are influenced by hydrological characteristics spatiotemporal variability in physicochemical variables in bays impacts metal transport dynamics in vertical and lateral directions alvarez vazquez et al 2017 the ph is considered to be one of the main factors affecting the concentration and mobility of metals in water since an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration affects the migration intensity of heavy metals krol et al 2020 elevated suspended matter and ph reduce the concentration of dissolved metals shulkin and zhang 2014 in addition sediments have a capacity to store compounds absorbed from surface water and may subsequently release them previous studies have shown that the temperature mixing status and organic carbon content influence the degree of mobilization of heavy metals from sediments into overlying water columns seasonal temperature increases at the lakebed surface led to higher as concentrations in porewater which drove larger as diffusion fluxes across the sediment water interface barrett et al 2019 zaval tseva et al 2016 the mixing status caused by the concentration gradient difference between the overlying water and sediment impacts the heavy metal concentration of the water gao et al 2017 there is a positive correlation between organic carbon and several metal concentrations park 2009 some components of organic carbon in the sediment decrease to form organometallic complexes which increases the share of elements in the potential mobile fraction baran et al 2019 moreover variations in the dissolved oxygen content oxidation reduction potential electrical conductivity and other physicochemical properties could cause the release of absorbed pollutants and lead to secondary pollution palmer et al 2020 heavy metals that were previously accumulated in the reservoir bays can be transferred to overlying water through dissolution and exchange when reservoirs reach high water levels cheng et al 2017 for example the impoundment operation in the post dam period directly affected the distribution and mobilization transformation behavior of heavy metals in the three gorges reservoir zhu et al 2019 in addition land use characteristics in the local watershed influence trace metal compositions ai et al 2015 forests shrubs and grass land tend to mitigate metals in river water while agriculture urban areas and bare land tend to contribute to heavy metals li and zhang 2011 therefore the influence of the spatiotemporal characteristics on the heavy metal concentration of reservoir bays during different hydrological regulation periods needs to be identified the danjiangkou reservoir is the water source of the longest trans basin water transfer project china s south to north water transfer project in the world supplying approximately 25 billion m3 of water to north china to alleviate the water shortage crisis and 58 million inhabitants along the project have benefited nong et al 2020 since the danjiangkou dam was heightened to 176 6 m in 2014 the submerged area has formed new reservoir bays with a 307 7 km2 increase only a few studies have explored the dissolved heavy metals in surface water and sediment in the danjiangkou reservoir li et al 2008 wang et al 2015b these related studies were mostly conducted by setting a few sampling points in the center or tributaries of the reservoir moreover these investigations were mainly conducted before the official operation of this project and used short term data series so far there is still a lack of comprehensive analyses and assessments of heavy metals in the overall reservoir bays of the danjiangkou reservoir during different hydrological regulation periods after the reservoir began operating normally to achieve the sdgs and integrated management of water resources as well as to reduce the risk of heavy metal pollution in drinking water the concentrations of eight heavy metals chromium cr manganese mn nickel ni copper cu zinc zn arsenic as cadmium cd and lead pb physicochemical indices were monitored and analyzed in the danjiangkou reservoir bays from 2015 to 2019 during the storage and flood discharge periods the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks caused by different heavy metals were evaluated the relationships between as and the ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity tub electrical conductivity ec and land use were analyzed using the sem the objectives were to 1 reveal the distribution characteristics and trends of heavy metals in the storage and discharge periods 2 assess the potential human health risks of the eight metals and 3 determine the paths of processes affecting the metal concentrations in the reservoir bays under different hydrological regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir 32 36 33 48 n 110 59 111 49 e is located in the juncture of hubei province and henan province fig 1 its drainage area is approximately 95 000 km2 including the upper han river and dan river basins the elevation ranges from 86 to 2064 m with a topography dominated by mountains and steep slopes fig 1 the soil types in the reservoir drainage basin are primarily yellow brown soil and calcareous soil forestland and cultivated land are the main types of land use in this area this area is influenced by a monsoon continental subhumid climate the average annual precipitation is 750 900 mm and 70 of the precipitation is concentrated from june to october the precipitation is mainly concentrated in june to october and higher requirements are needed to discharge water to control floods hence we determined june to october as the flood discharge period the november to may period in the following year demonstrated a lack of precipitation and floods and water was stored in the reservoir thus the november to may period of the following year was defined as the storage period li et al 2020 there are 12 93 million people in the reservoir drainage area 80 of whom live in rural areas wheat corn rice and other food crops are planted in the low elevation areas economic fruit orchards such as orange trees and tea trees are mainly planted on mountains and hills the industry in the reservoir area is dominated by automobile parts processing hydropower development agricultural products water resource processing biomedicine mining and metallurgy moreover the danjiangkou reservoir also promotes the development of surrounding tourism 2 2 sample collection and analysis in total 169 soil samples were collected from the farmlands around the reservoir that formed the new submerged area because the water level was raised in 2014 the concentration of heavy metals in soil samples from the new submerged areas were monitored according to the digital elevation model dem 1 50 000 data the arcgis hydrologic analysis module was used to divide the catchment area of each reservoir bay fig 1 the land use type was generated using aerial orthoimages captured by an unmanned drone trimble ux5 the 65 reservoir bays were selected around the reservoir considering the danjiangkou reservoir topography and land use compositions fig 1 a total of eight sampling activities were conducted during the storage period may and the flood discharge period september namely september 2015 may 2016 and may and september of each year from 2017 to 2019 water samples were collected using previously acid washed 100 ml polyethylene bottles for each sampling event then the water sample was acidified using nitric acid to ph 1 and kept at 4 c then 0 45 μm millipore nitrocellulose filters were used to filter all the water samples before measurement the concentrations of dissolved elements cr mn ni cu zn as cd and pb in the water samples were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion 300x perkinelmer usa under standard operating conditions quality assurance and quality control procedures were ensured by using standard reference materials multi element calibration standard 2a 8500 6940 agilent technologies usa with each batch of samples and adding a solvent blank and a procedure blank the internal standard elements in the sample had response values between 85 and 115 of the response value of the calibration curve indicating that the amount of drift was within acceptable limits the detection limits for cr mn ni cu zn as cd and pb were 0 0086 μg l 0 0193 μg l 0 0051 μg l 0 0095 μg l 0 0172 μg l 0 0023 μg l 0 0039 μg l and 0 0073 μg l respectively the ph do tub ec and other parameters were quantified in situ with a multi parameter water quality sonde 6600 v2 ysi usa 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 risk

explore the impact factors for the high risk metals when multiple types of influencing factors exist sem reveals the chain reaction network this method allows tracking of the influence of any path or combination of paths in the model a priori model was established based on the spearman correlation between each variable for a good model fit the χ2 df ratio should be as small as possible the significance value p 0 05 from the chi squared test was determined and the root mean square error of approximation rmsea value 0 05 was considered chen et al 2008 a comparative fit index cfi value of more than 0 97 indicated a good fit relative to the independence model bentler 1990 the variation captured was expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 iacobucci 2010 2 3 3 statistical analyses the heavy metal concentration data followed non normal distribution according to the kolmogorov smirnov test therefore spatial and periodic variations in heavy metal concentrations were analyzed using kruskal wallis h the homogeneity of the data was set at a significance level of 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted in spss 22 0 ibm co armonk ny 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics of heavy metal concentration the concentrations of heavy metals displayed great periodic fluctuations fig 2 the concentrations of all metals had unconcentrated distribution between reservoir bays from 2015 to 2016 the peak values of cr cu and ni occurred in the flood discharge period of 2015 while as cd and pb appeared in the storage period of 2016 and mn and zn appeared in 2017 the ni concentration in the reservoir bays increased with sampling years reaching 4 71 μg l in 2019 but the concentrations were far less than the water quality limit 20 μg l cu and pb showed a certain degree of concentration rebound in 2019 all heavy metal concentrations varied significantly p 0 05 between the storage period and flood discharge period the spatial distribution of the heavy metal content in the two periods are shown in fig 3 and 4 no significant difference in metal concentrations was found among different bays except for mn and as which showed significant spatial variations p 0 05 reservoir bays with higher as concentrations were located mostly in the northeast fig 3 f fig 4 f the highest variation in heavy metals over the reservoir bays was found for as cv 3 06 the concentrations of mn in four individual reservoir bays were higher than those specified by china s drinking water quality standards cwqs 100 μg l fig 3 b meanwhile there were three bays with pb concentrations of 15 17 μg l 10 72 μg l and 10 05 μg l which exceeded cwqs 10 μg l in the storage period fig 3 h according to the guideline values the average concentrations of all heavy metals were safe table 1 cr ni cu zn and cd were present in extremely low concentrations compared to cwqs however the concentrations of as and pb in some reservoir bays exceeded the world health organization s who suggested level the levels recommended by the national primary drinking water regulations established by united states environmental protection agency usepa and cwqs 10 μg l for both as and pb fig 2 additionally the average concentrations of as and pb exceeded the maximum contaminant level goal mclg values 0 μg l for both as and pb compared with heavy metal concentrations in other water bodies table 1 cu 2 38 μg l cd 0 30 μg l and pb 3 22 μg l in the studied reservoirs were lower than those in the three gorges reservoir china cu 8 94 μg l cd 1 02 μg l pb 11 20 μg l the concentrations of mn 36 92 μg l and zn 18 88 μg l were much higher than those of the keban dam reservoir turkey however the metal concentrations in the bays during the same period were higher than the means of reservoirs in the hilly areas of southern china except cr and zn during the storage period and cr and pb during the flood discharge period table 1 3 2 human health risk assessment of heavy metals the hi values showed that the risk of metals was as pb mn cr cd zn cu ni table 2 as hi 0 210 and 0 286 values were relatively close to the critical level during the storage and discharge periods there was no risk of as in most reservoir bays only two bays in 2015 and five bays in 2016 showed hi risk values that exceeded 1 the average hi values of all heavy metals in the reservoir bays were smaller than 1 during the study periods table 2 these results suggested that most heavy metals via both ingestion and dermal pathways posed little or no health hazard the hq of cr mn and cd was higher through the dermal pathway than through the ingestion pathway the other five metals had higher risk values through ingestion than through dermal pathway the hi values of cr mn and cd 7 16e 03 1 23e 02 and 2 54e 03 during the storage period were higher than the values 5 29e 03 9 26e 03 and 1 34e 03 during the flood discharge period respectively however ni cu zn as and pb were present in lower concentrations than in the flood discharge period the cr value of as for the ingestion pathway was approximately 173 times higher than that for the dermal pathway in the two periods in the same situation the cr value of pb for the ingestion pathway was approximately 172 times higher than that for the dermal pathway obviously as and pb posed little hazard by dermal absorption but ingestion was the main carcinogenic pathway in this study although the cr value of as dropped below 10e 04 after 2017 the total carcinogenic risk of as 1 29e 04 in the flood discharge period exceeded the range of carcinogenic risks therefore the health risks associated with as need to be addressed 3 3 determinant of heavy metal dynamics the concentration of as in water of reservoir bays has posed hidden danger to human health and the spatiotemporal variation in as detected was large table 2 fig 2 anthropogenic land use in the corresponding catchment physicochemical water conditions and the concentration of as in farmland soil from submerged areas were selected as explanatory variables in the sem table 3 the main types of land use were a forest agricultural land and residential land forests implied the natural state of water quality before human interference the ph do tub and ec were considered in the analysis because they may be the determinant of dissolution the rising water level during the flood discharge period contacted the soil in the submerged area during the storage period all selected factors accounted for 32 of the variation of the as concentration fig 5 the concentration of as was positively correlated with agricultural land r 0 34 p 0 05 do had a significant effect on as and the path coefficient was 0 22 the results showed that the ph was negatively correlated with as r 0 41 p 0 001 the residential area tub and ec had no significant effects on as the total effect of the tub on the as concentration had a low positive value 0 01 which was opposite to the original direct effect table 4 in addition the agriculture indirectly affected as by affecting the do and tub of water bodies the total effect of agricultural land was 0 37 which was the largest among all the selected factors during the flood discharge period all selected factors accounted for 44 of the variation of the as concentration fig 6 anthropogenic land use in the corresponding catchment had no significant correlation with as however anthropogenic land use affected the physicochemical properties of water the total effects of agricultural and residential land on the as concentration were 0 17 and 0 19 respectively table 1 in the flood discharge period the correlation between water quality indices were large the ec had the highest path coefficient r 0 53 p 0 001 for the as concentration the total effect of tub was also increased by 0 23 compared with the storage period the as in the soil of the submerged area was dissolved into water which had a significant positive effect on the concentration of the as in the bays r 0 20 p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 low health risk of heavy metals after normal operation the heavy metals of the reservoir bays showed large interannual variation during the study periods fig 2 some factors might cause this large interannual variation the rapid rise of the water level in the initial stage of the reservoir s impoundment increased the disturbance between sediments and the newly submerged area which might carry more pollutants into the reservoir bays lin et al 2020 when the water level was stable this effect was reduced in addition the relevant government departments have taken measures for achieving water quality safety over the years such as banning fishing by boat and constructing landfill leachate treatment projects these measures reduced the concentrations of heavy metal to some extent however the degree of reduction in the metal concentration differed due to the various sources of heavy metals from different reservoir bays moreover the variation of annual precipitation caused a difference in the water level during the storage and drainage of reservoirs which lead to the fluctuation of the heavy metal concentration heavy metal concentrations are affected by the weathering processes of rock and soil and anthropogenic activities taka et al 2016 the very low ratios of cl cl hco3 suggested that the danjiangkou reservoir waters were dominated by the chemical weathering of carbonates li et al 2017 which caused large amounts of heavy metal elements to be leached and released and to flow into the water with the weathering solution the low concentrations of cr and ni were derived from natural sources ophiolite fragments and characterized by slow accumulation meng et al 2016 the concentration of as from bays in the northeast decreased in accordance with the distance from ore sites which suggested that as was affected by weathering processes higher background levels of trace elements and metal manufacturing furthermore the highest concentrations of mn and as were found in the danjiang river and laoguan river that flow directly into the reservoir meng et al 2016 ai et al 2015 also found that the xiang river has a higher concentration 2 89 7 00 μg l of as than other inflow tributaries of the danjiangkou reservoir these high concentrations of heavy metals from the inflow tributaries caused the bays in the northeast with the higher concentrations fig 3 and 4 however some dissolved metal cr cu as cd and pb concentrations were lower than those in 2006 li et al 2008 indicating that water quality management policies for reservoirs and input tributaries were effective table 1 heavy metals accumulated within the reservoir sediments could be released which could affect the metal concentration in the water of bays the enrichment of mn in the sediments located in the center of danjiang reservoir could also contribute to the high concentrations of mn in nearby bays fig 3 b zheng et al 2020 the reservoir as the water source could become a medium for the spread of pollution expanding the affected area and endangering the health of residents bing et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to take countermeasures for specific heavy metals to reduce the risk of high concentrations in several specific bays of the danjiangkou reservoir fig 2 fig 3 most heavy metal concentrations in our studied reservoir bays were lower than those in the three gorges reservoir gao et al 2016 because there was no large scale industrialization or urbanizations and little shipping around the danjiangkou reservoir which limited the discharge of heavy metal laden wastewater the results of water quality monitoring showed that the heavy metal levels in the reservoir bays met the drinking water quality standards set by who and china during the operation of water impoundment 2015 2019 table 1 different heavy metals in the reservoir bays had specific hi and hq values during the storage period and discharge period table 2 as and pb had considerably higher values than other metals in terms of non carcinogenic risks during the two periods and ingestion was the primary exposure pathway table 2 which was in agreement with the previous study li and zhang 2010 as and pb deserved more attention due to their concentration persistence and toxicity saleem et al 2019 varol 2019 in addition the as concentration should cause a focus on control due to the cr of as through oral intake exceeding the tolerable limit set by the usepa in the flood discharge period this result indicated that long term ingestion of reservoir water with excessive as concentration might increase the possibility of cancer however there is no need to worry about drinking reservoir water at present because the risks mainly occurred in the initial stage of reservoir operation and the concentration of as has stabilized below the recommended guidelines 10 μg l in the last three years 2017 2019 fig 2 4 2 divergent controls on heavy metals under different operation periods reservoirs alter natural hydrological rhythms and water basin environments and cause complicated changes in the water quality a significant difference p 0 05 in heavy metal concentrations occurred between the two periods this difference may be related to precipitation hydrological characteristics river inflow metal properties and the main sources of pollution wang et al 2010 additionally eutrophication and sediment resuspension in reservoirs greatly affects the distribution and periodic variation in dissolved heavy metals wu et al 2017 in this study the total concentrations of eight elements in the storage period had higher values than those in the flood discharge period the dilution effect due to the higher water level triggered the reduction of the total concentration during the flood discharge period this diluting effect was also identified in the kaban reservoir varol 2019 our results showed that the concentrations of cr mn cd and pb were higher in the storage period than in the flood discharge period and a reverse trend occurred for the other four metal concentrations table 1 the dissimilar sources of these heavy metals caused this phenomenon the concentrations of contaminants point sources i e cr mn cd and pb might decrease due to dilution by abundant water whereas the input of ni cu zn and as into the bays from diffuse sources increased in the flood discharge period wang et al 2018 in particular as enters aquatic ecosystems through many routes and affects the water quality and human health for example runoff generated from precipitation coupled with sediments and pollutants discharged into reservoir bays affected the variation in the as concentration moreover domestic sewage and industrial wastewater contained certain concentrations of as discharged into tributaries and modified the as concentration in the reservoir bays previous research revealed that as was the primary polluting element in the yangtze river and in reservoirs of southern china wang et al 2018 although the current concentration of as in the danjiangkou reservoir met the level suggested by the who and cwqs the health risks of as cannot be ignored table 1 table 2 therefore we used path analysis to consider the interactive effects among water physicochemical properties and land use on trace metal as and quantified the contributions of possible sources fig 5 and 6 the fluidity of as was mainly determined by the processes of the mineral surface especially precipitation dissolution adsorption and desorption these processes were controlled by physicochemical parameters such as the ph eh ion composition and mineral type palmer et al 2020 physicochemical parameters were significant for understanding the toxic load behavior resulting from the chemical equilibrium among different reservoir bays alvarez vazquez et al 2017 while the effects of the do and ph on metal concentrations were opposite they had a positive relationship mutually moreover the ph data had a small variation suggesting that the ph had little influence on the variation of the as concentration which was consistent with taka et al 2016 the farmland soil from newly submerged areas was equivalent to the water level fluctuation zone in the danjiangkou reservoir which was influenced by erosion and inundation the soil in submerged areas served as a source and sink for the accumulation and redistribution of heavy metals song et al 2019 wang et al 2015a the ion exchange process of the sediment and the specific substances suspended in the water column might affect the dissolution of heavy metals de melo gurgel et al 2016 the outcome of the sem also showed that the ec r 0 53 p 0 05 and soil r 0 20 p 0 05 had a positive effect on the as concentrations meanwhile the direct effect of the agri became relatively small during the flood discharge period fig 6 a previous study reported that land use located away from the riparian zone especially agriculture regardless of its relative position influenced the water metal concentration in the han river li and zhang 2011 these heavy metals would be accumulated in the soil under the long term use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers ouyang et al 2019 specifically the majority of as containing pesticides and herbicides were sprayed on winter wheat corn and rice farmland and citrus orchards from february to may during the storage period csy 2018 water coupled with sediments reached reservoir bays which indirectly increased the content of heavy metals pekey et al 2004 the proportion of agricultural land directly affected the as concentration and indirectly affected the as concentration through turbidity fig 6 the high variability 61 61 of the farmland area facilitated the largest spatial variability of as which proved that as came from human agricultural activities from another perspective in the northeastern part of the reservoir there are mining activities and a high percentage of farmland therefore the as concentrations in bays were high in the northeast fig 3 and 4 there were small effects on the as concentration in residential areas during the two periods fig 5 and 6 on one hand the proportion of residential areas was relatively small and scattered fig 1 and there was a small population density and little industrial wastewater discharge in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment on the other hand the increase in the residential area caused more sealed surfaces with less interaction between runoff and bare soil which further decreased the amount of as in the tributaries flowing into the bays furthermore hydrodynamic conditions also altered the distribution migration and transformation of as in the reservoir bays the mixing of water between the bays and reservoir affected the as concentration in the reservoir bays however we cannot provide enough information to reflect this mixing effect and further investigations are needed in the future 4 3 implication from the perspective of the heavy metal concentration our research explained and addressed some concerns about water quality safety for dammed reservoirs the concentrations of heavy metals met all standards after five years of reservoir operation although dissolved heavy metals in some reservoir bays are within the standard range they are higher than those in other reservoir bays therefore we need to take some measures to prevent the heavy metal concentration in these bays from exceeding the standard and becoming high risk danjiangkou reservoir is the first level water source protection area in china cage fish culture has been completely banned and a ten year fishing ban has been stipulated the water quality has improved markedly due to the investment in wastewater discharge treatment and the development of pollution control strategies ma et al 2020 china s water pollution prevention and control action plan needs to continue to control heavy metal risks in reservoir bays in addition farmland area has a positive effect on the metal concentration as evidenced by the sem fig 5 improving the utilization rate of fertilizers and reducing the use of high toxicity and residual pesticides in farmland which will weaken the risk of metal diffusion using some methods including phytoremediation rhizofiltration and biosorption will reduce pollutants entering the reservoir bays by setting up riparian buffers in the catchment of reservoir bays moreover for individual bays with high risks of mn as and pb fig 3 table 2 some biophysical techniques such as coagulation active carbon bioremediation ion exchange etc can be applied to the treatment and removal of heavy metals from reservoir bays ul islam 2017 as was effectively fixed by adsorption or co precipitation with metal oxides under high do levels nicomel et al 2015 thus constructing waterfall facilities on tributaries promotes do and reduces the risk of as in water overall the focus of the prevention of heavy metals in reservoir bays is to strengthen source control coordinate management of catchments and apply physiochemical techniques furthermore hydrodynamic characteristics caused by reservoir operation might also affect the process of heavy metal migration in reservoir bays and more detailed information is needed to identify these effects gao et al 2016 in addition water quality information e g the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and dominant ions for the main reservoir waterbody as well as sediment nutrient retention and release need to be obtained to comprehensively determine the impact of dammed reservoir construction on the water environment chassiot et al 2019 in the future the influence of reservoir operations on water quality can be further explored in combination with tracer technology e g stable isotope technology hydrodynamic models remote sensing inversion and other advanced technologies this study will provide a basis for ensuring the safety of the water supply and a practical path for the realization of sdgs 5 conclusion spatiotemporal variations in heavy metal concentrations in reservoir bays were investigated following the operation of the danjiangkou reservoir from 2015 to 2019 under different hydrological regulation we evaluated potential human health hazards and explored the effects of land use soil and physiochemical properties of water on heavy metals by conducting sem all heavy metals were well controlled and the average concentrations met the level recommended by the who and cwqs during the storage and discharge periods the concentrations of heavy metals in reservoir bays decreased from 2015 to 2019 indicating that the water quality improved after the reservoir operated normally the hi values of heavy metals were as pb mn cr cd zn cu ni and non carcinogenic risk of all metals did not exist hi 1 however the cancer potential of as should be concerning because the total carcinogenic risk of as in the flood discharge period exceeded the range of carcinogenic risks the influences of water physicochemical properties and land use on the as concentration in two periods were different the indirect effects further revealed the complex network of underlying processes controlling metal concentrations considering that the reservoir will continue to supply water for many

4791,the interactions between surface water groundwater hyporheic exchange and sediment lithology influence oxidation reduction redox conditions near river aquifer interfaces redox dynamics have implications for subsurface nutrient transformations but are difficult to assess spatially and temporally using traditional geochemical observations this study applied continuous three dimensional monitoring of redox potential in a shallow riparian aquifer to assess the geochemical response to sediment lithology and hydrogeologic variables we mapped a series of cross sectional redox contour plots from throughout the aquifer over a storm event which captured the dynamics of redox conditions during stage driven mixing results show that redox potential increased by over 400 mv at some locations following river water infiltration during the storm while persistent zones of high potential endured along preferential high conductivity flow paths conditions within high conductivity 1 cm s sediments took longer to recover up to 30 days following storms than those within finer low conductivity 6 9 10 5 cm s sediments days to hours however attributed to less organic matter driving nutrient transformations dynamic surface water groundwater interactions intermittently perturb redox conditions but the underlying sediment lithology ultimately governs the spatial and temporal dynamics of aquifer redox conditions these novel observations provide fundamental insights into hyporheic exchange and riparian geochemical dynamics broadly applicable to hydrogeology and biogeochemistry keywords hyporheic redox surface water groundwater interactions geochemistry groundwater 1 introduction groundwater quality and the associated geochemical state of subsurface systems are becoming increasingly important as global population expands land use changes and contaminants of emerging concern become more ecologically abundant a number of physical chemical and biological processes affect the evolution of aquifer geochemistry see review papers by hubbard et al 2018 li et al 2017 summarizing these coupled and complex processes but perhaps most important are the spatial distributions of hydraulic conductivity k and organic matter related to sediment heterogeneity as hydraulically connected high k facies three dimensional 3d bodies of sediment e g soltanian and ritzi 2014 liu et al 2020 act as preferential pathways for groundwater flow and nutrient transport under varying flow regimes driven by the local hydraulic gradient sediment organic matter fuels transformative microbial reactions e g duff and triska 1990 wallace et al 2020a as a result discrete biogeochemical hot spots i e zones of enhanced reaction rates may develop throughout the subsurface where conditions favor nutrient transformations krause et al 2017 mcclain et al 2003 most often these conditions reflect a balance between nutrient availability flow path residence times and reaction rates bardini et al 2012 marzadri et al 2012 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020b in aquifers adjacent to rivers surface water groundwater hyporheic exchange drives the flux of water and solutes across the sediment water interface and through the subsurface as channel water from rivers and streams is diverted along deeper hyporheic flow paths and into the adjacent riparian aquifer it mixes with groundwater and is exposed to geochemically and microbially active sediment surfaces where nutrient transformations may take place boano et al 2010 cardenas et al 2015 harvey et al 2013 xu et al 2017 the hyporheic zone thus serves as an important transition zone for lotic system function where biogeochemical activity can be locally elevated due in part to surface water groundwater mixing due to the high spatial and temporal variability of subsurface flow and solute transport patterns a fundamental understanding of aquifer geochemical dynamics requires high resolution information about chemical fluxes and the associated groundwater chemistry conventional methods e g core drilling groundwater sampling provide insight about discrete locations within the aquifer e g harms and grimm 2008 peterjohn and correll 1984 but the difficulty of collecting such samples at high spatial or temporal resolution and the related costs can inhibit observations of dynamic reaction rates and chemical fluxes alternatively oxidation reduction redox potential can be continuously monitored using relatively inexpensive in situ sensors redox potential eh indicates the energetic favorability of a given reaction and has been used to describe the potential for degradation of anthropogenic contaminants in aquifers lensing et al 1994 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 wallace et al 2018 when monitored

but heretofore has only been sparsely monitored in one or two dimensions further only a handful of studies have focused on redox monitoring during hyporheic mixing e g briggs et al 2015 sawyer et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 which limits its utility for understanding the controlling influence of sediment heterogeneity and its spatial variability on geochemical dynamics during hyporheic exchange the main objective of this study is to demonstrate the capability of fully continuous 3d redox data for the first time to quantitatively assess aquifer redox response to static i e sediment heterogeneity and dynamic e g storms seasons forcings the study site described in detail below was specifically instrumented to improve predictive understandings of riparian aquifer dynamics and response to perturbations and the aquifer is representative of other heterogeneous environments in the surface and near surface environment termed the critical zone results could thus be helpful to other studies

2005 the novel aspects of this study are as follows 1 it is conducted at high spatial and temporal resolution in three dimensions across a relatively large spatial scale hundreds of meters in scale and 2 it provides fundamental insights into the distribution size and persistence of high and low eh zones as well as their expansion and contraction during and after hydrologic perturbations further fundamental insights developed through this study should be widely transferrable because it is conducted in a buried valley aquifer representing aquifers widespread across north america 2 study site the study site 39 23755 n 84 71252 w is part of the theis environmental monitoring and modeling site temms located along a section of the great miami river near cincinnati ohio usa roughly 20 km northwest of downtown cincinnati fig 1 the great miami river is 150 m wide and 1 5 m deep at the study site and flow averages 110 m3 s 1 the channel is generally incised and contains gravelly compound and point bars which represent a larger scale of sedimentary architecture within which planar and trough cross bedded sand and gravel are common ritzi et al 2002 the river at the study site is generally losing and regional groundwater flow through the aquifer is away from the river the study aquifer extends roughly 100 m into the southern bank of the great miami river approximately 28 km upstream of its confluence with the ohio river the depth to bedrock averages 33 m and the average water table depth is 5 m below the land surface watkins and spieker 1971 aquifer transmissivity is estimated between 1200 and 3700 m2 d 1 with storativity of 0 2 spieker 1968 sediment lithology at the temms is quite complex consisting primarily of poorly sorted subrounded sediments ranging from cobbles to medium sand with interbedded open framework gravel ofg facies overlain by 1 m thick organic rich silt and clay deposits wallace and soltanian 2021 the three dominant facies types at the site are fine grained silt and clay coarse sand and gravel 3 methods 3 1 hydrologic and geochemical monitoring a series of observation wells were installed in 2017 to monitor groundwater levels and basic water quality parameters fig 1 wells were installed at three locations and were constructed of 11 5 cm o d pvc with 3 m screens all wells were sealed with granular bentonite and positioned in waterproof concrete pads to prevent preferential flowpaths related to installation multiparameter sensors ysi 600ls deployed inside each well monitor hydraulic head temperature and specific conductance at 15 min intervals a central pylon houses a weather station weatherflow sky to collect data on ambient atmospheric conditions and a telecommunications link that transmits data from the site every 15 min river stage is monitored at a nearby usgs gauge 03274615 located roughly 3 km downstream of the study site measurements were extracted to correspond to the on site data collection period described below over 90 m of continuous cores 30 m at each of three locations were collected from the site during well installation to determine sediment properties and constrain floodplain sediment heterogeneity wallace and soltanian 2021 visually described the cores for mineral composition color and grain size at 5 cm resolution based on visual descriptions they analyzed grain size for 10 representative samples from each core 30 samples total within the range of 0 037 8 mm using a gilson ss 15 sieve shaker all of the samples but one had sediments 8 mm which were further classified to grains sized less than 80 mm redox probes were installed throughout the riparian floodplain on a roughly 10 m grid to capture redox variations influenced by sediment heterogeneity and a range of water table fluctuations fig 1 final probe locations were subject to accessibility i e trees foliage and local sediment properties i e coarse gravel preventing installation each of the 23 probes consisted of a 150 cm fiberglass epoxy tube embedded with an array of 4 platinum electrodes spaced 45 cm apart paleo terra amsterdam netherlands platinum electrode redox probes do not require calibration and have been successfully used in variably saturated systems to describe hydrogeochemical changes in the near stream environment e g sawyer et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 all probes were connected to one of two ag agcl reference electrodes installed below the water table in wells p2 and p3 to minimize agitation of the soil layer we augured to varying depths at each location and then manually inserted the probes an additional 150 cm into undisturbed sediments and backfilled with soil all sensors were connected to cr800 control modules and am416 multiplexers campbell scientific logan ut and programmed to collect readings every 15 min all parameters i e eh water table elevation temperature specific conductance were monitored continuously from january 29 2020 through july 15 2020 3 2 aquifer scale redox interpolation the spatial distribution of eh throughout the aquifer was calculated using radial basis function interpolation of the redox point measurements 1 7 mv accuracy which has been shown to provide high order accurate interpolants of large datasets schaback 1995 a series of unique functions ϕi each of which possess radial symmetry about one of the sample points were developed for point readings obtained from the redox probes a continuous function f which represents the sum of the individual functions was then employed to approximate values between the sample points 1 f x y z i 1 n c i e ε r 2 where ci is a fitting coefficient applied to the inverse multiquadratic function ϕi n is the number of observed points and ε is a shape parameter coefficients are determined by constraining f to match samples values at the sensor locations the distance from the central point of each function r is defined as 2 r x i x j 2 y i y j 2 z i z j 2 where xi yi zi denotes the center of the function i e the sample point and xj yj zj denotes a field point vertical anisotropy often associated with buried valley sediment stratigraphy was incorporated by scaling z coordinates by a factor of 0 1 which accounted for the difference between points in the vertical direction when computing r the resulting interpolation is often spectrally accurate and stable for large numbers of data points buhmann and dyn 1993 based on our field installation 92 individual redox readings were collected at each time point redox data were interpolated to a grid 51 m long 68 m wide and 3 75 m deep to represent our study portion of the shallow floodplain aquifer with the top boundary elevation corresponding to the floodplain topography the grid was uniformly discretized with 0 15 m horizontal and vertical resolution 3 85 106 grid cells the performance of radial basis function interpolation is often dependent on both the type of radial basis functions employed and the associated value of ε for those functions rippa 1999 not only should the function suit the application for spatial interpolation but ε should be optimized for the dataset to increase accuracy while maintaining numerical stability here we employ the inverse multiquadratic imq radial basis function rhs of eq 1 which has a high order rate of convergence and has been shown to perform well in groundwater modeling applications e g amaziane et al 2004 li et al 2003 yao et al 2016 the optimal shape parameter for imq functions generally depends on the density and distribution of the observed points and the interpolated function values at the points fasshauer and zhang 2007 huang et al 2007 we optimized ε by minimizing the root mean squared error rmse of the interpolated dataset relative to the observed redox point measurements fig s1 using ε 0 03 the error was reduced to 1 7 mv less than 0 2 of our range of redox observations 3 3 time series analysis the continuous wavelet transform cwt was used to characterize the frequency content of time series data and to resolve temporal variations in energy at a given frequency related to hydrologic events further the correlation between cwt signals can be used to identify relationships between different time series and provide information about relative signal lag the morlet wavelet was used for the cwt because it is well localized in space and time and is thus appropriate for feature extraction farge 1992 grinsted et al 2004 3 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where ω0 is dimensionless frequency ω0 6 and η is dimensionless time the cwt of a time series x t with uniform time steps is then defined as 4 w x ψ τ s x t 1 s ψ t τ s d t where s is the scale of the transformed time series wx ψ τ s at position τ in the time domain and ψ is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function edge effects cause errors at the beginning and end of the wavelet power spectrum as indicated by the shaded regions in cwt images wavelet analysis reveals when particular frequencies in a time series are stronger or weaker and can be used to resolve the effects of hydrologic perturbations across temporal scales e g wallace et al 2018 for example if a storm affects redox conditions over one week the cwt plot shows higher power at the one week frequency during that time following cwt analysis of the hydrologic and redox time series cross spectrum analyses i e comparison between the cwt of two signals of redox with stage and precipitation were used to identify variability within the floodplain the coherence between cwt signals is a measure of their time varying correlation and can be conceptualized as a localized correlation coefficient in time frequency space the wavelet coherence of two time series x and y is defined as torrence and webster 1999 5 r n 2 s s s 1 w xy τ s 2 s s 1 w x τ s 2 s s 1 w y τ s 2 where w i s is the wavelet transform of time series i and s is a smoothing operator represented here by a weighted running average in both the time and scale directions the interested reader is referred to torrence and webster 1999 and grinsted et al 2004 for more details about computing the wavelet coherence the coherence varies between 0 and 1 with higher values indicating when the two signals are more strongly correlated and phase arrows in correlated regions are used to compute the relative lag time between the two signals zhang et al 2019 for example high wavelet correlation between river stage and the redox signal during a storm event would result in high coherence over periods of days to weeks depending on the size of the storm shifts in the dominant period s over which there is high coherence can also indicate fluctuations across different timescales and can reveal when the signal is influenced by more than one hydrologic variable i e stage and precipitation the lag time δt between the signals is calculated as 6 δ t φ 360 f where φ is the phase angle in degrees and f is the signal frequency y axis on cross spectrum plots phase arrows on the cross spectrum plots point to the right φ 0 when the two signals are in phase and to the left φ 180 when the two signals are out of phase to ensure robust analyses signal lag was only evaluated when wavelet coherence was 0 85 here we focus the analyses on redox measurements taken within two predominantly high eh eh 700 mv and low eh eh 300 mv regions of the aquifer these definitions of high and low eh were based on typical redox zonation in groundwater where potentials above 700 mv correspond to aerobic conditions and potentials below 300 mv represent moderately reducing conditions e g klüpfel et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 though the redox response within such regions will vary spatially and temporally across the floodplain depending upon the adjacent heterogeneity structure and proximity to the river these analyses provide insight into how the relative influence of each hydrologic parameter varies with sediment heterogeneity 4 results and interpretation 4 1 geohydrologic measurements stage changes propagated through the aquifer within a matter of hours and average amplitudes of water table fluctuations were 59 5 64 8 and 45 1 of the river stage amplitude at locations p1 p2 and p3 respectively fig 2 sediment core analyses reflect prior reports of interbedded sand and gravel facies overlain by low k silts and clays fig 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments estimated using hazen s equation hazen 1892 varied by orders of magnitude increasing from 6 9 10 5 cm s in the overlying silt facies to 0 16 cm s in sand dominated facies to just over 1 cm s in sandy gravel facies fig 3 grain size analysis was not performed on ofg sediments because some cobbles exceeded 150 mm in diameter and the distribution curve would not have been well constrained however previous work to determine the k of ofg facies measured values as high as 4 cm s e g ferriera et al 2010 based on darcy s law the instantaneous flow rate between the river and groundwater ranged from 4 22 to 1 70 m d in general pore water velocities were greater through the shallow aquifer where the hydraulic gradient was steeper across the bank seepage face though near the riverbank i e at locations p1 and p2 the volumes of water infiltrating and exfiltrating were approximately equal further into the aquifer at location p3 only about 27 of the total darcy flux during the study period was towards the river the immediate aquifer response to stage changes likely indicates preferential flow along connected high k facies specific conductance measurements in wells revealed that during high stage or flood events surface water penetrated as far as 100 m laterally into the aquifer for example during a significant flood event that occurred from march 19 23 2020 specific conductance values in wells p1 35 m from the stream bank and p3 100 m from the stream bank both dropped by over 50 in less than 1 h concurrent with a 49 drop in groundwater temperature suggesting rapid infiltration of relatively fresh surface water along connected groundwater flowpaths fig 4 the water table profiles at both locations also showed very similar responses to the increase in river stage indicating a high degree of hydraulic connectivity across the aquifer likely caused by spatially connected high k facies e g gravel ofg fig 3 4 2 redox potential and redox dynamics continuous redox measurements reflect the implicit findings of the basic hydrologic measurements we first quantified the contributions of changing water temperature on redox measurements groundwater temperatures fluctuated between 8 6 and 17 7 c at location p2 and between 6 7 and 13 8 c at location p3 where reference electrodes were installed the effects of changing temperature on the groundwater redox state were calculated following sawyer et al 1995 7 c 199 1 01 t 25 where t is the temperature of the groundwater and c is the potential correction used to adjust the raw measured redox potential at each electrode the temperatures observed near the river at location p2 available in the metadata were more variable coefficient of variation cv 0 27 c over the study period than those further inland at location p3 cv 0 18 c suggesting enhanced hyporheic mixing near the river bank redox potentials have not been corrected for ph redox measurements can also be affected by the saturation state of the aquifer e g jennings 2007 smith and van huyssteen 2011 but water table measurements in this study and previous studies at the temms e g wallace and soltanian 2021 indicate rapid head changes which propagate throughout the aquifer in a matter of hours thus because our redox electrodes are all positioned at nearly the same elevation and within the same soil horizons we interpret eh changes equally at all locations the time series of redox potentials captures the dynamics of hyporheic mixing revealing how infiltrating surface water influences subsurface redox conditions generally eh values throughout the aquifer increased immediately following stage rise corresponding with changes in water table elevation that indicate surface water infiltration some centrally located probes e g probes 12 and 13 showed a higher degree of variability however with conditions fluctuating by up to 16 during storms data available in the metadata these changes are associated with electrodes positioned within highly conductive facies that quickly convey infiltrating river water transects of the subsurface redox potential two roughly parallel aa and bb and two roughly perpendicular cc and dd to the direction of river flow clearly show variation in redox conditions redox conditions varied spatially throughout the study period here we focus our analysis around a major storm event that occurred from march 18 21 2020 as an example of a hydrologic perturbation that induced a significant aquifer redox response fig 5 the first set of contour plots are from march 17 roughly one day before the onset of heavy precipitation the fourth set of contour plots are from march 21 when the stage was at its peak the remaining sets of contour plots show the redox profiles on the rising times 2 and 3 and falling times 5 6 and 7 limbs of the hydrograph the contour plots show increasing eh throughout the aquifer as stage increased and river water infiltrated associated with preferential flow pathways formed by hydraulically connected high k facies types as indicated by fig 4 a deep high eh zone on the west side of transect aa expanded vertically and horizontally with the dynamic river stage while shallow and deep high eh zones became vertically connected near the center of transect cc the extent of these high eh zones increased through contour plots 1 4 and contracted afterward within a few hours of the maximum stage the total volume of high eh sediments within the aquifer increased by almost 300 from 130 m3 to 383 m3 fig 6 comparing the redox contour plots also shows notable changes in the extent of low eh conditions fig 5 as river stage increased between times 1 4 eh decreased significantly on the west side of transect bb even as a large high eh zone developed towards the center of the transect simultaneously eh decreased farther from the river at roughly the same depth 2 m on the south sides of both transects cc and dd perpendicular to the direction of river flow this suggests that infiltrating river water also displaces relatively low eh groundwater and drives redox changes further inland but further field investigations are needed to substantiate this idea such dynamic low eh conditions occurred only near dynamic high eh regions however while other low eh regions persisted throughout the aquifer even during the hydrologic perturbation fig 6 4 3 redox zonation related to lithology the redox contour plots show that consistently high eh conditions 700 mv persisted throughout the study period within two distinct regions of the aquifer a large region near the center roughly 1 m below the ground near the intersection of bb and dd termed zone 1 and a smaller region on the western side located roughly 2 5 m below the ground seen near the center of transect cc termed zone 2 fig 5 though both show consistently high eh conditions their size and shape evolved independently through time and they responded differently to changes in stage and precipitation fig 6 sediment cores from locations p1 and p3 fig 3 combined with ongoing field observations i e fig 4 indicate the presence of high k and gravel dominated facies in the shallow aquifer and cross comparison with these redox trends suggests that these facies bisect the aquifer at these locations bivariate correlation analyses i e the linear correlation between variables wherein a value of 1 shows total positive correlation and 0 no correlation reveal that while both regions were influenced by stage fluctuations ρ 0 69 and 0 59 for zones 1 and 2 respectively precipitation moderately influenced zone 1 but not zone 2 ρ 0 19 and 0 07 respectively the p values for all analyses were 0 001 this trend was observed throughout the monitoring period stage primarily drove elevated eh conditions with negligible influence of precipitation except during major storm events which resulted in site flooding the distribution of observed changes in redox potential calculated over the study period highlights areas of increased microbial activity and dynamic fluid mixing the range of redox fluctuations was calculated as the difference between the absolute maximum and minimum eh potential at each point in space over the entire study period fig 7 redox potential fluctuated throughout the aquifer with the locations of greatest change often co located with persistent high eh zones 1 and 2 for example the most dynamic conditions were located in a shallow zone near the intersection of transects bb and dd which also represents the persistent shallow high eh zone discussed above co location of dynamic yet persistent high eh conditions suggests preferential flow paths of higher k and gravel dominated facies types this region was underlain by a broad area where changes in redox potential were small or noticeably absent however which corresponds to the deeper narrow high eh zone seen along transect dd fig 5 this is also interpreted as a preferential flow path and may even represent a gravel dominated cross strata e g ofg such facies often exhibit unimodal grain size distributions d50 2 mm with high k due to a lack of sediment blocking pore spaces between gravel grains ferreira et al 2010 lunt and bridge 2004 not only does this create rapid and localized dispersion of solutes through the aquifer but the relative absence of fine organic rich sediments may limit the sustained supply of doc thereby reducing microbial reaction rates e g hunter et al 1998 and limiting reaction extents as doc sourced from infiltrated river water is rapidly consumed wallace et al 2020b further the reduced surface area of large grained high k sediments relative to fine grained sediments limits the contact time between nutrients and bioreactive surfaces further reducing the potential for nutrient transformation as a result high eh conditions persisted with little change in the redox state caused by microbial activity redox conditions were also highly dynamic in the shallow aquifer near the stream bank along transect dd figs 5 7 where redox potential fluctuated by roughly 200 mv 21 8 of the total observed range in eh across the floodplain this represents a transition zone where river water and groundwater mix other regions with nominal redox fluctuation and consistently low eh are interpreted as mostly hosting anoxic groundwater with little to no mixing fig 6 redox data from probes immediately adjacent to wells i e p1 p2 p3 were compared with core data at each location to further evaluate the influence of sediment lithology on redox dynamics fig 7c the mean facies length of high k sand or gravel facies in buried valley aquifers is on the order of meters with a coefficient of variation in length of 1 m e g ritzi et al 2002 dai et al 2004 thus the lithology observed in cores from p1 p2 and p3 should be representative of the sediment structure associated with redox data collected at probes 21 2 3 m from p1 23 4 1 m from p2 and 3 2 7 m from p3 in general redox potential fluctuated most within or near the transition to high k facies fig 7c at p1 redox potential fluctuated by nearly 100 mv over the study period at roughly 1 m depth corresponding with a 10 cm interval of gravel interbedded between silt facies similarly a dynamic region roughly 1 5 m deep at p2 is correlated with a 50 cm thick gravel facies location p3 also showed some variability despite its distance from the channel with redox potential fluctuations of up to 60 mv located near the transitions between low k and high k facies 4 4 temporal dynamics cross wavelet analysis shows that river stage had the greatest influence on redox conditions throughout the aquifer during storm events but its influence was tempered in low eh regions located within lower k sediments fig 8 the first sizeable storm event on march 18 raised the water table 5 8 m and flooded the site which considerably changed the aquifer redox state figs 4 5 a subsequent storm on may 18 raised the water table 5 4 m and also flooded the site but induced a smaller redox response which indicates the absence of preferential vertical infiltration from the overlying flood waters into the shallow aquifer which may alter the geochemistry in general eh conditions showed a strong response i e high coherence to significant stage changes caused by storm events redox conditions responded differently in low and high eh regions of the aquifer however at sensor 4 consistently low eh conditions located in the low eh zone in fig 6 µ 267 50 mv showed minimal response to stage changes including the flood event in march over short time periods and phase arrows indicate that redox lagged stage by 24 days over longer periods fig 8c at sensor 14 located just 26 m away eh was consistently high located within zone 2 µ 682 40 mv and showed a strong response to stage fluctuations with redox conditions responding to stage changes in roughly 12 h fig 8a though precipitation did not consistently influence either signal during the large storm event in march redox conditions at sensor 14 lagged the precipitation signal by 3 4 days over a period of 8 days fig 8b precipitation negligibly influenced redox conditions in the low eh region at sensor 4 over the monitoring period fig 8d high wavelet coherence over short periods 0 125 days on the precipitation plots for both zones is likely associated with the spurious correlation of noise characteristic of climatic signals e g maraun and kurths 2004 while high coherence on all plots over periods 32 days often associated with seasonal changes must be interpreted with caution given the length of our datasets our cross wavelet analyses highlight the significance of interpreting redox variations through the lens of frequency content because they reveal the influence of hydrologic perturbations which is often concealed by general time series analyses i e fig 4 for example despite the consistently low eh at sensor 4 the potential still fluctuated by up to 75 mv throughout the study period cross wavelet analysis of these data showed that these changes did not occur on the same time scale as changes in stage or precipitation as would be expected along connected high k pathways however and so conditions were relatively unperturbed by such hydrologic forcings 5 discussion subsurface redox conditions are influenced by an assemblage of hydrologic and lithologic variables including stage fluctuations precipitation and sediment heterogeneity our results reveal that while redox conditions are intermittently perturbed by temporally variable environmental changes i e storm surge the underlying sediment heterogeneity ultimately governs the formation and persistence of high and low eh zones given that fine sediments i e clays silts typically have a higher organic matter content than their high k counterparts i e sandy gravel and ofg reaction hotspots are more likely to form within such impermeable facies than along preferential flow pathways newcomer et al 2018 our high resolution observations of subsurface redox zonation likely represent an end member example given the complex sediment heterogeneity inherent to glacial aquifers but similar redox patterns have been observed in other heterogeneous coastal e g seybold et al 2002 wallace et al 2018 and non coastal e g king et al 2019 environments the geochemical state of subsurface systems and the associated efficiency of subsurface nutrient cycling are thus tied to sediment lithology and their complexity is not well represented by two dimensional monitoring despite the vast growth in observational data documenting riparian processes many observations represent discrete measurements which are difficult to interpret through time also these observations are not usually made during storm events hydrologic perturbations this represents a deficiency for vulnerable regions where continuous monitoring could elucidate controls on groundwater quality especially those related to large research community networks such as the critical zone observatories usgs hydrologic benchmark network and the great lake ecological observatory network the utility of continuous 3d redox monitoring for assessing hydrology driven aquifer dynamics thus stems from a lack of understanding about how biogeochemical conditions vary spatially and temporally here across the floodplain eh consistently showed greater fluctuations along high k facies and a dampened response to hydrologic perturbations within low k facies figs 5 6 7 though the glacial aquifer in this study is highly heterogeneous with extremely high k due to the presence of gravel dominated facies types such as ofg redox zonation and eh variability are observed to follow similar trends in other systems with lower contrasts in k and less hydraulic connectivity e g wallace et al 2018 coupling redox monitoring with the extensive observational infrastructure available at many sites e g carnevali et al 2020 dwivedi et al 2018b would help characterize spatial variability and significantly improve predictive understandings of biogeochemical processes and their response to perturbations hydrodynamics such as stage fluctuations exerted an important control on subsurface redox conditions and the duration and lag time of perturbations revealed the interplay between transport and kinetic reaction controls on the geochemistry in high k high eh regions of the aquifer redox conditions responded quickly to changes in river stage similar to observations within other heterogeneous aquifers e g lahiri and davidson 2020 su et al 2018 though water and nutrients were delivered efficiently along high k flowpaths the absence of fine organic rich sediments likely inhibited microbial respiration and nutrient transformation as a result it took longer on the order of weeks for equilibrium to be reestablished fig 8 further rapid temperature fluctuations associated with river water infiltration would presumably play an important role in nutrient transformation as reaction kinetics and redox conditions adjusted accordingly massmann et al 2006 munz et al 2019 seybold et al 2002 conversely low eh conditions showed a delayed response to changes in river stage as local low k and high organic matter sediments in our case silt clay and silty sand created barriers to flow and nutrient delivery however because the high organic carbon content of the sediments bolstered respiration rates the redox signal typically recovered within a matter of days these findings are consistent with other studies discussing the importance of lithology on subsurface redox conditions e g king et al 2019 sawyer et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 but our results further demonstrate and quantify the importance of small scale spatial differences in geochemistry caused by local changes in sediment properties when coupled with chemical data these analyses may also help constrain reaction kinetics and reveal implications for groundwater nutrient and contaminant remediation and transformation especially during dynamic hydrologic perturbations that bolster flow and solute delivery throughout the subsurface the dynamics of subsurface redox zonation indicate where and when conditions are most favorable for redox driven solute transformations but information about the groundwater chemistry is needed for further assessment our goal to assess the lithologic and hydrologic controls on subsurface redox conditions did not require analysis of groundwater chemistry but such data in combination with redox monitoring represents a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying reaction specific biogeochemical hotspots future work at the temms will therefore involve not only spatially distributed groundwater sampling but 16s rrna gene sequencing and quantification of sediment organic matter content to evaluate subsurface nutrient cycling and contaminant transformation a few other techniques allow for assessment of geochemical conditions related to sediment lithology an increasingly popular approach is the use of time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip which have been applied both in coastal and non coastal environments e g cardenas and markowski 2010 kessouri et al 2019 ntarlagiannis et al 2005 nyquist et al 2008 however such geophysical methods are often costly and their accuracy depends strongly on the inversion method used to process the data further their efficacy may be limited depending on the specific degradation processes involved which could underestimate the degree of subsurface redox shifts we presented only an example application of 3d in situ redox monitoring but this technique can be used to spatially assess subsurface redox conditions across a broad range of timescales not only are the sensors relatively inexpensive and straightforward to use mcmahon and chapelle 2008 but platinum redox electrodes are rather durable often functioning reliably for long periods in both oxic and anoxic conditions shoemaker et al 2013 swerhone et al 1999 6 conclusions we have shown that redox conditions in floodplain sediments are strongly perturbed by dynamic stage driven mixing events that intensify hyporheic exchange and solute transport but the influence of such hydrologic perturbations is ultimately controlled by the underlying sediment lithology redox conditions are highly dynamic along high k facies which act as preferential flowpaths during river water infiltration while low k facies temper redox dynamics by limiting flow and the exchange of complimentary solutes redox monitoring allows for geochemical investigation when consistent sampling is difficult or where sites are inaccessible during large storms and the regular sampling interval permits frequency analysis to parse out the relative influence of storms or other hydrologic forcings by providing a continuous and time lapse record of subsurface conditions 3d in situ redox measurements can be used to understand the control of sediment heterogeneity on the reactive transport of redox sensitive solutes in hydrodynamic environments credit authorship contribution statement corey d wallace conceptualization methodology data

4791,the interactions between surface water groundwater hyporheic exchange and sediment lithology influence oxidation reduction redox conditions near river aquifer interfaces redox dynamics have implications for subsurface nutrient transformations but are difficult to assess spatially and temporally using traditional geochemical observations this study applied continuous three dimensional monitoring of redox potential in a shallow riparian aquifer to assess the geochemical response to sediment lithology and hydrogeologic variables we mapped a series of cross sectional redox contour plots from throughout the aquifer over a storm event which captured the dynamics of redox conditions during stage driven mixing results show that redox potential increased by over 400 mv at some locations following river water infiltration during the storm while persistent zones of high potential endured along preferential high conductivity flow paths conditions within high conductivity 1 cm s sediments took longer to recover up to 30 days following storms than those within finer low conductivity 6 9 10 5 cm s sediments days to hours however attributed to less organic matter driving nutrient transformations dynamic surface water groundwater interactions intermittently perturb redox conditions but the underlying sediment lithology ultimately governs the spatial and temporal dynamics of aquifer redox conditions these novel observations provide fundamental insights into hyporheic exchange and riparian geochemical dynamics broadly applicable to hydrogeology and biogeochemistry keywords hyporheic redox surface water groundwater interactions geochemistry groundwater 1 introduction groundwater quality and the associated geochemical state of subsurface systems are becoming increasingly important as global population expands land use changes and contaminants of emerging concern become more ecologically abundant a number of physical chemical and biological processes affect the evolution of aquifer geochemistry see review papers by hubbard et al 2018 li et al 2017 summarizing these coupled and complex processes but perhaps most important are the spatial distributions of hydraulic conductivity k and organic matter related to sediment heterogeneity as hydraulically connected high k facies three dimensional 3d bodies of sediment e g soltanian and ritzi

transformative microbial reactions e g duff and triska 1990 wallace et al 2020a as a result discrete biogeochemical hot spots i e zones of enhanced reaction rates may develop throughout the subsurface where conditions favor nutrient transformations krause et al 2017 mcclain et al 2003 most often these conditions reflect a balance between nutrient availability flow path residence times and reaction rates bardini et al 2012 marzadri et al 2012 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020b in aquifers adjacent to rivers surface water groundwater hyporheic exchange drives the flux of water and solutes across the sediment water interface and through the subsurface as channel water from rivers and streams is diverted along deeper hyporheic flow paths and into the adjacent riparian aquifer it mixes with groundwater and is exposed to geochemically and microbially active sediment surfaces where nutrient transformations may take place boano et al 2010 cardenas et al 2015 harvey et al 2013 xu et al 2017 the hyporheic zone thus serves as an important transition zone for lotic system function where biogeochemical activity can be locally elevated due in part to surface water groundwater mixing due to the high spatial and temporal variability of subsurface flow and solute transport patterns a fundamental understanding of aquifer geochemical dynamics requires high resolution information about chemical fluxes and the associated groundwater chemistry conventional methods e g core drilling groundwater sampling provide insight about discrete locations within the aquifer e g harms and grimm 2008 peterjohn and correll 1984 but the difficulty of collecting such samples at high spatial or temporal resolution and the related costs can inhibit observations of dynamic reaction rates and

2014 wallace et al 2018 which limits its utility for understanding the controlling influence of sediment heterogeneity and its spatial variability on geochemical dynamics during hyporheic exchange the main objective of this study is to demonstrate the capability of fully continuous 3d redox data for the first time to quantitatively assess aquifer redox response to static i e sediment heterogeneity and dynamic e g storms seasons forcings the study site described in detail below was specifically instrumented to improve predictive understandings of riparian aquifer dynamics and response to perturbations and the aquifer is representative of other heterogeneous environments in the surface and near surface environment termed the critical zone results could thus be helpful to other studies

2005 the novel aspects of this study are as follows 1 it is conducted at high spatial and temporal resolution in three dimensions across a relatively large spatial scale hundreds of meters in scale and 2 it provides fundamental insights into the distribution size and persistence of high and low eh zones as well as their expansion and contraction during and after hydrologic perturbations further fundamental insights developed through this study should be widely transferrable because it is conducted in a buried valley aquifer representing aquifers widespread across north america 2 study site the study site 39 23755 n 84 71252 w is part of the theis environmental monitoring and modeling site temms located along a section of the great miami river near cincinnati ohio usa roughly 20 km northwest of downtown cincinnati fig 1 the great miami river is 150 m wide and 1 5 m deep at the study site and flow averages 110 m3 s 1 the channel is generally incised and contains gravelly compound and point bars which represent a larger scale of sedimentary architecture within which planar and trough cross bedded sand and gravel are common ritzi et al 2002 the river at the study site is generally losing and regional groundwater flow through the aquifer is away from the river the study aquifer extends roughly 100 m into the southern bank of the great miami river approximately 28 km upstream of its confluence with the ohio river the depth to bedrock averages 33 m and the average water table depth is 5 m below the land surface watkins and spieker 1971 aquifer transmissivity is estimated between 1200 and 3700 m2 d 1 with storativity of 0 2 spieker 1968 sediment lithology at the temms is quite complex consisting primarily of poorly sorted subrounded sediments ranging from cobbles to medium sand with interbedded open framework gravel ofg facies overlain by 1 m thick organic rich silt and clay deposits wallace and soltanian 2021 the three dominant facies types at the site are fine grained silt and clay coarse sand and gravel 3 methods 3 1 hydrologic and geochemical monitoring a series of observation wells were installed in 2017 to monitor groundwater levels and basic water quality parameters fig 1 wells were installed at three locations and were constructed of 11 5 cm o d pvc with 3 m screens all wells were sealed with granular bentonite and positioned in waterproof concrete pads to prevent preferential flowpaths related to installation multiparameter sensors ysi 600ls deployed inside each well monitor hydraulic head temperature and specific conductance at 15 min intervals a central pylon houses a weather station weatherflow sky to collect data on ambient atmospheric conditions and a telecommunications link that transmits data from the site every 15 min river stage is monitored at a nearby usgs gauge 03274615 located roughly 3 km downstream of the study site measurements were extracted to correspond to the on site data collection period described below over 90 m of continuous cores 30 m at each of three locations were collected from the site during well installation to determine sediment properties and constrain floodplain sediment heterogeneity wallace and soltanian 2021 visually described the cores for mineral composition color and grain size at 5 cm resolution based on visual descriptions they analyzed grain size for 10 representative samples from each core 30 samples total within the range of 0 037 8 mm using a gilson ss 15 sieve shaker all of the samples but one had sediments 8 mm which were further classified to grains sized less than 80 mm redox probes were installed throughout the riparian floodplain on a roughly 10 m grid to capture redox variations influenced by sediment heterogeneity and a range of water table fluctuations fig 1 final probe locations were subject to accessibility i e trees foliage and local sediment properties i e coarse gravel preventing installation each of the 23 probes consisted of a 150 cm fiberglass epoxy tube embedded with an array of 4 platinum electrodes spaced 45 cm apart paleo terra amsterdam netherlands platinum electrode redox probes do not require calibration and have been successfully used in variably saturated systems to describe hydrogeochemical changes in the near stream environment e g sawyer et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 all probes were connected to one of two ag agcl reference electrodes installed below the water table in wells p2 and p3 to minimize agitation of the soil layer we augured to varying depths at each location and then manually inserted the probes an additional 150 cm into undisturbed sediments and backfilled with soil all sensors were connected to cr800 control modules and am416 multiplexers campbell scientific logan ut and programmed to collect readings every 15 min all parameters i e eh water table elevation temperature specific conductance were monitored continuously from january 29 2020 through july 15 2020 3 2 aquifer scale redox interpolation the spatial distribution of eh throughout the aquifer was calculated using radial basis function interpolation of the redox point measurements 1 7 mv accuracy which has been shown to provide high order accurate interpolants of large datasets schaback 1995 a series of unique functions ϕi each of which possess radial symmetry about one of the sample points were developed for point readings obtained from the redox probes a continuous function f which represents the sum of the individual functions was then employed to approximate values between the sample points 1 f x y z i 1 n c i e ε r 2 where ci is a fitting coefficient applied to the inverse multiquadratic function ϕi n is the number of observed points and ε is a shape parameter coefficients are determined by constraining f to match samples values at the sensor locations the distance from the central point of each function r is defined as 2 r x i x j 2 y i y j 2 z i z j 2 where xi yi zi denotes the center of the function i e the sample point and xj yj zj denotes a field point vertical anisotropy often associated with buried valley sediment stratigraphy was incorporated by scaling z coordinates by a factor of 0 1 which accounted for the difference between points in the vertical direction when computing r the resulting interpolation is often spectrally accurate and stable for large numbers of data points buhmann and dyn 1993 based on our field installation 92 individual redox readings were collected at each time point redox data were interpolated to a grid 51 m long 68 m wide and 3 75 m deep to represent our study portion of the shallow floodplain aquifer with the top boundary elevation corresponding to the floodplain topography the grid was uniformly discretized with 0 15 m horizontal and vertical resolution 3 85 106 grid cells the performance of radial basis function interpolation is often dependent on both the type of radial basis functions employed and the associated value of ε for those functions rippa 1999 not only should the function suit the application for spatial interpolation but ε should be optimized for the dataset to increase accuracy while maintaining numerical stability here we employ the inverse multiquadratic imq radial basis function rhs of eq 1 which has a high order rate of convergence and has been shown to perform well in groundwater modeling applications e g amaziane et al 2004 li et al 2003 yao et al 2016 the optimal shape parameter for imq functions generally depends on the density and distribution of the observed points and the interpolated function values at the points fasshauer and zhang 2007 huang et al 2007 we optimized ε by minimizing the root mean squared error rmse of the interpolated dataset relative to the observed redox point measurements fig s1 using ε 0 03 the error was reduced to 1 7 mv less than 0 2 of our range of redox observations 3 3 time series analysis the continuous wavelet transform cwt was used to characterize the frequency content of time series data and to resolve temporal variations in energy at a given frequency related to hydrologic events further the correlation between cwt signals can be used to identify relationships between different time series and provide information about relative signal lag the morlet wavelet was used for the cwt because it is well localized in space and time and is thus appropriate for feature extraction farge 1992 grinsted et al 2004 3 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where ω0 is dimensionless frequency ω0 6 and η is dimensionless time the cwt of a time series x t with uniform time steps is then defined as 4 w x ψ τ s x t 1 s ψ t τ s d t where s is the scale of the transformed time series wx ψ τ s at position τ in the time domain and ψ is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function edge effects cause errors at the beginning and end of the wavelet power spectrum as indicated by the shaded regions in cwt images wavelet analysis reveals when particular frequencies in a time series are stronger or weaker and can be used to resolve the effects of hydrologic perturbations across temporal scales e g wallace et al 2018 for example if a storm affects redox conditions over one week the cwt plot shows higher power at the one week frequency during that time following cwt analysis of the hydrologic and redox time series cross spectrum analyses i e comparison between the cwt of two signals of redox with stage and precipitation were used to identify variability within the floodplain the coherence between cwt signals is a measure of their time varying correlation and can be conceptualized as a localized correlation coefficient in time frequency space the wavelet coherence of two time series x and y is defined as torrence and webster 1999 5 r n 2 s s s 1 w xy τ s 2 s s 1 w x τ s 2 s s 1 w y τ s 2 where w i s is the wavelet transform of time series i and s is a smoothing operator represented here by a weighted running average in both the time and scale directions the interested reader is referred to torrence and webster 1999 and grinsted et al 2004 for more details about computing the wavelet coherence the coherence varies between 0 and 1 with higher values indicating when the two signals are more strongly correlated and phase arrows in correlated regions are used to compute the relative lag time between the two signals zhang et al 2019 for example high wavelet correlation between river stage and the redox signal during a storm event would result in high coherence over periods of days to weeks depending on the size of the storm shifts in the dominant period s over which there is high coherence can also indicate fluctuations across different timescales and can reveal when the signal is influenced by more than one hydrologic variable i e stage and precipitation the lag time δt between the signals is calculated as 6 δ t φ 360 f where φ is the phase angle in degrees and f is the signal frequency y axis on cross spectrum plots phase arrows on the cross spectrum plots point to the right φ 0 when the two signals are in phase and to the left φ 180 when the two signals are out of phase to ensure robust analyses signal lag was only evaluated when wavelet coherence was 0 85 here we focus the analyses on redox measurements taken within two predominantly high eh eh 700 mv and low eh eh 300 mv regions of the aquifer these definitions of high and low eh were based on typical redox zonation in groundwater where potentials above 700 mv correspond to aerobic conditions and potentials below 300 mv represent moderately reducing conditions e g klüpfel et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 though the redox response within such regions will vary spatially and temporally across the floodplain depending upon the adjacent heterogeneity structure and proximity to the river these analyses provide insight into how the relative influence of each hydrologic parameter varies with sediment heterogeneity 4 results and interpretation 4 1 geohydrologic measurements stage changes propagated through the aquifer within a matter of hours and average amplitudes of water table fluctuations were 59 5 64 8 and 45 1 of the river stage amplitude at locations p1 p2 and p3 respectively fig 2 sediment core analyses reflect prior reports of interbedded sand and gravel facies overlain by low k silts and clays fig 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments estimated using hazen s equation hazen 1892 varied by orders of magnitude increasing from 6 9 10 5 cm s in the overlying silt facies to 0 16 cm s in sand dominated facies to just over 1 cm s in sandy gravel facies fig 3 grain size analysis was not performed on ofg sediments because some cobbles exceeded 150 mm in diameter and the distribution curve would not have been well constrained however previous work to determine the k of ofg facies measured values as high as 4 cm s e g ferriera et al 2010 based on darcy s law the instantaneous flow rate between the river and groundwater ranged from 4 22 to 1 70 m d in general pore water velocities were greater through the shallow aquifer where the hydraulic gradient was steeper across the bank seepage face though near the riverbank i e at locations p1 and p2 the volumes of water infiltrating and exfiltrating were approximately equal further into the aquifer at location p3 only about 27 of the total darcy flux during the study period was towards the river the immediate aquifer response to stage changes likely indicates preferential flow along connected high k facies specific conductance measurements in wells revealed that during high stage or flood events surface water penetrated as far as 100 m laterally into the aquifer for example during a significant flood event that occurred from march 19 23 2020 specific conductance values in wells p1 35 m from the stream bank and p3 100 m from the stream bank both dropped by over 50 in less than 1 h concurrent with a 49 drop in groundwater temperature suggesting rapid infiltration of relatively fresh surface water along connected groundwater flowpaths fig 4 the water table profiles at both locations also showed very similar responses to the increase in river stage indicating a high degree of hydraulic connectivity across the aquifer likely caused by spatially connected high k facies e g gravel ofg fig 3 4 2 redox potential and redox dynamics continuous redox measurements reflect the implicit findings of the basic hydrologic measurements we first quantified the contributions of changing water temperature on redox measurements groundwater temperatures fluctuated between 8 6 and 17 7 c at location p2 and between 6 7 and 13 8 c at location p3 where reference electrodes were installed the effects of changing temperature on the groundwater redox state were calculated following sawyer et al 1995 7 c 199 1 01 t 25 where t is the temperature of the groundwater and c is the potential correction used to adjust the raw measured redox potential at each electrode the temperatures observed near the river at location p2 available in the metadata were more variable coefficient of variation cv 0 27 c over the study period than those further inland at location p3 cv 0 18 c suggesting enhanced hyporheic mixing near the river bank redox potentials have not been corrected for ph redox measurements can also be affected by the saturation state of the aquifer e g jennings 2007 smith and van huyssteen 2011 but water table measurements in this study and previous studies at the temms e g wallace and soltanian 2021 indicate rapid head changes which propagate throughout the aquifer in a matter of hours thus because our redox electrodes are all positioned at nearly the same elevation and within the same soil horizons we interpret eh changes equally at all locations the time series of redox potentials captures the dynamics of hyporheic mixing revealing how infiltrating surface water influences subsurface redox conditions generally eh values throughout the aquifer increased immediately following stage rise corresponding with changes in water table elevation that indicate surface water infiltration some centrally located probes e g probes 12 and 13 showed a higher degree of variability however with conditions fluctuating by up to 16 during storms data available in the metadata these changes are associated with electrodes positioned within highly conductive facies that quickly convey infiltrating river water transects of the subsurface redox potential two roughly parallel aa and bb and two roughly perpendicular cc and dd to the direction of river flow clearly show variation in redox conditions redox conditions varied spatially throughout the study period here we focus our analysis around a major storm event that occurred from march 18 21 2020 as an example of a hydrologic perturbation that induced a significant aquifer redox response fig 5 the first set of contour plots are from march 17 roughly one day before the onset of heavy precipitation the fourth set of contour plots are from march 21 when the stage was at its peak the remaining sets of contour plots show the redox profiles on the rising times 2 and 3 and falling times 5 6 and 7 limbs of the hydrograph the contour plots show increasing eh throughout the aquifer as stage increased and river water infiltrated associated with preferential flow pathways formed by hydraulically connected high k facies types as indicated by fig 4 a deep high eh zone on the west side of transect aa expanded vertically and horizontally with the dynamic river stage while shallow and deep high eh zones became vertically connected near the center of transect cc the extent of these high eh zones increased through contour plots 1 4 and contracted afterward within a few hours of the maximum stage the total volume of high eh sediments within the aquifer increased by almost 300 from 130 m3 to 383 m3 fig 6 comparing the redox contour plots also shows notable changes in the extent of low eh conditions fig 5 as river stage increased between times 1 4 eh decreased significantly on the west side of transect bb even as a large high eh zone developed towards the center of the transect simultaneously eh decreased farther from the river at roughly the same depth 2 m on the south sides of both transects cc and dd perpendicular to the direction of river flow this suggests that infiltrating river water also displaces relatively low eh groundwater and drives redox changes further inland but further field investigations are needed to substantiate this idea such dynamic low eh conditions occurred only near dynamic high eh regions however while other low eh regions persisted throughout the aquifer even during the hydrologic perturbation fig 6 4 3 redox zonation related to lithology the redox contour plots show that consistently high eh conditions 700 mv persisted throughout the study period within two distinct regions of the aquifer a large region near the center roughly 1 m below the ground near the intersection of bb and dd termed zone 1 and a smaller region on the western side located roughly 2 5 m below the ground seen near the center of transect cc termed zone 2 fig 5 though both show consistently high eh conditions their size and shape evolved independently through time and they responded differently to changes in stage and precipitation fig 6 sediment cores from locations p1 and p3 fig 3 combined with ongoing field observations i e fig 4 indicate the presence of high k and gravel dominated facies in the shallow aquifer and cross comparison with these redox trends suggests that these facies bisect the aquifer at these locations bivariate correlation analyses i e the linear correlation between variables wherein a value of 1 shows total positive correlation and 0 no correlation reveal that while both regions were influenced by stage fluctuations ρ 0 69 and 0 59 for zones 1 and 2 respectively precipitation moderately influenced zone 1 but not zone 2 ρ 0 19 and 0 07 respectively the p values for all analyses were 0 001 this trend was observed throughout the monitoring period stage primarily drove elevated eh conditions with negligible influence of precipitation except during major storm events which resulted in site flooding the distribution of observed changes in redox potential calculated over the study period highlights areas of increased microbial activity and dynamic fluid mixing the range of redox fluctuations was calculated as the difference between the absolute maximum and minimum eh potential at each point in space over the entire study period fig 7 redox potential fluctuated throughout the aquifer with the locations of greatest change often co located with persistent high eh zones 1 and 2 for example the most dynamic conditions were located in a shallow zone near the intersection of transects bb and dd which also represents the persistent shallow high eh zone discussed above co location of dynamic yet persistent high eh conditions suggests preferential flow paths of higher k and gravel dominated facies types this region was underlain by a broad area where changes in redox potential were small or noticeably absent however which corresponds to the deeper narrow high eh zone seen along transect dd fig 5 this is also interpreted as a preferential flow path and may even represent a gravel dominated cross strata e g ofg such facies often exhibit unimodal grain size distributions d50 2 mm with high k due to a lack of sediment blocking pore spaces between gravel grains ferreira et al 2010 lunt and bridge 2004 not only does this create rapid and localized dispersion of solutes through the aquifer but the relative absence of fine organic rich sediments may limit the sustained supply of doc thereby reducing microbial reaction rates e g hunter et al 1998 and limiting reaction extents as doc sourced from infiltrated river water is rapidly consumed wallace et al 2020b further the reduced surface area of large grained high k sediments relative to fine grained sediments limits the contact time between nutrients and bioreactive surfaces further reducing the potential for nutrient transformation as a result high eh conditions persisted with little change in the redox state caused by microbial activity redox conditions were also highly dynamic in the shallow aquifer near the stream bank along transect dd figs 5 7 where redox potential fluctuated by roughly 200 mv 21 8 of the total observed range in eh across the floodplain this represents a transition zone where river water and groundwater mix other regions with nominal redox fluctuation and consistently low eh are interpreted as mostly hosting anoxic groundwater with little to no mixing fig 6 redox data from probes immediately adjacent to wells i e p1 p2 p3 were compared with core data at each location to further evaluate the influence of sediment lithology on redox dynamics fig 7c the mean facies length of high k sand or gravel facies in buried valley aquifers is on the order of meters with a coefficient of variation in length of 1 m e g ritzi et al 2002 dai et al 2004 thus the lithology observed in cores from p1 p2 and p3 should be representative of the sediment structure associated with redox data collected at probes 21 2 3 m from p1 23 4 1 m from p2 and 3 2 7 m from p3 in general redox potential fluctuated most within or near the transition to high k facies fig 7c at p1 redox potential fluctuated by nearly 100 mv over the study period at roughly 1 m depth corresponding with a 10 cm interval of gravel interbedded between silt facies similarly a dynamic region roughly 1 5 m deep at p2 is correlated with a 50 cm thick gravel facies location p3 also showed some variability despite its distance from the channel with redox potential fluctuations of up to 60 mv located near the transitions between low k and high k facies 4 4 temporal dynamics cross wavelet analysis shows that river stage had the greatest influence on redox conditions throughout the aquifer during storm events but its influence was tempered in low eh regions located within lower k sediments fig 8 the first sizeable storm event on march 18 raised the water table 5 8 m and flooded the site which considerably changed the aquifer redox state figs 4 5 a subsequent storm on may 18 raised the water table 5 4 m and also flooded the site but induced a smaller redox response which indicates the absence of preferential vertical infiltration from the overlying flood waters into the shallow aquifer which may alter the geochemistry in general eh conditions showed a strong response i e high coherence to significant stage changes caused by storm events redox conditions responded differently in low and high eh regions of the aquifer however at sensor 4 consistently low eh conditions located in the low eh zone in fig 6 µ 267 50 mv showed minimal response to stage changes including the flood event in march over short time periods and phase arrows indicate that redox lagged stage by 24 days over longer periods fig 8c at sensor 14 located just 26 m away eh was consistently high located within zone 2 µ 682 40 mv and showed a strong response to stage fluctuations with redox conditions responding to stage changes in roughly 12 h fig 8a though precipitation did not consistently influence either signal during the large storm event in march redox conditions at sensor 14 lagged the precipitation signal by 3 4 days over a period of 8 days fig 8b precipitation negligibly influenced redox conditions in the low eh region at sensor 4 over the monitoring period fig 8d high wavelet coherence over short periods 0 125 days on the precipitation plots for both zones is likely associated with the spurious correlation of noise characteristic of climatic signals e g maraun and kurths 2004 while high coherence on all plots over periods 32 days often associated with seasonal changes must be interpreted with caution given the length of our datasets our cross wavelet analyses highlight the significance of interpreting redox variations through the lens of frequency content because they reveal the influence of hydrologic perturbations which is often concealed by general time series analyses i e fig 4 for example despite the consistently low eh at sensor 4 the potential still fluctuated by up to 75 mv throughout the study period cross wavelet analysis of these data showed that these changes did not occur on the same time scale as changes in stage or precipitation as would be expected along connected high k pathways however and so conditions were relatively unperturbed by such hydrologic forcings 5 discussion subsurface redox conditions are influenced by an assemblage of hydrologic and lithologic variables including stage fluctuations precipitation and sediment heterogeneity our results reveal that while redox conditions are intermittently perturbed by temporally variable environmental changes i e storm surge the underlying sediment heterogeneity ultimately governs the formation and persistence of high and low eh zones given that fine sediments i e clays silts typically have a higher organic matter content than their high k counterparts i e sandy gravel and ofg reaction hotspots are more likely to form within such impermeable facies than along preferential flow pathways newcomer et al 2018 our high resolution observations of subsurface redox zonation likely represent an end member example given the complex sediment heterogeneity inherent to glacial aquifers but similar redox patterns have been observed in other heterogeneous coastal e g seybold et al 2002 wallace et al 2018 and non coastal e g king et al 2019 environments the geochemical state of subsurface systems and the associated efficiency of subsurface nutrient cycling are thus tied to sediment lithology and their complexity is not well represented by two dimensional monitoring despite the vast growth in observational data documenting riparian processes many observations represent discrete measurements which are difficult to interpret through time also these observations are not usually made during storm events hydrologic perturbations this represents a deficiency for vulnerable regions where continuous monitoring could elucidate controls on groundwater quality especially those related to large research community networks such as the critical zone observatories usgs hydrologic benchmark network and the great lake ecological observatory network the utility of continuous 3d redox monitoring for assessing hydrology driven aquifer dynamics thus stems from a lack of understanding about how biogeochemical conditions vary spatially and temporally here across the floodplain eh consistently showed greater fluctuations along high k facies and a dampened response to hydrologic perturbations within low k facies figs 5 6 7 though the glacial aquifer in this study is highly heterogeneous with extremely high k due to the presence of gravel dominated facies types such as ofg redox zonation and eh variability are observed to follow similar trends in other systems with lower contrasts in k and less hydraulic connectivity e g wallace et al 2018 coupling redox monitoring with the extensive observational infrastructure available at many sites e g carnevali et al 2020 dwivedi et al 2018b would help characterize spatial variability and significantly improve predictive understandings of biogeochemical processes and their response to perturbations hydrodynamics such as stage fluctuations exerted an important control on subsurface redox conditions and the duration and lag time of perturbations revealed the interplay between transport and kinetic reaction controls on the geochemistry in high k high eh regions of the aquifer redox conditions responded quickly to changes in river stage similar to observations within other heterogeneous aquifers e g lahiri and davidson 2020 su et al 2018 though water and nutrients were delivered efficiently along high k flowpaths the absence of fine organic rich sediments likely inhibited microbial respiration and nutrient transformation as a result it took longer on the order of weeks for equilibrium to be reestablished fig 8 further rapid temperature fluctuations associated with river water infiltration would presumably play an important role in nutrient transformation as reaction kinetics and redox conditions adjusted accordingly massmann et al 2006 munz et al 2019 seybold et al 2002 conversely low eh conditions showed a delayed response to changes in river stage as local low k and high organic matter sediments in our case silt clay and silty sand created barriers to flow and nutrient delivery however because the high organic carbon content of the sediments bolstered respiration rates the redox signal typically recovered within a matter of days these findings are consistent with other studies discussing the importance of lithology on subsurface redox conditions e g king et al 2019 sawyer et al 2014 wallace et al 2018 but our results further demonstrate and quantify the importance of small scale spatial differences in geochemistry caused by local changes in sediment properties when coupled with chemical data these analyses may also help constrain reaction kinetics and reveal implications for groundwater nutrient and contaminant remediation and transformation especially during dynamic hydrologic perturbations that bolster flow and solute delivery throughout the subsurface the dynamics of subsurface redox zonation indicate where and when conditions are most favorable for redox driven solute transformations but information about the groundwater chemistry is needed for further assessment our goal to assess the lithologic and hydrologic controls on subsurface redox conditions did not require analysis of groundwater chemistry but such data in combination with redox monitoring represents a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying reaction specific biogeochemical hotspots future work at the temms will therefore involve not only spatially distributed groundwater sampling but 16s rrna gene sequencing and quantification of sediment organic matter content to evaluate subsurface nutrient cycling and contaminant transformation a few other techniques allow for assessment of geochemical conditions related to sediment lithology an increasingly popular approach is the use of time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip which have been applied both in coastal and non coastal environments e g cardenas and markowski 2010 kessouri et al 2019 ntarlagiannis et al 2005 nyquist et al 2008 however such geophysical methods are often costly and their accuracy depends strongly on the inversion method used to process the data further their efficacy may be limited depending on the specific degradation processes involved which could underestimate the degree of subsurface redox shifts we presented only an example application of 3d in situ redox monitoring but this technique can be used to spatially assess subsurface redox conditions across a broad range of timescales not only are the sensors relatively inexpensive and straightforward to use mcmahon and chapelle 2008 but platinum redox electrodes are rather durable often functioning reliably for long periods in both oxic and anoxic conditions shoemaker et al 2013 swerhone et al 1999 6 conclusions we have shown that redox conditions in floodplain sediments are strongly perturbed by dynamic stage driven mixing events that intensify hyporheic exchange and solute transport but the influence of such hydrologic perturbations is ultimately controlled by the underlying sediment lithology redox conditions are highly dynamic along high k facies which act as preferential flowpaths during river water infiltration while low k facies temper redox dynamics by limiting flow and the exchange of complimentary solutes redox monitoring allows for geochemical investigation when consistent sampling is difficult or where sites are inaccessible during large storms and the regular sampling interval permits frequency analysis to parse out the relative influence of storms or other hydrologic forcings by providing a continuous and time lapse record of subsurface conditions 3d in situ redox measurements can be used to understand the control of sediment heterogeneity on the reactive transport of redox sensitive solutes in hydrodynamic environments credit authorship contribution statement corey d wallace conceptualization methodology data

4792,mass balance checks are often used to evaluate the abilities of numerical simulators and assess the accuracy of the solutions but are often insufficient in addition there is a need to calculate the difference in mass fluxes through downstream subdomain analysis to determine whether remediation technologies are suitable for upstream contaminated sites the galerkin finite element method gfem has been commonly considered locally nonconservative whereas the finite difference method fdm is a local mass conservation method in this study we proved that the gfem has local mass balance equations on mass conserved elements constructed by connecting lines that perpendicularly cross element faces at midpoints in solute transport problems with spatially variable velocities and dispersion coefficients identical to discretized balance equations in the fdm furthermore we found that locally conservative gfems with two types of approaches involving spatially variable coefficients i e a linear combination approach and an average approach give rise to two types of postprocessing techniques for calculating local mass fluxes these are equivalent to an area weighted method and first order taylor series method respectively finally to illustrate the practical applicability of these gfems we used the proposed postprocessing approaches to resolve practical problems involving computation of local mass fluxes based on information directly obtainable from finite element solutions of concentration distribution our findings revealed that the local mass balance errors were negligibly small regardless of numerical concentration accuracy keywords galerkin finite element method local mass conservation method solute transport problems linear combination approach average approach 1 introduction when evaluating the effects of management practices or policy regulations local mass fluxes must be calculated in some local areas for example when remediation activities e g permeable reactive barriers or other in situ remediation approaches are recommended at upstream contaminated sites it is often necessary to calculate local mass fluxes through downstream areas of interest this aids in determining whether a permeable reactive barrier or other in situ remediation technologies are appropriate technologies for the upstream site moreover if the downstream area contains regions susceptible to contaminant toxic effects the local mass balance in the subdomain should be calculated to establish the level of risk when the galerkin finite element method gfem widely utilized in groundwater simulations is employed to evaluate such problems this method is expected to have the computational capability to conserve mass balance in some local areas thereby permitting evaluation of the local mass flux or local mass balance within a given subdomain here the subdomain refers to any collection of elements a subset of all elements or an individual element within the susceptible region however the gfem is commonly considered locally nonconservative although mass can be conserved globally because a single element is unable to conserve its mass and mass fluxes across edges are discontinuous berger and howington 2002 carey 1982 2002 carey et al 1985 deng et al 2019 dogrul and kadir 2006 kolar et al 1996 lynch 1984 oliveira et al 2000 suk et al 2020 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 some studies have proven that the gfem can be locally conservative with postprocessed fluxes berger and howington 2002 cockburn et al 2007 dogrul and kadir 2006 hughes et al 2000 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however most of the prior studies except hughes et al 2000 only considered groundwater flow problems but not contaminant transport problems with advection and dispersion although zhang et al 2013 proposed a locally conservative galerkin finite element method lcg for two phase flow simulations in heterogeneous porous media the lcg was employed for solving only pressure equation which is a type of elliptic partial differential equation but not for saturation equation which is a type of parabolic partial differential equation rather than a locally conservative galerkin finite element method they used an upstream finite volume method fvm to solve the saturation equation like advection dispersion equation accordingly they combined lcg and fvm to compute pressure and saturation in two phase flow problems respectively therefore theoretically they didn t use the lcg method to solute transport problem of advection dispersion i e a type of parabolic partial differential equation so we can see that all previous works related to local conservative galerkin finite element method applied to only groundwater flow equations notably hughes et al 2000 proposed that the gfem is globally and locally conservative in both groundwater flow and solute transport problems but their study was limited to steady state conditions to provide proof of the mathematical theory alone in addition the proposed postprocessing technique was demonstrated through hypothetical abstract examples that considerably differed from typical groundwater scenarios or other practical applications furthermore hughes et al 2000 developed a postprocessing method that calculated local mass balance by obtaining flow rates across finite element faces in the current study we propose an alternative approach involving local mass conservation by the gfem in which integrated mass fluxes are computed along quadrant sides of areas referred to as mass conserved elements that are directly obtainable from solutions of concentration distribution in a local domain here mass conserved elements are constructed by connecting lines that perpendicularly cross element faces at midpoints to our knowledge nobody applied gfem to obtain locally conservative solutions in solute transport problems with advection dispersion in transient heterogenous porous media as mentioned above the gfem lacks an explicit discrete mass conservation statement in its equations so it is widely presumed to be locally nonconservative by contrast the finite difference method fdm is based on local balance equations that are written for each discretization cell i e control volume thus making it an attractive approach for local mass conservation however this study proves that the gfem can produce local mass balance equations defined on the basis of mass conserved elements equivalent to cells in the fdm and satisfy global mass conservation by means of a simple one dimensional advection dispersion transport example with spatially variable coefficients therefore we show that the gfem is identical to the fdm when mass lumping is performed and both methods have identical local mass balance equations with similar control volume i e mass conserved elements in the gfem and cells in the fdm these findings imply that the gfem can incorporate advantages of the fdm e g local mass conservation and maintain the inherent advantages of the gfem regarding irregular complex geometry the aim of this study was to provide mathematical proof that the gfem can produce local mass balance equations defined on the basis of mass conserved elements equivalent to cells in the fdm when solving solute transport equations with spatially variable coefficients in a transient state in the solute transport problem we propose a new post processing method for the computation of integrated mass fluxes along quadrant sides of a mass conserved element using information directly obtainable from finite element solutions of local concentration distribution the computed integrated mass fluxes were compared with analytical solutions to determine their accuracies finally to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach to two dimensional transient solute transport problems under spatially varying velocities in heterogeneous aquifers solute transport problems in two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer systems with aquifer and aquitard configurations were solved local mass balances within two dimensional mass conserved elements as well as integrated mass fluxes along quadrant sides of each mass conserved element were computed and the local mass balance error was shown to be negligibly small 2 materials and methods a standard continuous gfem can be applied to solve transport equations with spatially variable coefficients by using the following weighted residual method 1 r n i c t v c d c d r 0 i n where r is the region of interest t is time n i is the weighting function at node i n is the total number of nodes in the finite element network c is an approximate concentration c i n i c i c i is the concentration at node i v is the seepage velocity and d is the dispersion coefficient application of the gfem results in the following matrix equations 2a m dc dt s c f 2b m i j r n i n j d r i j n 2c s i j r n i v n j d n j d r i j n 2d f i b n i n vc d c d b i n where m is the mass matrix associated with the time derivative term s is the stiffness matrix associated with advective and dispersive fluxes f is the load vector associated with boundary conditions b is the boundary of the solution domain and n is the outward unit vector normal to b the global matrices and vectors are formed via element by element assembly and the components of the global matrices and vector can be written in indicial notation as follows 3a m i j e m i j e i j n e m e 3b s i j e s i j e i j n e m e 3c f i e f i e i n e m e where 4a m i j e r e n i n j d r 4b s i j e r e n i v n j d n j d r 4c f i e b e n i n vc d c d b here element matrices of m i j e and s i j e and the element vector of f i e are evaluated at an element region of r e and an element boundary of b e respectively subscripts i and j indicate global node numbers included in element e with me representing the total number of elements and v and d representing the approximated seepage velocity and dispersion coefficient respectively when the element integrals are computed for the element matrices and vectors spatially variable coefficients such as velocities and dispersion coefficients within the element integral can be approximated by two different approaches linear combination and average to propose two locally mass conservative gfems corresponding to the two different approaches above for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality the one dimensional solute transport example with spatially variable velocities and dispersion coefficients will hereafter be assumed to consist of four nodes forming three elements with variable element sizes as shown in fig 1 a the linear combination approach calculates spatially variable coefficients i e velocities and dispersion coefficients as a linear combination of the respective nodal values of velocities and dispersion coefficients within a given element as follows 5a v i n i v i i n 5b d i n i d i i n where v i and d i are the seepage velocity and dispersion coefficient at node i respectively the alternative approach i e an average approach is to simply take the arithmetic averages of the respective nodal values of velocities and dispersion coefficients within a given element as follows 6a v v i v j 2 i j n 6b d d i d j 2 i j n employing the two approaches above the galerkin approximation of eq 1 will lead to distinct systems of ordinary differential equations with respect to time in the following section using these two approaches respective systems of ordinary differential equations will be derived by focusing on a one dimensional solute transport problem the derived systems of ordinary differential equations according to the two approaches will be compared with two discretized balance equations obtained using two respective alternative approximations of mass fluxes at the cell interface in the fdm the corresponding mass flux approximations will be determined so that the derived systems of ordinary differential equations in the gfem will be identical to those of discretized balance equations in the fdm accordingly this study proposes two locally mass conservative gfems that correspond to a linear combination approach and an average approach 2 1 linear combination approach with spatially varying coefficients the application of the gfem at the first node yields the following ordinary differential equation 7 m 1 1 1 d c 1 dt m 1 2 1 d c 2 dt s 1 1 1 c 1 s 1 2 1 c 2 f b 1 where m i j e and s i j e are the mass and stiffness matrices associated with global nodes i and j within element e respectively whereas f b 1 is the boundary mass flux rate that is directed into the region of interest through the left boundary in fig 1b after all integrations in element matrices are performed in accordance with the linear combination approach eq 7 can be rewritten as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 8 v 1 3 v 2 6 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 6 v 2 3 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 f b 1 where δ x e is the grid size of element e similarly for the second third and fourth nodes following the linear combination approach ordinary differential equations with respect to time can be obtained as eqs 9 10 and 11 respectively shown below δ x 1 6 d c 1 dt δ x 1 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 6 d c 3 dt v 1 3 v 2 6 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 6 v 2 3 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 9 v 2 3 v 3 6 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 6 v 3 3 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 0 δ x 2 6 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 6 d c 4 dt v 2 3 v 3 6 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 6 v 3 3 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 10 v 3 3 v 4 6 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 6 v 4 3 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 0 δ x 3 6 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 4 dt 11 v 3 3 v 4 6 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 6 v 4 3 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 f b 2 where f b 2 is the boundary mass flux rate that is directed into the region of interest through the right boundary in fig 1b summing eqs 8 through 11 the following is obtained δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt δ x 1 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 4 dt 12 f b 1 f b 2 the right hand side is the mass rate true or known mass that is directed into the region of interest through the global boundary whereas the left hand side is the mass rate accumulated numerical mass in the region thus the gfem is a global mass conserved method because all true mass entering the region is included in the numerical mass this is consistent with the findings of previous studies hughes et al 2000 to show that the gfem is a local mass conservation method the fdm method was applied to the same one dimensional problem discretized with the gfem in fig 1a discretized with four block centered cells in the fdm fig 1b the four discretized balance equations corresponding to the four cells can be written as eqs 13a 13d as follows 13a δ x 1 2 dc 1 dt f b 1 f 1 13b δ x 1 2 dc 2 dt δ x 2 2 dc 2 dt f 1 f 2 13c δ x 2 2 dc 3 dt δ x 3 2 dc 3 dt f 2 f 3 13d δ x 4 2 dc 4 dt f 3 f b 2 where f i represents the local mass fluxes at interfaces between i th and i 1 th cells corresponding to the local mass fluxes at the midpoint in the i th finite element in fig 1a the above four equations are known as local mass conserved equations because each equation is a mass conservation equation written for each discretization cell summing eqs 13a through 13d the following is obtained 14 δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt δ x 1 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 4 dt f b 1 f b 2 which is identical to eq 12 thus the fdm method conserves both global and local mass such that all true mass entering the region right hand side through the global boundary is included in the numerical mass left hand side here local mass fluxes at the cell interface can be approximated by two methods an area weighted method and a first order taylor series method using the area weighted method the mass flux f 1 at the interface between cells 1 and 2 which corresponds to the midpoint within finite element 1 can be approximated as follows f 1 x 1 x 2 v c d x δ x 1 x 1 x 2 d d x δ x 1 c 2 c 1 δ x 1 x 1 x 2 n 1 x v 1 n 2 x v 2 n 1 x c 1 n 2 x c 2 d x δ x 1 x 1 x 2 n 1 x d 1 n 2 x d 2 d x δ x 1 c 2 c 1 δ x 1 15a 1 3 v 1 1 6 v 2 c 1 1 6 v 1 1 3 v 2 c 2 d 1 d 2 c 2 c 1 2 δ x 1 where x 1 and x 2 are the x axis coordinates at nodes 1 and 2 respectively within finite element 1 similarly mass fluxes at other cell interfaces can be calculated as follows 15b f 2 1 3 v 2 1 6 v 3 c 2 1 6 v 2 1 3 v 3 c 3 d 2 d 3 c 3 c 2 2 δ x 2 15c f 3 1 3 v 3 1 6 v 4 c 3 1 6 v 3 1 3 v 4 c 4 d 3 d 4 c 4 c 3 2 δ x 3 to show that the ordinary differential equation of eq 8 in the gfem is equivalent to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm eq 8 can be rearranged as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 16 1 3 v 1 1 6 v 2 c 1 1 6 v 1 1 3 v 2 c 2 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 c 2 f b 1 substituting eq 15a into eq 16 and performing mass lumping eq 16 can be written as follows 17 δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt f b 1 f 1 notably eq 17 i e the ordinary differential equation of eq 8 in the gfem is mathematically identical to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm by performing the same procedure for other ordinary differential equations of eqs 9 10 and 11 in the gfem combined with respective mass flux approximations of eqs 15a 15c it is clear that eqs 9 10 and 11 are mathematically identical to eqs 13b 13c and 13d respectively therefore by performing mass lumping on a system of ordinary differential equations all of which can be obtained by performing integrations in element matrices in accordance with a linear combination approach ultimately the ordinary differential equations turn out to be the discretized balance equations in the fdm with local mass fluxes at interfaces approximated using the area weighted method finally finite element equations with the linear combination approach conserve local mass as with discretized balance equations in the fdm with local mass fluxes obtained using the area weighted method 2 2 average approach with spatially varying coefficients in the average approach we perform all integrations in the element matrix of eq 7 this yields eq 18 as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 18 v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 f b 1 similarly for the second third and fourth nodes ordinary differential equations with respect to time can be written as eqs 19 20 and 21 respectively δ x 1 6 d c 1 dt δ x 1 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 6 d c 3 dt v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 19 v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 0 δ x 2 6 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 6 d c 4 dt v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 20 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 0 δ x 3 6 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 4 dt 21 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 f b 2 summing eqs 18 through 21 the following is obtained δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt δ x 1 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 4 dt 22 f b 1 f b 2 the right hand side is the mass rate true or known mass that is directed into the region of interest through the global boundary whereas the left hand side is the mass rate accumulated numerical mass in the region thus as in the previous section the gfem method based on the average approach is a global mass conservation method because all true mass entering the region is included in the numerical mass to illustrate that the gfem method based on the average approach is also a local mass conservation method local mass fluxes at cell interfaces are obtained using a first order taylor series expansion as follows 23 f i v i 1 2 c i 1 2 d i 1 2 c x i 1 2 where 24a v i 1 2 v i v x i δ x 2 v i v i 1 v i δ x δ x 2 v i 1 v i 2 24b c i 1 2 c i c x i δ x 2 c i c i 1 c i δ x δ x 2 c i 1 c i 2 24c d i 1 2 d i d x i δ x 2 d i d i 1 d i δ x δ x 2 d i 1 d i 2 24d c x i 1 2 c i 1 c i δ x finally the mass flux can be written as follows 25 f i v i 1 v i 2 c i 1 c i 2 d i 1 d i 2 c i 1 c i δ x i 1 2 3 as in the linear combination approach described in the previous section to show that the ordinary differential equation of eq 18 in the gfem is equivalent to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm eq 18 can be rearranged as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 26 1 4 v 1 1 4 v 2 c 1 1 4 v 1 1 4 v 2 c 2 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 c 2 f b 1 substituting eq 25 into eq 26 and performing mass lumping eq 26 becomes eq 13a accordingly the ordinary differential equation of eq 18 derived using the average approach in the gfem is mathematically identical to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm by performing the same procedures on ordinary differential equations associated with the second third and fourth nodes combined with the respective mass flux approximations of eq 25 it is clear that eqs 19 20 and 21 are mathematically identical to eqs 13b 13c and 13d respectively therefore as in the linear combination approach described in the previous section by performing mass lumping on a system of ordinary differential equations all of which can be obtained by performing integrations in element matrices using the average approach the ordinary differential equations are identical to the discretized balance equations in the fdm notably this occurs when the mass fluxes at interfaces between cells are approximated using a first order taylor series method finally as in the linear combination approach in the previous section finite element equations derived using the average approach conserve local mass as in discretized balance equations in the fdm with local mass fluxes approximated using a taylor series method 2 3 conserving local mass fluxes when applying the gfem to two dimensional solute transport equations to extend the argument made in the previous section whereby gfems can be local mass conservation methods to a two dimensional solute transport problem numerical formulation of local mass fluxes at interfaces between mass conserved elements must be expressed in terms of element matrices to determine local mass fluxes by analogy to the one dimensional solute transport problem in the previous section comparison of eq 9 with eqs 15a and 15b shows that the fifth and sixth terms in eq 9 which originate from s 2 1 1 c 1 s 2 2 1 c 2 are equivalent to the negative of f 1 in eq 15a this indicates that mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 1 by means of element 1 similarly the seventh and eighth terms in eq 9 which originate from s 2 2 2 c 2 s 2 3 2 c 3 are equivalent to f 2 in eq 15b this indicates that mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 3 by means of element 2 for ease of understanding the new convention f 2 1 was devised to denote local mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 1 by means of element 1 as follows 27 f 2 1 s 2 1 1 c 1 s 2 2 1 c 2 similarly mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 3 by means of element 2 can be denoted as follows 28 f 2 3

element 5 therefore we show that the gfem in two dimensional solute transport retains local mass flux conservation with respect to an individual mass conserved element 3 results to illustrate the extent of local mass conservation on mass conserved elements when the proposed postprocessing approach was employed in the gfem four examples were designed the first example involves a one dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients whereas the second example involves a one dimensional advection dispersion problem with spatially variable coefficients notably the second example corresponds to the push pull test scenario adopted by suk 2013 in which velocity and dispersion coefficients were spatially variable in the vicinity of pumping and injection wells the third example involves a two dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients lastly to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method the fourth example involves back diffusion of contaminants trapped in an aquitard under an aquifer and aquitard configuration in a two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer in all examples accuracy of numerical solutions of concentration and local mass flux obtained using the proposed gfem were quantitatively calculated against analytical solution using a normalized root mean square error nrmse in order to investigate how numerical concentration and consequently numerical local mass flux were affected according to grid and time step sizes the nrmses for concentration and local mass flux were defined as 32 n r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n y max where n is total number of nodes y i is concentration or local mass flux at the i th node simulated by the proposed gfem y i is analytic solutions of concentration or local mass flux at the i th node and y max is maximum analytic value of concentration or local mass flux the nrmses indicate the ratio of the difference between the simulated and the analytic values to the maximum analytic values in order to show superior performance of gfem with proposed postprocessing approaches with respect to local mass conservation we compared local mass balances from the proposed gfem with results from conventional gfem in the conventional gfem the conventional postprocessing method used simulated concentrations obtained from conventional gfem to obtain diffusive local mass flux rates by substituting the simulated concentrations into the fick s law i e momentum equation istok 1989 šimůnek et al 2005 here the derivative of solute concentration in the fick s law is evaluated by taking the derivative of the finite element interpolated solutions obtained from linear interpolation of shape functions and simulated values at nodes istok 1989 šimůnek et al 2005 yeh 1981 dogrul and kadir 2006 since the derivatives of the shape functions in linear elements are not continuous across the element interface generally the derivative of solute concentration in the fick s law would not be continuous across the element interface istok 1989 yeh 1999 accordingly conventional postprocessing scheme of the conventional gfem might arise discontinuity of diffusive local mass fluxes across element interface it means that such discontinuity unfortunately leads to violation of local mass conservation 3 1 ex1 one dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients to illustrate the extent of local mass conservation in mass conserved elements in one dimensional solute transport when the gfem was employed a simple one dimensional solute transport scenario in ex1 was defined in which the solute migrated and spread away from left to right with a unidirectional flow at constant velocity of 100 m d a y the length of the whole domain was assumed to be 1 m the dispersion coefficient was also assumed to be 5000 m2 day the left boundary condition was specified as a dirichlet condition in which a concentration of 1 ppm was imposed on the boundary whereas the right boundary condition was specified as a neumann condition in which zero flux was assigned the solute concentration was initially zero across the whole domain for the sake of simplicity the whole domain was discretized with a consistent element size the numerical experiment was performed for various grid sizes e g 0 002 and 0 02 m and various time steps e g 2 0 10 7 1 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 6 days to investigate how numerical solutions of concentration local mass fluxes and local mass balance errors change depending on the grid size and time step the numerical results had different accuracies depending on grid size and time step compared with the analytical solution fig 3 and table 1 as shown in fig 3 and table 1 the most accurate concentration distribution was obtained by using the smallest time step with small grid size of 0 02 m by contrast the least accurate solution was obtained using the largest grid size and time step i e 0 02 m and 5 0 10 6 days respectively similar to the concentration distribution local mass fluxes at interfaces between mass conserved elements across the whole domain were calculated using a proposed post processing method based on known finite element solutions of concentration according to grid size and time step as shown in fig 4 and table 1 the most accurate solutions of mass fluxes across the whole domain relative to the analytical solution were found when the smallest time step with small grid size of 0 02 m was used by contrast the least accurate numerical local mass fluxes compared with the analytical solution were obtained using the largest grid size and time step fig 4 and table 1 accordingly numerical orders of accuracy for local mass fluxes depending on grid and time step sizes were identical to those for numerical concentrations as shown in fig 5 local mass balance errors were not consistently linked to the accuracies of numerical concentrations or numerical mass fluxes all mass balance errors were negligible regardless of grid size and time step employed in addition when grid sizes were smaller the local mass balance errors became slightly larger however these still remained negligible as shown in fig 5 furthermore we can see in fig 5 that local mass balance errors of gfem with the proposed postprocessing approaches were about 5 to 8 orders of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional gfem 3 2 ex2 one dimensional advection dispersion problem with variable coefficients in ex2 we employed a push pull test scenario originally described by suk 2013 in which velocity and dispersion coefficients are spatially variable in the vicinity of pumping or injection well in the push pull test example we considered the transport behavior of the only first species during the injection phase assuming no decay accordingly input parameters related to this push pull test example were identical to those described by suk 2013 with the exception of the first order decay coefficient and longitudinal dispersivity detailed input parameters are shown in table 2 to investigate how local mass balance errors are affected depending on the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration two cases were considered diffusion dominant and advection dominant inputs of the diffusion dominant and advection dominant cases are listed under ex2a and ex2b in table 2 respectively thus the diffusion dominant and advection dominant cases were assumed to have dispersivities of 1 0 and 0 01 m respectively whereas other parameters remained identical in each case grid sizes and time steps were varied to obtain distinct peclet and courant numbers that affected the accuracy of concentration solutions furthermore the proposed locally conservative gfems with two different approaches considering spatially variable coefficients within element integrals i e linear combination and average approaches were used to solve these two cases this enabled the performance comparison between the two approaches with respect to local mass balance errors overall in the diffusion dominant case ex2a the numerical solutions of concentration obtained using both the linear combination and average approaches were more accurate at smaller grid sizes and time steps compared with the semi analytical solution suk 2013 whereas for relatively larger grid sizes and time steps the solutions were less accurate fig s1a b of supplementary material and table 1 numerical mass fluxes at the interfaces between mass conserved elements exhibited a similar dependence on grid and time step sizes in both the linear combination and average approaches however at the grid size and time step of 1 m and 0 5 days respectively the numerical solutions of mass flux deviated less from the semi analytical solution compared with the numerical solutions of concentration fig s2a b of supplementary material and table 1 however local mass balance errors in both the linear combination and average approaches exhibited greater dependence on grid size than on the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration and mass flux fig 6 a and b a smaller grid size was associated with a larger local mass balance error therefore the local mass balance errors are affected by grid size rather than the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration and mass flux conversely the local mass balance errors in both linear combination and average approaches were negligible for all grid sizes and time steps employed in fig 6a and b based on the results obtained using the linear combination and average approaches no practical differences between the two approaches were found both approaches were presumed to be suitable for calculating local mass balance error furthermore it can be seen in fig 6a and b that local mass balance errors of gfem with the proposed postprocessing approach were about 11 to 14 orders of magnitude smaller than those from the conventional gfem to evaluate changes in the calculation of local mass balance errors depending on the flow regime condition the advection dominant case ex2b was solved using the proposed gfems with either the linear combination or average approach as described earlier in this paper numerical concentrations numerical mass fluxes and local mass balance errors were obtained using both approaches for various grid sizes and time steps numerical solutions of concentration obtained using the proposed gfems with both approaches were compared against the semi analytical solution suk 2013 as in ex2a with the diffusion dominant case the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration obtained using both linear combination and average approaches were dependent on grid size and time step the numerical solutions were more accurate for smaller grid sizes and time steps but less accurate for larger grid sizes and time steps fig s3a b of supplementary material and table 1 smaller grid sizes and time steps were necessary in the advection dominant case to achieve solutions similar to the analytical solution compared with the dispersion dominant case furthermore numerical mass fluxes at the interfaces between mass conserved elements exhibited a similar dependence on grid size and time step in both the linear combination and average approaches fig s4a b of supplementary material and table 1 as the numerical solutions of concentration deviated further from the analytical solution the calculated mass fluxes obtained from numerical concentrations also contained more errors in both the linear combination and average approaches however regardless of the accuracies of the numerical concentrations and mass fluxes the local mass balance errors were negligible for all grid sizes and time steps in both approaches fig 7 a and b furthermore the local mass balance errors depended more on grid size than on the accuracies of numerical concentrations and mass fluxes finally the local mass errors were remarkably small although smaller grid sizes caused larger local mass balance errors similar to results of previous examples local mass balance error of proposed gfem were about 11 to 14 orders of magnitude smaller than those of conventional gfem in both linear combination and average approaches 3 3 ex3 two dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients for confirmation of local mass conservation in a two dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant velocities and dispersivities fig 8 numerical simulation of solute transport in ex3 was performed to describe plume migration under unidirectional flow in the x direction the x and y directional velocities were set at 100 and 0 m day respectively the x and y directional dispersion coefficients dxx and dyy were assumed to be 5000 and 500 m2 day respectively the initial concentration was assumed to follow gaussian distribution the boundary conditions at the left right top and bottom sides were prescribed as a dirichlet boundary condition with zero concentration neumann boundary condition with zero flux no flux boundary condition and no flux boundary condition respectively fig 8 similar to the one dimensional problem above the two discretization schemes were assumed to have fine and coarse quadrilateral elements respectively the sizes of the fine and coarse quadrilateral elements were 0 01 m 0 01 m and 0 1 m 0 1 m respectively using these fine and coarse discretizations numerical simulations of solute transport were performed to obtain the respective concentration distributions as shown in figs 9 and 10 and table 1 the accuracies of numerical results differed according to grid size and time step numerical solutions of concentration distribution with fine mesh discretization matched well with the semi analytical solution whereas solutions with coarse mesh discretization exhibited numerical oscillation when numerical solutions of concentrations were obtained local mass fluxes could be calculated for mass conserved elements using the proposed postprocessing method because there were four local mass flux rates for each mass conserved element along the transects of aa and bb as shown in fig 11 for example f 2471 2472 2411 2410 f 2471 2532 2533 2472 f 2471 2470 2531 2532 and f 2471 2410 2409 2470 for a mass conserved element centered on node number 2471 the four calculated local mass flux rates were plotted along the transects of aa and bb as shown in figs s5 s8 of supplementary material comparison of the four numerical local mass fluxes along the transect of aa obtained using the fine discretization system against the semi analytical solutions showed that the four numerical local mass fluxes clearly matched the semi analytical solutions fig s5 of supplementary material subsequently comparison of the four numerical local mass fluxes along the transect of bb obtained using the fine discretization system against the semi analytical solutions showed that these four local mass fluxes reasonably matched the semi analytical solutions but exhibited slight deviations fig s6 of supplementary material these deviations might be attributable to a reduction in the y directional dispersion coefficient compared with the x directional dispersion coefficient which resulted in a higher y directional peclet number similarly four numerical local mass fluxes along the transects of aa and bb were calculated using the coarse discretization system and then compared with semi analytical solutions as shown in figs s7 and s8 of supplementary material because the numerical solutions of concentration in the coarse discretization system have significant numerical errors figs 9b and 10a b the four numerical local mass fluxes along the transects of a a and b b deviated considerably from the semi analytical solutions figs s7 and s8 of supplementary material therefore as shown in table 1 nrmses of the numerical solutions of the local mass flux in the fine discretization scheme were smaller than those in the coarse discretization scheme regardless of the accuracies of the numerical concentrations and numerical local mass fluxes local mass balance errors in both fine and coarse discretization systems were negligible nonetheless local mass balance errors were slightly larger in the fine discretization system than in the coarse discretization system fig 12 also in fig 12 similar to previous results numerical local mass balance errors along transects of a a and b b from gfem with the proposed postprocessing approaches were about 11 to 14 orders of magnitude smaller than those from conventional gfem 3 4 ex4 two dimensional advection dispersion problem based on a heterogeneous aquifer system lastly a solute transport problem involving aquifer and aquitard configuration was employed in ex4 to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in a two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer system as shown in fig 13 contaminants were assumed to initially exist in only some portions of the aquitard with the boundary and initial conditions as displayed in fig 13 numerical solutions of concentration distributions were calculated based on fine and coarse grid systems the numerical solutions of concentration distributions from the fine and coarse grid systems were compared with the semi analytical solutions respectively as shown in figs s9 and s10 of supplementary material and table 1 the numerical results had different accuracies depending on grid sizes and time steps numerical solutions of concentration distribution were more accurate with fine mesh discretization than with coarse mesh discretization using the fine discretization system in a heterogeneous aquifer system the four numerical integrated mass fluxes through the sides of mass conserved elements along a a and b b transects reasonably matched the semi analytical solutions although they exhibited slight deviations from the semi analytical solutions due to minimal inaccuracies associated with numerical concentrations figs s11 and s12 of supplementary material by contrast numerical integrated mass fluxes obtained using the coarse discretization system deviated greatly from the semi analytical solutions along both a a and b b transects figs s13 and s14 of supplementary material also in table 1 through the comparison of nrmses between fine and coarse discretization system local mass flux in the fine discretization system were more accurate than in the coarse discretization system finally local mass balance errors calculated using the proposed method were remarkably small fig 14 regardless of whether the solutions of numerical concentrations and local mass fluxes had considerable errors as in the one dimensional problem regardless of the accuracies of numerical concentrations and local mass fluxes the local mass balance errors were negligible with both mesh sizes however the errors were larger when the fine discretization scheme was employed which was consistent with the results for the one dimensional problem above consistent with previous results in fig 14 local mass balance errors along transects of a a and b b from the proposed gfem were shown to be about 2 to 8 orders of magnitude smaller than those from the conventional gfem 4 discussion and conclusions generally the gfem has been considered locally nonconservative because it lacks explicit representation of local mass balance for a finite element whereas the fdm is considered to conserve local masses because it solves local balance equations on a control volume however we proved that the gfem can produce local mass balance equations defined on the basis of mass conserved elements when solving solute transport equations with spatially variable coefficients identical to discretized balance equations in the fdm accordingly the proposed gfem was locally conservative for solving a solute transport problem involving a heterogeneous aquifer furthermore we showed that locally conservative gfems based on linear combination and average approaches give rise to two respective types of postprocessing techniques for calculating local mass fluxes an area weighted method and a first order taylor series truncation method analogous to the one dimensional solute transport problem above a two dimensional solute transport problem was proposed with a new postprocessing technique for computing integrated mass fluxes along the sides of mass conserved elements based on element matrices the local mass fluxes determined using the new proposed postprocessing techniques could be directly obtained from solutions of concentration distribution in a local domain in the gfems moreover the techniques efficiently computed local mass fluxes because they did not use global post processing whereby a linear system involving an entire domain must be solved this would result in excessive computational cost by contrast the local post processing techniques calculated the local mass fluxes using numerical concentrations at nodes associated with only finite elements overlapping into mass conserved elements to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed locally conservative gfem to the solute transport equation two cases with constant and spatially variable coefficients were considered in both one dimensional and two dimensional solute transport problems in each case grid sizes and time steps which affected the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration were altered to determine how the accuracies of local mass fluxes and local mass balance errors were affected by the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration furthermore to determine how respective accuracies of local mass fluxes and local mass balance errors in dispersion dominant and advection dominant cases were affected by numerical solutions of concentration high and low dispersivities were assumed in a push pull scenario as expected with larger grid sizes and time steps numerical concentration solutions became less accurate the corresponding accuracies of local mass fluxes were similar to those of concentration solutions affected by grid sizes and time steps numerical concentrations were less accurate at a higher peclet number in the advection dominant case than at a lower peclet number in the dispersion dominant case when discretization levels of time and space were identical in accordance with the accuracies of numerical concentrations local mass fluxes were also less accurate at higher peclet numbers however for all cases considered above local mass balance errors were negligible regardless of the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration and local mass flux rather local mass balance errors were primarily dependent on grid size this does not imply true perfect local mass conservation when significant numerical errors are involved in the calculation of numerical concentrations local mass balances are conserved in terms of numerical mass fluxes only which might contain substantial numerical errors due to inaccurate numerical concentrations rather than in terms of true mass fluxes therefore if the numerical solutions of concentration are close to the exact solutions i e highly accurate the calculated local mass fluxes can almost approximate true mass flux the corresponding calculated local mass balances are likely to be practically meaningful because the calculated inflow and outflow across the subdomain of interest are almost the same as the true values also according to all results in this study local mass balance errors of the proposed gfem were remarkably smaller than the conventional gfem where the local mass balance errors from the proposed gfem were about several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional gfem therefore gfem with the proposed postprocessing approaches showed superior performance over the conventional gfem with respect to local mass conservation computation finally extensive future research is needed regarding the proposed locally conservative gfem various types of elements should be considered including three dimensional elements furthermore this proposed approach might extend to multiphase flow problems to address practical problems that are more likely to be encountered in real world scenarios credit

4792,mass balance checks are often used to evaluate the abilities of numerical simulators and assess the accuracy of the solutions but are often insufficient in addition there is a need to calculate the difference in mass fluxes through downstream subdomain analysis to determine whether remediation technologies are suitable for upstream contaminated sites the galerkin finite element method gfem has been commonly considered locally nonconservative whereas the finite difference method fdm is a local mass conservation method in this study we proved that the gfem has local mass balance equations on mass conserved elements constructed by connecting lines that perpendicularly cross element faces at midpoints in solute transport problems with spatially variable velocities and dispersion coefficients identical to discretized balance equations in the fdm furthermore we found that locally conservative gfems with two types of approaches involving spatially variable coefficients i e a linear combination approach and an average approach give rise to two types of postprocessing techniques for calculating local mass fluxes these are equivalent to an area weighted method and first order taylor series method respectively finally to illustrate the practical applicability of these gfems we used the proposed postprocessing approaches to resolve practical problems involving computation of local mass fluxes based on information directly obtainable from finite element solutions of concentration distribution our findings revealed that the local mass balance errors were negligibly small regardless of numerical concentration accuracy keywords galerkin finite element method local mass conservation method solute transport problems linear combination approach average approach 1 introduction when evaluating the effects of management practices or policy regulations local mass fluxes must be calculated in some local areas for example when remediation activities e g permeable reactive barriers or other in situ remediation approaches are recommended at upstream contaminated sites it is often necessary to calculate local mass fluxes through downstream areas of interest this aids in determining whether a permeable reactive barrier or other in situ remediation technologies are appropriate technologies for the upstream site moreover if the downstream area contains regions susceptible to contaminant toxic effects the local mass balance in the subdomain should be calculated to establish the level of risk when the galerkin finite element method gfem widely utilized in groundwater simulations is employed to evaluate such problems this method is expected to have the computational capability to conserve mass balance in some local areas thereby permitting evaluation of the local mass flux or local mass balance within a given subdomain here the subdomain refers to any collection of elements a subset of all elements or an individual element within the susceptible region however the gfem is commonly considered locally nonconservative although mass can be conserved globally because a single element is unable to conserve its mass and mass fluxes across edges are discontinuous berger and howington 2002 carey 1982 2002 carey et al 1985 deng et al 2019 dogrul and kadir 2006 kolar et al 1996 lynch 1984 oliveira et al 2000 suk et al 2020 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 some studies have proven that the gfem can be locally conservative with postprocessed fluxes berger and howington 2002 cockburn et al 2007 dogrul and kadir 2006 hughes et al 2000 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however most of the prior studies except hughes et al 2000 only considered groundwater flow problems but not contaminant transport problems with advection and dispersion although zhang et al 2013 proposed a locally conservative galerkin finite element method lcg for two phase flow simulations in heterogeneous porous media the lcg was employed for solving only pressure equation which is a type of elliptic partial differential equation but not for saturation equation which is a type of parabolic partial differential equation rather than a locally conservative galerkin finite element method they used an upstream finite volume method fvm to solve the saturation equation like advection dispersion equation accordingly they combined lcg and fvm to compute pressure and saturation in two phase flow problems respectively therefore theoretically they didn t use the lcg method to solute transport problem of advection dispersion i e a type of parabolic partial differential equation so we can see that all previous works related to local conservative galerkin finite element method applied to only groundwater flow equations notably hughes et al 2000 proposed that the gfem is globally and locally conservative in both groundwater flow and solute transport problems but their study was limited to steady state conditions to provide proof of the mathematical theory alone in addition the proposed postprocessing technique was demonstrated through hypothetical abstract examples that considerably differed from typical groundwater scenarios or other practical applications furthermore hughes et al 2000 developed a postprocessing method that calculated local mass balance by obtaining flow rates across finite element faces in the current study we propose an alternative approach involving local mass conservation by the gfem in which integrated mass fluxes are computed along quadrant sides of areas referred to as mass conserved elements that are directly obtainable from solutions of concentration distribution in a local domain here mass conserved elements are constructed by connecting lines that perpendicularly cross element faces at midpoints to our knowledge nobody applied gfem to obtain locally conservative solutions in solute transport problems with advection dispersion in transient heterogenous porous media as mentioned above the gfem lacks an explicit discrete mass conservation statement in its equations so it is widely presumed to be locally nonconservative by contrast the finite difference method fdm is based on local balance equations that are written for each discretization cell i e control volume thus making it an attractive approach for local mass conservation however this study proves that the gfem can produce local mass balance equations defined on the basis of mass conserved elements equivalent to cells in the fdm and satisfy global mass conservation by means of a simple one dimensional advection dispersion transport example with spatially variable coefficients therefore we show that the gfem is identical to the fdm when mass lumping is performed and both methods have identical local mass balance equations with similar control volume i e mass conserved elements in the gfem and cells in the fdm these findings imply that the gfem can incorporate advantages of the fdm e g local mass conservation and maintain the inherent advantages of the gfem regarding irregular complex geometry the aim of this study was to provide mathematical proof that the gfem can produce local mass balance equations defined on the basis of mass conserved elements equivalent to cells in the fdm when solving solute transport equations with spatially variable coefficients in a transient state in the solute transport problem we propose a new post processing method for the computation of integrated mass fluxes along quadrant sides of a mass conserved element using information directly obtainable from finite element solutions of local concentration distribution the computed integrated mass fluxes were compared with analytical solutions to determine their accuracies finally to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach to two dimensional transient solute transport problems under spatially varying velocities in heterogeneous aquifers solute transport problems in two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer systems with aquifer and aquitard configurations were solved local mass balances within two dimensional mass conserved elements as well as integrated mass fluxes along quadrant sides of each mass conserved element were computed and the local mass balance error was shown to be negligibly small 2 materials and methods a standard continuous gfem can be applied to solve transport equations with spatially variable coefficients by using the following weighted residual method 1 r n i c t v c d c d r 0 i n where r is the region of interest t is time n i is the weighting function at node i n is the total number of nodes in the finite element network c is an approximate concentration c i n i c i c i is the concentration at node i v is the seepage velocity and d is the dispersion coefficient application of the gfem results in the following matrix equations 2a m dc dt s c f 2b m i j r n i n j d r i j n 2c s i j r n i v n j d n j d r i j n 2d f i b n i n vc d c d b i n where m is the mass matrix associated with the time derivative term s is the stiffness matrix associated with advective and dispersive fluxes f is the load vector associated with boundary conditions b is the boundary of the solution domain and n is the outward unit vector normal to b the global matrices and vectors are formed via element by element assembly and the components of the global matrices and vector can be written in indicial notation as follows 3a m i j e m i j e i j n e m e 3b s i j e s i j e i j n e m e 3c f i e f i e i n e m e where 4a m i j e r e n i n j d r 4b s i j e r e n i v n j d n j d r 4c f i e b e n i n vc d c d b here element matrices of m i j e and s i j e and the element vector of f i e are evaluated at an element region of r e and an element boundary of b e respectively subscripts i and j indicate global node numbers included in element e with me representing the total number of elements and v and d representing the approximated seepage velocity and dispersion coefficient respectively when the element integrals are computed for the element matrices and vectors spatially variable coefficients such as velocities and dispersion coefficients within the element integral can be approximated by two different approaches linear combination and average to propose two locally mass conservative gfems corresponding to the two different approaches above for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality the one dimensional solute transport example with spatially variable velocities and dispersion coefficients will hereafter be assumed to consist of four nodes forming three elements with variable element sizes as shown in fig 1 a the linear combination approach calculates spatially variable coefficients i e velocities and dispersion coefficients as a linear combination of the respective nodal values of velocities and dispersion coefficients within a given element as follows 5a v i n i v i i n 5b d i n i d i i n where v i and d i are the seepage velocity and dispersion coefficient at node i respectively the alternative approach i e an average approach is to simply take the arithmetic averages of the respective nodal values of

distinct systems of ordinary differential equations with respect to time in the following section using these two approaches respective systems of ordinary differential equations will be derived by focusing on a one dimensional solute transport problem the derived systems of ordinary differential equations according to the two approaches will be compared with two discretized balance equations obtained using two respective alternative approximations of mass fluxes at the cell interface in the fdm the corresponding mass flux approximations will be determined so that the derived systems of ordinary differential equations in the gfem will be identical to those of discretized balance equations in the fdm accordingly this study proposes two locally mass conservative gfems that correspond to a linear combination approach and an average approach 2 1 linear combination approach with spatially varying coefficients the application of the gfem at the first node yields the following ordinary differential equation 7 m 1 1 1 d c 1 dt m 1 2 1 d c 2 dt s 1 1 1 c 1 s 1 2 1 c 2 f b 1 where m i j e and s i j e are the mass and stiffness matrices associated with global nodes i and j within element e respectively whereas f b 1 is the boundary mass flux rate that is directed into the region of interest through the left boundary in fig 1b after all integrations in element matrices are performed in accordance with the linear combination approach eq 7 can be rewritten as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 8 v 1 3 v 2 6 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 6 v 2 3 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 f b 1 where δ x e is the grid size of element e similarly for the second third and fourth nodes following the linear combination approach ordinary differential equations with respect to time can be obtained as eqs 9 10 and 11 respectively shown below δ x 1 6 d c 1 dt δ x 1 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 6 d c 3 dt v 1 3 v 2 6 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 6 v 2 3 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 9 v 2 3 v 3 6 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 6 v 3 3 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 0 δ x 2 6 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 6 d c 4 dt v 2 3 v 3 6 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 6 v 3 3 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 10 v 3 3 v 4 6 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 6 v 4 3 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 0 δ x 3 6 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 4 dt 11 v 3 3 v 4 6 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 6 v 4 3 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 f b 2 where f b 2 is the boundary mass flux rate that is directed into the region of interest through the right boundary in fig 1b summing eqs 8 through 11 the following is obtained δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt δ x 1 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 4 dt 12 f b 1 f b 2 the right hand side is the mass rate true or known mass that is directed into the region of interest through the global boundary whereas the left hand side is the mass rate accumulated numerical mass in the region thus the gfem is a global mass conserved method because all true mass entering the region is included in the numerical mass this is consistent with the findings of previous studies hughes et al 2000 to show that the gfem is a local mass conservation method the fdm method was applied to the same one dimensional problem discretized with the gfem in fig 1a discretized with four block centered cells in the fdm fig 1b the four discretized balance equations corresponding to the four cells can be written as eqs 13a 13d as follows 13a δ x 1 2 dc 1 dt f b 1 f 1 13b δ x 1 2 dc 2 dt δ x 2 2 dc 2 dt f 1 f 2 13c δ x 2 2 dc 3 dt δ x 3 2 dc 3 dt f 2 f 3 13d δ x 4 2 dc 4 dt f 3 f b 2 where f i represents the local mass fluxes at interfaces between i th and i 1 th cells corresponding to the local mass fluxes at the midpoint in the i th finite element in fig 1a the above four equations are known as local mass conserved equations because each equation is a mass conservation equation written for each discretization cell summing eqs 13a through 13d the following is obtained 14 δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt δ x 1 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 4 dt f b 1 f b 2 which is identical to eq 12 thus the fdm method conserves both global and local mass such that all true mass entering the region right hand side through the global boundary is included in the numerical mass left hand side here local mass fluxes at the cell interface can be approximated by two methods an area weighted method and a first order taylor series method using the area weighted method the mass flux f 1 at the interface between cells 1 and 2 which corresponds to the midpoint within finite element 1 can be approximated as follows f 1 x 1 x 2 v c d x δ x 1 x 1 x 2 d d x δ x 1 c 2 c 1 δ x 1 x 1 x 2 n 1 x v 1 n 2 x v 2 n 1 x c 1 n 2 x c 2 d x δ x 1 x 1 x 2 n 1 x d 1 n 2 x d 2 d x δ x 1 c 2 c 1 δ x 1 15a 1 3 v 1 1 6 v 2 c 1 1 6 v 1 1 3 v 2 c 2 d 1 d 2 c 2 c 1 2 δ x 1 where x 1 and x 2 are the x axis coordinates at nodes 1 and 2 respectively within finite element 1 similarly mass fluxes at other cell interfaces can be calculated as follows 15b f 2 1 3 v 2 1 6 v 3 c 2 1 6 v 2 1 3 v 3 c 3 d 2 d 3 c 3 c 2 2 δ x 2 15c f 3 1 3 v 3 1 6 v 4 c 3 1 6 v 3 1 3 v 4 c 4 d 3 d 4 c 4 c 3 2 δ x 3 to show that the ordinary differential equation of eq 8 in the gfem is equivalent to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm eq 8 can be rearranged as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 16 1 3 v 1 1 6 v 2 c 1 1 6 v 1 1 3 v 2 c 2 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 c 2 f b 1 substituting eq 15a into eq 16 and performing mass lumping eq 16 can be written as follows 17 δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt f b 1 f 1 notably eq 17 i e the ordinary differential equation of eq 8 in the gfem is mathematically identical to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm by performing the same procedure for other ordinary differential equations of eqs 9 10 and 11 in the gfem combined with respective mass flux approximations of eqs 15a 15c it is clear that eqs 9 10 and 11 are mathematically identical to eqs 13b 13c and 13d respectively therefore by performing mass lumping on a system of ordinary differential equations all of which can be obtained by performing integrations in element matrices in accordance with a linear combination approach ultimately the ordinary differential equations turn out to be the discretized balance equations in the fdm with local mass fluxes at interfaces approximated using the area weighted method finally finite element equations with the linear combination approach conserve local mass as with discretized balance equations in the fdm with local mass fluxes obtained using the area weighted method 2 2 average approach with spatially varying coefficients in the average approach we perform all integrations in the element matrix of eq 7 this yields eq 18 as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 18 v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 f b 1 similarly for the second third and fourth nodes ordinary differential equations with respect to time can be written as eqs 19 20 and 21 respectively δ x 1 6 d c 1 dt δ x 1 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 2 dt δ x 2 6 d c 3 dt v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 v 1 4 v 2 4 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 2 19 v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 0 δ x 2 6 d c 2 dt δ x 2 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 3 dt δ x 3 6 d c 4 dt v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 2 v 2 4 v 3 4 d 2 d 3 2 δ x 2 c 3 20 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 0 δ x 3 6 d c 3 dt δ x 3 3 d c 4 dt 21 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 3 v 3 4 v 4 4 d 3 d 4 2 δ x 3 c 4 f b 2 summing eqs 18 through 21 the following is obtained δ x 1 2 d c 1 dt δ x 1 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 2 dt δ x 2 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 3 dt δ x 3 2 d c 4 dt 22 f b 1 f b 2 the right hand side is the mass rate true or known mass that is directed into the region of interest through the global boundary whereas the left hand side is the mass rate accumulated numerical mass in the region thus as in the previous section the gfem method based on the average approach is a global mass conservation method because all true mass entering the region is included in the numerical mass to illustrate that the gfem method based on the average approach is also a local mass conservation method local mass fluxes at cell interfaces are obtained using a first order taylor series expansion as follows 23 f i v i 1 2 c i 1 2 d i 1 2 c x i 1 2 where 24a v i 1 2 v i v x i δ x 2 v i v i 1 v i δ x δ x 2 v i 1 v i 2 24b c i 1 2 c i c x i δ x 2 c i c i 1 c i δ x δ x 2 c i 1 c i 2 24c d i 1 2 d i d x i δ x 2 d i d i 1 d i δ x δ x 2 d i 1 d i 2 24d c x i 1 2 c i 1 c i δ x finally the mass flux can be written as follows 25 f i v i 1 v i 2 c i 1 c i 2 d i 1 d i 2 c i 1 c i δ x i 1 2 3 as in the linear combination approach described in the previous section to show that the ordinary differential equation of eq 18 in the gfem is equivalent to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm eq 18 can be rearranged as follows δ x 1 3 d c 1 dt δ x 1 6 d c 2 dt 26 1 4 v 1 1 4 v 2 c 1 1 4 v 1 1 4 v 2 c 2 d 1 d 2 2 δ x 1 c 1 c 2 f b 1 substituting eq 25 into eq 26 and performing mass lumping eq 26 becomes eq 13a accordingly the ordinary differential equation of eq 18 derived using the average approach in the gfem is mathematically identical to the discretized balance equation of eq 13a in the fdm by performing the same procedures on ordinary differential equations associated with the second third and fourth nodes combined with the respective mass flux approximations of eq 25 it is clear that eqs 19 20 and 21 are mathematically identical to eqs 13b 13c and 13d respectively therefore as in the linear combination approach described in the previous section by performing mass lumping on a system of ordinary differential equations all of which can be obtained by performing integrations in element matrices using the average approach the ordinary differential equations are identical to the discretized balance equations in the fdm notably this occurs when the mass fluxes at interfaces between cells are approximated using a first order taylor series method finally as in the linear combination approach in the previous section finite element equations derived using the average approach conserve local mass as in discretized balance equations in the fdm with local mass fluxes approximated using a taylor series method 2 3 conserving local mass fluxes when applying the gfem to two dimensional solute transport equations to extend the argument made in the previous section whereby gfems can be local mass conservation methods to a two dimensional solute transport problem numerical formulation of local mass fluxes at interfaces between mass conserved elements must be expressed in terms of element matrices to determine local mass fluxes by analogy to the one dimensional solute transport problem in the previous section comparison of eq 9 with eqs 15a and 15b shows that the fifth and sixth terms in eq 9 which originate from s 2 1 1 c 1 s 2 2 1 c 2 are equivalent to the negative of f 1 in eq 15a this indicates that mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 1 by means of element 1 similarly the seventh and eighth terms in eq 9 which originate from s 2 2 2 c 2 s 2 3 2 c 3 are equivalent to f 2 in eq 15b this indicates that mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 3 by means of element 2 for ease of understanding the new convention f 2 1 was devised to denote local mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 1 by means of element 1 as follows 27 f 2 1 s 2 1 1 c 1 s 2 2 1 c 2 similarly mass fluxes from mass conserved element 2 to mass conserved element 3 by means of element 2 can be denoted as follows 28 f 2 3 s 2 2 2 c 2 s 2 3 2 c 3 by analogy to the one dimensional solute transport case to determine the numerical formulation of local mass fluxes in a two dimensional solute transport problem in terms of element matrices a schematic diagram with two dimensional discretization consisting of four elements and nine nodes is illustrated in fig 2 application of the gfem to eq 1 at the fifth node will lead to the following ordinary differential equation m 5 1 1 d c 1 dt m 5 2 1 m 5 2 2 d c 2 dt m 5 3 2 d c 3 dt m 5 4 1 m 5 4 3 d c 4 dt m 5 5 1 m 5 5 2 m 5 5 3 m 5 5 4 d c 5 dt m 5 6 2 m 5 6 4 d c 6 dt m

c 5 s 5 5 4 c 5 s 5 8 4 c 8 s 5 9 4 c 9 s 5 6 4 c 6 0 following the above new conventions by analogy to the one dimensional solute transport problem above local mass fluxes at interfaces between mass conserved elements in a two dimensional solute transport problem can be written in terms of element matrices as follows 30a f 5 2 1 4 s 5 1 1 c 1 s 5 4 1 c 4 s 5 5 1 c 5 s 5 2 1 c 2 30b f 5 6 3 2 s 5

from mass conserved element 5 to mass conserved elements 2 1 and 4 via original finite element 1 f 5 6 3 2 denotes the flux from mass conserved element 5 to mass conserved elements 6 3 and 2 via original finite element 2 f 5 4 7 8 denotes the flux from mass conserved element 5 to mass conserved elements 4 7 and 8 via original finite element 3 and f 5 8 9 6 denotes the flux from mass conserved element 5 to mass conserved elements 8 9 and 6 via original finite element 4 thus as shown in fig 2 f 5 2 1 4 is an integrated mass flux rate through the third quadrant sides of mass conserved element 5 which only belongs to original finite element 1 at the adjacent boundary sides of mass conserved element 5 and mass conserved elements 2 1 and 4 similarly as shown in fig 2 f 5 6 3 2 is an integrated mass flux rate through the second quadrant sides of mass conserved element 5 which only belongs to original finite element 2 at the adjacent boundary sides of mass conserved element 5 and mass conserved elements 6 3 and 2 the other conventions f 5 4 7 8 and f 5 8 9 6 follow similar approaches as shown in fig 2 finally performing mass lumping and rearranging of eq 29 yields the following a 5 d c 5 dt s 5 1 1 c 1 s 5 4 1 c 4 s 5 5 1 c 5 s 5 2 1 c 2 s 5 2 2 c 2 s 5 5 2 c 5 s 5 6 2 c 6 s 5 3 2 c 3 s 5 4 3 c 4 s 5 7 3 c 7 s 5 8 3 c 8 s 5 5 3 c 5 s 5 5 4 c 5 s 5 8 4 c 8 s 5 9 4 c 9 s 5 6 4 c 6 31 f 5 2 1 4 f 5 6 3 2 f 5 4 7 8 f 5 8 9 6 where a 5 is the area of mass conserved element 5 accordingly eq 31 is a statement of the local mass balance equation for mass conserved element 5 therefore we show that the gfem in two dimensional solute transport retains local mass flux conservation with respect to an individual mass conserved element 3 results to illustrate the extent of local mass conservation on mass conserved elements when the proposed postprocessing approach was employed in the gfem four examples were designed the first example involves a one dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients whereas the second example involves a one dimensional advection dispersion problem with spatially variable coefficients notably the second example corresponds to the push pull test scenario adopted by suk 2013 in which velocity and dispersion coefficients were spatially variable in the vicinity of pumping and injection wells the third example involves a two dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients lastly to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method the fourth example involves back diffusion of contaminants trapped in an aquitard under an aquifer and aquitard configuration in a two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer in all examples accuracy of numerical solutions of concentration and local mass flux obtained using the proposed gfem were quantitatively calculated against analytical solution using a normalized root mean square error nrmse in order to investigate how numerical concentration and consequently numerical local mass flux were affected according to grid and time step sizes the nrmses for concentration and local mass flux were defined as 32 n r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n y max where n is total number of nodes y i is concentration or local mass flux at the i th node simulated by the proposed gfem y i is analytic solutions of concentration or local mass flux at the i th node and y max is maximum analytic value of concentration or local mass flux the nrmses indicate the ratio of the difference between the simulated and the analytic values to the maximum analytic values in order to show superior performance of gfem with proposed postprocessing approaches with respect to local mass conservation we compared local mass balances from the proposed gfem with results from conventional gfem in the conventional gfem the conventional postprocessing method used simulated concentrations obtained from conventional gfem to obtain diffusive local mass flux rates by substituting the simulated concentrations into the fick s law i e momentum equation istok 1989 šimůnek et al 2005 here the derivative of solute concentration in the fick s law is evaluated by taking the derivative of the finite element interpolated solutions obtained from linear interpolation of shape functions and simulated values at nodes istok 1989 šimůnek et al 2005 yeh 1981 dogrul and kadir 2006 since the derivatives of the shape functions in linear elements are not continuous across the element interface generally the derivative of solute concentration in the fick s law would not be continuous across the element interface istok 1989 yeh 1999 accordingly conventional postprocessing scheme of the conventional gfem might arise discontinuity of diffusive local mass fluxes across element interface it means that such discontinuity unfortunately leads to violation of local mass conservation 3 1 ex1 one dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients to illustrate the extent of local mass conservation in mass conserved elements in one dimensional solute transport when the gfem was employed a simple one dimensional solute transport scenario in ex1 was defined in which the solute migrated and spread away from left to right with a unidirectional flow at constant velocity of 100 m d a y the length of the whole domain was assumed to be 1 m the dispersion coefficient was also assumed to be 5000 m2 day the left boundary condition was specified as a dirichlet condition in which a concentration of 1 ppm was imposed on the boundary whereas the right boundary condition was specified as a neumann condition in which zero flux was assigned the solute concentration was initially zero across the whole domain for the sake of simplicity the whole domain was discretized with a consistent element size the numerical experiment was performed for various grid sizes e g 0 002 and 0 02 m and various time steps e g 2 0 10 7 1 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 6 days to investigate how numerical solutions of concentration local mass fluxes and local mass balance errors change depending on the grid size and time step the numerical results had different accuracies depending on grid size and time step compared with the analytical solution fig 3 and table 1 as shown in fig 3 and table 1 the most accurate concentration distribution was obtained by using the smallest time step with small grid size of 0 02 m by contrast the least accurate solution was obtained using the largest grid size and time step i e 0 02 m and 5 0 10 6 days respectively similar to the concentration distribution local mass fluxes at interfaces between mass conserved elements across the whole domain were calculated using a proposed post processing method based on known finite element solutions of concentration according to grid size and time step as shown in fig 4 and table 1 the most accurate solutions of mass fluxes across the whole domain relative to the analytical solution were found when the smallest time step with small grid size of 0 02 m was used by contrast the least accurate numerical local mass fluxes compared with the analytical solution were obtained using the largest grid size and time step fig 4 and table 1 accordingly numerical orders of accuracy for local mass fluxes depending on grid and time step sizes were identical to those for numerical concentrations as shown in fig 5 local mass balance errors were not consistently linked to the accuracies of numerical concentrations or numerical mass fluxes all mass balance errors were negligible regardless of grid size and time step employed in addition when grid sizes were smaller the local mass balance errors became slightly larger however these still remained negligible as shown in fig 5 furthermore we can see in fig 5 that local mass balance errors of gfem with the proposed postprocessing approaches were about 5 to 8 orders of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional gfem 3 2 ex2 one dimensional advection dispersion problem with variable coefficients in ex2 we employed a push pull test scenario originally described by suk 2013 in which velocity and dispersion coefficients are spatially variable in the vicinity of pumping or injection well in the push pull test example we considered the transport behavior of the only first species during the injection phase assuming no decay accordingly input parameters related to this push pull test example were identical to those described by suk 2013 with the exception of the first order decay coefficient and longitudinal dispersivity detailed input parameters are shown in table 2 to investigate how local mass balance errors are affected depending on the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration two cases were considered diffusion dominant and advection dominant inputs of the diffusion dominant and advection dominant cases are listed under ex2a and ex2b in table 2 respectively thus the diffusion dominant and advection dominant cases were assumed to have dispersivities of 1 0 and 0 01 m respectively whereas other parameters remained identical in each case grid sizes and time steps were varied to obtain distinct peclet and courant numbers that affected the accuracy of concentration solutions furthermore the proposed locally conservative gfems with two different approaches considering spatially variable coefficients within element integrals i e linear combination and average approaches were used to solve these two cases this enabled the performance comparison between the two approaches with respect to local mass balance errors overall in the diffusion dominant case ex2a the numerical solutions of concentration obtained using both the linear combination and average approaches were more accurate at smaller grid sizes and time steps compared with the semi analytical solution suk 2013 whereas for relatively larger grid sizes and time steps the solutions were less accurate fig s1a b of supplementary material and table 1 numerical mass fluxes at the interfaces between mass conserved elements exhibited a similar dependence on grid and time step sizes in both the linear combination and average approaches however at the grid size and time step of 1 m and 0 5 days respectively the numerical solutions of mass flux deviated less from the semi analytical solution compared with the numerical solutions of concentration fig s2a b of supplementary material and table 1 however local mass balance errors in both the linear combination and average approaches exhibited greater dependence on grid size than on the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration and mass flux fig 6 a and b a smaller grid size was associated with a larger local mass balance error therefore the local mass balance errors are affected by grid size rather than the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration and mass flux conversely the local mass balance errors in both linear combination and average approaches were negligible for all grid sizes and time steps employed in fig 6a and b based on the results obtained using the linear combination and average approaches no practical differences between the two approaches were found both approaches were presumed to be suitable for calculating local mass balance error furthermore it can be seen in fig 6a and b that local mass balance errors of gfem with the proposed postprocessing approach were about 11 to 14 orders of magnitude smaller than those from the conventional gfem to evaluate changes in the calculation of local mass balance errors depending on the flow regime condition the advection dominant case ex2b was solved using the proposed gfems with either the linear combination or average approach as described earlier in this paper numerical concentrations numerical mass fluxes and local mass balance errors were obtained using both approaches for various grid sizes and time steps numerical solutions of concentration obtained using the proposed gfems with both approaches were compared against the semi analytical solution suk 2013 as in ex2a with the diffusion dominant case the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration obtained using both linear combination and average approaches were dependent on grid size and time step the numerical solutions were more accurate for smaller grid sizes and time steps but less accurate for larger grid sizes and time steps fig s3a b of supplementary material and table 1 smaller grid sizes and time steps were necessary in the advection dominant case to achieve solutions similar to the analytical solution compared with the dispersion dominant case furthermore numerical mass fluxes at the interfaces between mass conserved elements exhibited a similar dependence on grid size and time step in both the linear combination and average approaches fig s4a b of supplementary material and table 1 as the numerical solutions of concentration deviated further from the analytical solution the calculated mass fluxes obtained from numerical concentrations also contained more errors in both the linear combination and average approaches however regardless of the accuracies of the numerical concentrations and mass fluxes the local mass balance errors were negligible for all grid sizes and time steps in both approaches fig 7 a and b furthermore the local mass balance errors depended more on grid size than on the accuracies of numerical concentrations and mass fluxes finally the local mass errors were remarkably small although smaller grid sizes caused larger local mass balance errors similar to results of previous examples local mass balance error of proposed gfem were about 11 to 14 orders of magnitude smaller than those of conventional gfem in both linear combination and average approaches 3 3 ex3 two dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant coefficients for confirmation of local mass conservation in a two dimensional advection dispersion problem with constant velocities and dispersivities fig 8 numerical simulation of solute transport in ex3 was performed to describe plume migration under unidirectional flow in the x direction the x and y directional velocities were set at 100 and 0 m day respectively the x and y directional dispersion coefficients dxx and dyy were assumed to be 5000 and 500 m2 day respectively the initial concentration was assumed to follow gaussian distribution the boundary conditions at the left right top and bottom sides were prescribed as a dirichlet boundary condition with zero concentration neumann boundary condition with zero flux no flux boundary condition and no flux boundary condition respectively fig 8 similar to the one dimensional problem above the two discretization schemes were assumed to have fine and coarse quadrilateral elements respectively the sizes of the fine and coarse quadrilateral elements were 0 01 m 0 01 m and 0 1 m 0 1 m respectively using these fine and coarse discretizations numerical simulations of solute transport were performed to obtain the respective concentration distributions as shown in figs 9 and 10 and table 1 the accuracies of numerical results differed according to grid size and time step numerical solutions of concentration distribution with fine mesh discretization matched well with the semi analytical solution whereas solutions with coarse mesh discretization exhibited numerical oscillation when numerical solutions of concentrations were obtained local mass fluxes could be calculated for mass conserved elements using the proposed postprocessing method because there were four local mass flux rates for each mass conserved element along the transects of aa and bb as shown in fig 11 for example f 2471 2472 2411 2410 f 2471 2532 2533 2472 f 2471 2470 2531 2532 and f 2471 2410 2409 2470 for a mass conserved element centered on node number 2471 the four calculated local mass flux rates were plotted along the transects of aa and bb as shown in figs s5 s8 of supplementary material comparison of the four numerical local mass fluxes along the transect of aa obtained using the fine discretization system against the semi analytical solutions showed that the four numerical local mass fluxes clearly matched the semi analytical solutions fig s5 of supplementary material subsequently comparison of the four numerical local mass fluxes along the transect of bb obtained using the fine discretization system against the semi analytical solutions showed that these four local mass fluxes reasonably matched the semi analytical solutions but exhibited slight deviations fig s6 of supplementary material these deviations might be attributable to a reduction in the y directional dispersion coefficient compared with the x directional dispersion coefficient which resulted in a higher y directional peclet number similarly four numerical local mass fluxes along the transects of aa and bb were calculated using the coarse discretization system and then compared with semi analytical solutions as shown in figs s7 and s8 of supplementary material because the numerical solutions of concentration in the coarse discretization system have significant numerical errors figs 9b and 10a b the four numerical local mass fluxes along the transects of a a and b b deviated considerably from the semi analytical solutions figs s7 and s8 of supplementary material therefore as shown in table 1 nrmses of the numerical solutions of the local mass flux in the fine discretization scheme were smaller than those in the coarse discretization scheme regardless of the accuracies of the numerical concentrations and numerical local mass fluxes local mass balance errors in both fine and coarse discretization systems were negligible nonetheless local mass balance errors were slightly larger in the fine discretization system than in the coarse discretization system fig 12 also in fig 12 similar to previous results numerical local mass balance errors along transects of a a and b b from gfem with the proposed postprocessing approaches were about 11 to 14 orders of magnitude smaller than those from conventional gfem 3 4 ex4 two dimensional advection dispersion problem based on a heterogeneous aquifer system lastly a solute transport problem involving aquifer and aquitard configuration was employed in ex4 to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in a two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer system as shown in fig 13 contaminants were assumed to initially exist in only some portions of the aquitard with the boundary and initial conditions as displayed in fig 13 numerical solutions of concentration distributions were calculated based on fine and coarse grid systems the numerical solutions of concentration distributions from the fine and coarse grid systems were compared with the semi analytical solutions respectively as shown in figs s9 and s10 of supplementary material and table 1 the numerical results had different accuracies depending on grid sizes and time steps numerical solutions of concentration distribution were more accurate with fine mesh discretization than with coarse mesh discretization using the fine discretization system in a heterogeneous aquifer system the four numerical integrated mass fluxes through the sides of mass conserved elements along a a and b b transects reasonably matched the semi analytical solutions although they exhibited slight deviations from the semi analytical solutions due to minimal inaccuracies associated with numerical concentrations figs s11 and s12 of supplementary material by contrast numerical integrated mass fluxes obtained using the coarse discretization system deviated greatly from the semi analytical solutions along both a a and b b transects figs s13 and s14 of supplementary material also in table 1 through the comparison of nrmses between fine and coarse discretization system local mass flux in the fine discretization system were more accurate than in the coarse discretization system finally local mass balance errors calculated using the proposed method were remarkably small fig 14 regardless of whether the solutions of numerical concentrations and local mass fluxes had considerable errors as in the one dimensional problem regardless of the accuracies of numerical concentrations and local mass fluxes the local mass balance errors were negligible with both mesh sizes however the errors were larger when the fine discretization scheme was employed which was consistent with the results for the one dimensional problem above consistent with previous results in fig 14 local mass balance errors along transects of a a and b b from the proposed gfem were shown to be about 2 to 8 orders of magnitude smaller than those from the conventional gfem 4 discussion and conclusions generally the gfem has been considered locally nonconservative because it lacks explicit representation of local mass balance for a finite element whereas the fdm is considered to conserve local masses because it solves local balance equations on a control volume however we proved that the gfem can produce local mass balance equations defined on the basis of mass conserved elements when solving solute transport equations with spatially variable coefficients identical to discretized balance equations in the fdm accordingly the proposed gfem was locally conservative for solving a solute transport problem involving a heterogeneous aquifer furthermore we showed that locally conservative gfems based on linear combination and average approaches give rise to two respective types of postprocessing techniques for calculating local mass fluxes an area weighted method and a first order taylor series truncation method analogous to the one dimensional solute transport problem above a two dimensional solute transport problem was proposed with a new postprocessing technique for computing integrated mass fluxes along the sides of mass conserved elements based on element matrices the local mass fluxes determined using the new proposed postprocessing techniques could be directly obtained from solutions of concentration distribution in a local domain in the gfems moreover the techniques efficiently computed local mass fluxes because they did not use global post processing whereby a linear system involving an entire domain must be solved this would result in excessive computational cost by contrast the local post processing techniques calculated the local mass fluxes using numerical concentrations at nodes associated with only finite elements overlapping into mass conserved elements to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed locally conservative gfem to the solute transport equation two cases with constant and spatially variable coefficients were considered in both one dimensional and two dimensional solute transport problems in each case grid sizes and time steps which affected the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration were altered to determine how the accuracies of local mass fluxes and local mass balance errors were affected by the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration furthermore to determine how respective accuracies of local mass fluxes and local mass balance errors in dispersion dominant and advection dominant cases were affected by numerical solutions of concentration high and low dispersivities were assumed in a push pull scenario as expected with larger grid sizes and time steps numerical concentration solutions became less accurate the corresponding accuracies of local mass fluxes were similar to those of concentration solutions affected by grid sizes and time steps numerical concentrations were less accurate at a higher peclet number in the advection dominant case than at a lower peclet number in the dispersion dominant case when discretization levels of time and space were identical in accordance with the accuracies of numerical concentrations local mass fluxes were also less accurate at higher peclet numbers however for all cases considered above local mass balance errors were negligible regardless of the accuracies of numerical solutions of concentration and local mass flux rather local mass balance errors were primarily dependent on grid size this does not imply true perfect local mass conservation when significant numerical errors are involved in the calculation of numerical concentrations local mass balances are conserved in terms of numerical mass fluxes only which might contain substantial numerical errors due to inaccurate numerical concentrations rather than in terms of true mass fluxes therefore if the numerical solutions of concentration are close to the exact solutions i e highly accurate the calculated local mass fluxes can almost approximate true mass flux the corresponding calculated local mass balances are likely to be practically meaningful because the calculated inflow and outflow across the subdomain of interest are almost the same as the true values also according to all results in this study local mass balance errors of the proposed gfem were remarkably smaller than the conventional gfem where the local mass balance errors from the proposed gfem were about several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional gfem therefore gfem with the proposed postprocessing approaches showed superior performance over the conventional gfem with respect to local mass conservation computation finally extensive future research is needed regarding the proposed locally conservative gfem various types of elements should be considered including three dimensional elements furthermore this proposed approach might extend to multiphase flow problems to address practical problems that are more likely to be encountered in real world scenarios credit

4793,while submarine groundwater discharge sgd is well known to release large amounts of dissolved nutrients and organic carbon into the ocean the contribution of sgd to the marine inorganic carbon cycle is poorly understood here the biogeochemistry of inorganic carbon in an intertidal aquifer and related sgd derived fluxes into tolo harbor hong kong was investigated over tidal and seasonal time scales the results revealed the production of total alkalinity talk and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the intertidal aquifer over the entire salinity range the locally produced talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer contributed to 50 of the talk and dic discharged with sgd to the ocean the distributions of talk and dic in the transition mangrove and high salinity bare beach zones were different due to the distinct hydrogeological and geochemical conditions in the organic rich mangrove zone talk and dic productions were driven by biotic processes such as aerobic respiration denitrification and sulfate reduction in the organic poor bare beach zone talk and dic productions were likely driven by abiotic processes such as precipitation dissolution of carbonate minerals temperature ph physical mixing and iron cycling in the intertidal aquifer also considerably influenced the carbonate biogeochemistry talk inventory in the intertidal aquifer was seasonally stable but talk discharged with sgd was 60 greater in the wet season than in the dry season 73 3 vs 45 6 mol d 1 per m coastline the dic inventory in the intertidal aquifer and dic discharged with sgd were 24 and 95 higher respectively in the wet season than dry season overall through analyzing talk dic ratios and related fluxes sgd was thought to reduce the co2 buffering capacity of the receiving ocean and act as a local driver of ocean acidification keywords coastal inorganic carbon biogeochemistry mangrove intertidal aquifer wetlands 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is an important source of carbon nutrient and trace metal to the ocean and has a major influence on solute mass balance and marine productivity liu et al 2014 moore 2010 nutrient and carbon fluxes can contribute to primary production liu et al 2012 luo et al 2018 red tides lee and kim 2007 coral reef growth mcmahon and santos 2017 paytan et al 2006 street et al 2008 as well as degradation of coastal ecosystems lubarsky et al 2018 intertidal aquifers are an active zone of biogeochemical reactions due to mixing between fresh groundwater fgw and seawater liu et al 2018b 2018c the transition zone of fgw and seawater is often referred as a subterranean estuary moore 1999 and plays an important role in modifying chemical fluxes to the ocean biogeochemical reactions in this zone have been found to control sgd derived chemical fluxes such as nutrients gonneea and charette 2014 santos et al 2008 carbons liu et al 2017a roy et al 2013 santos et al 2009b trace metals beck et al 2010 o connor et al 2018 reckhardt et al 2017 and radium isotopes liu et al 2018c moore et al 2011 many studies indicated that total alkalinity talk and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in sgd flux are produced in intertidal aquifer cai et al 2000 chaillou et al 2014 maher et al 2013 moore et al 2011 rao et al 2014 however liu et al 2017a found that the aquifer with intermediate salinity removes talk in groundwater so is intertidal aquifer a source or sink of talk and dic for coastal seawater the different findings of previous studies may be caused by the site specific characteristics and also lack of comprehensive understanding of the production removal processes of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer therefore investigating the production and removal mechanism of talk and dic is crucial to clarify the role of intertidal aquifer in land sea carbon cycle cai et al 2003 2000 liu et al 2017a understanding carbonate biogeochemistry in the intertidal aquifer is challenging due to multiple biotic and abiotic reactions such as organic matter remineralization and carbonates dissolution precipitation the remineralization pathways of organic matter include aerobic respiration denitrification manganese reduction iron reduction sulfate reduction methanogenesis and fermentation these processes alter talk dic and dissolved organic carbon doc in coastal groundwater through production or consumption of chemical species such as co2 hco3 nh3 h and hs that are components of talk and or dic cai et al 2003 these remineralization pathways are site specific and complex cai et al 2003 indicated that organic carbon degradation driven by sulfate reduction modified the conservative mixing of dic between fgw and seawater in an intertidal aquifer in south carolina united states similarly organic carbon degradation via sulfate reduction was found to be the major source of talk and dic in an intertidal aquifer of gulf of st lawrence canada chaillou et al 2014 and organic rich mangrove aquifer in evans head australia santos et al 2019 however in an intertidal aquifer of waquoit bay usa aerobic respiration and denitrification was regarded as the driver of talk and dic enrichments in coastal groundwater liu et al 2017a besides the biotic reactions organic matter remineralization abiotic reactions such as oxidation of reduced species and precipitation or dissolution of carbonate minerals calcite dolomite and aragonites are also influencing factors of carbonate biogeochemistry krumins et al 2013 liu et al 2017a rao et al 2014 saderne et al 2019 stumm and morgan 2012 for example talk can be decreased by the production of h through fe2 oxidation liu et al 2017a while carbonate mineral dissolution was shown to play a minor role in the variation of groundwater talk and dic in an intertidal aquifer in waquoit bay liu et al 2017a calcite dissolution was found to be the major factor influencing talk and dic in the low salinity region of an intertidal aquifer in north inlet south carolina cai et al 2003 the balance between the calcite dissolution and calcification determines the caco3 burial co2 emissions and subsequently affects talk and dic dynamics in coastal groundwater saderne et al 2019 therefore due to the distinct hydrologic geologic and redox conditions of the intertidal aquifer at different locations varieties of biotic and abiotic reactions could be the controlling factors of talk and dic dynamics in the intertidal aquifer even in the same intertidal aquifer zones with various water sources and salinity may also have different redox conditions and reactions liu et al 2018c more importantly the flow dynamics and redox conditions varies with external driving forces with different time scales such as tidal fluctuation and seasonal hydrologic variations liu et al 2018d moore et al 2011 however previous studies cai et al 2003 chaillou et al 2014 did not address dynamics of dic and talk over tidal and seasonal scales even though liu et al 2017a presented the seasonal variation of dic and talk of a sampling profile in the intertidal aquifer the variation of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer from land to sea need further investigation to provide comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution temporal variation and geochemical processes influencing the talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer most of previous studies on carbonate biogeochemistry in intertidal aquifers also provide estimates of sgd derived dic and talk fluxes to the ocean cai et al 2003 chaillou et al 2014 liu et al 2017a however how sgd derived dic flux contribute to the marine carbon cycle and whether sgd is a driver or a buffer of ocean acidification are remaining poorly understood while river inputs and coastal eutrophication are known to modify the seawater ph in coastal ocean borgesa and gypensb 2010 cai et al 2011 wang et al 2014 it remains unclear how sgd derived dic inputs influences coastal seawater ph due to comparatively limited investigation and quantification of sgd derived dic and talk fluxes it remains uncertain whether sgd is a driver or buffer for ocean acidification the ratios between talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer source are controlled by biotic and abiotic biogeochemical processes in today s oceans talk is usually higher than dic with talk dic ratios ranging from 1 05 to 1 19 egleston et al 2010 by examining buffer factors and the sensitivity of co2 and h concentrations and caco3 saturation to changes in dic and talk concentrations egleston et al 2010 suggested that the buffering capacity of the ocean to anthropogenic co2 dissolution is the lowest when talk dic ratio 1 therefore the talk dic ratio in external water flux can be used as an indicator for oceanic seawater ph variation for example external inputs with a talk dic ratio 1 would increase the ocean water talk dic ratio increasing its co2 buffering capacity in seawater as a result if the talk dic ratio in sgd is 1 sgd decreases buffer capacity and serves as local driver of ocean acidification while talk dic ratio is 1 in sgd making sgd a buffer for ocean acidification liu et al 2017a robinson et al 2018 while sgd is well known to release nutrients metals and organic carbons to oceans the amount of dic and talk carried by sgd is poorly quantified the carbonate biogeochemistry in the intertidal aquifer explaining the sources and variation of sgd derived dic and talk fluxes also remains poorly understood here we described the spatial distribution in the entire intertidal aquifer over diel and seasonal scales and seasonal sgd derived talk and dic fluxes into the coastal ocean of tolo harbor hong kong we hypothesize that the spatial distribution and sgd derived dic and talk fluxes experience diel and seasonal cycles due to coupled effects of tidal pumping seasonal rainfall and biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer field data are used to quantify sgd derived fluxes and investigate the biogeochemical drivers of dic and talk production or consumption over seasonal and diel scales in addition the major biotic and abiotic pathways of inorganic carbon cycling are identified and the implication of sgd fluxes to ocean acidification is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study site tolo harbor area 52 km2 coastline length 82 km is a semi closed embayment located at the northeast of new territories hong kong fig 1 a due to the bottlenecked configuration of the harbor and northeasterly wind direction there is limited exchange between the harbor and open seawater tolo harbor has been suffering from eutrophication for over 40 years lee et al 2012 resulting in serious ecological problems such as red tides and degradation of coral communities luo and jiao 2016 wong et al 2018 the semi diurnal tide in tolo harbor has a mean level of 1 45 mpd meter above principal datum and average tidal amplitude of 1 06 m liu et al 2017b the study site 22 280 06 91 n 114 13 002 22 e is a shallow intertidal aquifer with a gentle beach slope 1 at the north coast of plover cove fig 1a the sediments of the sandy beach can be classified as well sorted gravelly sand according to the unified soil classification system uscs the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer measured via falling head test is 4 5 0 4 m day and 1 6 0 5 m day for the bare beach and mangrove soil respectively and the porosity of the surficial sediments for both mangrove and bare beach is measured to be 0 3 a permanent multilevel sampling system luo et al 2017 containing 11 sampling sites l1 l5 above and s1 s6 below mean tidal mark was installed to sample groundwater across the intertidal zone fig 1b sampling sites l1 l3 were installed in a mangrove zone while l4 l5 and s1 s6 were installed in the bare sandy beach four monitoring wells named d1 to d4 with automatic pressure transducers were installed in different lateral locations of the intertidal aquifer to obtain the groundwater table which was used to obtain the sgd flux according to the recharge and discharge induced water table fluctuation liu et al 2018a in addition d4 was installed offshore with the open top submerged in seawater to catch the sea level fluctuation some groundwater and ancillary data have previously been used in studies evaluating the major ion liu et al 2017b trace metal liu et al 2019 radium isotopes liu et al 2018c and nutrient liu et al 2018d 2017c processes in the intertidal aquifer all the dic talk and major ion na k mg2 ca2 so4 2 and cl data in march april may and december 2016 in groundwater and the river water data reported here are new data the intertidal aquifer can be separated into a fgw zone l1 and l2 4 salinity 1 transition zone l2 and l3 1 salinity 25 and high salinity zone l4 l5 s1 s6 salinity 25 fig 1b table 1 liu et al 2017c 2018d due to the different ph oxidation reduction potential orp stable isotopic δ2h and δ18o and chemical compositions table 1 the fgw region is divided into shallow fgw l1 1 and l1 2 and deep fgw l2 4 zones the deep fgw zone is oxic orp 0 mv with low ph 5 92 0 3 and the shallow fgw zone is slightly reduced orp 10 mv with higher ph 6 13 0 31 groundwater in the transition zone and high salinity zone is reduced with average orp values of 100 72 and 106 28 mv respectively the near surface region of the transition zone organic rich mangrove zone in fig 1b is highly reduced orp 150 mv the salinity and ph across the entire intertidal aquifer are lower in the rainy season compared with the dry season liu 2017 liu et al 2018d groundwater temperature has a clear seasonality with higher temperatures observed from april to december liu et al 2018b 2018d the for more details of the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of salinity ph temperature and orp in the entire intertidal aquifer can be found in supporting information of liu et al 2018d here for convenience for reader the figures shown the salinity ph temperature and orp are also included in supporting information of this study figs s1 s4 2 2 sampling approach and methods groundwater sampling was performed in 2016 over semi diurnal and seasonal time scales seasonal sampling was performed on 24 february 11 march 25 april 20 october and 13 december for all the sampling sites fig 1 precipitation over the sampling period is shown in fig 2 a the samples collected over seasonal time scale were collected during the low tide of the spring tide period to minimize changes caused by short term tidal drivers in addition to groundwater sample collection a nearshore seawater sample was collected at the low tide during each sampling campaign groundwater samples were also collected from the fgw and transition zones l1 l3 four times from may 23 and 25 2016 at different tidal phases low tide med tide and high tide fig 2b a nearshore seawater sample was also collected at each tidal phase river water samples were collected from tai po kau tpk and shan liu sl rivers in 2016 fig 1a salinity ph dissolved oxygen do temperature and orp were measured with a calibrated portable meter hi98194 hanna instruments immediately after the sample collection for all samples groundwater was pumped with a peristatic pump and the sampling tube was placed at the bottom of the cap of meter a beaker with a volume 100 ml which can be screwed onto the probe body for protection until fulfilled the probes for measurement of physicochemical parameters were then submerged into the water and the cap was screwed on the probe body to eliminate the contact with air the whole procedure last for only several seconds and measurement is believed to have very limited influences of air the calibration of the portable meter was conducted in laboratory with a three points 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 calibration of ph was applied using the nbs scale at room temperature 25 c following the standard procedures specified by hanna instruments the resolutions and accuracies of salinity ph do temperature and orp are 0 01 and 0 01 0

in the field 2 hno3 solution was added to the cation na k mg2 and ca2 samples to prevent precipitation after this pretreatment the anion cl and so4 2 and cation samples were refrigerated 4 c the groundwater samples 100 ml were titrated with 0 16 n or 1 6 n h2so4 solution to obtain talk boyd 2015 the dic and pco2 were calculated using the co2sys program lewis and wallace 1998 based on the talk ph salinity and temperature data cao et al 2011 dissociation constants for carbonic acid boric acid bisulfate ion and hydrogen fluoride in the co2sys were selected from millero et al 2006 lee et al 2010 dickson 1981 and perez and fraga 1987 respectively in carbonate chemistry ph talk dic and pco2 can be calculated co2sys if any two of the four parameters are known the application of co2sys to calculate the other components of dic such as dissolved carbon dioxide co2 aqu hco3 and co3 2 is common in literature cao et al 2011 harris et al 2013 liu et al 2017a zhai et al 2014 the anion samples were analyzed via ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 1100 with analytical errors 3 the cation samples were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes by analyzing a standard after every ten measurements the accuracy and precision of cation analysis was estimated to be 99 2 3 mass balance model the mass balance of water and solute in the intertidal aquifer was conducted as described by liu et al 2018d 2019 1 w a t e r b a l a n c e f s w r f f g r f s g d 2 s o l u t e b a l a n c e f s w r c i s w δ t f f g r c i f g δ t f s g d c i s g d δ t δ

s w r f f g r and f s g d are the seawater recharge flux fgw recharge flux and sgd flux respectively c i s w c i f g and c i s g d are the concentrations of solute i in nearshore seawater fgw and saline groundwater in the intertidal aquifer respectively i i t is the inventory of solute i at time t n is the porosity of the intertidal aquifer c i t is the concentration of solute i at time t ω is the space of the intertidal aquifer δ i i is the inventory change of solute i from time t to t δ t r i is the net production or removal rate of solute i in the aquifer during the time period δ t in this study solute i is talk or dic in the calculations it is assumed that δ t 1 d because the water flux was estimated with a temporal resolution of 1 day more importantly one day corresponds to two tidal cycles with no significant differences in tidal level between the sampling time t and t δ t therefore the talk and dic variation induced by tidal level change can be neglected in the seasonal analysis the fresh sgd flux was estimated via darcy s law by considering the groundwater hydraulic gradient aquifer thickness and aquifer hydraulic conductivities liu et al 2018a the groundwater hydraulic gradient was obtained by monitoring the groundwater level in two wells d1 and a temporary well 40 m landward to d1 the tide driven saline sgd was calculated via the water storage change in the intertidal aquifer between high and low tide periods by monitoring the water table difference santos et al 2009a the saline sgd driven by tidal fluctuation was calculated with a resolution of 0 5 d all the details of sgd calculation and data can be found in liu et al 2018a seasonal sgd rates are provided in table s1 2 4 non conservative mixing model dissolved chemicals in the intertidal aquifer generally have non conservative mixing due to the biogeochemical reactions to evaluate the degree of non conservative transport of dissolved chemicals in the intertidal aquifer the ionic delta which describes the difference between the measured concentration and theoretically calculated conservative concentration was calculated cai et al 2003 liu et al 2017c 5 δ m i m i s a m p l e m i m i

respectively f s e a is the fraction of seawater which is calculated from the chloride cl concentration in the groundwater samples the fraction f s e a was calculated by 7 f s e a m c l s a m p l e m c l f r e s h m c l s e a m c l f r e s h where m c l s a m p l e m c l f r e s h and m c l s e a are the concentration of cl in the groundwater sample freshwater endmember and seawater endmember respectively a typical open seawater from the northern south china sea is selected as the seawater endmember since it has the limited uncertainty and the least anthropogenic interferes liu 2014 the deep fresh groundwater collected from l2 4 in each month was applied as the groundwater endmember the deep fresh groundwater upwells from deep aquifer and has less anthropogenic interferes the offset between the observed data talk dic and h and conservative mixing line between the freshwater and seawater endmembers is regarded as a result of biogeochemical reactions in the intertidal aquifer the observed data over below the conservative mixing line indicates the production consumption of talk dic and h in the intertidal aquifer the details of the major ion concentrations in each endmember are listed in table 3 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns the talk distribution shows a clear spatial zonation across the intertidal aquifer fig 3 generally fgw had low talk with seasonal mean value of 1352 243 μmol kg 1 for shallow fgw l1 1 and l1 2 and 760 106 μmol kg 1 for deep fgw l2 4 coinciding with the low ph 6 13 0 51 for shallow fgw and 5 92 0 30 for deep fgw table 1 in the transition zone with distance between 50 and 30 m talk increased to 2410 1299 μmol kg 1 the highest talk 3588 μmol kg 1 at the near surface area of the transition zone l2 1 and l3 1 exceeded infiltrated seawater 1720 357 μmol kg 1 and fgw from inland suggesting an internal source of talk in the intertidal aquifer as expected the spatial distribution of pco2 fig 4 was the opposite of talk fig 3 with highest pco2 in fgw and lowest in the high salinity zone with distance between 30 and 50 m the reverse trend between pco2 and talk may be partially due to the transformation from dissolved carbon dioxide co2 aqu in fgw with low ph 6 13 0 31 in shallow fgw and 5 92 0 30 in deep fgw in table 1 to hco3 in saline groundwater with more neutral ph 6 24 0 28 in table 1 in the high salinity zone with distance between 30 and 50 m in fig 3 the seasonal mean talk was much higher than that in the transition zone with distance between 50 and 30 m in fig 3 3735 1023 versus 2410 1299 μmol kg 1 table 1 the vertical distribution of talk in high salinity zone differed from the transition zone for example talk in the transition zone was high near the surface on contrary talk was higher in the deep location of the high salinity zone talk was 2520 μmol kg 1 at 0 5 m and 4920 μmol kg 1 at 2 0 m depth at the sampling site l5 in april in addition locations close to the sea 20 50 m had lower talk than further inland 20 10 m implying dilution by seawater with lower talk 1720 357 μmol kg 1 the different veritical distributions of talk in the transition and high salinity zones suggest different spatial controlling mechanisms of talk production and removal in the two zones pco2 in the high salinity zone fig 4 was low 3400 3300 μatm only 3 of dic was co2 aqu in the high salinity zone table 1 the spatial distribution of dic fig 5 in fgw was similar to that of pco2 since the major component of dic was co2 aqu 64 in table 1 the distribution of dic in the transition zone and high salinity zone was similar to talk since the major component of dic was hco3 94 in table 1 3 2 semi diurnal variations the distribution of talk dic pco2 ph and salinity in the intertidal aquifer varied over the tidal cycle fig 6 and table s2 during the rising tide from low tide 1 02 m to high tide 0 58 m talk was elevated at the near surface area while pco2 was elevated in the fgw the increase of talk coincided with the increase of salinity at the near surface area during high tide indicating the close relationship of talk production and seawater infiltration for example talk at l3 1 the near surface area increased from 3100 μmol kg 1 to 3720 μmol kg 1 and the pco2 in fgw at l1 2 increased from 25 869 μatm to 55 971 μatm when the sea level rose from 1 02 m fig 6 a1 to 0 58 m fig 6 b3 the elevated talk was produced within the aquifer since both the freshwater and marine endmembers had a lower talk the seaward movement of fgw at high tide was observed from the pco2 fig 6 c3 but the phase lag of pco2 was not clear due to the sampling resolution according to ph fluctuation the highest ph was observed 3 h behind the highest tide while the lowest ph was observed 11 h behind the lowest tide liu et al 2018b the dic variations were mainly controlled by the changes in both hco3 and co2 aqu since 1 of dic presents as co3 2 as the groundwater ph was 5 84 7 34 high dic was observed at both the near surface area and fgw zone at high tide fig 6 for example dic at l3 1 near surface area was 5200 μmol kg 1 at high tide 60 greater than at low tide the dic at l1 2 fgw was 3172 μmol kg 1 at high tide 50 greater than at low tide the increase in dic at the near surface area was mainly due to an increase in co2 aqu 65 but the increase of hco3 35 played a minor role as a result the increase in dic at the near surface area at high tide was greater than the increase in talk the change of dic in the fgw was due to the variation in co2 aqu as the talk variations were limited in the fgw and 40 of the dic was co2 aqu during the tidal cycle 3 3 seasonal variations talk in fgw was relatively constant between the monthly sampling events with 4 variation table s3 in contrast in the transition zone with distance between 50 and 30 m talk varied between the monthly sampling events at the near surface area l3 1 and l2 1 for example much higher talk concentrations were observed at the near surface area l3 1 and l2 1 of the transition zone in october 4100 μmol kg 1 and december 3600 μmol kg 1 compared to february 3260 μmol kg 1 and march 2740 μmol kg 1 fig 3 indicating that the production of talk in this zone had seasonal variation in contrast talk was relatively constant for locations above the mean tidal mark 30 0 m in the high salinity zone indicating a comparative stable production rate of talk the different seasonal variations of the talk production rates in the two zones suggested the distinct geochemical reactions responsible for the production however for locations below the mean tidal mark with distance between 0 and 50 m talk was lower in october and december compared to february march and april in the wet season the heavy precipitation directly diluted talk in seawater and also lowered seawater ph this may explain why talk was low in october below the mean tidal mark where seawater exchange across the aquifer ocean interface was important fig 3d a seaward movement of the talk plume in december compared to october at the location with distance of 10 m indicated that the system was recovering from heavy rainfall fig 3e the spatial distribution of pco2 had clear seasonality fig 4 with higher pco2 in the fgw in wet season october 1 16 105 µatm than in the other seasons february 4 36 104 µatm march 3 85 104 µatm april 1 78 104 µatm and december 5 92 104 µatm the heavy rainfall with low ph 4 3 in october led to a lower fgw ph 5 60 compared to 6 06 6 08 6 47 and 5 93 in february march april and december respectively due to the mixing with seawater ph increased seaward leading to a decrease in co2 aqu in the aquifer the seasonality of dic in the intertidal aquifer was related to both talk and pco2 in the fgw talk was relatively constant but both dic and pco2 changed following precipitation in the high salinity zone the dic patterns fig 5 were similar to the talk patterns fig 3 in the transition zone due to mixing of saline groundwater and fgw dic seasonal variation was related to both pco2 and talk with higher dic in the wet season october than other seasons february march april and december 3 4 inventories and fluxes the inventory of talk in the intertidal aquifer was relatively constant 337 328 339 339 and 346 mol per m coastline in february march april october and december respectively with no significant seasonal variation 2 fig 7 a and table s4 however the total sgd derived talk flux increased considerably in the wet season 73 3 mol d 1 per m coastline in october compared to the dry season 48 2 mol d 1 per m coastline because of the increase of water flux in wet season fig 7b and table s4 the dic inventory in the wet season 471 6 mol per m coastline in october was higher than that in dry season 402 1 mol per m coastline fig 7a and table s4 the increase in dic inventory in october was due to the heavy precipitation the heavy precipitation lowered fgw ph driving dissolution of carbonates which increases dic in fgw in addition the heavy precipitation also elevated the groundwater level inland which in turn enhances the seaward flow of fgw the sgd derived dic flux 93 3 mol d 1 per m coastline in october was about 2 fold greater than that in the dry season 51 8 mol d 1 per m coastline fig 7b and table s4 4 discussion 4 1 the production of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer the spatial distribution of talk and dic species in the intertidal aquifer was controlled by multiple physical and biogeochemical factors such as salinity ph carbon availability temperature and microbial communities cai et al 2003 liu et al 2017a endmember mixing analysis was conducted using salinity as a conservative parameter to qualitatively characterize production consumption of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer chaillou et al 2014 couturier et al 2017 gonneea and charette 2014 santos et al 2009b the data showed that most talk and dic samples in the transition zone and high salinity zone were above the theoretical conservative mixing line indicating talk and dic production fig 8 and h depletion across the salinity gradient fig 9 the observed talk and dic production was consistent with observations from nearshore aquifers in the gulf of st lawrence quebec canada chaillou et al 2014 north inlet south carolina usa cai et al 2003 and the wadden sea germany santos et al 2015 but different from observations in waquoit bay massachusetts usa liu et al 2017a in waquoit bay talk consumption was observed in saline water and was attributed to the production of protons h during the oxidative precipitation of ferrous iron fe2 and formation of an iron curtain iron oxides charette and sholkovitz 2002 liu et al 2017a however in addition to iron oxide precipitation iron sulfide fes precipitates had been observed in many nearshore aquifers such as gulf of st lawrence qc canada chaillou et al 2014 cape shores lewes delaware usa mcallister et al 2015 indian river lagoon florida usa roy et al 2012 and tolo harbor hong kong sar china liu et al 2019 iron sulfide mineral precipitation occured under reducing conditions that were also favorable to iron oxide dissolution roy et al 2010 therefore it was possible that the transformation between fes minerals and dissolved ferrous iron fe2 table 2 explained the variation of talk in the gulf of st lawrence qc canada chaillou et al 2014 and tolo harbor this study the different biogeochemical cycling including types of iron precipitates in the intertidal aquifer well explained the different production and consumption of talk and dic highlighting the potentially important role biogeochemical iron cycling may have on carbonate geochemistry besides biogeochemical influences the carbonate chemistry in intertidal aquifer was also influenced by hydrologic variations dorsett et al 2011 roy et al 2013 2010 talk and dic production generally increased with salinity in the transition zone fig 8 located in the mangrove area with distance between 55 and 30 m in fig 1b the high soil organic content and salinity at the near surface area liu et al 2018d of the mangrove zone may promote fes precipitation and talk production roy et al 2012 santos et al 2019 lower excess talk and dic in the high salinity zone with distance between 30 and 50 m fig 8 may be due to mixing with recirculating seawater which has lower talk and dic concentrations seawater infiltrating into the intertidal aquifer increased the groundwater salinity but decreased talk and dic concentrations the low organic content in the sediments in the high salinity zone compared to the mangrove zone was likely associated with low microbial activities preventing the production of sufficient talk and dic to counterbalance the dilution by seawater infiltration therefore different distribution and dynamics of talk and dic in the two zones of the intertidal aquifer mangroves and bare beach zones suggested the unique production pathways the talk dic ratios in the different zones of the intertidal aquifer were variable indicating dissimilar biogeochemistry of talk and dic in each zone fig 10 a the variation of dic was much larger than talk in the fgw zone fig 10a due to the large variation of co2 aqu in low ph fgw however the talk dic ratio 0 91 in the high salinity zone was close to 1 1 indicating the variation of talk was very close to the variation of dic in groundwater which indicated that hco3 as the only shared ion in talk and dic was the dominant component of both dic and talk in this high ph zone both groundwater ph table 1 and talk dic ratio 0 65 fig 10a were intermediate in the transition zone therefore ph controled the partitioning of dic between co2 aqu hco3 and co3 2 4 2 biogeochemical pathways in different zones of the intertidal aquifer the production of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer was a result of different biogeochemical pathways table 2 such as aerobic respiration anaerobic reactions denitrification manganese reduction iron reduction and sulfate reduction as well as abiotic dissolution of carbonate minerals cai et al 2003 chaillou et al 2014 liu et al 2017a 2017c which could be site specific and may have seasonal changes in reaction intensity for example sulfate reduction was recognized as important pathway for talk and dic production in many organic rich sites such as salt marshes in north inlet in the united states cai et al 2003 gulf of st lawrence in canada chaillou et al 2014 mangroves in australia santos et al 2019 and tolo harbor in hong kong china sar liu et al 2017c however aerobic respiration and denitrification were found to be more important than sulfate reduction in waquoit bay massachusetts united states liu et al 2017a here we used the ratios and slopes of the δtalk and δdic to infer the biogeochemical reactions that may control talk and dic at our site the δtalk δdic ratios in different biogeochemical pathways were illustrated in fig 11 the δtalk and δdic were calculated according to the offset between the measured data tables s3 and s5 and conservative mixing section 2 4 between the mixing endmembers listed in table 3 the samples from the high salinity zone were mostly located between caco3 dissolution δtalk δdic 2 and denitrification or sulfate reduction slopes δtalk δdic 1 while most samples from the transition zone were located between the denitrification or sulfate reduction δtalk δdic 1 and aerobic respiration δtalk δdic 0 2 fig 11 the wide range of slopes suggested that multiple different reactions control the production and consumption of talk and dic in each zone the scattered distribution of fgw samples shown in fig 11suggested that it was not possible to determine the sources of talk and dic in this zone in the transition zone iron sulfide precipitation δtalk δdic 1 and iron reduction δtalk δdic 8 liu et al 2019 may explain the negative δdic observed in fig 11 as for the production of talk and dic the most likely pathway was aerobic respiration and denitrification or sulfate reduction fig 11 the dissolution of calcium carbonates was not expected to be the major contributor since δtalk δdic ratio was considerably 2 in the transition zone in addition the deep area with low ph deep groundwater should have a higher dissolution rate of calcium carbonates which should result in higher concentration of talk compared to the near surface area if dissolution of calcium carbonates was the major driver of talk production in this zone it was expected that aerobic respiration would contribute to talk and dic production to some extent since both fgw and seawater endmembers had high do concentration indicating the consumption of do in the aquifer liu et al 2018b 2018d in addition short term sampling data indicated that the do concentrations in the transition zone vary through the tidal cycle indicating changing redox conditions in the aquifer furthermore the δtalk δdic ratio in the transition zone was closer to the denitrification or sulfate reduction ratio 1 fig 11 suggesting that the two processes may be contributing to the production of talk and dic the significant linear relationship between sulfate depletion talk production fig 12 a suggested that sulfate reduction may be a large contributor to talk and dic production in the transition zone as for denitrification the low concentrations of both ammonium 13 µm and nitrate 3 µm seemed to not support the large observed production of talk and dic in the transition zone when considering the stoichiometric reactions table 2 however the deficit of sulphate was several mm during sulfate reduction which could result in hundreds of µm nitrogen production as suggested in liu et al 2018d the scheme of the nitrogen cycle in this aquifer was remineralization denitrification as such it was possible that denitrification may also contribute to the production of talk and dic in the aquifer based on the stoichiometric reaction table 2 during sulfate reduction 1 mm sulphate depletion was associated with 1 3 mm nitrogen and 2 mm of talk the subsequent depletion of 1 3 mm of nitrogen depletion via denitrification produced around 1 3 mm talk as a result the amount of talk produced via sulfate reduction directly was six times that of the talk produced via denitrification of nitrogen as a byproduct of sulphate reduction based on this stoichiometry and also the linear relationship between the production of talk and depletion of sulphate fig 12a and distribution of δtalk δdic ratio in the transition zone fig 11 it was concluded that sulfate reduction is the dominant process responsible for talk and dic in the transition zone in summary data indicated that the biotic processes were the main contributor to talk and dic production in the transition zone of which sulfate reduction was the dominant biotic process compared to aerobic respiration and denitrification in the high salinity zone the δtalk and δdic data were plotted between calcium carbonate mineral dissolution and denitrification or sulfate reduction lines fig 11 however sulfate reduction and denitrification were unlikely to considerably influence talk and dic production in this zone firstly the correlation between the sulfate depletion δso4 2 and production of talk δtalk was very poor fig s5 which indicated that sulfate reduction was not the dominant factor as we discussed in the transition zone denitrification only contributed about 1 6 of the talk production via sulfate reduction therefore denitrification was a minor factor for talk production in the high salinity zone secondly the comparatively high dissolved inorganic nitrogen e g 46 µm at 0 5 m versus 3 µm at 2 0 m at s1 in february at the near surface area liu et al 2018d should have supported a high denitrification rate and production of talk and dic at the near surface area however the high concentrations of talk and dic were not observed at the near surface area figs 3 and 5 the significant linear relationship between δtalk and δca2 fig 12b suggested that calcium carbonate mineral dissolution may control the dic and talk dynamics in the high salinity zone surprisingly the production of talk positive δtalk was also observed when δca2 was negative fig 12b the precipitation of calcium minerals in a form of gypsum caso4 calcite caco3 and aragonite caco3 would remove ca2 however these processes would not produce talk therefore no single mineral precipitation or dissolution could explain the observations the combined effect of dissolution precipitation of multiple minerals was very likely to occur we examined the saturation index of common minerals such as gypsum calcite aragonite dolomite camg co3 2 and huntite camg3 co3 4 figs s6 s10 table s6 and found that gypsum was consistently under saturated fig s6 therefore it was unlikely that gypsum precipitation accounts for the removal of ca2 in contrast dolomite was consistently supersaturated throughout the sampling year fig s7 indicating the possibility of dolomite precipitation in the intertidal aquifer however dolomite precipitation in seawater was unlikely with dolomitization only occurring under specific conditions such as high temperature low ca2 mg2 and low ca2 co3 2 machel and mountjoy 1986 two sediment samples at s1 with depths of 0 25 and 0 5 m were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd and no dolomite signal was found therefore the removal of ca2 was not due to dolomitization it was unclear why the dolomitization did not occur even when a supersaturation of dolomite was observed one possible reason was that the aquifer lacked the bacteria needed for dolomitization and another possible reason was that the sample collected in this site was too shallow this unsolved question would be addressed in the future study besides the oversaturation of dolomite the aragonite and calcite were over saturated in most samples over the sampling period figs s8 s9 whereas huntite was under saturated in most samples through the sampling period fig s10 this indicated that calcite aragonite precipitation may be removing ca2 and talk while huntite may be supplying ca2 and talk at the same time if we assumed that calcite aragonite precipitation huntite dissolution occured simultaneously it was possible for net talk production and net ca2 removal to occur due to the fact that huntite dissolution produced talk and ca2 with a ratio of 8 1 eq 9 while aragonite calcite removed talk and ca2 with a ratio of 2 1 eq 10 9 h u n t i t e d i s s o l u t i o n c a m g 3 c o 3 4 4 h 2

biogeochemistry the diurnal variation of talk dic and pco2 fig 6 was resulted from the combination influences of tidal fluctuation induced seawater groundwater mixing and day night shift induced variation of co2 uptake and respiration of mangrove roots the effect of tidal fluctuation on talk dic and pco2 was not uniformed in the entire transition zone at the near surface area tidal fluctuation affected the talk dic and pco2 directly by increasing the physical mixing between the seawater and groundwater higher salinity at high tide due to the infiltration of seawater from the beach fig 6d in addition the organic matter and oxygen carried by the seawater facilitate the mineralization of organic matter which influenced the short term variation of talk dic and pco2 in deep area the physical mixing salinity in response to tidal fluctuation had a phase lag since the transport of chemicals in the aquifer need time levanon et al 2016 for example the ph and radium isotopes variations in deep locations were observed about 12 h behind the sea level change liu et al 2018b 2018c the activity of microbial communities may also be affected by the shift of salinity for example through flow through reaction experiments methanogenesis and denitrification were found to decrease with salinity while carbon mineralization was found increase with salinity weston et al 2006 in addition to tidal fluctuation induced physical mixing change the day night shift induced change of co2 uptake and respiration of mangrove roots was another important factor for the carbonate chemistry change over short time scale the shutdown of photosynthesis at night reduced the co2 removal from the groundwater and caused the decrease of ph and increase of pco2 fig 6c e the day night shift induced temperature change could be another factor for the short term dynamics of dic and talk the temperature change directly affected the solubility of co2 in groundwater therefore the comparatively low temperature in night time leaded to a high pco2 as observed in fig 6c even though the comparatively low temperature would decrease the microbial activity gödde and conrad 1999 thamdrup and fleischer 1998 but the overall change of temperature was below 3 c liu et al 2018b which would not cause significant change of microbial activity over a tidal scale rainfall and evapotranspiration induced seasonal hydrologic variation in the terrestrial environment caused a change of talk and dic in the high salinity zone over seasonal scale figs 8 and 10b according to previous study liu et al 2018a fresh sgd could increase by 20 while tide driven sgd could increase by 50 the heavy rainfall induced fast circulation of seawater and freshwater discharge lowered the salinity and ph in the intertidal aquifer as observed in october figs s1 s2 on one hand the decreased groundwater ph liu et al 2017c 2018d altered the speciation of dic in groundwater the lower groundwater ph in the wet season may also facilitate the carbonate mineral dissolution since carbonate dissolution was generally ph dependent chou et al 1989 more importantly the increased flow velocity of groundwater discharge and circulation of seawater could bring more dissolved oxygen and organic matter for mineralization the produced co2 during the mineralization would facilitate the carbonate dissolution as a result an increased talk and dic production large offset from the conservative mixing line in wet season was observed fig 8 in addition the seasonal shift of temperature might be a potential influencing factor for the carbonate mineral dissolution and subsequently explained the variation of talk and dic fig 8 on one hand the high groundwater temperature potentially increased microbial activity gödde and conrad 1999 thamdrup et al 1998 and the heterotrophic respiration increased the dissolved co2 which would be buffered by the increased carbonate dissolution dorsett et al 2011 pain et al 2019 on the other hand high temperature increased the solubility of carbonate minerals in the intertidal aquifer sjöberg and rickard 1984 the contribution of sulfate reduction to talk production in the transition zone might be seasonal fig 12a if all talk was assumed to be produced from sulfate reduction the theoretical ratio between talk production and sulfate depletion should be 2 1 based on the stoichiometry of sulfate reduction table 2 additional production of talk via other processes such as aerobic respiration and denitrification could result in δtalk δso4 2 2 however the δtalk δso4 2 was 0 20 and 0 80 in the dry and wet season respectively which was much lower than 2 to account for δtalk δso4 2 2 other processes should remove carbonate species or produce h due to the extensive sulfate reduction it was likely that the reaction products h2s combined with the high dissolved ferrous iron fe2 to form iron sulfide or pyrite minerals liu et al 2019 the production of h via iron sulfide formation table 2 may explain δtalk δso4 2 2 in the transition zone since the iron oxidation and manganese oxidation both produce h but were not major processes at the study site liu et al 2019 in addition aerobic respiration may also cause δtalk δso4 2 2 in the transition zone however δtalk δso4 2 was lower in the dry season compared with the wet season indicating greater removal of hco3 in dry seasons theoretically the higher do seawater in the wet season should drive greater aerobic respiration and resulted in a higher removal of hco3 however this was not observed therefore aerobic respiration is not expected to be the major process removing hco3 in high salinity zone the observed ratio between δtalk and δca2 was 2 1 in dry seasons and 1 2 in wet season fig 12b the δtalk δca2 ratio 2 1 in wet season suggested the production of talk from a mineral with a theoretical ratio δtalk δca2 2 the huntite dissolution had a theoretical ratio δtalk δca2 of 8 eq 9 which could explain the observed data with removal of ca2 but production of talk more importantly the observed mg2 ca2 ratio in groundwater of the high salinity zone was generally higher than that in the nearshore seawater indicating more mg2 was produced than ca2 by geochemical processes table s5 therefore it was possible that huntite dissolution aragonite calcite precipitation was one of the major processes controlling the production of talk in the high salinity zone huntite dissolution followed by precipitation of aragonite calcite provided an example of element relocation in the intertidal aquifer 4 4 inorganic carbon flux and production rate there were multiple drivers forcing flow across the land sea interface and influences the marine environment which had been generalized in santos et al 2012 in an intertidal aquifer the typical driving forces for sgd included seasonal oscillation of the water table wave set up and tidal fluctuation and density differences between the seawater and fresh groundwater liu et al 2016 michael 2005 robinson et al 2007 in tolo harbor the sgd occurred in intertidal aquifer was mainly controlled by the tidal fluctuation and land sea hydraulic gradient the saline sgd was over 65 of the total sgd based on multiple previous estimations lee et al 2012 liu et al 2018a luo et al 2014 the sgd estimated via multiple methods including darcy s law and piezometer 222rn mass balance radium quartets three endmember mixing and si mass balance rangeed from 0 02 to 16 6 cm d which was comparable to the estimates in embayment harbors and coastal areas luo and jiao 2016 the seasonal variation of inland groundwater table caused by the non uniformed precipitation and evapotranspiration throughout a hydrology year led to a higher sgd both fresh and saline sgd in wet season than dry season liu et al 2018a sgd derived dic fluxes was estimated to be 95 greater in the wet season than in the dry season a similar seasonal shift was observed in the jiulong river estuary china wang et al 2015 waquoit bay massachusetts united states liu et al 2017a wang et al 2016 and southwest florida united states liu et al 2014 this seasonal shift could be related to temperature precipitation and redox conditions the seasonal change of these drivers alters sgd flow dynamics gonneea and charette 2014 liu et al 2017a wang et al 2015 the composition of both fgw and seawater endmembers liu et al 2017a and the biogeochemical reactions in the intertidal aquifer dorsett et al 2011 o connor et al 2018 the 95 increase in dic flux in the wet season compared to the dry season was due to an increase in both dic inventories 24 increase and sgd 76 increase flux the dic production in the intertidal aquifer was considerably higher in the wet season 44 2 and 53 7 mol d 1 per m coastline for talk and dic compared to the dry season 24 0 and 27 2 mol d 1 per m coastline for talk and dic fig 13 the talk and dic produced in the intertidal aquifer contributed to 50 of the sgd fluxes to the harbor in both dry and wet seasons fig 13 the proportion of sgd derived talk and dic flux associated with the production in the intertidal aquifer was much larger than the proportion in waquoit bay 5 for talk and 19 for dic liu et al 2017a combined with the literature chen et al 2018 our observations of high dic production indicates that intertidal aquifers can be significant sources of carbon to the coastal ocean especially in organic rich mangrove sediments if we upscale the talk flux calculated for the beach transect to the whole tolo harbor sgd derived talk fluxes were estimated to be 3 95 106 and 6 01 106 mol d 1 in the dry and wet seasons respectively this sgd derived talk flux was one order of magnitude greater than other pathways including river discharge 1 24 105 mol d 1 calculated from the river water talk data listed in table s7 table 4 suggesting that sgd was an important external talk source the sgd derived dic flux in the dry 3 93 106 mol d 1 and wet seasons 7 65 106 mol d 1 was larger than dic flux associated with river discharge 1 20 105 mol d 1 the contribution of sgd to coastal talk and dic budgets was still poorly understood and varied considerably between different field sites for example it had been estimated that sgd derived dic flux accounted for 45 110 of river discharge in jiulong river estuary china wang et al 2015 23 53 in pearl river estuary china liu et al 2012 22 75 in korogoro creek australia sadat noori et al 2016 200 in moreton bay australia stewart et al 2015 and 170 on the eastern united states coastline wang et al 2016 combined with these prior investigations our findings indicated that sgd could be a major yet often overlooked source of dic and talk to coastal waters 4 5 implications to ocean acidification the high pco2 was often observed in coastal groundwater despite the buffering by caco3 dissolution and serves as a co2 source for coastal waters pain et al 2019 the low talk dicratios in sgd may lead to a decrease in receiving coastal water ph sgd investigations in systems such as coastal wetlands de weys et al 2011 jeffrey et al 2016 mangroves chen et al 2018 santos et al 2019 coral reef lagoons cyronak et al 2014 wang et al 2014 estuaries sadat noori et al 2016 and coastal embayment liu et al 2017a had demonstrated the groundwater input would decrease the ph in receiving waters through continuously monitoring of sgd flux prior studies found the negative correlation between the sgd flux and seawater ph over tidal and seasonal scale demonstrating the contribution of groundwater as a driver of ocean acidification de weys et al 2011 egleston et al 2010 suggested the lowest buffering capacity of the ocean to atmospheric co2 when talk dic ratio 1 indicating that the talk dic ratio in coastal groundwater could be an indicator to identify the sgd contribution to ocean acidification as a driver or buffer for example in waquoit bay the sgd derived dic flux was found to be consistently greater than the talk flux suggesting that sgd may reduce the co2 buffering capacity of the coastal water liu et al 2017a however it was important to note that seawater ph could also increase due to enhanced biological productivity supported by sgd derived nutrients or by adsorption of protons on sediments lee and kim 2015 therefore site specific investigations were needed to determine the impact of sgd on the ph of receiving coastal waters in tolo harbor the talk dic ratio in sgd flux was 1 01 and 0 80 in the dry and wet seasons respectively table 4 indicating that the sgd flux tended to increase ph in coastal water in dry season but decrease ph in coastal water in wet season the increase in rainfall in the wet season rose the talk dic ratio 0 8 in sgd flux which decreased the overall seawater ph and strengthens ocean acidification in dry season the talk dic ratio was over 1 1 01 which would not strengthen ocean acidification however the talk dicratio in sgd flux was lower than that in the harbor seawater 1 1 in table 1 indicating that sgd may decrease the buffering capacity of atmospheric co2 in tolo harbor the findings of seasonal variation of talk dic ratio in sgd flux and decreasing of co2 buffering capacity by sgd were not specific to our study site the summarized talk dic ratios in sgd and seawater in different coastal ecosystems worldwide table 5 found that sgd talk dic ratios were generally lower than coastal seawater however field data from some sites including shelf waters off mangroves in australia sippo et al 2016 and nueces bay united states murgulet et al 2018 suggested sgd may ultimately increase the buffering capacity of coastal water after co2 equilibrates with the atmosphere for example by estimating the net inputs of talk and dic sippo et al 2019 found that talk inputs from mangrove was about 20 higher than dic inputs to coastal waters which would lead to overall increase of ph in receiving waters mangrove organic rich groundwater tended to have a high talk dic ratio compared to other systems table 5 suggesting that talk production may cause a localized increase in ocean ph following co2 degassing in addition a much higher production of talk in organic rich mangrove zone was observed in this study fig 3 suggesting the contribution of biogeochemical reactions in mangrove soil to buffer the groundwater acidity and could alter the situation of ocean acidification driven by sgd input therefore we suggested that sgd may be a driver of ocean acidification in most systems but a buffer in sgd derived from organic rich mangrove areas where talk production was high 5 conclusions quantification of carbonate biogeochemistry in intertidal aquifers and sgd derived carbon flux is challenging due to the complex and interacting hydrodynamics hydrogeology and biogeochemistry our new field data illustrated clear temporal variation in the distribution of talk and dic in an intertidal aquifer of tolo harbor hong kong at the semi diurnal and seasonal scales both tidal pumping and seasonal hydrologic variation led to changes in the dic production rate in the intertidal aquifer multiple abiotic and biotic processes such as aerobic respiration denitrification sulfate reduction and precipitation dissolution of carbonate minerals were found to control talk and dic in the different zones of the intertidal aquifer specifically the organic rich mangrove zone has higher talk and dic production via biotic processes such as aerobic respiration denitrification and sulfate reduction sulfate reduction was thought to be the major process due to the very good correlation between the sulfate depletion δso4 2 and production of talk δtalk iron cycling in the transition zone significantly influences on the carbonate geochemistry in addition to ph and temperature in organic poor bare beach good correlation between the δca2 and δtalk indicated that the abiotic processes such as dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals may be primarily responsible to produce talk and dic calculation of saturation indices for carbonate minerals suggested that huntite dissolution combined with calcite and aragonite precipitation may be responsible for talk and dic production in this zone while talk inventory in the intertidal aquifer was found to be seasonally stable the sgd derived talk flux was 60 greater in the wet season compared with the dry season in contrast to the talk inventory the dic inventory in the intertidal aquifer was about 24 higher in the wet season compared with in the dry season sgd derived dic fluxes were 95 higher in the wet season compared with the dry season among the sources of talk and dic in sgd this study suggested that talk and dic produced locally in the intertidal aquifer via multiple biotic and abiotic processes may contribute over 50 of the talk and dic discharged to coastal waters via sgd while prior studies had indicated conflicting results with respect to whether sgd was a potential driver or buffer for the ocean acidification in this study the talk dic ratio in groundwater was always lower than that in seawater and therefore sgd may reduce the seawater buffering capacity in tolo harbor and may serve as a local driver of ocean acidification credit authorship contribution statement

4793,while submarine groundwater discharge sgd is well known to release large amounts of dissolved nutrients and organic carbon into the ocean the contribution of sgd to the marine inorganic carbon cycle is poorly understood here the biogeochemistry of inorganic carbon in an intertidal aquifer and related sgd derived fluxes into tolo harbor hong kong was investigated over tidal and seasonal time scales the results revealed the production of total alkalinity talk and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the intertidal aquifer over the entire salinity range the locally produced talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer contributed to 50 of the talk and dic discharged with sgd to the ocean the distributions of talk and dic in the transition mangrove and high salinity bare beach zones were different due to the distinct hydrogeological and geochemical conditions in the organic rich mangrove zone talk and dic productions were driven by biotic processes such as aerobic respiration denitrification and sulfate reduction in the organic poor bare beach zone talk and dic productions were likely driven by abiotic processes such as precipitation dissolution of carbonate minerals temperature ph physical mixing and iron cycling in the intertidal aquifer also considerably influenced the carbonate biogeochemistry talk inventory in the intertidal aquifer was seasonally stable but talk discharged with sgd was 60 greater in the wet season than in the dry season 73 3 vs 45 6 mol d 1 per m coastline the dic inventory in the intertidal aquifer and dic discharged with sgd were 24 and 95 higher respectively in the wet season than dry season overall through analyzing talk dic ratios and related fluxes sgd was thought to reduce the co2 buffering capacity of the receiving ocean and act as a local driver of ocean acidification keywords coastal inorganic carbon biogeochemistry mangrove intertidal aquifer wetlands 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is an important source of carbon nutrient and trace metal to the ocean and has a major influence on solute mass balance and marine productivity liu et al 2014 moore 2010 nutrient and carbon fluxes can contribute to primary production liu et al 2012 luo et al 2018 red tides lee and kim 2007 coral reef growth mcmahon and santos 2017 paytan et al 2006 street et al 2008 as well as degradation of coastal ecosystems lubarsky et al 2018 intertidal aquifers are an active zone of biogeochemical reactions due to mixing between fresh groundwater fgw and seawater liu et al 2018b 2018c the transition zone of fgw and seawater is often referred as a subterranean estuary moore 1999 and plays an important role in modifying chemical fluxes to the ocean biogeochemical reactions in this zone have been found to control sgd derived chemical fluxes such as nutrients gonneea and charette 2014 santos et al 2008 carbons liu et al 2017a roy et al 2013 santos et al 2009b trace metals beck et al 2010 o connor et al 2018 reckhardt et al 2017 and radium isotopes liu et al 2018c moore et al 2011 many studies indicated that total alkalinity talk and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in sgd flux are produced in intertidal aquifer cai et al 2000 chaillou et al 2014 maher et al 2013 moore et al 2011 rao et al 2014 however liu et al 2017a found that the aquifer with intermediate salinity removes talk in groundwater so is intertidal aquifer a source or sink of talk and dic for coastal seawater the different findings of previous studies may be caused by the site specific characteristics and also lack of comprehensive understanding of the production removal processes of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer therefore investigating the production and removal mechanism of talk and dic is crucial to clarify the role of intertidal aquifer in land sea carbon cycle cai et al 2003 2000 liu et al 2017a understanding carbonate biogeochemistry in the intertidal aquifer is challenging due to multiple biotic and abiotic reactions such as organic matter remineralization and carbonates dissolution precipitation the remineralization pathways of organic matter include aerobic respiration denitrification manganese reduction iron reduction sulfate reduction methanogenesis and fermentation these processes alter talk dic and dissolved organic carbon doc in coastal groundwater through production or consumption of chemical species such as co2 hco3 nh3 h and hs that are components of talk and or dic cai et al 2003 these remineralization pathways are site specific and complex cai et al 2003 indicated that organic carbon degradation driven by sulfate reduction modified the conservative mixing of dic between fgw and seawater in an intertidal aquifer in south carolina united states similarly organic carbon degradation via sulfate reduction was found to be the major source of talk and dic in an intertidal aquifer of gulf of st lawrence canada chaillou et al 2014 and organic rich mangrove aquifer in evans head australia santos et al 2019 however in an intertidal aquifer of waquoit bay usa aerobic respiration and denitrification was regarded as the driver of talk and dic enrichments in coastal groundwater liu et al 2017a besides the biotic reactions organic matter remineralization abiotic reactions such as oxidation of reduced species and precipitation or dissolution of carbonate minerals calcite dolomite and aragonites are also influencing factors of carbonate biogeochemistry krumins et al 2013 liu et al 2017a rao et al 2014 saderne et al 2019 stumm and morgan 2012 for example talk can be decreased by the production of h through fe2 oxidation liu et al 2017a while carbonate mineral dissolution was shown to play a minor role in the variation of groundwater talk and dic in an intertidal aquifer in waquoit bay liu et al 2017a calcite dissolution was found to be the major factor influencing talk and dic in the low salinity region of an intertidal aquifer in north inlet south carolina cai et al 2003 the balance between the calcite dissolution and calcification determines the caco3 burial co2 emissions and subsequently affects talk and dic dynamics in coastal groundwater saderne et al 2019 therefore due to the distinct hydrologic geologic and redox conditions of the intertidal aquifer at different locations varieties of biotic and abiotic reactions could be the controlling factors of talk and dic dynamics in the intertidal aquifer even in the same intertidal aquifer zones with various water sources and salinity may also have different redox conditions and reactions liu et al 2018c more importantly the flow dynamics and redox conditions varies with external driving forces with different time scales such as tidal fluctuation and seasonal hydrologic variations liu et al 2018d moore et al 2011 however previous studies cai et al 2003 chaillou et al 2014 did not address dynamics of dic and talk over tidal and seasonal scales even though liu et al 2017a presented the seasonal variation of dic and talk of a sampling profile in the intertidal aquifer the variation of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer from land to sea need further investigation to provide comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution temporal variation and geochemical processes influencing the talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer most of previous studies on carbonate biogeochemistry in intertidal aquifers also provide estimates of sgd derived dic and talk fluxes to the ocean cai et al 2003 chaillou et al 2014 liu et al 2017a however how sgd derived dic flux contribute to the marine carbon cycle and whether sgd is a driver or a buffer of ocean acidification are remaining poorly understood while river inputs and coastal eutrophication are known to modify the seawater ph in coastal ocean borgesa and gypensb 2010 cai et al 2011 wang et al 2014 it remains unclear how sgd derived dic inputs influences coastal seawater ph due to comparatively limited investigation and quantification of sgd derived dic and talk fluxes it remains uncertain whether sgd is a driver or buffer for ocean acidification the ratios between talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer source are controlled by biotic and abiotic biogeochemical processes in today s oceans talk is usually higher than dic with talk dic ratios ranging from 1 05 to 1 19 egleston et al 2010 by examining buffer factors and the sensitivity of co2 and h concentrations and caco3 saturation to changes in dic and talk concentrations egleston et al 2010 suggested that the buffering capacity of the ocean to anthropogenic co2 dissolution is the lowest when talk dic ratio 1 therefore the talk dic ratio in external water flux can be used as an indicator for oceanic seawater ph variation for example external inputs with a talk dic ratio 1 would increase the ocean water talk dic ratio increasing its co2 buffering capacity in seawater as a result if the talk dic ratio in sgd is 1 sgd decreases buffer capacity and serves as local driver of ocean acidification while talk dic ratio is 1 in sgd making sgd a buffer for ocean acidification liu et al 2017a robinson et al 2018 while sgd is well known to release nutrients metals and organic carbons to oceans the amount of dic and talk carried by sgd is poorly quantified the carbonate biogeochemistry in the intertidal aquifer explaining the sources and variation of sgd derived dic and talk fluxes also remains poorly understood here we described the spatial distribution in the entire intertidal aquifer over diel and seasonal scales and seasonal sgd derived talk and dic fluxes into the coastal ocean of tolo harbor hong kong we hypothesize that the spatial distribution and sgd derived dic and talk fluxes experience diel and seasonal cycles due to coupled effects of tidal pumping seasonal rainfall and biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer field data are used to quantify sgd derived fluxes and investigate the biogeochemical drivers of dic and talk production or consumption over seasonal and diel scales in addition the major biotic and abiotic pathways of inorganic carbon cycling are identified and the implication of sgd fluxes to ocean acidification is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study site tolo harbor area 52 km2 coastline length 82 km is a semi closed embayment located at the northeast of new territories hong kong fig 1 a due to the bottlenecked configuration of the harbor and northeasterly wind direction there is limited exchange between the harbor and open seawater tolo harbor has been suffering from eutrophication for over 40 years lee et al 2012 resulting in serious ecological problems such as red tides and degradation of coral communities luo and jiao 2016 wong et al 2018 the semi diurnal tide in tolo harbor has a mean level of 1 45 mpd meter above principal datum and average tidal amplitude of 1 06 m liu et al 2017b the study site 22 280 06 91 n 114 13 002 22 e is a shallow intertidal aquifer with a gentle beach slope 1 at the north coast of plover cove fig 1a the sediments of the sandy beach can be classified as well sorted gravelly sand according to the unified soil classification system uscs the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer measured via falling head test is 4 5 0 4 m day and 1 6 0 5 m day for the bare beach and mangrove soil respectively and the porosity of the surficial sediments for both mangrove and bare beach is measured to be 0 3 a permanent multilevel sampling system luo et al 2017 containing 11 sampling sites l1 l5 above and s1 s6 below mean tidal mark was installed to sample groundwater across the intertidal zone fig 1b sampling sites l1 l3 were installed in a mangrove zone while l4 l5 and s1 s6 were installed in the bare sandy beach four monitoring wells named d1 to d4 with automatic pressure transducers were installed in different lateral locations of the intertidal aquifer to obtain the groundwater table which was used to obtain the sgd flux according to the recharge and discharge induced water table fluctuation liu et al 2018a in addition d4 was installed offshore with the open top submerged in seawater to catch the sea level fluctuation some groundwater and ancillary data have previously been used in studies evaluating the major ion liu et al 2017b trace metal liu et al 2019 radium isotopes liu et al 2018c and nutrient liu et al 2018d 2017c processes in the intertidal aquifer all the dic talk and major ion na k mg2 ca2 so4 2 and cl data in march april may and december 2016 in groundwater and the river water data reported here are new data the intertidal aquifer can be separated into a fgw zone l1 and l2 4 salinity 1 transition zone l2 and l3 1 salinity 25 and high salinity zone l4 l5 s1 s6 salinity 25 fig 1b table 1 liu et al 2017c 2018d due to the different ph oxidation reduction potential orp stable isotopic δ2h and δ18o and chemical compositions table 1 the fgw region is divided into shallow fgw l1 1 and l1 2 and deep fgw l2 4 zones the deep fgw zone is oxic orp 0 mv with low ph 5 92 0 3 and the shallow fgw zone is slightly reduced orp 10 mv with higher ph 6 13 0 31 groundwater in the transition zone and high salinity zone is reduced with average orp values of 100 72 and 106 28 mv respectively the near surface region of the transition zone organic rich mangrove zone in fig 1b is highly reduced orp 150 mv the salinity and ph across the entire intertidal aquifer are lower in the rainy season compared with the dry season liu 2017 liu et al 2018d groundwater temperature has a clear seasonality with higher temperatures observed from april to december liu et al 2018b 2018d the for more details of the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of salinity ph temperature and orp in the entire intertidal aquifer can be found in supporting information of liu et al 2018d here for convenience for reader the figures shown the salinity ph temperature and orp are also included in supporting information of this study figs s1 s4 2 2 sampling approach and methods groundwater sampling was performed in 2016 over semi diurnal and seasonal time scales seasonal sampling was performed on 24 february 11 march 25 april 20 october and 13 december for all the sampling sites fig 1 precipitation over the sampling period is shown in fig 2 a the samples collected over seasonal time scale were collected during the low tide of the spring tide period to minimize changes caused by short term tidal drivers in addition to groundwater sample collection a nearshore seawater sample was collected at the low tide during each sampling campaign groundwater samples were also collected from the fgw and transition zones l1 l3 four times from may 23 and 25 2016 at different tidal phases low tide med tide and high tide fig 2b a nearshore seawater sample was also collected at each tidal phase river water samples were collected from tai po kau tpk and shan liu sl rivers in 2016 fig 1a salinity ph dissolved oxygen do temperature and orp were measured with a calibrated portable meter hi98194 hanna instruments immediately after the sample collection for all samples groundwater was pumped with a peristatic pump and the sampling tube was placed at the bottom of the cap of meter a beaker with a volume 100 ml which can be screwed onto the probe body for protection until fulfilled the probes for measurement of physicochemical parameters were then submerged into the water and the cap was screwed on the probe body to eliminate the contact with air the whole procedure last for only several seconds and measurement is believed to have very limited influences of air the calibration of the portable meter was conducted in laboratory with a three points 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 calibration of ph was applied using the nbs scale at room temperature 25 c following the standard procedures specified by hanna instruments the resolutions and accuracies of salinity ph do temperature and orp are 0 01 and 0 01 0 01 and 0 02 0 01 and 0 10 ppm 0 01 and 0 15 c and 0 1 and 1 0 mv respectively liu et al 2018b the groundwater river water and nearshore seawater samples 1 l were filtered with 0 45 µm syringe filters in the field 2 hno3 solution was added to the cation na k mg2 and ca2 samples to prevent precipitation after this pretreatment the anion cl and so4 2 and cation samples were refrigerated 4 c the groundwater samples 100 ml were titrated with 0 16 n or 1 6 n h2so4 solution to obtain talk boyd 2015 the dic and pco2 were calculated using the co2sys program lewis and wallace 1998 based on the talk ph salinity and temperature data cao et al 2011 dissociation constants for carbonic acid boric acid bisulfate ion and hydrogen fluoride in the co2sys were selected from millero et al 2006 lee et al 2010 dickson 1981 and perez and fraga 1987 respectively in carbonate chemistry ph talk dic and pco2 can be calculated co2sys if any two of the four parameters are known the application of co2sys to calculate the other components of dic such as dissolved carbon dioxide co2 aqu hco3 and co3 2 is common in literature cao et al 2011 harris et al 2013 liu et al 2017a zhai et al 2014 the anion samples were analyzed via ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 1100 with analytical errors 3 the cation samples were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes by analyzing a standard after every ten measurements the accuracy and precision of cation analysis was estimated to be 99 2 3 mass balance model the mass balance of water and solute in the intertidal aquifer was conducted as described by liu et al 2018d 2019 1 w a t e r b a l a n c e f s w r f f g r f s g d 2 s o l u t e b a l a n c e f s w r c i s w δ t f f g r c i f g δ t f s g d c i s g d δ t δ

s w r f f g r and f s g d are the seawater recharge flux fgw recharge flux and sgd flux respectively c i s w c i f g and c i s g d are the concentrations of solute i in nearshore seawater fgw and saline groundwater in the intertidal aquifer respectively i i t is the inventory of solute i at time t n is the porosity of the intertidal aquifer c i t is the concentration of solute i at time t ω is the space of the intertidal aquifer δ i i is the inventory change of solute i from time t to t δ t r i is the net production or removal rate of solute i in the aquifer during the time period δ t in this study solute i is talk or dic in the calculations it is assumed that δ t 1 d because the water flux was estimated with a temporal resolution of 1 day more importantly one day corresponds to two tidal cycles with no significant differences in tidal level between the sampling time t and t δ t therefore the talk and dic variation induced by tidal level change can be neglected in the seasonal analysis the fresh sgd flux was estimated via darcy s law by considering the groundwater hydraulic gradient aquifer thickness and aquifer hydraulic conductivities liu et al 2018a the groundwater hydraulic gradient was obtained by monitoring the groundwater level in two wells d1 and a temporary well 40 m landward to d1 the tide driven saline sgd was calculated via the water storage change in the intertidal aquifer between high and low tide periods by monitoring the water table difference santos et al 2009a the saline sgd driven by tidal fluctuation was calculated with a resolution of 0 5 d all the details of sgd calculation and data can be found in liu et al 2018a seasonal sgd rates are provided in table s1 2 4 non conservative mixing model dissolved chemicals in the intertidal aquifer generally have non conservative mixing due to the biogeochemical reactions to evaluate the degree of non conservative transport of dissolved chemicals in the intertidal aquifer the ionic delta which describes the difference between the measured concentration and theoretically calculated conservative concentration was calculated cai et al 2003 liu et al 2017c 5 δ m i m i s a m p l e m i m i x where the δ m i is the ionic delta of species i m i s a m p l e is the measured concentration of species i and m i m i x is the calculated theoretical concentration of species i according to conservative endmember model 6 m i m i x f s e a m i s e a 1 f s e a m i f r e s h where m i s e a and m i f r e s h are the concentrations of the seawater endmember and freshwater endmember respectively f s e a is the fraction of seawater which is calculated from the chloride cl concentration in the groundwater samples the fraction f s e a was calculated by 7 f s e a m c l s a m p l e m c l f r e s h m c l s e a m c l f r e s h where m c l s a m p l e m c l f r e s h and m c l s e a are the concentration of cl in the groundwater sample freshwater endmember and seawater endmember respectively a typical open seawater from the northern south china sea is selected as the seawater endmember since it has the limited uncertainty and the least anthropogenic interferes liu 2014 the deep fresh groundwater collected from l2 4 in each month was applied as the groundwater endmember the deep fresh groundwater upwells from deep aquifer and has less anthropogenic interferes the offset between the observed data talk dic and h and conservative mixing line between the freshwater and seawater endmembers is regarded as a result of biogeochemical reactions in the intertidal aquifer the observed data over below the conservative mixing line indicates the production consumption of talk dic and h in the intertidal aquifer the details of the major ion concentrations in each endmember are listed in table 3 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns the talk distribution shows a clear spatial zonation across the intertidal aquifer fig 3 generally fgw had low talk with seasonal mean value of 1352 243 μmol kg 1 for shallow fgw l1 1 and l1 2 and 760 106 μmol kg 1 for deep fgw l2 4 coinciding with the low ph 6 13 0 51 for shallow fgw and 5 92 0 30 for deep fgw table 1 in the transition zone with distance between 50 and 30 m talk increased to 2410 1299 μmol kg 1 the highest talk 3588 μmol kg 1 at the near surface area of the transition zone l2 1 and l3 1 exceeded infiltrated seawater 1720 357 μmol kg 1 and fgw from inland suggesting an internal source of talk in the intertidal aquifer as expected the spatial distribution of pco2 fig 4 was the opposite of talk fig 3 with highest pco2 in fgw and lowest in the high salinity zone with distance between 30 and 50 m the reverse trend between pco2 and talk may be partially due to the transformation from dissolved carbon dioxide co2 aqu in fgw with low ph 6 13 0 31 in shallow fgw and 5 92 0 30 in deep fgw in table 1 to hco3 in saline groundwater with more neutral ph 6 24 0 28 in table 1 in the high salinity zone with distance between 30 and 50 m in fig 3 the seasonal mean talk was much higher than that in the transition zone with distance between 50 and 30 m in fig 3 3735 1023 versus 2410 1299 μmol kg 1 table 1 the vertical distribution of talk in high salinity zone differed from the transition zone for example talk in the transition zone was high near the surface on contrary talk was higher in the deep location of the high salinity zone talk was 2520 μmol kg 1 at 0 5 m and 4920 μmol kg 1 at 2 0 m depth at the sampling site l5 in april in addition locations close to the sea 20 50 m had lower talk than further inland 20 10 m implying dilution by seawater with lower talk 1720 357 μmol kg 1 the different veritical distributions of talk in the transition and high salinity zones suggest different spatial controlling mechanisms of talk production and removal in the two zones pco2 in the high salinity zone fig 4 was low 3400 3300 μatm only 3 of dic was co2 aqu in the high salinity zone table 1 the spatial distribution of dic fig 5 in fgw was similar to that of pco2 since the major component of dic was co2 aqu 64 in table 1 the distribution of dic in the transition zone and high salinity zone was similar to talk since the major component of dic was hco3 94 in table 1 3 2 semi diurnal variations the distribution of talk dic pco2 ph and salinity in the intertidal aquifer varied over the tidal cycle fig 6 and table s2 during the rising tide from low tide 1 02 m to high tide 0 58 m talk was elevated at the near surface area while pco2 was elevated in the fgw the increase of talk coincided with the increase of salinity at the near surface area during high tide indicating the close relationship of talk production and seawater infiltration for example talk at l3 1 the near surface area increased from 3100 μmol kg 1 to 3720 μmol kg 1 and the pco2 in fgw at l1 2 increased from 25 869 μatm to 55 971 μatm when the sea level rose from 1 02 m fig 6 a1 to 0 58 m fig 6 b3 the elevated talk was produced within the aquifer since both the freshwater and marine endmembers had a lower talk the seaward movement of fgw at high tide was observed from the pco2 fig 6 c3 but the phase lag of pco2 was not clear due to the sampling resolution according to ph fluctuation the highest ph was observed 3 h behind the highest tide while the lowest ph was observed 11 h behind the lowest tide liu et al 2018b the dic variations were mainly controlled by the changes in both hco3 and co2 aqu since 1 of dic presents as co3 2 as the groundwater ph was 5 84 7 34 high dic was observed at both the near surface area and fgw zone at high tide fig 6 for example dic at l3 1 near surface area was 5200 μmol kg 1 at high tide 60 greater than at low tide the dic at l1 2 fgw was 3172 μmol kg 1 at high tide 50 greater than at low tide the increase in dic at the near surface area was mainly due to an increase in co2 aqu 65 but the increase of hco3 35 played a minor role as a result the increase in dic at the near surface area at high tide was greater than the increase in talk the change of dic in the fgw was due to the variation in co2 aqu as the talk variations were limited in the fgw and 40 of the dic was co2 aqu during the tidal cycle 3 3 seasonal variations talk in fgw was relatively constant between the monthly sampling events with 4 variation table s3 in contrast in the transition zone with distance between 50 and 30 m talk varied between the monthly sampling events at the near surface area l3 1 and l2 1 for example much higher talk concentrations were observed at the near surface area l3 1 and l2 1 of the transition zone in october 4100 μmol kg 1 and december 3600 μmol kg 1 compared to february 3260 μmol kg 1 and march 2740 μmol kg 1 fig 3 indicating that the production of talk in this zone had seasonal variation in contrast talk was relatively constant for locations above the mean tidal mark 30 0 m in the high salinity zone indicating a comparative stable production rate of talk the different seasonal variations of the talk production rates in the two zones suggested the distinct geochemical reactions responsible for the production however for locations below the mean tidal mark with distance between 0 and 50 m talk was lower in october and december compared to february march and april in the wet season the heavy precipitation directly diluted talk in seawater and also lowered seawater ph this may explain why talk was low in october below the mean tidal mark where seawater exchange across the aquifer ocean interface was important fig 3d a seaward movement of the talk plume in december compared to october at the location with distance of 10 m indicated that the system was recovering from heavy rainfall fig 3e the spatial distribution of pco2 had clear seasonality fig 4 with higher pco2 in the fgw in wet season october 1 16 105 µatm than in the other seasons february 4 36 104 µatm march 3 85 104 µatm april 1 78 104 µatm and december 5 92 104 µatm the heavy rainfall with low ph 4 3 in october led to a lower fgw ph 5 60 compared to 6 06 6 08 6 47 and 5 93 in february march april and december respectively due to the mixing with seawater ph increased seaward leading to a decrease in co2 aqu in the aquifer the seasonality of dic in the intertidal aquifer was related to both talk and pco2 in the fgw talk was relatively constant but both dic and pco2 changed following precipitation in the high salinity zone the dic patterns fig 5 were similar to the talk patterns fig 3 in the transition zone due to mixing of saline groundwater and fgw dic seasonal variation was related to both pco2 and talk with higher dic in the wet season october than other seasons february march april and december 3 4 inventories and fluxes the inventory of talk in the intertidal aquifer was relatively constant 337 328 339 339 and 346 mol per m coastline in february march april october and december respectively with no significant seasonal variation 2 fig 7 a and table s4 however the total sgd derived talk flux increased considerably in the wet season 73 3 mol d 1 per m coastline in october compared to the dry season 48 2 mol d 1 per m coastline because of the increase of water flux in wet season fig 7b and table s4 the dic inventory in the wet season 471 6 mol per m coastline in october was higher than that in dry season 402 1 mol per m coastline fig 7a and table s4 the increase in dic inventory in october was due to the heavy precipitation the heavy precipitation lowered fgw ph driving dissolution of carbonates which increases dic in fgw in addition the heavy precipitation also elevated the groundwater level inland which in turn enhances the seaward flow of fgw the sgd derived dic flux 93 3 mol d 1 per m coastline in october was about 2 fold greater than that in the dry season 51 8 mol d 1 per m coastline fig 7b and table s4 4 discussion 4 1 the production of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer the spatial distribution of talk and dic species in the intertidal aquifer was controlled by multiple physical and biogeochemical factors such as salinity ph carbon availability temperature and microbial communities cai et al 2003 liu et al 2017a endmember mixing analysis was conducted using salinity as a conservative parameter to qualitatively characterize production consumption of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer chaillou et al 2014 couturier et al 2017 gonneea and charette 2014 santos et al 2009b the data showed that most talk and dic samples in the transition zone and high salinity zone were above the theoretical conservative mixing line indicating talk and dic production fig 8 and h depletion across the salinity gradient fig 9 the observed talk and dic production was consistent with observations from nearshore aquifers in the gulf of st lawrence quebec canada chaillou et al 2014 north inlet south carolina usa cai et al 2003 and the wadden sea germany santos et al 2015 but different from observations in waquoit bay massachusetts usa liu et al 2017a in waquoit bay talk consumption was observed in saline water and was attributed to the production of protons h during the oxidative precipitation of ferrous iron fe2 and formation of an iron curtain iron oxides charette and sholkovitz 2002 liu et al 2017a however in addition to iron oxide precipitation iron sulfide fes precipitates had been observed in many nearshore aquifers such as gulf of st lawrence qc canada chaillou et al 2014 cape shores lewes delaware usa mcallister et al 2015 indian river lagoon florida usa roy et al 2012 and tolo harbor hong kong sar china liu et al 2019 iron sulfide mineral precipitation occured under reducing conditions that were also favorable to iron oxide dissolution roy et al 2010 therefore it was possible that the transformation between fes minerals and dissolved ferrous iron fe2 table 2 explained the variation of talk in the gulf of st lawrence qc canada chaillou et al 2014 and tolo harbor this study the different biogeochemical cycling including types of iron precipitates in the intertidal aquifer well explained the different production and consumption of talk and dic highlighting the potentially important role biogeochemical iron cycling may have on carbonate geochemistry besides biogeochemical influences the carbonate chemistry in intertidal aquifer was also influenced by hydrologic variations dorsett et al 2011 roy et al 2013 2010 talk and dic production generally increased with salinity in the transition zone fig 8 located in the mangrove area with distance between 55 and 30 m in fig 1b the high soil organic content and salinity at the near surface area liu et al 2018d of the mangrove zone may promote fes precipitation and talk production roy et al 2012 santos et al 2019 lower excess talk and dic in the high salinity zone with distance between 30 and 50 m fig 8 may be due to mixing with recirculating seawater which has lower talk and dic concentrations seawater infiltrating into the intertidal aquifer increased the groundwater salinity but decreased talk and dic concentrations the low organic content in the sediments in the high salinity zone compared to the mangrove zone was likely associated with low microbial activities preventing the production of sufficient talk and dic to counterbalance the dilution by seawater infiltration therefore different distribution and dynamics of talk and dic in the two zones of the intertidal aquifer mangroves and bare beach zones suggested the unique production pathways the talk dic ratios in the different zones of the intertidal aquifer were variable indicating dissimilar biogeochemistry of talk and dic in each zone fig 10 a the variation of dic was much larger than talk in the fgw zone fig 10a due to the large variation of co2 aqu in low ph fgw however the talk dic ratio 0 91 in the high salinity zone was close to 1 1 indicating the variation of talk was very close to the variation of dic in groundwater which indicated that hco3 as the only shared ion in talk and dic was the dominant component of both dic and talk in this high ph zone both groundwater ph table 1 and talk dic ratio 0 65 fig 10a were intermediate in the transition zone therefore ph controled the partitioning of dic between co2 aqu hco3 and co3 2 4 2 biogeochemical pathways in different zones of the intertidal aquifer the production of talk and dic in the intertidal aquifer was a result of different biogeochemical pathways table 2 such as aerobic respiration anaerobic reactions denitrification manganese reduction iron reduction and sulfate reduction as well as abiotic dissolution of carbonate minerals cai et al 2003 chaillou et al 2014 liu et al 2017a 2017c which could be site specific and may have seasonal changes in reaction intensity for example sulfate reduction was recognized as important pathway for talk and dic production in many organic rich sites such as salt marshes in north inlet in the united states cai et al 2003 gulf of st lawrence in canada chaillou et al 2014 mangroves in australia santos et al 2019 and tolo harbor in hong kong china sar liu et al 2017c however aerobic respiration and denitrification were found to be more important than sulfate reduction in waquoit bay massachusetts united states liu et al 2017a here we used the ratios and slopes of the δtalk and δdic to infer the biogeochemical reactions that may control talk and dic at our site the δtalk δdic ratios in different biogeochemical pathways were illustrated in fig 11 the δtalk and δdic were calculated according to the offset between the measured data tables s3 and s5 and conservative mixing section 2 4 between the mixing endmembers listed in table 3 the samples from the high salinity zone were mostly located between caco3 dissolution δtalk δdic 2 and denitrification or sulfate reduction slopes δtalk δdic 1 while most samples from the transition zone were located between the denitrification or sulfate reduction δtalk δdic 1 and aerobic respiration δtalk δdic 0 2 fig 11 the wide range of slopes suggested that multiple different reactions control the production and consumption of talk and dic in each zone the scattered distribution of fgw samples shown in fig 11suggested that it was not possible to determine the sources of talk and dic in this zone in the transition zone iron sulfide precipitation δtalk δdic 1 and iron reduction δtalk δdic 8 liu et al 2019 may explain the negative δdic observed in fig 11 as for the production of talk and dic the most likely pathway was aerobic respiration and denitrification or sulfate reduction fig 11 the dissolution of calcium carbonates was not expected to be the major contributor since δtalk δdic ratio was considerably 2 in the transition zone in addition the deep area with low ph deep groundwater should have a higher dissolution rate of calcium carbonates which should result in higher concentration of talk compared to the near surface area if dissolution of calcium carbonates was the major driver of talk production in this zone it was expected that aerobic respiration would contribute to talk and dic production to some extent since both fgw and seawater endmembers had high do concentration indicating the consumption of do in the aquifer liu et al 2018b 2018d in addition short term sampling data indicated that the do concentrations in the transition zone vary through the tidal cycle indicating changing redox conditions in the aquifer furthermore the δtalk δdic ratio in the transition zone was closer to the denitrification or sulfate reduction ratio 1 fig 11 suggesting that the two processes may be contributing to the production of talk and dic the significant linear relationship between sulfate depletion talk production fig 12 a suggested that sulfate reduction may be a large contributor to talk and dic production in the transition zone as for denitrification the low concentrations of both ammonium 13 µm and nitrate 3 µm seemed to not support the large observed production of talk and dic in the transition zone when considering the stoichiometric reactions table 2 however the deficit of sulphate was several mm during sulfate reduction which could result in hundreds of µm nitrogen production as suggested in liu et al 2018d the scheme of the nitrogen cycle in this aquifer was remineralization denitrification as such it was possible that denitrification may also contribute to the production of talk and dic in the aquifer based on the stoichiometric reaction table 2 during sulfate reduction 1 mm sulphate depletion was associated with 1 3 mm nitrogen and 2 mm of talk the subsequent depletion of 1 3 mm of nitrogen depletion via denitrification produced around 1 3 mm talk as a result the amount of talk produced via sulfate reduction directly was six times that of the talk produced via denitrification of nitrogen as a byproduct of sulphate reduction based on this stoichiometry and also the linear relationship between the production of talk and depletion of sulphate fig 12a and distribution of δtalk δdic ratio in the transition zone fig 11 it was concluded that sulfate reduction is the dominant process responsible for talk and dic in the transition zone in summary data indicated that the biotic processes were the main contributor to talk and dic production in the transition zone of which sulfate reduction was the dominant biotic process compared to aerobic respiration and denitrification in the high salinity zone the δtalk and δdic data were plotted between calcium carbonate mineral dissolution and denitrification or sulfate reduction lines fig 11 however sulfate reduction and denitrification were unlikely to considerably influence talk and dic production in this zone firstly the correlation between the sulfate depletion δso4 2 and production of talk δtalk was very poor fig s5 which indicated that sulfate reduction was not the dominant factor as we discussed in the transition zone denitrification only contributed about 1 6 of the talk production via sulfate reduction therefore denitrification was a minor factor for talk production in the high salinity zone secondly the comparatively high dissolved inorganic nitrogen e g 46 µm at 0 5 m versus 3 µm at 2 0 m at s1 in february at the near surface area liu et al 2018d should have supported a high denitrification rate and production of talk and dic at the near surface area however the high concentrations of talk and dic were not observed at the near surface area figs 3 and 5 the significant linear relationship between δtalk and δca2 fig 12b suggested that calcium carbonate mineral dissolution may control the dic and talk dynamics in the high salinity zone surprisingly the production of talk positive δtalk was also observed when δca2 was negative fig 12b the precipitation of calcium minerals in a form of gypsum caso4 calcite caco3 and aragonite caco3 would remove ca2 however these processes would not produce talk therefore no single mineral precipitation or dissolution could explain the observations the combined effect of dissolution precipitation of multiple minerals was very likely to occur we examined the saturation index of common minerals such as gypsum calcite aragonite dolomite camg co3 2 and huntite camg3 co3 4 figs s6 s10 table s6 and found that gypsum was consistently under saturated fig s6 therefore it was unlikely that gypsum precipitation accounts for the removal of ca2 in contrast dolomite was consistently supersaturated throughout the sampling year fig s7 indicating the possibility of dolomite precipitation in the intertidal aquifer however dolomite precipitation in seawater was unlikely with dolomitization only occurring under specific conditions such as high temperature low ca2 mg2 and low ca2 co3 2 machel and mountjoy 1986 two sediment samples at s1 with depths of 0 25 and 0 5 m were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd and no dolomite signal was found therefore the removal of ca2 was not due to dolomitization it was unclear why the dolomitization did not occur even when a supersaturation of dolomite was observed one possible reason was that the aquifer lacked the bacteria needed for dolomitization and another possible reason was that the sample collected in this site was too shallow this unsolved question would be addressed in the future study besides the oversaturation of dolomite the aragonite and calcite were over saturated in most samples over the sampling period figs s8 s9 whereas huntite was under saturated in most samples through the sampling period fig s10 this indicated that calcite aragonite precipitation may be removing ca2 and talk while huntite may be supplying ca2 and talk at the same time if we assumed that calcite aragonite precipitation huntite dissolution occured simultaneously it was possible for net talk production and net ca2 removal to occur due to the fact that huntite dissolution produced talk and ca2 with a ratio of 8 1 eq 9 while aragonite calcite removed talk and ca2 with a ratio of 2 1 eq 10 9 h u n t i t e d i s s o l u t i o n c a m g 3 c o 3 4 4 h 2

biogeochemistry the diurnal variation of talk dic and pco2 fig 6 was resulted from the combination influences of tidal fluctuation induced seawater groundwater mixing and day night shift induced variation of co2 uptake and respiration of mangrove roots the effect of tidal fluctuation on talk dic and pco2 was not uniformed in the entire transition zone at the near surface area tidal fluctuation affected the talk dic and pco2 directly by increasing the physical mixing between the seawater and groundwater higher salinity at high tide due to the infiltration of seawater from the beach fig 6d in addition the organic matter and oxygen carried by the seawater facilitate the mineralization of organic matter which influenced the short term variation of talk dic and pco2 in deep area the physical mixing salinity in response to tidal fluctuation had a phase lag since the transport of chemicals in the aquifer need time levanon et al 2016 for example the ph and radium isotopes variations in deep locations were observed about 12 h behind the sea level change liu et al 2018b 2018c the activity of microbial communities may also be affected by the shift of salinity for example through flow through reaction experiments methanogenesis and denitrification were found to decrease with salinity while carbon mineralization was found increase with salinity weston et al 2006 in addition to tidal fluctuation induced physical mixing change the day night shift induced change of co2 uptake and respiration of mangrove roots was another important factor for the carbonate chemistry change over short time scale the shutdown of photosynthesis at night reduced the co2 removal from the groundwater and caused the decrease of ph and increase of pco2 fig 6c e the day night shift induced temperature change could be another factor for the short term dynamics of dic and talk the temperature change directly affected the solubility of co2 in groundwater therefore the comparatively low temperature in night time leaded to a high pco2 as observed in fig 6c even though the comparatively low temperature would decrease the microbial activity gödde and conrad 1999 thamdrup and fleischer 1998 but the overall change of temperature was below 3 c liu et al 2018b which would not cause significant change of microbial activity over a tidal scale rainfall and evapotranspiration induced seasonal hydrologic variation in the terrestrial environment caused a change of talk and dic in the high salinity zone over seasonal scale figs 8 and 10b according to previous study liu et al 2018a fresh sgd could increase by 20 while tide driven sgd could increase by 50 the heavy rainfall induced fast circulation of seawater and freshwater discharge lowered the salinity and ph in the intertidal aquifer as observed in october figs s1 s2 on one hand the decreased groundwater ph liu et al 2017c 2018d altered the speciation of dic in groundwater the lower groundwater ph in the wet season may also facilitate the carbonate mineral dissolution since carbonate dissolution was generally ph dependent chou et al 1989 more importantly the increased flow velocity of groundwater discharge and circulation of seawater could bring more dissolved oxygen and organic matter for mineralization the produced co2 during the mineralization would facilitate the carbonate dissolution as a result an increased talk and dic production large offset from the conservative mixing line in wet season was observed fig 8 in addition the seasonal shift of temperature might be a potential influencing factor for the carbonate mineral dissolution and subsequently explained the variation of talk and dic fig 8 on one hand the high groundwater temperature potentially increased microbial activity gödde and conrad 1999 thamdrup et al 1998 and the heterotrophic respiration increased the dissolved co2 which would be buffered by the increased carbonate dissolution dorsett et al 2011 pain et al 2019 on the other hand high temperature increased the solubility of carbonate minerals in the intertidal aquifer sjöberg and rickard 1984 the contribution of sulfate reduction to talk production in the transition zone might be seasonal fig 12a if all talk was assumed to be produced from sulfate reduction the theoretical ratio between talk production and sulfate depletion should be 2 1 based on the stoichiometry of sulfate reduction table 2 additional production of talk via other processes such as aerobic respiration and denitrification could result in δtalk δso4 2 2 however the δtalk δso4 2 was 0 20 and 0 80 in the dry and wet season respectively which was much lower than 2 to account for δtalk δso4 2 2 other processes should remove carbonate species or produce h due to the extensive sulfate reduction it was likely that the reaction products h2s combined with the high dissolved ferrous iron fe2 to form iron sulfide or pyrite minerals liu et al 2019 the production of h via iron sulfide formation table 2 may explain δtalk δso4 2 2 in the transition zone since the iron oxidation and manganese oxidation both produce h but were not major processes at the study site liu et al 2019 in addition aerobic respiration may also cause δtalk δso4 2 2 in the transition zone however δtalk δso4 2 was lower in the dry season compared with the wet season indicating greater removal of hco3 in dry seasons theoretically the higher do seawater in the wet season should drive greater aerobic respiration and resulted in a higher removal of hco3 however this was not observed therefore aerobic respiration is not expected to be the major process removing hco3 in high salinity zone the observed ratio between δtalk and δca2 was 2 1 in dry seasons and 1 2 in wet season fig 12b the δtalk δca2 ratio 2 1 in wet season suggested the production of talk from a mineral with a theoretical ratio δtalk δca2 2 the huntite dissolution had a theoretical ratio δtalk δca2 of 8 eq 9 which could explain the observed data with removal of ca2 but production of talk more importantly the observed mg2 ca2 ratio in groundwater of the high salinity zone was generally higher than that in the nearshore seawater indicating more mg2 was produced than ca2 by geochemical processes table s5 therefore it was possible that huntite dissolution aragonite calcite precipitation was one of the major processes controlling the production of talk in the high salinity zone huntite dissolution followed by precipitation of aragonite calcite provided an example of element relocation in the intertidal aquifer 4 4 inorganic carbon flux and production rate there were multiple drivers forcing flow across the land sea interface and influences the marine environment which had been generalized in santos et al 2012 in an intertidal aquifer the typical driving forces for sgd included seasonal oscillation of the water table wave set up and tidal fluctuation and density differences between the seawater and fresh groundwater liu et al 2016 michael 2005 robinson et al 2007 in tolo harbor the sgd occurred in intertidal aquifer was mainly controlled by the tidal fluctuation and land sea hydraulic gradient the saline sgd was over 65 of the total sgd based on multiple previous estimations lee et al 2012 liu et al 2018a luo et al 2014 the sgd estimated via multiple methods including darcy s law and piezometer 222rn mass balance radium quartets three endmember mixing and si mass balance rangeed from 0 02 to 16 6 cm d which was comparable to the estimates in embayment harbors and coastal areas luo and jiao 2016 the seasonal variation of inland groundwater table caused by the non uniformed precipitation and evapotranspiration throughout a hydrology year led to a higher sgd both fresh and saline sgd in wet season than dry season liu et al 2018a sgd derived dic fluxes was estimated to be 95 greater in the wet season than in the dry season a similar seasonal shift was observed in the jiulong river estuary china wang et al 2015 waquoit bay massachusetts united states liu et al 2017a wang et al 2016 and southwest florida united states liu et al 2014 this seasonal shift could be related to temperature precipitation and redox conditions the seasonal change of these drivers alters sgd flow dynamics gonneea and charette 2014 liu et al 2017a wang et al 2015 the composition of both fgw and seawater endmembers liu et al 2017a and the biogeochemical reactions in the intertidal aquifer dorsett et al 2011 o connor et al 2018 the 95 increase in dic flux in the wet season compared to the dry season was due to an increase in both dic inventories 24 increase and sgd 76 increase flux the dic production in the intertidal aquifer was considerably higher in the wet season 44 2 and 53 7 mol d 1 per m coastline for talk and dic compared to the dry season 24 0 and 27 2 mol d 1 per m coastline for talk and dic fig 13 the talk and dic produced in the intertidal aquifer contributed to 50 of the sgd fluxes to the harbor in both dry and wet seasons fig 13 the proportion of sgd derived talk and dic flux associated with the production in the intertidal aquifer was much larger than the proportion in waquoit bay 5 for talk and 19 for dic liu et al 2017a combined with the literature chen et al 2018 our observations of high dic production indicates that intertidal aquifers can be significant sources of carbon to the coastal ocean especially in organic rich mangrove sediments if we upscale the talk flux calculated for the beach transect to the whole tolo harbor sgd derived talk fluxes were estimated to be 3 95 106 and 6 01 106 mol d 1 in the dry and wet seasons respectively this sgd derived talk flux was one order of magnitude greater than other pathways including river discharge 1 24 105 mol d 1 calculated from the river water talk data listed in table s7 table 4 suggesting that sgd was an important external talk source the sgd derived dic flux in the dry 3 93 106 mol d 1 and wet seasons 7 65 106 mol d 1 was larger than dic flux associated with river discharge 1 20 105 mol d 1 the contribution of sgd to coastal talk and dic budgets was still poorly understood and varied considerably between different field sites for example it had been estimated that sgd derived dic flux accounted for 45 110 of river discharge in jiulong river estuary china wang et al 2015 23 53 in pearl river estuary china liu et al 2012 22 75 in korogoro creek australia sadat noori et al 2016 200 in moreton bay australia stewart et al 2015 and 170 on the eastern united states coastline wang et al 2016 combined with these prior investigations our findings indicated that sgd could be a major yet often overlooked source of dic and talk to coastal waters 4 5 implications to ocean acidification the high pco2 was often observed in coastal groundwater despite the buffering by caco3 dissolution and serves as a co2 source for coastal waters pain et al 2019 the low talk dicratios in sgd may lead to a decrease in receiving coastal water ph sgd investigations in systems such as coastal wetlands de weys et al 2011 jeffrey et al 2016 mangroves chen et al 2018 santos et al 2019 coral reef lagoons cyronak et al 2014 wang et al 2014 estuaries sadat noori et al 2016 and coastal embayment liu et al 2017a had demonstrated the groundwater input would decrease the ph in receiving waters through continuously monitoring of sgd flux prior studies found the negative correlation between the sgd flux and seawater ph over tidal and seasonal scale demonstrating the contribution of groundwater as a driver of ocean acidification de weys et al 2011 egleston et al 2010 suggested the lowest buffering capacity of the ocean to atmospheric co2 when talk dic ratio 1 indicating that the talk dic ratio in coastal groundwater could be an indicator to identify the sgd contribution to ocean acidification as a driver or buffer for example in waquoit bay the sgd derived dic flux was found to be consistently greater than the talk flux suggesting that sgd may reduce the co2 buffering capacity of the coastal water liu et al 2017a however it was important to note that seawater ph could also increase due to enhanced biological productivity supported by sgd derived nutrients or by adsorption of protons on sediments lee and kim 2015 therefore site specific investigations were needed to determine the impact of sgd on the ph of receiving coastal waters in tolo harbor the talk dic ratio in sgd flux was 1 01 and 0 80 in the dry and wet seasons respectively table 4 indicating that the sgd flux tended to increase ph in coastal water in dry season but decrease ph in coastal water in wet season the increase in rainfall in the wet season rose the talk dic ratio 0 8 in sgd flux which decreased the overall seawater ph and strengthens ocean acidification in dry season the talk dic ratio was over 1 1 01 which would not strengthen ocean acidification however the talk dicratio in sgd flux was lower than that in the harbor seawater 1 1 in table 1 indicating that sgd may decrease the buffering capacity of atmospheric co2 in tolo harbor the findings of seasonal variation of talk dic ratio in sgd flux and decreasing of co2 buffering capacity by sgd were not specific to our study site the summarized talk dic ratios in sgd and seawater in different coastal ecosystems worldwide table 5 found that sgd talk dic ratios were generally lower than coastal seawater however field data from some sites including shelf waters off mangroves in australia sippo et al 2016 and nueces bay united states murgulet et al 2018 suggested sgd may ultimately increase the buffering capacity of coastal water after co2 equilibrates with the atmosphere for example by estimating the net inputs of talk and dic sippo et al 2019 found that talk inputs from mangrove was about 20 higher than dic inputs to coastal waters which would lead to overall increase of ph in receiving waters mangrove organic rich groundwater tended to have a high talk dic ratio compared to other systems table 5 suggesting that talk production may cause a localized increase in ocean ph following co2 degassing in addition a much higher production of talk in organic rich mangrove zone was observed in this study fig 3 suggesting the contribution of biogeochemical reactions in mangrove soil to buffer the groundwater acidity and could alter the situation of ocean acidification driven by sgd input therefore we suggested that sgd may be a driver of ocean acidification in most systems but a buffer in sgd derived from organic rich mangrove areas where talk production was high 5 conclusions quantification of carbonate biogeochemistry in intertidal aquifers and sgd derived carbon flux is challenging due to the complex and interacting hydrodynamics hydrogeology and biogeochemistry our new field data illustrated clear temporal variation in the distribution of talk and dic in an intertidal aquifer of tolo harbor hong kong at the semi diurnal and seasonal scales both tidal pumping and seasonal hydrologic variation led to changes in the dic production rate in the intertidal aquifer multiple abiotic and biotic processes such as aerobic respiration denitrification sulfate reduction and precipitation dissolution of carbonate minerals were found to control talk and dic in the different zones of the intertidal aquifer specifically the organic rich mangrove zone has higher talk and dic production via biotic processes such as aerobic respiration denitrification and sulfate reduction sulfate reduction was thought to be the major process due to the very good correlation between the sulfate depletion δso4 2 and production of talk δtalk iron cycling in the transition zone significantly influences on the carbonate geochemistry in addition to ph and temperature in organic poor bare beach good correlation between the δca2 and δtalk indicated that the abiotic processes such as dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals may be primarily responsible to produce talk and dic calculation of saturation indices for carbonate minerals suggested that huntite dissolution combined with calcite and aragonite precipitation may be responsible for talk and dic production in this zone while talk inventory in the intertidal aquifer was found to be seasonally stable the sgd derived talk flux was 60 greater in the wet season compared with the dry season in contrast to the talk inventory the dic inventory in the intertidal aquifer was about 24 higher in the wet season compared with in the dry season sgd derived dic fluxes were 95 higher in the wet season compared with the dry season among the sources of talk and dic in sgd this study suggested that talk and dic produced locally in the intertidal aquifer via multiple biotic and abiotic processes may contribute over 50 of the talk and dic discharged to coastal waters via sgd while prior studies had indicated conflicting results with respect to whether sgd was a potential driver or buffer for the ocean acidification in this study the talk dic ratio in groundwater was always lower than that in seawater and therefore sgd may reduce the seawater buffering capacity in tolo harbor and may serve as a local driver of ocean acidification credit authorship contribution statement

4794,event based rainfall runoff models used for design flood estimation and operational flood forecasting commonly represent losses the amount of rainfall which does not appear as runoff using lumped parsimonious models in gauged catchments these loss values are typically estimated by calibrating models to observed flood events studies which compare loss models tend to focus on which model best reproduces observed events however flood modelling often requires estimating events larger than those used for calibration it is thus of interest to examine how loss models perform over a range of flood magnitudes particularly larger floods here we evaluate the efficacy of different loss models by exploring the dependence between event magnitude and model performance we assess four loss models commonly used in flood modelling initial loss continuing loss ilcl initial loss proportional loss ilpl soil conservation service curve number scscn and probability distributed model pdm the four loss models were incorporated into a lumped rainfall runoff model that was calibrated to observed storm events for 35 small rural australian catchments using a total of 876 unique storm events in calibration ilpl was found to best reproduce observed hydrographs however the difference in performance between the four different models in terms of nse was small dependence between event magnitude and model performance was explored by re simulating observed events with the loss model parameters fixed to represent typical catchment conditions these typical parameters were estimated from the median of the observed parameter ranges in each catchment with the largest five events excluded so that the impact of extrapolating model parameters to events larger than which they were calibrated could be explored when these typical parameters were applied to large flood events the ilcl model displayed minimal dependence between model performance and event magnitude in contrast ilpl scscn and pdm all clearly displayed an underprediction bias which increased with increasing event size we explain this behaviour through the loss model structure of ilcl where ongoing loss the loss which occurs after runoff begins is constant and independent of rainfall fvmagnitude in contrast the three remaining models represent ongoing loss as a proportion of rainfall as the difference in magnitude between small and large floods increases with climate change extrapolation of flood models is likely to become a more pertinent issue in the future we conclude that loss models which are independent of event magnitude are better suited to flood modelling applications where extrapolation is required keywords event based losses design flood estimation flood forecasting extrapolation equifinality 1 introduction flooding is the most common natural disaster and leading cause of natural disaster deaths globally doocy et al 2013 modelling of floods using rainfall runoff models is important to assess the risk posed to society by flooding so that appropriate steps to mitigate flood damage can be taken the two most common applications of flood modelling are flood risk estimates for planning and design purposes and operational flood forecasting for real time predictions and warnings most practical flood estimation is undertaken using event based models that is models which simulate the flood response of a catchment from individual storm events such models are widely used for estimating floods of selected probability from rainfall i e design flood estimation pilgrim and cordery 1993 nrcs 2004a kjeldsen et al 2005 ball et al 2019 can be considered for operational flood forecasting e g berthet et al 2009 tramblay et al 2010 coustau et al 2013 silvestro and rebora 2014 and have been proposed for describing the rainfall runoff response in semi distributed models bartlett et al 2016 in event based flood modelling it is necessary to estimate the volume of storm runoff or rainfall excess where the part of rainfall that does not appear as runoff is commonly referred to as loss losses represent physical processes such as interception by vegetation infiltration into the soil retention on the surface depression storage and transmission loss through stream banks hill and thompson 2019 as these processes vary on fine spatial and temporal scales and are difficult to estimate using process based models it is common practice to represent losses using simple parsimonious lumped models pilgrim and cordery 1993 event based models incorporating parsimonious lumped loss models are attractive to practitioners as they are simple to use the methodologies required for their application are widely available and there is doubt regarding the worth of more complex procedures in view of the inaccuracies inherent in hydrologic data and lack of knowledge of actual runoff processes pilgrim and cordery 1993 the main drawback of event based models is that initial conditions such as antecedent catchment wetness need to be specified exogenously and that the joint probabilities involved in some flood generation processes need to be accounted for explicitly nathan and ball 2019 previous studies investigating lumped event based loss models have shown that there is utility in estimating initial conditions using proxies of catchment wetness such as antecedent precipitation index and baseflow in combination with remotely sensed products sunwoo and choi 2017 and soil moisture measurement brocca et al 2009 tramblay et al 2010 in operation flood forecasting applications streamflow data from the beginning of a flood event can be assimilated to correct initial conditions coustau et al 2013 or constrain flood estimates in a way which reduces the sensitivity of flood estimates to initial conditions berthet et al 2009 for design flood estimation hybrid approaches have been proposed which use periods of continuous simulation to provide initial conditions to the event based models used to simulate flood events paquet et al 2013 li et al 2014 despite the widespread use of parsimonious loss models for event based flood modelling most studies focus on a single model often one familiar to the study authors which is a common shortcoming of all hydrologic studies addor and melsen 2019 there is limited literature which compares or evaluates the suitability of loss models the few studies that do compare models e g chahinian et al 2005 joo et al 2014 bouvier et al 2018 evaluate the merit of different models based on their ability to reproduce observed events through calibration or validation where calibrated parameters are applied to a different set of events to which they were calibrated however the evaluation of a model s ability to simulate historic flood events does not necessarily provide insight into their appropriateness for estimating design floods and in operational flood forecasting aside from the necessity to consider the intrinsic differences between gauged observations and design and operational inputs it is common to utilise loss model parameters which have been obtained from calibration to observed events a leap of faith is required when estimating design floods or forecasting events which are much larger than the largest observed event in the catchment the use of any model outside the range of events used for calibration referred to hereon as extrapolation introduces additional uncertainty into predictions beven 2012 however this is a common challenge in many flood applications where it is often necessary to estimate floods that are larger than those used in calibration in design flood applications this extrapolation results from using probabilistic or standards based synthetic rainfalls that are larger than those observed in the catchment of interest and in operational forecasting it may result from the consideration of forecast rainfalls that are larger than those used in calibration therefore when testing whether a loss model is appropriate for flood modelling it is important not only to test if the model can be used to reproduce observed events but also test the model s performance when used to predict events over a range of flood magnitudes particularly those larger than which it has been calibrated for a loss model to be suitable under extrapolation its performance needs to be independent of event magnitude if a loss model s performance was to vary with event magnitude using that model to predict floods that are larger than those used in calibration may introduce bias into flood estimates the consequences of which may include over or under design of infrastructure or erroneous flood warnings despite extrapolation being a common necessity in flood modelling to the best of these authors knowledge no study has been published on the relative efficacy of different parsimonious loss models as a function of event magnitude here we apply four parsimonious loss models commonly used in event based flood modelling to 35 small rural catchments ranging in size between 20 and 100 km2 the models considered include the initial loss continuing loss ilcl model the initial loss proportional loss ilpl model the soil conservation service curve number scscn method and the probability distributed model pdm two parameter versions of the four models were adopted to facilitate direct comparison between the models in each model one parameter represents antecedent conditions that control the amount of loss that occurs prior to the onset of runoff and the other controls the amount of ongoing loss that occurs once runoff commences the performance of the models is evaluated by first considering their ability to simulate historic events and secondly by examining if the performance of the models varies with event magnitude 2 data the 35 catchments considered are located across australia fig 1 there is a distinct change in climate across the australian continent from winter dominated rainfall in the temperate south to summer dominated rainfall in the tropical north similar to mean rainfall seasonality rainfall maxima occur in the late austral summer february in the tropics and east coast of australia and in the austral winter september in the south west of australia in the south east however though mean rainfall is winter dominant rainfall maxima occur more uniformly through the year due to a mixture of dominant storm mechanisms wasko et al 2020 therefore the 35 selected catchments are distributed across a range of hydroclimatic conditions commonly encountered in hydrologic practice the catchments were identified as part of the revision of guidance on losses for australia s design flood estimation guidelines hill and thompson 2019 the catchments were selected to have a catchment area of between 20 and 100 km2 to minimise the effects of routing and minimise the chance of the rainfall gauges being unrepresentative of the catchment average rainfall a catchment centroid located within close proximity to a pluviograph rainfall gauge overlapping streamflow and pluviograph rainfall data for a minimum of 20 years predominately undisturbed land use i e largely free from lakes dams diversions and urban development these selection criteria represent a trade off in the number of catchments available for analysisand the quality of available rainfall and streamflow data information about the location area elevation and slope of each of the catchments is provided in appendix 1 catchment boundaries weredefined using a 9 nine second digital elevation model hutchinson et al 2008 streamflow data was obtained from the relevant local water authorities and the australian bureau of meteorology pluviograph data was obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology and was aggregated to one hour time step for analysis events were selected on the basis of their rainfall magnitude i e the largest rainfall events were selected rather than selecting the largest flood events as this provides an unbiased sample of losses that facilitate their use in the joint probability analysis of design floods pilgrim and cordery 1993 nathan and ling 2019 and uncertainty analysis in ensemble flood forecasting selection of losses on the basis of flood magnitude would yield a sample of losses that are biased towards wet catchment conditions and accordingly their use in design would exacerbate the problem of producing a flood estimate with a similar probability to that of the causative design rainfall pilgrim and cordery 1993 the storm events used in the analysis were selected on the basis of the maximum 24 hour rainfall magnitude where the number of events selected was the same as the number of years of concurrent streamflow and rainfall data for each catchment between 17 and 41 unique storm events were identified and hourly rainfall depths and surface runoff flow rates collected these 24 hour rainfall bursts were extended to capture the complete storms that contributed to flood runoff the start time of a complete storm was defined as the end of the first period of a minimum 12 hours of zero rainfall prior to the start of the 24 hour burst periods of zero rainfall greater than 12 hours were considered to represent separate storms surface runoff was obtained from observed streamflow for a selected storm events using a digital recursive filter to remove baseflow nathan and mcmahon 1990 ladson et al 2013 complete storm end times were then set to capture the remaining flood response of the catchment start and end times were extended to 9 00 am so that systematic observations of daily rainfall could be used to help inform the spatial variation of storm rainfalls for each event the spatial distribution of rainfall was calculated based on the average of inverse distance weighting of nearby daily rainfall stations this daily rainfall grid was then disaggregated to an hourly timestep using available pluviograph data once complete storms were obtained additional filtering was required to remove any events with erroneous or problematic data the criteria used to exclude events included those where pluviograph or streamflow data was missing throughout the event where streamflow did not occur as such events cannot be calibrated to a single set of parameters or where the volume of streamflow after baseflow separation exceeded the volume of rainfall which can occur when the observed rainfall data is not representative of the rainfall that fell on the catchment though only 13 such events were identified application of these criteria yielded a total of 876 storms with an average of 25 events per catchment 3 methods 3 1 event based modelling framework the event based modelling framework utilised in this study is presented as a flow chart in fig 2 only streamflows generated by surface runoff mechanisms are considered for each event the hourly rainfalls timeseries is partitioned into loss and storm runoff using a loss model the resulting storm runoff is input to a routing model to produce an hourly timeseries of streamflows over the duration of the event the loss model and routing model parameters are calibrated to match this modelled streamflow to the observed streamflow series after baseflow separation evapotranspiration is neglected as its impact on the water balance during large flood events is minimal compared to incident rainfalls 3 2 loss models we compare four different loss models that are commonly employed in event based modelling initial loss continuing loss ilcl initial loss proportional loss ilpl soil conservation service curve number scscn and probability distributed model pdm these models can be implemented in various ways but here two parameter versions of these models were adopted to facilitate comparison the first parameter controls the amount of loss prior to any runoff commencing in the catchment the second parameter controls the amount of loss which occurs once runoff has commenced 3 2 1 initial loss continuing loss ilcl the ilcl model divides losses into two terms the initial loss and the continuing loss the initial loss represents the depth of rain required to satisfy a moisture deficit before runoff commences the magnitude of this deficit is linked to catchment antecedent conditions with higher initial loss values expected from a drier catchment the continuing loss is a maximum rate of loss which is applied at each timestep once the initial loss is exhausted this continuing loss is consistent with runoff generated via an infiltration excess mechanism i e hortonian overland flow where runoff occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of soil mathematically the storm runoff can be expressed by 1 x t 0 for p cum t i l m a x 0 p t c l for p cum t i l where xt is the storm runoff in timestep t mm hour pt is the rainfall in timestep t mm hour pcum t is the cumulative precipitation to the end of timestep t mm il is the initial loss parameter mm and cl is the continuing loss parameter mm hour ilcl is recommended for design flood estimation of extreme floods in australia hill and thompson 2019 and is available in hec hms a rainfall runoff modelling suite that is widely used for design flood estimation usace hec 2018 in hec hms the ilcl model is included as the initial loss and constant loss model and it is also functionally equivalent to the deficit constant loss model where the difference between the initial deficit and the maximum deficit represents initial loss 3 2 2 initial loss proportional loss ilpl the ilpl model adopts the same initial loss parameterisation as ilcl however the constant continuing loss rate is replaced by a proportional loss which removes a constant percentage of rainfall once the initial loss is exhausted this is consistent with saturated overland flow mechanism where runoff is produced from a saturated proportion of the catchment which remains constant throughout an event mathematically the storm runoff can be expressed by 2 x i 0 f o r p cum t i l p t 100 p l 100 f o r p cum t i l where il is the initial loss parameter mm and pl is the proportional loss parameter this model has historically been used in urban design flood hydrology in australia pilgrim 1987 hill and thompson 2019 3 2 3 soil conservation service curve number scsccn the scscn model was originally conceived for calculating the total runoff volume from rainfall for small agricultural catchments by the usda soil conservation service scs now natural resources conservation service in the 1950s nrcs 2004a since then it has been widely applied in small catchment hydrology where it is principally used for the estimation of design floods ponce and hawkins 1996 nrcs 2004a it also has applications in operational forecasting tramblay et al 2010 coustau et al 2013 and for representing rainfall runoff response in semi distributed models bartlett et al 2016 the scscn model has also been applied in flood modelling studies outside the u s e g boughton 1989 brocca et al 2009 coustau et al 2012 the model calculates runoff volume or cumulative storm runoff xcum t 3 x cum t p t i a 2 p t i a s f o r p t i a where ia is the initial abstraction mm and s is the potential retention of the soil mm the theoretical range of s is from 0 no retention all rainfall becomes runoff once initial abstraction is satisfied to infinity no rainfall becomes runoff for practical applications s is mapped to a dimensionless parameter known as the curve number cn 4 s 25400 cn 25 4 cn can vary in the range 0 100 the national engineering handbook provides estimates of curve numbers for different land use types for five different hydrologic soil groups for use in ungauged catchments nrcs 2004b to aid estimation the initial abstraction of the model is often assumed to be some function of the potential retention effectively creating a one parameter version of the model 5 i a λ s the value λ 0 2 is adopted in the national engineering handbook nrcs 2004a however there is evidence that this value can vary in the range 0 0 3 between catchments mishra and singh 2003 the scscn model can be used to generate losses for a given timestep by considering the difference in cumulative runoff between timesteps 6 x t 0 for p t i a x c u m t x c u m t 1 for p t i a where xcum t is the cumulative storm runoff up until the end of time period t this temporally distributed form of the scscn model equation 6 is adopted in this study values of cn and ia are determined by calibration 3 2 4 probability distributed model pdm the probability distributed model pdm is described by moore 1985 and moore 2007 the pdm with interacting storage elements and without recharge can be applied as an event based model this form of the pdm describes the soil moisture holding capacity of the catchment cf as a probability distribution 7 c f c m a x 1 1 f 1 b where f is the proportion of the catchment where infiltration capacity is less than or equal to cf cmax is the maximum soil moisture holding capacity in the catchment and b is the shape factor for this study a linear shape was assumed b 1 an initial moisture parameter im is used to set the level of saturation in the catchment prior to an event storm runoff is then described by 8 x t 0 f o r p cum t i m p cum t 1 p cum t 1 c m a x c f c m a x b d c f f o r i m p cum t i m c max p t f o r p cum t i m c max in the case where im is negative it represents the rainfall deficit before runoff will commence when im is positive runoff will commence as soon as rainfall occurs from the proportion of the catchment which has cf im once cumulative rainfall is greater than the initial deficit plus the maximum soil moisture holding capacity the catchment is saturated and all rainfall becomes runoff pdm is consistent with variable saturated overland flow mechanisms where runoff is produced from a saturated proportion of the catchment which increases as the storm depth increases the version of the pdm described above is used for design flood estimation in the uk as part of revitalised flood hydrograph method with b 1 and im constrained to be greater than zero kjeldsen et al 2005 wallingford hydrosolutions 2019 the swmod model which has been applied as a loss model for design flood estimation in the west of australia has the same structure as pdm but includes an additional parameter for the minimum soil moisture holding capacity hill and thompson 2019 pdm had also been applied in operational flood forecasting as both an event based model roberts et al 2009 and a continuous simulation model werner and cranston 2009 the use of a probability distribution to describe the variability in infiltration capacity across the catchment like in pdm is also adopted in some more complex continuous simulation rainfall runoff models such as the vic model liang et al 1994 1996 and the xinanjian model ren jun 1992 3 2 5 comparison of loss models when comparing loss model behaviour it is useful to group model parameters into those which control the initial loss the amount of loss prior to any runoff commencing in the catchment and those controlling ongoing loss the amount of loss which occurs once runoff has commenced setting the shape parameter of the pdm to b 1 means that each of the four models have two free parameters which can be varied to produce an acceptable fit the il parameter in ilcl and ilpl and the ia parameter in scscn are conceptually identical and represent the catchment initial loss lower values of these parameters can be interpreted as higher catchment antecedent moisture prior to the event the im parameter in pdm also provides information about the catchment antecedent moisture however unlike il and ia which have a lower bound of zero its value can be both positive and negative for im 0 an initial loss of magnitude im occurs for im 0 no initial loss occurs and runoff will commence as soon as rainfalls on the proportion of the catchment which has cf im in all four models the remaining second parameter controls ongoing loss the process of runoff conversion varies considerably based on the model structure in ilcl the cl parameter is a maximum fixed rate of loss in each timestep and in cases when rainfall rate is less than the cl parameter all rainfall is lost in ilpl the pl parameter represents the proportion of rainfall lost in each timestep with this proportion fixed throughout an event in both scscn and pdm ongoing losses can be conceptualised as a proportion of rainfall which decreases as an event proceeds in scscn the cn parameter is inversely related to the soil retention s where the value of s controls the rate at which the proportion of rainfall which is lost decreases for pdm the value of cmax represents the maximum soil moisture holding capacity of the catchment in the case when b 1 cmax controls that rate at which the catchment becomes saturated as a rainfall event progresses and larger values of cmax result in catchments which have slower rates of saturation and therefore higher ongoing losses wang 2018 describes a generalised probability density function for the variability of catchment soil moisture capacity that can describe both the scscn and pdm models the most significant structural difference exists between ilcl and the three remaining models in ilcl ongoing losses are generated at a constant rate which is independent of rainfall except in the case when rainfall rate is less than the constant loss rate cl in the remaining three models ongoing losses are generated as a proportion of rainfall this proportion is constant in the case of ilpl and decreasing through the event for scscn and pdm 3 3 routing model as shown in fig 2 the timeseries of storm runoff was routed through a model representing the lag and attenuation associated with catchment and channel storage for consistency the same routing model was adopted for all four loss models where the distributed nature of overland and channel storage elements is represented by a single conceptual storage with routing based on a non linear power law between storage and discharge with two parameters k and m 9 s k q m where s is storage and q is storage discharge here the value of the non linearity parameter m was fixed at 0 8 as is general industry practice and the value of k was obtained by calibration pilgrim 1987 this lumped storage routing approach was found to satisfactorily reproduce routing from the semi distributed storage routing modelling software rorb laurenson et al 2010 where catchments were represented as a series of sub areas connected via conceptual storages in the same arrangement as the stream network 3 4 calibration the loss model parameters were calibrated to each storm event employing the shuffle complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 to maximise the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse objective function nash and sutcliffe 1970 10 n s e 1 t 1 n q m t q o t 2 t 1 n q o t q o 2 where q m t is the modelled streamflow at time t q o t is the observed streamflow at time t and q o is the mean observed discharge nse was considered an appropriate objective function for this study as the sum of squared residuals component places greater emphasis on larger flows with peak flow being a key variable in design flood estimation and operational flood forecasting whilst also preserving event timing additionally all nse values are bounded between 1 with a value of one indicating an exact match between observed and modelled hydrographs this makes it possible to compare nse values between events and catchments two sequential calibrations were undertaken the first calibration involved estimation of a single routing parameter to be used for all events for each combination of catchment and loss model the second involved the estimation of event specific loss parameters in the first calibration the routing parameters were allowed to vary by loss model as well as by catchment as the different loss models result in systematic differences in the timing of storm runoff and these differences impact directly on the routing required to simulate the flood response in each catchment the routing parameters were calibrated to the largest five events by peak flow in each catchment during this first calibration there were three free parameters the catchment routing parameter k and the two loss model parameters events where the routing response of the catchment was poorly represented by available gauging data events with mass balance problems or nse 0 7 were filtered out leaving 3 5 events per catchment the median of the k values from these filtered events was adopted as the fixed value of k for calibration of the event specific loss parameters the estimation process based on the five largest events is preferred to assess the routing characteristics of catchments given the focus here is the modelling large floods estimating k using all available events was found to have a negligible impact on estimates of k subsequently the second calibration focused on identifying the two optimum loss model parameters required to match observed and modelled streamflow for each individual event as discussed in section 2 the events used to calibrate the loss parameters were selected on the basis of their 24 hour rainfall magnitude yielding a sample of between 17 and 41 pairs of loss parameters for each combination of catchment and loss model the results of this second calibration are of focus for the rest of the paper 3 5 exploring dependence between loss model performance and flood magnitude the range of loss model parameters obtained from calibrating each individual event for each combination of catchment and loss model notionally represents the variability of losses associated with different antecedent conditions and differences in the physical characteristics of each catchment and uncertainties in the recorded streamflow separation of baseflow and estimate of rainfall over the catchment to test whether the loss model performance was dependent on event magnitude for each catchment a set of loss model parameters representative of typical catchment conditions was required the median of all calibrated parameters from all events in a catchment except the five largest floods by flood peak was adopted for this purpose taking the median of a group of events is standard practice in design flood estimation where it is necessary to minimise the problem of joint probability involved in the transformation of rainfall into floods pilgrim and cordery 1993 the calibrated parameters from the largest five flood peaks were not included in the typical parameter estimation process to allow investigation of extrapolation within the event dataset the parameters representing typical catchment conditions were then used to re simulate each flood event the extent to which the adoption of a single fixed loss parameter over a range of event magnitudes adversely impacts on model performance provides an indication of the suitability of the loss model for use in design and operational forecasting if model parameters are dependent on event magnitude then additional account needs to be given to the joint probabilities involved and this can be particularly problematic when estimating floods that are larger than those used in calibration to allow comparisons between catchments flood peaks were standardized by the median observed flood peak in each catchment for the purposes of subsequent analysis large floods are considered those greater than the catchment median i e dimensionless peak 1 which notionally relates to an annual exceedance probability of 1 in 2 given the method of event selection the dependence on larger floods is also considered by investigating events with dimensionless peaks 5 and 10 to test the sensitivity of the results to the choice of typical catchment parameters the 25th and 75th percentile of all calibrated parameters in each catchment excluding the five largest events were also used to re simulate each flood event 4 results 4 1 calibration performance the empirical cumulative density function cdf of nse metrics derived from calibration of the four loss models across all catchments and events is presented in fig 3 the cdf for a given value of nse x tells us the proportion of events where nse x for example for the ilpl model 50 of events have an nse 0 83 therefore the lower a curve for a given value of nse the smaller the proportion of events with model performances that are less than or equal to this value and the better the overall calibration performance of the model with respect to nse the results in fig 3 show that while there are clearly some differences in the performance of the four models the differences are modest for example there is only a minor difference in the median nse values for each of the two parameter models with ilpl 0 83 pdm 0 83 ilcl 0 80 and scscn 0 80 the ilpl model shows the best overall calibration performance followed by pdm the nse values for the ilpl and pdm models are relatively equal for values of cdf above 0 5 below a cdf value of 0 5 ilpl is the best performing model with pdm the second best ilcl and scscn display roughly similar calibration performance in terms of nse and both models perform slightly worse than ilpl and pdm it should be noted that the pdm calibration performance was found to be sensitive to the upper and lower bounds of the cmax parameter theoretically this parameter can take any real positive value a range of 10 10 000 mm was adopted which is thought to represent the likely maximum range of behaviour that could be conceived as being consistent with physical reasoning intuitively increasing the range of this parameter can increase model performance however values of cmax outside this range could be considered physically unrealistic 4 2 calibration parameters fig 4 presents the distribution of the initial loss parameters obtained from calibration of each of the loss models while fig 5 presents the distribution for the ongoing loss parameters a boxplot of the variation is shown for each catchment the additive inverse of im i e im is plotted for the pdm model to aid comparison with the other models a value of im 0 is equivalent to an initial loss in the other models values of im 0 are plotted on a log10 axis and represent events when some proportion of the catchment contributes runoff from the onset of the storm while ilcl and ilpl show very similar distributions of the il parameter fig 4 this is expected as both models represent the initial abstraction of rainfall in the same manner the distribution of ia in scscn bears some similarities to the il in ilcl and ilpl with catchments exhibiting the largest range of initial loss values being common amongst the three models however ia values for scscn generally have a narrower range and are more skewed toward zero this difference in range is likely caused by interdependence between the model parameters see section 5 1 for the pdm values of im 0 show similar ranges to ia for most catchments the majority of catchment have some events where im 0 meaning that initial losses are zero over the whole catchment and instead a partial response from the saturated portion of the catchment occurs with the advent of runoff in some catchments up to 75 of events have im 0 the magnitude of variation for the cl parameter varies between catchments with median values between 0 and 9 8 mm hour fig 5 the pl parameter in ilpl and the cn parameter in scscn are both bound between 0 and 100 however the two are inversely related i e no ongoing loss occurs when pl 0 or cn 100 for both models there are several catchments where these parameters vary between the upper and lower bound this means that within the same catchment there are some events where there is no ongoing loss pl 0 or cn 100 and some events where close to all rainfall becomes runoff pl 100 or cn 0 comparing pl to cn highlights the inverse relationship between the two parameters catchments 6 10 show values of pl between 70 and 100 and values of cn between 0 and 40 fig 5 this suggests that in these catchments which are located in south west australia region 2 only a small proportion of rainfall becomes runoff even during large storms during the calibration of pdm the value of cmax converged to the lower and upper bound of the parameter space 10 mm and 10 000 mm respectively this convergence did not show any consistency with physical conditions as results for different events within a single catchment converged to both the upper and lower bounds convergence to the bounds of the parameter space continued to occur even when the limits were expanded this convergence to unrealistic extreme values of cmax undermines the physical interpretation of the pdm model and suggests that the model structure is not well suited to event based flood estimation we also note that scscn is often implemented in a single parameter form where the initial abstraction is a function of the potential retention of the soil therefore calibration results were also derived for two different single parameter versions of the model i where ia 0 and ii where ia 0 2s as per equation 5 where λ 0 2 calibration performance was significantly improved using ia 0 where median nse 0 72 compared to ia 0 2s where median nse 0 66 results not shown this result is consistent with findings of woodward et al 2003 who argues that a value of λ 0 05 is more appropriate than 0 2 however the results may be location specific given other studies have shown the values of λ to vary in the range 0 0 3 between catchments mishra and singh 2003 4 3 variation of loss model performance with event magnitude to test the dependency of each model s structure on event magnitude estimates of typical catchment loss model parameter values taken as the median of the parameter values obtained from calibration excluding the largest five flood peaks in each catchment were used to re simulate each flood event the simulated peak flows were then compared to observed peak flows to investigate any systematic differences in the performance of the four loss models with event magnitude fig 6 shows the modelled peak flow using the estimated typical catchment parameters vs observed peak flow as a heat map events from all catchments are shown with both modelled and observed peak flow standardised by the observed median peak flow for each catchment to allow comparison on a single set of axes the colour of each grid cell on the heat map represents the number of events in that cell and axes have been log10 transformed a lowess local smoothing regression is fitted to the data in the heat map to aid interpretation solid line to demonstrate the sensitivity of the dependency of each loss model to the method of estimating typical parameters lowess regressions fitted to re simulated flood peaks using the 25th and 75th percentile of loss model parameters excluding the five largest events are also shown dashed lines all four models show considerable scatter around the 1 1 line fig 6 this is expected and reflects the natural variability inherent in the antecedent wetness of catchments where use of typical catchment parameters should lead to the overprediction of events which occurred on wet catchments and underprediction of events which occurred on dry catchments for all four models the local regression line plots above the 1 1 for smaller events dimensionless observed peak flow 1 meaning that modelled flood peaks using typical catchment parameter values are overestimated this result is intuitive as smaller events are likely characterised by high losses and thus applying median loss parameter values would underestimate losses and overestimate flood peaks however these small events are rarely what is of interest in flood modelling looking at larger events ilcl is the only model that does not show distinct bias in modelled flood peaks when using typical catchment parameters for flood events greater than the median dimensionless observed peak flow 1 the local regression of quantiles predicted by the ilcl model tracks close to the 1 1 line for large events with the heat map scatter approximately symmetrical around the 1 1 line in contrast ilpl scscn and pdm all show clear dependence between model performance and event magnitude with each model tending to under predict observed flood peaks when typical catchment parameters are used for these three models the local regression line plots below the 1 1 line for large events with most of the heat map scatter also plotting below the 1 1 line table 1 quantifies this bias as the average of the residual between dimensionless modelled and observed flood peaks three different quantile magnitudes are considered based on the size of the flood peak ilcl demonstrates an overestimation bias with an average residual of 0 85 for those flood events with a dimensionless observed peak 1 this bias increases when moving to more extreme events with an average residual of 1 31 for the largest floods with a dimensionless observed peak 10 in contrast the three remaining models display an underestimation bias which increases markedly when moving to larger events of these three models scscn 8 00 shows the smallest negative average residual when dimensionless flood is 10 while the average residual of pdm and ilpl are more than double scscn 14 90 and 16 80 respectively indicating approximately an order of magnitude underestimation these observations tell us directly about the performance of the four loss models under extrapolation especially when focusing on dimensionless observed peak 5 as these events were estimated under conditions of extrapolation as the largest 5 events were excluded from calculations of typical catchment parameters the results suggest that of the four models only ilcl is suitable for use under extrapolation or in applications where no explicit consideration is given to the joint probabilities involved as it is the only model where performance is not dependent on event magnitude in contrast the ilpl scscn and pdm models do not appear appropriate for use under extrapolation as they display a clear dependence between event magnitude and model performance this dependence results in a significant underestimation bias which increases with event magnitude when using typical catchment parameters to estimate large floods estimating typical parameters using the median of all events including the five largest events did not materially change these results the standard deviation of the residual between dimensionless modelled and observed flood peak was also calculated however no material difference was observed between the four models the lowess regressions based on the 25th and 75th percentile of loss parameter values excluding the largest five events provide a sensitivity analysis of the impact of different choices of typical parameters on the dependence between model performance and flood magnitude evidently using the 25th percentile will under predict losses and over predict flood peaks on average while using the 75th percentile will over predict losses and under predict flood peaks on average however for large flood events the shape of the lowess smoothing line remains similar to that of when the median is used the systematic underestimation of large flood peaks remains for ilpl scscn and pdm regardless of choice of typical parameters this provides further evidence that the performance of these models is dependent on event magnitude and hence that they are not suitable for use under extrapolation in contrast the 25th and 75th lowess smoothing lines for ilcl straddle the 1 1 line whilst not symmetrical this is behaviour is consistent with what we would expect from a model where performance is independent of event magnitude it is also of interest that for large floods dimensionless peak 1 ilcl s spread between the 25th and 75th percentile lowess regressions decreases as event size increases while it remains relatively constant for ilpl scscn and pdm the implications of this observation are discussed in terms of the sensitivity of modelled peaks to changes in loss parameter values in section 5 2 5 discussion 5 1 implications of model structure on calibration performance when evaluating the calibration of the four loss models it is useful to consider both the calibration performance how well the models were able to reproduce observed events and how robustly model parameters can be identified which we assess by investigating the degree of parameter interaction during calibration ilpl and pdm displayed the best calibration performance though the reduction in performance when using ilcl and scscn was small while better calibration performance could indicate that ilpl and pdm have greater efficacy the pl and cmax calibrated parameters approaching the bounds of the parameter space could also be indicative of a model structure not well suited to estimating floods by removing a proportion of rainfall at each time step rather than a fixed amount models such as ilpl and pdm may be more prone to overfitting as the ongoing loss parameter can be finely tuned to match the observed flow volume however this does not explain why scscn which also represents loss as a proportion of rainfall does not perform better than ilcl a further insight into the adequacy of loss model structure can be gained by investigating the degree to which model calibration is confounded by parameter interaction fig 7 presents an example response surface of the nse for each of the models for a single event on a single catchment parameter combinations resulting in nse 0 are not shown while representing just a single event the response surfaces shown in fig 7 represent common behaviour observed in studying surfaces from different events for each of the loss models therefore points discussed here are thought to generalize broadly to all events parameter interaction can be observed to a different extent in each model close to the optima location of maximum nse diagonal ridges of high nse are present where the value of nse is insensitive to small changes in parameter values conceptually this parameter interaction can be thought of trading a portion of the initial loss for ongoing loss for example in ilcl a small increase in initial loss could be offset by a small decrease in continuing loss to maintain an appropriate storm runoff volume though with some change in timing this interaction can hinder efforts at parameter identification as the presence of multiple parameter sets lead to similar model performance otherwise referred to as equifinality beven 2006 parameter interaction correlation is well known to lead to inefficiencies in automatic calibration schemes kavetski et al 2006 but also creates challenges when applying the models to conditions that lie outside the range used in their calibration fowler et al 2016 stephens et al 2018 parameter interaction is present in all four models however equifinality issues are most pronounced for pdm where the response surface shows a long diagonal ridge of high nse values this highlights a highly linear relationship between the cmax and im parameters where similar model performance can be obtained by simultaneously increasing or decreasing both the cmax and im parameter values this means that suitable calibrations could potentially be obtained using a wide range of combinations of cmax and im that sit along the ridge this is at odds with the physical interpretation of the pdm model where the cmax parameter is meant to represent the maximum soil moisture holding capacity in the catchment and may explain why catchments displayed such a wide range of cmax values during calibration the presence of multiple suitable cmax values is likely evidence that it is difficult to estimate catchment soil moisture holding capacity using rainfall and streamflow data from a single flood event which casts doubt on the suitability on the use of the pdm model for event based flood estimation a potential strategy to alleviate the equifinality would be to calibrate multiple storm events for a single catchment simultaneously with a single catchment cmax value and event specific im values however this in turn would create a higher dimension calibration problem which would introduce additional challenges ilcl shows a stepped response surface where for certain values of cl there is no change in nse for a given change in il the behaviour is most obvious for high cl values and represents some threshold behaviour in the model this stepped shape occurs when cl is greater than the amount of rainfall that falls in the initial timesteps in the example shown this does not affect the model optima and we see a smooth response surface however it is possible that this threshold behaviour could impact calibration at the optima in some cases which would hinder calibration efforts and in part explain the poorer calibration using ilcl ilpl and scscn both display smooth response surfaces around their respective optima the diagonal slope of the contour lines around these optima demonstrate some parameter interaction for example in ilpl a small decrease in il can be offset by a small increase in pl however this parameter interaction does not appear to have impacted the calibration scheme s convergence to the optima 5 2 implications of model structure on dependence with flood magnitude the results presented in fig 6 suggest that ilcl is the only model which does not introduce substantial underprediction bias when estimating large flood events under conditions of extrapolation using loss model parameter values representative of typical catchment conditions of the four loss models investigated ilcl is the only model where ongoing losses are represented by a constant rate which is independent of rainfall amount in the other three models ongoing losses are a function of rainfall this is most apparent for ilpl where the pl parameter determines the constant proportion of rainfall which is converted to ongoing loss meanwhile scscn and pdm represent ongoing loss as a proportion of rainfall which decreases throughout an event this structural difference in models can explain the difference dependencies between model performance and event magnitude presented in fig 6 for example consider a catchment where a single 5 mm 1 hour rainfall burst fell and produced 2 5 mm hour of runoff neglecting initial losses and routing ilcl and ilpl could be calibrated to reproduce the event cl 2 5 mm hour and pl 50 adopting these calibrated losses and extrapolating to a much larger 20 mm 1 hour rainfall burst ilpl would produce 10 mm hour of runoff and ilcl would produce 17 5 mm hour runoff as the ongoing loss in ilpl scales with rainfall volume the amount of loss produced increases to 10 mm in contrast the amount of ongoing loss in ilcl is independent of rainfall and remains at 2 5 mm as for the smaller calibration event in fig 6 the three models where ongoing loss is represented as a proportion of rainfall ilpl scscn and pdm all clearly display underestimation bias for large flood events which increases with event magnitude this suggests that using loss models where losses scale with rainfall to estimate flood events larger than the events used to calibrate the model will lead to underestimation of flood peaks a potential solution to address this behaviour is through joint probability techniques where relationships between loss parameters and event magnitude are used to ensure unbiased flood estimates however there is no guarantee that these relationships will hold outside of the range of events over which they are developed and they add additional complexity that can be avoided by using models without this dependence the systematic underestimation of large flood peaks when using typical catchment parameters also suggests that conceptualising ongoing loss as a proportion of rainfall may not be representative of catchment runoff generating mechanisms in contrast the ilcl model with an ongoing loss that is independent of rainfall depth shows relatively unbiased estimates of large flood peaks suggesting that its parameters are more robust when extrapolated to larger events than used in calibration the spread between the 25th and 75th lowess regressions in fig 6 provides an insight into the sensitivity of loss models to changes in parameter values relative to event size given all four models represent initial losses in a similar manner any difference in behaviour can be attributed to the ongoing loss parameters for dimensionless flood peaks 1 the spread between the 25th and 75th percentile regressions decrease with increasing event size for ilcl this suggests that the model is less sensitive to changes in cl as event size increases which is intuitive for a model where losses are independent of rainfall magnitude for a fixed value of cl the ratio of cl to rainfall magnitude deceases as event size increases and hence the relative change of flow as a result of changing cl decreases in contrast for ilpl scscn and pdm the spread between the 25th and 75th regressions remain relatively constant between the 25th and 75th percentile regressions for dimensionless floods 1 this behaviour is likely explained by the fact that for these three models losses scale with rainfall and hence for large events where initial loss is small relative to total loss a change in ongoing loss parameter has the same proportional impact on flow regardless of rainfall magnitude this suggests that ilcl is a more robust loss model for predicting large events as the propagation of errors from calibration have less of an impact on estimated flood peaks and provides further support for using models like ilcl where losses are independent of rainfall for extrapolation applications an alternative way to assess the suitability to loss models under extrapolation would be to assess if there is any dependence between calibrated loss model parameters and both rainfall and flood magnitudes the presence of any such relationship would be evidence that model provides biased estimates of flood peaks unless these joint probabilities are explicitly accounted for when using the model to estimate floods however variability in loss parameters values due to uncertainties in streamflow and rainfall data as described in section 3 5 interdependence between model parameters as discussed in section 5 1 and differences in runoff processes between catchments all confound attempts to investigate such relationships in contrast a key advantage of our methodology is that by looking directly at modelled flows we largely avoid the impact of variability and interdependence of loss parameter values in this study we focus on parsimonious two parameter models commonly used in event based flood modelling each with an equivalent degree of flexibility to take advantage of the available observations however there are other less parsimonious loss models which can be used for event based flood modelling which also conceptualise ongoing losses in a way that is independent of rainfall these include green and ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 horton s infiltration equation horton 1933 and modified holton overton equation huggins and monke 1968 such models represent ongoing loss typically called infiltration rate in the literature discussing these models as a rate of loss which decreases throughout a storm event as a catchment becomes wetter however the use of such models would add additional parameters which further confounds the difficulty of robust estimation and further research would be required to understand if the ability to better simulate historic events gained by adding these additional parameters translates through to better performance under conditions of extrapolation 5 3 practical considerations for choosing a loss model the findings of this study are expected to become more pertinent in the presence of climate change where there is evidence that in some areas changes in soil moisture may drive a decrease in peak flow for smaller more frequent flood events notionally those with a return period more frequent than 1 in 10 years but that increases in rainfall intensity may lead to an increase in larger rarer flood events wasko and nathan 2019 bertola et al 2020 this would likely exacerbate the issues of extrapolation as the difference in magnitude will increase between more frequently observed flood events available for calibration and larger events which are typically of interest in flood modelling therefore care should be taken to select loss models whose performance is independent of flood magnitude the key finding here that loss models which represent ongoing loss independently of rainfall are most suitable for use under extrapolation has implications for design flood estimation and operational flood forecasting where extrapolation of parameters is routinely necessary our results suggest that the use of models that represent ongoing loss as a function of rainfall in these contexts may result in the under design of infrastructure or erroneous flood warnings both of which have the potential to result in loss of life or costly damage in design flood estimation losses can be estimated either deterministically or as part of a joint probability approach which attempts to mimic the joint interaction of flood drivers in nature at its simplest this involves joint sampling of losses and rainfall intensity kuczera et al 2006 nathan and ling 2019 in operational flood forecasting ensembles of forecasts are increasingly used to assess the uncertainty in predictions including uncertainty relating to initial conditions and hydrologic model parameterisation cloke and pappenberger 2009 while this study was undertaken in a manner that illustrates the general extrapolation problem further research may consider using specific modelling frameworks relevant to the application of interest to confirm the same behaviour observed here 6 conclusions motivated by a lack of studies comparing the efficacy of parsimonious loss models for event based flood modelling we compared four commonly used two parameter loss models in 35 small rural australian catchments initial loss continuing loss ilcl model initial loss proportional loss ilpl model soil conservation service curve number scscn method and probability distributed model pdm crucially instead of solely focusing on how well the models reproduce observed events we sought to compare the performance of loss models under conditions of varying event magnitude when tested using fixed loss parameters indicative of typical conditions this challenge of applying typical loss model parameters is specific to event based models and although the problem can be ameliorated by using joint probability techniques the use of models that have a robust structure under conditions of extrapolation greatly simplify the issues that need to be considered model calibration showed that initial loss proportional loss was the best performing model however the difference in calibration performance between the four models was small probability distributed model was shown to demonstrate significant parameter interaction which may confound attempts to calibrate event based forms of the model the conditions of extrapolation were emulated by applying typical catchment parameter values taken as the median of calibrated parameter values within each catchment excluding the five largest events to re simulate all observed flood events including the five largest events not used in typical parameter estimation across these re simulations initial loss continuing loss model did not exhibit dependence between model performance in terms of peak flow and event magnitude in contrast initial loss proportional loss soil conservation service curve number and probability distributed model re simulations displayed systematic under prediction of large flood events initial loss continuing loss was also found to be less sensitive to changes in parameter values for large floods than the other models these results suggest that models such as initial loss continuing loss where ongoing losses i e losses that occur once runoff has commenced are independent of rainfall are more suitable for use under extrapolation than models such as initial loss proportional loss soil conservation service curve number and probability distributed model where ongoing losses are represented as a proportion of rainfall credit

4794,event based rainfall runoff models used for design flood estimation and operational flood forecasting commonly represent losses the amount of rainfall which does not appear as runoff using lumped parsimonious models in gauged catchments these loss values are typically estimated by calibrating models to observed flood events studies which compare loss models tend to focus on which model best reproduces observed events however flood modelling often requires estimating events larger than those used for calibration it is thus of interest to examine how loss models perform over a range of flood magnitudes particularly larger floods here we evaluate the efficacy of different loss models by exploring the dependence between event magnitude and model performance we assess four loss models commonly used in flood modelling initial loss continuing loss ilcl initial loss proportional loss ilpl soil conservation service curve number scscn and probability distributed model pdm the four loss models were incorporated into a lumped rainfall runoff model that was calibrated to observed storm events for 35 small rural australian catchments using a total of 876 unique storm events in calibration ilpl was found to best reproduce observed hydrographs however the difference in performance between the four different models in terms of nse was small dependence between event magnitude and model performance was explored by re simulating observed events with the loss model parameters fixed to represent typical catchment conditions these typical parameters were estimated from the median of the observed parameter ranges in each catchment with the largest five events excluded so that the impact of extrapolating model parameters to events larger than which they were calibrated could be explored when these typical parameters were applied to large flood events the ilcl model displayed minimal dependence between model performance and event magnitude in contrast ilpl scscn and pdm all clearly displayed an underprediction bias which increased with increasing event size we explain this behaviour through the loss model structure of ilcl where ongoing loss the loss which occurs after runoff begins is constant and independent of rainfall fvmagnitude in contrast the three remaining models represent ongoing loss as a proportion of rainfall as the difference in magnitude between small and large floods increases with climate change extrapolation of flood models is likely to become a more pertinent issue in the future we conclude that loss models which are independent of event magnitude are better suited to flood modelling applications where extrapolation is required keywords event based losses design flood estimation flood forecasting extrapolation equifinality 1 introduction flooding is the most common natural disaster and leading cause of natural disaster deaths globally doocy et al 2013 modelling of floods using rainfall runoff models is important to assess the risk posed to society by flooding so that appropriate steps to mitigate flood damage can be taken the two most common applications of flood modelling are flood risk estimates for planning and design purposes and operational flood forecasting for real time predictions and warnings most practical flood estimation is undertaken using event based models that is models which simulate the flood response of a catchment from individual storm events such models are widely used for estimating floods of selected probability from rainfall i e design flood estimation pilgrim and cordery 1993 nrcs 2004a kjeldsen et al 2005 ball et al 2019 can be considered for operational flood forecasting e g berthet et al 2009 tramblay et al 2010 coustau et al 2013 silvestro and rebora 2014 and have been proposed for describing the rainfall runoff response in semi distributed models bartlett et al 2016 in event based flood modelling it is necessary to estimate the volume of storm runoff or rainfall excess where the part of rainfall that does not appear as runoff is commonly referred to as loss losses represent physical processes such as interception by vegetation infiltration into the soil retention on the surface depression storage and transmission loss through stream banks hill and thompson 2019 as these processes vary on fine spatial and temporal scales and are difficult to estimate using process based models it is common practice to represent losses using simple parsimonious lumped models pilgrim and cordery 1993 event based models incorporating parsimonious lumped loss models are attractive to practitioners as they are simple to use the methodologies required for their application are widely available and there is doubt regarding the worth of more complex procedures in view of the inaccuracies inherent in hydrologic data and lack of knowledge of actual runoff processes pilgrim and cordery 1993 the main drawback of event based models is that initial conditions such as antecedent catchment wetness need to be specified exogenously and that the joint probabilities involved in some flood generation processes need to be accounted for explicitly nathan and ball 2019 previous studies investigating lumped event based loss models have shown that there is utility in estimating initial conditions using proxies of catchment wetness such as antecedent precipitation index and baseflow in combination with remotely sensed products sunwoo and choi 2017 and soil moisture measurement brocca et al 2009 tramblay et al 2010 in operation flood forecasting applications streamflow data from the beginning of a flood event can be assimilated to correct initial conditions coustau et al 2013 or constrain flood estimates in a way which reduces the sensitivity of flood estimates to initial conditions berthet et al 2009 for design flood estimation hybrid approaches have been proposed which use periods of continuous simulation to provide initial conditions to the event based models used to simulate flood events paquet et al 2013 li et al 2014 despite the widespread use of parsimonious loss models for event based flood modelling most studies focus on a single model often one familiar to the study authors which is a common shortcoming of all hydrologic studies addor and melsen 2019 there is limited literature which compares or evaluates the suitability of loss models the few studies that do compare models e g chahinian et al 2005 joo et al 2014 bouvier et al 2018 evaluate the merit of different models based on their ability to reproduce observed events through calibration or validation where calibrated parameters are applied to a different set of events to which they were calibrated however the evaluation of a model s ability to simulate historic flood events does not necessarily provide insight into their appropriateness for estimating design floods and in operational flood forecasting aside from the necessity to consider the intrinsic differences between gauged observations and design and operational inputs it is common to utilise loss model parameters which have been obtained from calibration to observed events a leap of faith is required when estimating design floods or forecasting events which are much larger than the largest observed event in the catchment the use of any model outside the range of events used for calibration referred to hereon as extrapolation introduces additional uncertainty into predictions beven 2012 however this is a common challenge in many flood applications where it is often necessary to estimate floods that are larger than those used in calibration in design flood applications this extrapolation results from using probabilistic or standards based synthetic rainfalls that are larger than those observed in the catchment of interest and in operational forecasting it may result from the consideration of forecast rainfalls that are larger than those used in calibration therefore when testing whether a loss model is appropriate for flood modelling it is important not only to test if the model can be used to reproduce observed events but also test the model s performance when used to predict events over a range of flood magnitudes particularly those larger than which it has been calibrated for a loss model to be suitable under extrapolation its performance needs to be independent of event magnitude if a loss model s performance was to vary with event magnitude using that model to predict floods that are larger than those used in calibration may introduce bias into flood estimates the consequences of which may include over or under design of infrastructure or erroneous flood warnings despite extrapolation being a common necessity in flood modelling to the best of these authors knowledge no study has been published on the relative efficacy of different parsimonious loss models as a function of event magnitude here we apply four parsimonious loss models commonly used in event based flood modelling to 35 small rural catchments ranging in size between 20 and 100 km2 the models considered include the initial loss continuing loss ilcl model the initial loss proportional loss ilpl model the soil conservation service curve number scscn method and the probability distributed model pdm two parameter versions of the four models were adopted to facilitate direct comparison between the models in each model one parameter represents antecedent conditions that control the amount of loss that occurs prior to the onset of runoff and the other controls the amount of ongoing loss that occurs once runoff commences the performance of the models is evaluated by first considering their ability to simulate historic events and secondly by examining if the performance of the models varies with event magnitude 2 data the 35 catchments considered are located across australia fig 1 there is a distinct change in climate across the australian continent from winter dominated rainfall in the temperate south to summer dominated rainfall in the tropical north similar to mean rainfall seasonality rainfall maxima occur in the late austral summer february in the tropics and east coast of australia and in the austral winter september in the south west of australia in the south east however though mean rainfall is winter dominant rainfall maxima occur more uniformly through the year due to a mixture of dominant storm mechanisms wasko et al 2020 therefore the 35 selected catchments are distributed across a range of hydroclimatic conditions commonly encountered in hydrologic practice the catchments were identified as part of the revision of guidance on losses for australia s design flood estimation guidelines hill and thompson 2019 the catchments were selected to have a catchment area of between 20 and 100 km2 to minimise the effects of routing and minimise the chance of the rainfall gauges being unrepresentative of the catchment average rainfall a catchment centroid located within close proximity to a pluviograph rainfall gauge overlapping streamflow and pluviograph rainfall data for a minimum of 20 years predominately undisturbed land use i e largely free from lakes dams diversions and urban development these selection criteria represent a trade off in the number of catchments available for analysisand the quality of available rainfall and streamflow data information about the location area elevation and slope of each of the catchments is provided in appendix 1 catchment boundaries weredefined using a 9 nine second digital elevation model hutchinson et al 2008 streamflow data was obtained from the relevant local water authorities and the australian bureau of meteorology pluviograph data was obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology and was aggregated to one hour time step for analysis events were selected on the basis of their rainfall magnitude i e the largest rainfall events were selected rather than selecting the largest flood events as this provides an unbiased sample of losses that facilitate their use in the joint probability analysis of design floods pilgrim and cordery 1993 nathan and ling 2019 and uncertainty analysis in ensemble flood forecasting selection of losses on the basis of flood magnitude would yield a sample of losses that are biased towards wet catchment conditions and accordingly their use in design would exacerbate the problem of producing a flood estimate with a similar probability to that of the causative design rainfall pilgrim and cordery 1993 the storm events used in the analysis were selected on the basis of the maximum 24 hour rainfall magnitude where the number of events selected was the same as the number of years of concurrent streamflow and rainfall data for each catchment between 17 and 41 unique storm events were identified and hourly rainfall depths and surface runoff flow rates collected these 24 hour rainfall bursts were extended to capture the complete storms that contributed to flood runoff the start time of a complete storm was defined as the end of the first period of a minimum 12 hours of zero rainfall prior to the start of the 24 hour burst periods of zero rainfall greater than 12 hours were considered to represent separate storms surface runoff was obtained from observed streamflow for a selected storm events using a digital recursive filter to remove baseflow nathan and mcmahon 1990 ladson et al 2013 complete storm end times were then set to capture the remaining flood response of the catchment start and end times were extended to 9 00 am so that systematic observations of daily rainfall could be used to help inform the spatial variation of storm rainfalls for each event the spatial distribution of rainfall was calculated based on the average of inverse distance weighting of nearby daily rainfall stations this daily rainfall grid was then disaggregated to an hourly timestep using available pluviograph data once complete storms were obtained additional filtering was required to remove any events with erroneous or problematic data the criteria used to exclude events included those where pluviograph or streamflow data was missing throughout the event where streamflow did not occur as such events cannot be calibrated to a single set of parameters or where the volume of streamflow after baseflow separation exceeded the volume of rainfall which can occur when the observed rainfall data is not representative of the rainfall that fell on the catchment though only 13 such events were identified application of these criteria yielded a total of 876 storms with an average of 25 events per catchment 3 methods 3 1 event based modelling framework the event based modelling framework utilised in this study is presented as a flow chart in fig 2 only streamflows generated by surface runoff mechanisms are considered for each event the hourly rainfalls timeseries is partitioned into loss and storm runoff using a loss model the resulting storm runoff is input to a routing model to produce an hourly timeseries of streamflows over the duration of the event the loss model and routing model parameters are calibrated to match this modelled streamflow to the observed streamflow series after baseflow separation evapotranspiration is neglected as its impact on the water balance during large flood events is minimal compared to incident rainfalls 3 2 loss models we compare four different loss models that are commonly employed in event based modelling initial loss continuing loss ilcl initial loss proportional loss ilpl soil conservation service curve number scscn and probability distributed model pdm these models can be implemented in various ways but here two parameter versions of these models were adopted to facilitate comparison the first parameter controls the amount of loss prior to any runoff commencing in the catchment the second parameter controls the amount of loss which occurs once runoff has commenced 3 2 1 initial loss continuing loss ilcl the ilcl model divides losses into two terms the initial loss and the continuing loss the initial loss represents the depth of rain required to satisfy a moisture deficit before runoff commences the magnitude of this deficit is linked to catchment antecedent conditions with higher initial loss values expected from a drier catchment the continuing loss is a maximum rate of loss which is applied at each timestep once the initial loss is exhausted this continuing loss is consistent with runoff generated via an infiltration excess mechanism i e hortonian overland flow where runoff occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of soil mathematically the storm runoff can be expressed by 1 x t 0 for p cum t i l m a x 0 p t c l for p cum t i l where xt is the storm runoff in timestep t mm hour pt is the rainfall in timestep t mm hour pcum t is the cumulative precipitation to the end of timestep t mm il is the initial loss parameter mm and cl is the continuing loss parameter mm hour ilcl is recommended for design flood estimation of extreme floods in australia hill and thompson 2019 and is available in hec hms a rainfall runoff modelling suite that is widely used for design flood estimation usace hec 2018 in hec hms the ilcl model is included as the initial loss and constant loss model and it is also functionally equivalent to the deficit constant loss model where the difference between the initial deficit and the maximum deficit represents initial loss 3 2 2 initial loss proportional loss ilpl the ilpl model adopts the same initial loss parameterisation as ilcl however the constant continuing loss rate is replaced by a proportional loss which removes a constant percentage of rainfall once the initial loss is exhausted this is consistent with saturated overland flow mechanism where runoff is produced from a saturated proportion of the catchment which remains constant throughout an event mathematically the storm runoff can be expressed by 2 x i 0 f o r p cum t i l p t 100 p l 100 f o r p cum t i l where il is the initial loss parameter mm and pl is the proportional loss parameter this model has historically been used in urban design flood hydrology in australia pilgrim 1987 hill and thompson 2019 3 2 3 soil conservation service curve number scsccn the scscn model was originally conceived for calculating the total runoff volume from rainfall for small agricultural catchments by the usda soil conservation service scs now natural resources conservation service in the 1950s nrcs 2004a since then it has been widely applied in small catchment hydrology where it is principally used for the estimation of design floods ponce and hawkins 1996 nrcs 2004a it also has applications in operational forecasting tramblay et al 2010 coustau et al 2013 and for representing rainfall runoff response in semi distributed models bartlett et al 2016 the scscn model has also been applied in flood modelling studies outside the u s e g boughton

curve numbers for different land use types for five different hydrologic soil groups for use in ungauged catchments nrcs 2004b to aid estimation the initial abstraction of the model is often assumed to be some function of the potential retention effectively creating a one parameter version of the model 5 i a λ s the value λ 0 2 is adopted in the national engineering handbook nrcs 2004a however there is evidence that this value can vary in the range 0 0 3 between catchments mishra and singh 2003 the scscn model can be used to generate losses for a given timestep by considering the difference in cumulative runoff between timesteps 6 x t 0 for p t i a x c u m t x c u m t 1 for p t i a where xcum t is the cumulative storm runoff up until the end of time period t this temporally distributed form of the scscn model equation 6 is adopted in this study values of cn and ia are determined by calibration 3 2 4 probability distributed model pdm the probability distributed model pdm is described by moore 1985 and moore 2007 the pdm with interacting storage elements and without recharge can be applied as an event based model this form of the pdm describes the soil moisture holding capacity of the catchment cf as a probability distribution 7 c f c m a x 1 1 f 1 b where f is the proportion of the catchment where infiltration capacity is less than or equal to cf cmax is the maximum soil moisture holding capacity in the catchment and b is the shape factor for this study a linear shape was assumed b 1 an initial moisture parameter im is used to set the level of saturation in the catchment prior to an event storm runoff is then described by 8 x t 0 f o r p cum t i m p cum t 1 p cum t 1 c m a x c f c m a x b d c f f o r i m p cum t i m c max p t f o r p cum t i m c max in the case where im is negative it represents the rainfall deficit before runoff will commence when im is positive runoff will commence as soon as rainfall occurs from the proportion of the catchment which has cf im once cumulative rainfall is greater than the initial deficit plus the maximum soil moisture holding capacity the catchment is saturated and all rainfall becomes runoff pdm is consistent with variable saturated overland flow mechanisms where runoff is produced from a saturated proportion of the catchment which increases as the storm depth increases the version of the pdm described above is used for design flood estimation in the uk as part of revitalised flood hydrograph method with b 1 and im constrained to be greater than zero kjeldsen et al 2005 wallingford hydrosolutions 2019 the swmod model which has been applied as a loss model for design flood estimation in the west of australia has the same structure as pdm but includes an additional parameter for the minimum soil moisture holding capacity hill and thompson 2019 pdm had also been applied in operational flood forecasting as both an event based model roberts et al 2009 and a continuous simulation model werner and cranston 2009 the use of a probability distribution to describe the variability in infiltration capacity across the catchment like in pdm is also adopted in some more complex continuous simulation rainfall runoff models such as the vic model liang et al 1994 1996 and the xinanjian model ren jun 1992 3 2 5 comparison of loss models when comparing loss model behaviour it is useful to group model parameters into those which control the initial loss the amount of loss prior to any runoff commencing in the catchment and those controlling ongoing loss the amount of loss which occurs once runoff has commenced setting the shape parameter of the pdm to b 1 means that each of the four models have two free parameters which can be varied to produce an acceptable fit the il parameter in ilcl and ilpl and the ia parameter in scscn are conceptually identical and represent the catchment initial loss lower values of these parameters can be interpreted as higher catchment antecedent moisture prior to the event the im parameter in pdm also provides information about the catchment antecedent moisture however unlike il and ia which have a lower bound of zero its value can be both positive and negative for im 0 an initial loss of magnitude im occurs for im 0 no initial loss occurs and runoff will commence as soon as rainfalls on the proportion of the catchment which has cf im in all four models the remaining second parameter controls ongoing loss the process of runoff conversion varies considerably based on the model structure in ilcl the cl parameter is a maximum fixed rate of loss in each timestep and in cases when rainfall rate is less than the cl parameter all rainfall is lost in ilpl the pl parameter represents the proportion of rainfall lost in each timestep with this proportion fixed throughout an event in both scscn and pdm ongoing losses can be conceptualised as a proportion of rainfall which decreases as an event proceeds in scscn the cn parameter is inversely related to the soil retention s where the value of s controls the rate at which the proportion of rainfall which is lost decreases for pdm the value of cmax represents the maximum soil moisture holding capacity of the catchment in the case when b 1 cmax controls that rate at which the catchment becomes saturated as a rainfall event progresses and larger values of cmax result in catchments which have slower rates of saturation and therefore higher ongoing losses wang 2018 describes a generalised probability density function for the variability of catchment soil moisture capacity that can describe both the scscn and pdm models the most significant structural difference exists between ilcl and the three remaining models in ilcl ongoing losses are generated at a constant rate which is independent of rainfall except in the case when rainfall rate is less than the constant loss rate cl in the remaining three models ongoing losses are generated as a proportion of rainfall this proportion is constant in the case of ilpl and decreasing through the event for scscn and pdm 3 3 routing model as shown in fig 2 the timeseries of storm runoff was routed through a model representing the lag and attenuation associated with catchment and channel storage for consistency the same routing model was adopted for all four loss models where the distributed nature of overland and channel storage elements is represented by a single conceptual storage with routing based on a non linear power law between storage and discharge with two parameters k and m 9 s k q m where s is storage and q is storage discharge here the value of the non linearity parameter m was fixed at 0 8 as is general industry practice and the value of k was obtained by calibration pilgrim 1987 this lumped storage routing approach was found to satisfactorily reproduce routing from the semi distributed storage routing modelling software rorb laurenson et al 2010 where catchments were represented as a series of sub areas connected via conceptual storages in the same arrangement as the stream network 3 4 calibration the loss model parameters were calibrated to each storm event employing the shuffle complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 to maximise the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse objective function nash and sutcliffe 1970 10 n s e 1 t 1 n q m t q o t 2 t 1 n q o t q o 2 where q m t is the modelled streamflow at time t q o t is the observed streamflow at time t and q o is the mean observed discharge nse was considered an appropriate objective function for this study as the sum of squared residuals component places greater emphasis on larger flows with peak flow being a key variable in design flood estimation and operational flood forecasting whilst also preserving event timing additionally all nse values are bounded between 1 with a value of one indicating an exact match between observed and modelled hydrographs this makes it possible to compare nse values between events and catchments two sequential calibrations were undertaken the first calibration involved estimation of a single routing parameter to be used for all events for each combination of catchment and loss model the second involved the estimation of event specific loss parameters in the first calibration the routing parameters were allowed to vary by loss model as well as by catchment as the different loss models result in systematic differences in the timing of storm runoff and these differences impact directly on the routing required to simulate the flood response in each catchment the routing parameters were calibrated to the largest five events by peak flow in each catchment during this first calibration there were three free parameters the catchment routing parameter k and the two loss model parameters events where the routing response of the catchment was poorly represented by available gauging data events with mass balance problems or nse 0 7 were filtered out leaving 3 5 events per catchment the median of the k values from these filtered events was adopted as the fixed value of k for calibration of the event specific loss parameters the estimation process based on the five largest events is preferred to assess the routing characteristics of catchments given the focus here is the modelling large floods estimating k using all available events was found to have a negligible impact on estimates of k subsequently the second calibration focused on identifying the two optimum loss model parameters required to match observed and modelled streamflow for each individual event as discussed in section 2 the events used to calibrate the loss parameters were selected on the basis of their 24 hour rainfall magnitude yielding a sample of between 17 and 41 pairs of loss parameters for each combination of catchment and loss model the results of this second calibration are of focus for the rest of the paper 3 5 exploring dependence between loss model performance and flood magnitude the range of loss model parameters obtained from calibrating each individual event for each combination of catchment and loss model notionally represents the variability of losses associated with different antecedent conditions and differences in the physical characteristics of each catchment and uncertainties in the recorded streamflow separation of baseflow and estimate of rainfall over the catchment to test whether the loss model performance was dependent on event magnitude for each catchment a set of loss model parameters representative of typical catchment conditions was required the median of all calibrated parameters from all events in a catchment except the five largest floods by flood peak was adopted for this purpose taking the median of a group of events is standard practice in design flood estimation where it is necessary to minimise the problem of joint probability involved in the transformation of rainfall into floods pilgrim and cordery 1993 the calibrated parameters from the largest five flood peaks were not included in the typical parameter estimation process to allow investigation of extrapolation within the event dataset the parameters representing typical catchment conditions were then used to re simulate each flood event the extent to which the adoption of a single fixed loss parameter over a range of event magnitudes adversely impacts on model performance provides an indication of the suitability of the loss model for use in design and operational forecasting if model parameters are dependent on event magnitude then additional account needs to be given to the joint probabilities involved and this can be particularly problematic when estimating floods that are larger than those used in calibration to allow comparisons between catchments flood peaks were standardized by the median observed flood peak in each catchment for the purposes of subsequent analysis large floods are considered those greater than the catchment median i e dimensionless peak 1 which notionally relates to an annual exceedance probability of 1 in 2 given the method of event selection the dependence on larger floods is also considered by investigating events with dimensionless peaks 5 and 10 to test the sensitivity of the results to the choice of typical catchment parameters the 25th and 75th percentile of all calibrated parameters in each catchment excluding the five largest events were also used to re simulate each flood event 4 results 4 1 calibration performance the empirical cumulative density function cdf of nse metrics derived from calibration of the four loss models across all catchments and events is presented in fig 3 the cdf for a given value of nse x tells us the proportion of events where nse x for example for the ilpl model 50 of events have an nse 0 83 therefore the lower a curve for a given value of nse the smaller the proportion of events with model performances that are less than or equal to this value and the better the overall calibration performance of the model with respect to nse the results in fig 3 show that while there are clearly some differences in the performance of the four models the differences are modest for example there is only a minor difference in the median nse values for each of the two parameter models with ilpl 0 83 pdm 0 83 ilcl 0 80 and scscn 0 80 the ilpl model shows the best overall calibration performance followed by pdm the nse values for the ilpl and pdm models are relatively equal for values of cdf above 0 5 below a cdf value of 0 5 ilpl is the best performing model with pdm the second best ilcl and scscn display roughly similar calibration performance in terms of nse and both models perform slightly worse than ilpl and pdm it should be noted that the pdm calibration performance was found to be sensitive to the upper and lower bounds of the cmax parameter theoretically this parameter can take any real positive value a range of 10 10 000 mm was adopted which is thought to represent the likely maximum range of behaviour that could be conceived as being consistent with physical reasoning intuitively increasing the range of this parameter can increase model performance however values of cmax outside this range could be considered physically unrealistic 4 2 calibration parameters fig 4 presents the distribution of the initial loss parameters obtained from calibration of each of the loss models while fig 5 presents the distribution for the ongoing loss parameters a boxplot of the variation is shown for each catchment the additive inverse of im i e im is plotted for the pdm model to aid comparison with the other models a value of im 0 is equivalent to an initial loss in the other models values of im 0 are plotted on a log10 axis and represent events when some proportion of the catchment contributes runoff from the onset of the storm while ilcl and ilpl show very similar distributions of the il parameter fig 4 this is expected as both models represent the initial abstraction of rainfall in the same manner the distribution of ia in scscn bears some similarities to the il in ilcl and ilpl with catchments exhibiting the largest range of initial loss values being common amongst the three models however ia values for scscn generally have a narrower range and are more skewed toward zero this difference in range is likely caused by interdependence between the model parameters see section 5 1 for the pdm values of im 0 show similar ranges to ia for most catchments the majority of catchment have some events where im 0 meaning that initial losses are zero over the whole catchment and instead a partial response from the saturated portion of the catchment occurs with the advent of runoff in some catchments up to 75 of events have im 0 the magnitude of variation for the cl parameter varies between catchments with median values between 0 and 9 8 mm hour fig 5 the pl parameter in ilpl and the cn parameter in scscn are both bound between 0 and 100 however the two are inversely related i e no ongoing loss occurs when pl 0 or cn 100 for both models there are several catchments where these parameters vary between the upper and lower bound this means that within the same catchment there are some events where there is no ongoing loss pl 0 or cn 100 and some events where close to all rainfall becomes runoff pl 100 or cn 0 comparing pl to cn highlights the inverse relationship between the two parameters catchments 6 10 show values of pl between 70 and 100 and values of cn between 0 and 40 fig 5 this suggests that in these catchments which are located in south west australia region 2 only a small proportion of rainfall becomes runoff even during large storms during the calibration of pdm the value of cmax converged to the lower and upper bound of the parameter space 10 mm and 10 000 mm respectively this convergence did not show any consistency with physical conditions as results for different events within a single catchment converged to both the upper and lower bounds convergence to the bounds of the parameter space continued to occur even when the limits were expanded this convergence to unrealistic extreme values of cmax undermines the physical interpretation of the pdm model and suggests that the model structure is not well suited to event based flood estimation we also note that scscn is often implemented in a single parameter form where the initial abstraction is a function of the potential retention of the soil therefore calibration results were also derived for two different single parameter versions of the model i where ia 0 and ii where ia 0 2s as per equation 5 where λ 0 2 calibration performance was significantly improved using ia 0 where median nse 0 72 compared to ia 0 2s where median nse 0 66 results not shown this result is consistent with findings of woodward et al 2003 who argues that a value of λ 0 05 is more appropriate than 0 2 however the results may be location specific given other studies have shown the values of λ to vary in the range 0 0 3 between catchments mishra and singh 2003 4 3 variation of loss model performance with event magnitude to test the dependency of each model s structure on event magnitude estimates of typical catchment loss model parameter values taken as the median of the parameter values obtained from calibration excluding the largest five flood peaks in each catchment were used to re simulate each flood event the simulated peak flows were then compared to observed peak flows to investigate any systematic differences in the performance of the four loss models with event magnitude fig 6 shows the modelled peak flow using the estimated typical catchment parameters vs observed peak flow as a heat map events from all catchments are shown with both modelled and observed peak flow standardised by the observed median peak flow for each catchment to allow comparison on a single set of axes the colour of each grid cell on the heat map represents the number of events in that cell and axes have been log10 transformed a lowess local smoothing regression is fitted to the data in the heat map to aid interpretation solid line to demonstrate the sensitivity of the dependency of each loss model to the method of estimating typical parameters lowess regressions fitted to re simulated flood peaks using the 25th and 75th percentile of loss model parameters excluding the five largest events are also shown dashed lines all four models show considerable scatter around the 1 1 line fig 6 this is expected and reflects the natural variability inherent in the antecedent wetness of catchments where use of typical catchment parameters should lead to the overprediction of events which occurred on wet catchments and underprediction of events which occurred on dry catchments for all four models the local regression line plots above the 1 1 for smaller events dimensionless observed peak flow 1 meaning that modelled flood peaks using typical catchment parameter values are overestimated this result is intuitive as smaller events are likely characterised by high losses and thus applying median loss parameter values would underestimate losses and overestimate flood peaks however these small events are rarely what is of interest in flood modelling looking at larger events ilcl is the only model that does not show distinct bias in modelled flood peaks when using typical catchment parameters for flood events greater than the median dimensionless observed peak flow 1 the local regression of quantiles predicted by the ilcl model tracks close to the 1 1 line for large events with the heat map scatter approximately symmetrical around the 1 1 line in contrast ilpl scscn and pdm all show clear dependence between model performance and event magnitude with each model tending to under predict observed flood peaks when typical catchment parameters are used for these three models the local regression line plots below the 1 1 line for large events with most of the heat map scatter also plotting below the 1 1 line table 1 quantifies this bias as the average of the residual between dimensionless modelled and observed flood peaks three different quantile magnitudes are considered based on the size of the flood peak ilcl demonstrates an overestimation bias with an average residual of 0 85 for those flood events with a dimensionless observed peak 1 this bias increases when moving to more extreme events with an average residual of 1 31 for the largest floods with a dimensionless observed peak 10 in contrast the three remaining models display an underestimation bias which increases markedly when moving to larger events of these three models scscn 8 00 shows the smallest negative average residual when dimensionless flood is 10 while the average residual of pdm and ilpl are more than double scscn 14 90 and 16 80 respectively indicating approximately an order of magnitude underestimation these observations tell us directly about the performance of the four loss models under extrapolation especially when focusing on dimensionless observed peak 5 as these events were estimated under conditions of extrapolation as the largest 5 events were excluded from calculations of typical catchment parameters the results suggest that of the four models only ilcl is suitable for use under extrapolation or in applications where no explicit consideration is given to the joint probabilities involved as it is the only model where performance is not dependent on event magnitude in contrast the ilpl scscn and pdm models do not appear appropriate for use under extrapolation as they display a clear dependence between event magnitude and model performance this dependence results in a significant underestimation bias which increases with event magnitude when using typical catchment parameters to estimate large floods estimating typical parameters using the median of all events including the five largest events did not materially change these results the standard deviation of the residual between dimensionless modelled and observed flood peak was also calculated however no material difference was observed between the four models the lowess regressions based on the 25th and 75th percentile of loss parameter values excluding the largest five events provide a sensitivity analysis of the impact of different choices of typical parameters on the dependence between model performance and flood magnitude evidently using the 25th percentile will under predict losses and over predict flood peaks on average while using the 75th percentile will over predict losses and under predict flood peaks on average however for large flood events the shape of the lowess smoothing line remains similar to that of when the median is used the systematic underestimation of large flood peaks remains for ilpl scscn and pdm regardless of choice of typical parameters this provides further evidence that the performance of these models is dependent on event magnitude and hence that they are not suitable for use under extrapolation in contrast the 25th and 75th lowess smoothing lines for ilcl straddle the 1 1 line whilst not symmetrical this is behaviour is consistent with what we would expect from a model where performance is independent of event magnitude it is also of interest that for large floods dimensionless peak 1 ilcl s spread between the 25th and 75th percentile lowess regressions decreases as event size increases while it remains relatively constant for ilpl scscn and pdm the implications of this observation are discussed in terms of the sensitivity of modelled peaks to changes in loss parameter values in section 5 2 5 discussion 5 1 implications of model structure on calibration performance when evaluating the calibration of the four loss models it is useful to consider both the calibration performance how well the models were able to reproduce observed events and how robustly model parameters can be identified which we assess by investigating the degree of parameter interaction during calibration ilpl and pdm displayed the best calibration performance though the reduction in performance when using ilcl and scscn was small while better calibration performance could indicate that ilpl and pdm have greater efficacy the pl and cmax calibrated parameters approaching the bounds of the parameter space could also be indicative of a model structure not well suited to estimating floods by removing a proportion of rainfall at each time step rather than a fixed amount models such as ilpl and pdm may be more prone to overfitting as the ongoing loss parameter can be finely tuned to match the observed flow volume however this does not explain why scscn which also represents loss as a proportion of rainfall does not perform better than ilcl a further insight into the adequacy of loss model structure can be gained by investigating the degree to which model calibration is confounded by parameter interaction fig 7 presents an example response surface of the nse for each of the models for a single event on a single catchment parameter combinations resulting in nse 0 are not shown while representing just a single event the response surfaces shown in fig 7 represent common behaviour observed in studying surfaces from different events for each of the loss models therefore points discussed here are thought to generalize broadly to all events parameter interaction can be observed to a different extent in each model close to the optima location of maximum nse diagonal ridges of high nse are present where the value of nse is insensitive to small changes in parameter values conceptually this parameter interaction can be thought of trading a portion of the initial loss for ongoing loss for example in ilcl a small increase in initial loss could be offset by a small decrease in continuing loss to maintain an appropriate storm runoff volume though with some change in timing this interaction can hinder efforts at parameter identification as the presence of multiple parameter sets lead to similar model performance otherwise referred to as equifinality beven 2006 parameter interaction correlation is well known to lead to inefficiencies in automatic calibration schemes kavetski et al 2006 but also creates challenges when applying the models to conditions that lie outside the range used in their calibration fowler et al 2016 stephens et al 2018 parameter interaction is present in all four models however equifinality issues are most pronounced for pdm where the response surface shows a long diagonal ridge of high nse values this highlights a highly linear relationship between the cmax and im parameters where similar model performance can be obtained by simultaneously increasing or decreasing both the cmax and im parameter values this means that suitable calibrations could potentially be obtained using a wide range of combinations of cmax and im that sit along the ridge this is at odds with the physical interpretation of the pdm model where the cmax parameter is meant to represent the maximum soil moisture holding capacity in the catchment and may explain why catchments displayed such a wide range of cmax values during calibration the presence of multiple suitable cmax values is likely evidence that it is difficult to estimate catchment soil moisture holding capacity using rainfall and streamflow data from a single flood event which casts doubt on the suitability on the use of the pdm model for event based flood estimation a potential strategy to alleviate the equifinality would be to calibrate multiple storm events for a single catchment simultaneously with a single catchment cmax value and event specific im values however this in turn would create a higher dimension calibration problem which would introduce additional challenges ilcl shows a stepped response surface where for certain values of cl there is no change in nse for a given change in il the behaviour is most obvious for high cl values and represents some threshold behaviour in the model this stepped shape occurs when cl is greater than the amount of rainfall that falls in the initial timesteps in the example shown this does not affect the model optima and we see a smooth response surface however it is possible that this threshold behaviour could impact calibration at the optima in some cases which would hinder calibration efforts and in part explain the poorer calibration using ilcl ilpl and scscn both display smooth response surfaces around their respective optima the diagonal slope of the contour lines around these optima demonstrate some parameter interaction for example in ilpl a small decrease in il can be offset by a small increase in pl however this parameter interaction does not appear to have impacted the calibration scheme s convergence to the optima 5 2 implications of model structure on dependence with flood magnitude the results presented in fig 6 suggest that ilcl is the only model which does not introduce substantial underprediction bias when estimating large flood events under conditions of extrapolation using loss model parameter values representative of typical catchment conditions of the four loss models investigated ilcl is the only model where ongoing losses are represented by a constant rate which is independent of rainfall amount in the other three models ongoing losses are a function of rainfall this is most apparent for ilpl where the pl parameter determines the constant proportion of rainfall which is converted to ongoing loss meanwhile scscn and pdm represent ongoing loss as a proportion of rainfall which decreases throughout an event this structural difference in models can explain the difference dependencies between model performance and event magnitude presented in fig 6 for example consider a catchment where a single 5 mm 1 hour rainfall burst fell and produced 2 5 mm hour of runoff neglecting initial losses and routing ilcl and ilpl could be calibrated to reproduce the event cl 2 5 mm hour and pl 50 adopting these calibrated losses and extrapolating to a much larger 20 mm 1 hour rainfall burst ilpl would produce 10 mm hour of runoff and ilcl would produce 17 5 mm hour runoff as the ongoing loss in ilpl scales with rainfall volume the amount of loss produced increases to 10 mm in contrast the amount of ongoing loss in ilcl is independent of rainfall and remains at 2 5 mm as for the smaller calibration event in fig 6 the three models where ongoing loss is represented as a proportion of rainfall ilpl scscn and pdm all clearly display underestimation bias for large flood events which increases with event magnitude this suggests that using loss models where losses scale with rainfall to estimate flood events larger than the events used to calibrate the model will lead to underestimation of flood peaks a potential solution to address this behaviour is through joint probability techniques where relationships between loss parameters and event magnitude are used to ensure unbiased flood estimates however there is no guarantee that these relationships will hold outside of the range of events over which they are developed and they add additional complexity that can be avoided by using models without this dependence the systematic underestimation of large flood peaks when using typical catchment parameters also suggests that conceptualising ongoing loss as a proportion of rainfall may not be representative of catchment runoff generating mechanisms in contrast the ilcl model with an ongoing loss that is independent of rainfall depth shows relatively unbiased estimates of large flood peaks suggesting that its parameters are more robust when extrapolated to larger events than used in calibration the spread between the 25th and 75th lowess regressions in fig 6 provides an insight into the sensitivity of loss models to changes in parameter values relative to event size given all four models represent initial losses in a similar manner any difference in behaviour can be attributed to the ongoing loss parameters for dimensionless flood peaks 1 the spread between the 25th and 75th percentile regressions decrease with increasing event size for ilcl this suggests that the model is less sensitive to changes in cl as event size increases which is intuitive for a model where losses are independent of rainfall magnitude for a fixed value of cl the ratio of cl to rainfall magnitude deceases as event size increases and hence the relative change of flow as a result of changing cl decreases in contrast for ilpl scscn and pdm the spread between the 25th and 75th regressions remain relatively constant between the 25th and 75th percentile regressions for dimensionless floods 1 this behaviour is likely explained by the fact that for these three models losses scale with rainfall and hence for large events where initial loss is small relative to total loss a change in ongoing loss parameter has the same proportional impact on flow regardless of rainfall magnitude this suggests that ilcl is a more robust loss model for predicting large events as the propagation of errors from calibration have less of an impact on estimated flood peaks and provides further support for using models like ilcl where losses are independent of rainfall for extrapolation applications an alternative way to assess the suitability to loss models under extrapolation would be to assess if there is any dependence between calibrated loss model parameters and both rainfall and flood magnitudes the presence of any such relationship would be evidence that model provides biased estimates of flood peaks unless these joint probabilities are explicitly accounted for when using the model to estimate floods however variability in loss parameters values due to uncertainties in streamflow and rainfall data as described in section 3 5 interdependence between model parameters as discussed in section 5 1 and differences in runoff processes between catchments all confound attempts to investigate such relationships in contrast a key advantage of our methodology is that by looking directly at modelled flows we largely avoid the impact of variability and interdependence of loss parameter values in this study we focus on parsimonious two parameter models commonly used in event based flood modelling each with an equivalent degree of flexibility to take advantage of the available observations however there are other less parsimonious loss models which can be used for event based flood modelling which also conceptualise ongoing losses in a way that is independent of rainfall these include green and ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 horton s infiltration equation horton 1933 and modified holton overton equation huggins and monke 1968 such models represent ongoing loss typically called infiltration rate in the literature discussing these models as a rate of loss which decreases throughout a storm event as a catchment becomes wetter however the use of such models would add additional parameters which further confounds the difficulty of robust estimation and further research would be required to understand if the ability to better simulate historic events gained by adding these additional parameters translates through to better performance under conditions of extrapolation 5 3 practical considerations for choosing a loss model the findings of this study are expected to become more pertinent in the presence of climate change where there is evidence that in some areas changes in soil moisture may drive a decrease in peak flow for smaller more frequent flood events notionally those with a return period more frequent than 1 in 10 years but that increases in rainfall intensity may lead to an increase in larger rarer flood events wasko and nathan 2019 bertola et al 2020 this would likely exacerbate the issues of extrapolation as the difference in magnitude will increase between more frequently observed flood events available for calibration and larger events which are typically of interest in flood modelling therefore care should be taken to select loss models whose performance is independent of flood magnitude the key finding here that loss models which represent ongoing loss independently of rainfall are most suitable for use under extrapolation has implications for design flood estimation and operational flood forecasting where extrapolation of parameters is routinely necessary our results suggest that the use of models that represent ongoing loss as a function of rainfall in these contexts may result in the under design of infrastructure or erroneous flood warnings both of which have the potential to result in loss of life or costly damage in design flood estimation losses can be estimated either deterministically or as part of a joint probability approach which attempts to mimic the joint interaction of flood drivers in nature at its simplest this involves joint sampling of losses and rainfall intensity kuczera et al 2006 nathan and ling 2019 in operational flood forecasting ensembles of forecasts are increasingly used to assess the uncertainty in predictions including uncertainty relating to initial conditions and hydrologic model parameterisation cloke and pappenberger 2009 while this study was undertaken in a manner that illustrates the general extrapolation problem further research may consider using specific modelling frameworks relevant to the application of interest to confirm the same behaviour observed here 6 conclusions motivated by a lack of studies comparing the efficacy of parsimonious loss models for event based flood modelling we compared four commonly used two parameter loss models in 35 small rural australian catchments initial loss continuing loss ilcl model initial loss proportional loss ilpl model soil conservation service curve number scscn method and probability distributed model pdm crucially instead of solely focusing on how well the models reproduce observed events we sought to compare the performance of loss models under conditions of varying event magnitude when tested using fixed loss parameters indicative of typical conditions this challenge of applying typical loss model parameters is specific to event based models and although the problem can be ameliorated by using joint probability techniques the use of models that have a robust structure under conditions of extrapolation greatly simplify the issues that need to be considered model calibration showed that initial loss proportional loss was the best performing model however the difference in calibration performance between the four models was small probability distributed model was shown to demonstrate significant parameter interaction which may confound attempts to calibrate event based forms of the model the conditions of extrapolation were emulated by applying typical catchment parameter values taken as the median of calibrated parameter values within each catchment excluding the five largest events to re simulate all observed flood events including the five largest events not used in typical parameter estimation across these re simulations initial loss continuing loss model did not exhibit dependence between model performance in terms of peak flow and event magnitude in contrast initial loss proportional loss soil conservation service curve number and probability distributed model re simulations displayed systematic under prediction of large flood events initial loss continuing loss was also found to be less sensitive to changes in parameter values for large floods than the other models these results suggest that models such as initial loss continuing loss where ongoing losses i e losses that occur once runoff has commenced are independent of rainfall are more suitable for use under extrapolation than models such as initial loss proportional loss soil conservation service curve number and probability distributed model where ongoing losses are represented as a proportion of rainfall credit
