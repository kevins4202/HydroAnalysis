13115,three dimensional electrode reactor packed with conductive particles is more cost effective than traditional two dimensional electrode reactor in this study granular activated carbon gac was applied as particle electrode then the long term performance on amoxicillin amx removal and activated carbon regeneration of the gac particle electrode oxidation process gac eop was investigated and the gac adsorption process gac ads was carried out for comparison both of them ran continuously to remove amx because of the regeneration effect of electrochemical action the gac eop showed a more stable physisorption capacity than gac ads with less change in micropore volume pore size distribution and surface morphology of gac the result of xps revealed the amx chemisorption mechanism the carbonyl co and phenolic hydroxyl oh on activated carbon combined with carboxyl cooh and ammonium group nh3 on amx respectively correspondingly the content of co and oh on gac fell significantly during the gac ads however due to the chemical bond regeneration effect of electrolysis noticeable declines were not observed in gac eop which ensured the stable chemisorption capacity of this system it was shown that during the 50 consecutive runs the amx removal in gac eop was always higher than 60 even the removal efficiency showed an upward tendency with the average value reached 86 1 and 99 1 in the 31 40 and 41 50 run times respectively it was because of the rising specific surface area of gac and the effect of electro polarization which made it more meaningful to explore the long term performance of three dimensional electrode reactor graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords particle electrode amoxicillin activated carbon adsorption regeneration 1 introduction since penicillin was discovered in the 20th century antibiotics have been widely used for decades of years amoxicillin amx is one of the most common antibiotics which plays a role in clinical medicine and livestock farming in recent years the escalating consumption and even abuse of amx result in the contamination of aquatic environment via the amx discharge of hospitals urban wastewater rural sewage and so on 22 27 amx in the environment poses a threat to the environment and the health of animals and human beings for example amx can be accumulated in the plants which are irrigated with amx polluted water hence consuming these plants especially uncooked ones could develop the antibiotic resistance in human bodies 5 18 what s more serious is that antibiotics in the environment could promote the generation and spread of antibiotic resistant genes bacteria and even superbugs 8 23 the research on the removal of amx makes sense to all antibiotics that are difficult to be mineralized different classes of technologies have been investigated for the elimination of amx from wastewater such as adsorption 25 membrane filtration 4 and advanced oxidation technologies consisting of electrochemical oxidation 9 ozonation 20 photocatalysis 2 19 and sulfate radical oxidation 7 21 compared to other technologies electrochemical oxidation avoids the use of extra reagents with simple structure and easy operation process which is worth studying at present traditional electro oxidation systems are being applied to degrade amoxicillin using ti ruo2 electrodes at optimum conditions ph 7 53 i 0 7a 51 64 of amx was removed after about 2 h 16 using cu doped pbo2 electrode under the conditions of current density of 46 1 ma cm2 and ph of 3 5 the removal rate of amx reached 96 3 and moreover the combustion efficiencies of the pbo2 electrode and cu pbo2 electrode were 65 6 and 98 4 respectively 12 using tio2 nanotubes electrophoretically modified with pbo2 and ta2o5 50 50 in acid media 0 1 mol l h2so4 44 71 of amx was removed jsb et al 2021 however this traditional two dimensional electrode system uses a lot of electrical energy and the mass transfer resistance especially in low conductivity wastewater cannot be neglected based on previous study this problem can be solved by placing conductive particles which would be polarized between the anode and cathode because a great number of tiny electrolytic cells form in the system this system is usually called three dimensional electrode system or particle electrode system 11 13 15 as for conductive particles activated carbon is a great alternative due to its good electroconductivity low cost and strong affinity it could not only serve as particle electrode but also play an important role as adsorbent to separate the organic pollutant from wastewater 26 andrés garcía et al achieved around 50 1 and 59 6 enhancement of total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod removal while the particle electrode system was used to replace the traditional two dimensional electrode system for greywater treatment 1 besides we have ever packed activated carbons and a few quartz sands to reduce the short circuit current between the ti ruo2 anode and cathode the results showed that under the optimal conditions current density of 5 ma cm2 17 mm nacl as electrolyte initial ph of 5 56 and the activated carbon quartz sand volume ratio of 9 1 the removal efficiencies of amx and toc reached 98 98 and 47 6 respectively while the toc removal efficiency was only 8 7 in traditional two dimensional electrode reactor more importantly the energy consumption of particle electrode system was 1 4 102 kw h kg toc far below that of two dimensional electrode system 1 1 103 kw h kg toc 24 there are still issues with three dimensional electrode reactor antibiotics are relatively bulky molecules and the adsorption process maybe stall after a while because the antibiotics adsorbed on activated carbon result in the size exclusion effect 17 besides the consumption of the new activated carbon and the disposal of the waste activated carbon restrict the practical application of the system concerned about all this it s meaningful to study the long term performance of the system without replacing fresh activated carbon in this study we evaluated the long term performance of the particle electrode reactor by the removal of amx in order to figure out how the system have long term and steady operation characteristics of the original activated carbon o ac activated carbon involved in adsorption experiments a ac and activated carbon involved in particle electrode oxidation processes e ac had been investigated furthermore the adsorption mechanism of amx and activated carbon regeneration was proposed which explained the stability of the system up to a point 2 material and methods 2 1 materials amoxicillin trihydrate amx was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china with carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl amino in the structure amx has three pka of 2 68 7 49 and 9 63 coconut shell based granular activated carbon gac was purchased from lianhua charcoal industry company henan china the particle size of gac is approximately 4 8 mm and the size of quartz sand qs is the same as gac 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the experiments were conducted in a water cycling particle electrode system two ti ruo2 electrodes 100 50 3 mm positioned in parallel were used as anode and cathode in a cuboid shaped reactor in addition gac and insulated qs the total volume of which is 50 cm3 were packed between the anode and cathode with the volume ratio of 9 1 the effluent was re pumped into the reactor after contact with air and more dissolved oxygen was supplied into the apparatus without the need for aeration device to compare the performances of gac particle electrode oxidation process gac eop and gac adsorption process gac ads the same configuration with no current flowing through was applied for adsorption for each electrolysis or adsorption experiment 500 ml amx simulated wastewater with the concentration of 200 mg l was fed into the water cycling system under the designed conditions for 2 h 1 g l nacl was added as electrolyte and the current density was 5 ma cm2 table 1 the single electro regeneration option of activated carbon was in situ carried out with a higher current density of 10 ma cm2 and 3 g l nacl as electrolyte 2 3 analysis the concentration of amx was analyzed using hplc 20at shimadzu japan equipped with a hydrosphere c18 column ymc japan ultrapure water and acetonitrile 90 10 v v adjusted to ph 3 by h3po4 was used as mobile phase and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 6 the physical characteristics of gac were tested by autosorb iq quanta chrome the united states after 10 h vacuum degassing at 300 c the n2 adsorption was carried out on the gac samples at the temperature of 77 k and the pressure of 10 7 1 p p0 p p0 0 95 the total pore volumes were obtained by the n2 volume adsorbed on the samples the specific surface areas of total pores and micropores were calculated using brunauer emmett teller bet equation and dubinin radushkevich dr respectively the quenched solid density functional theory qsdft was applied to obtain the pore size distributions the surface morphology of activated carbon was characterized by jsm 7610f jeol japan the c n h s element contents of gac were determined via vario el cube elementer germany and the o content was calculated by subtraction method in addition the information of the surface functional groups of activated carbon were obtained by escalab 250xi thermo the united states 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of gac eop and gac ads as described in table 1 two identical reactors filled with 50 cm3 particles 90 activated carbon and 10 quartz sand by volume were constructed one with current density of 5 ma cm2 flowing through gac eop the other just without applied current gac ads in order to compare the long term performance of gac eop and gac ads both of these two systems continuously ran 10 times without replacing fresh activated carbon also each of the experiments was constructed with the same initial concentration of amx 200 mg l as shown in fig 2 during the 10 consecutive runs the amx removal efficiencies of the two systems declined with varying degrees more specifically the value of gac ads was reduced from 98 1 of the 1st run to 32 7 of the 10th run while the removal efficiency in gac eop could reach up to 64 2 at the 10th run to restore the efficacy of gac eop and gac ads in removing amx a single electro regeneration option of gac was tried out in situ the electrolytic cell was full of nacl solution with current density of 10 ma cm2 flowing through for the two systems fig 1 fig 2 depicts the variation trend of amx removal after the electrochemical regeneration process it could be seen that due to the electro regenerated gac both of the two systems recovered some of their amx removal efficiency gac ads from 32 7 to 55 5 and gac eop from 64 2 to 91 8 in addition between the 11th to 20th runs after the regeneration process the amx removal of gac eop descended slowly still up to 71 7 in the 20th run while the value of gac ads dropped significantly to 10 8 therefore a single electro regeneration option was helping to extend the useful lives of the two systems especially for gac eop meanwhile whether before or after the regeneration gac eop could maintain a relatively stable amx removal rate during the long term treatment process 3 2 recycling operation mechanism of gac eop the effective and stable amx removal capacity of gac eop was partially attributed to the continuous work of electrochemical oxidation which included the direct and indirect pathways the former referred to the direct electron transfer of amx occurring on the electrode surface and the latter pathway was caused by strong oxidizing intermediate products that was oh and active chlorine generated from h2o and nacl respectively eqs 1 3 1 ti ru o 2 h 2 o ti ru o 2 oh h e 2 ti ru o 2 cl ti ru o 2 cl ad e 3 2 ti ru o 2 cl ad 2 ti ru o 2 cl 2 in addition there was no doubt that activated carbon also played an important part in stable amx removal capacity of gac eop in order to study how this might be done adsorption properties of the three activated carbon o ac a ac and e ac were investigated fig 3 a shows the adsorption isotherms of them it can be seen that hysteresis loops exist in all of the three curves indicating the presence of mesopores in these three activated carbons moreover the pore size distributions of the three kinds of activated carbon are almost the same mainly are micropores with 2 nm width as shown in fig 3 b however the total pore volume specific surface area micropore volume and micropore area had changed a lot as shown in table 2 compared to o ac all these parameters of a ac suffered a remarkable reduction whereas the specific surface area and pore volume of e ac only fell by an insignificant amount the noticeable changes in gac ads were because as the adsorption went on increasing amx entered activated carbon s pores and blocked the pores and channels decreasing its adsorption capacity unlike in gac ads the activated carbon in gac eop could be electrochemically regenerated throughout the treatment process due to the presence of electric field while the activated carbon in gac ads couldn t be unless in a special electro regeneration process that was to say the amx adsorbed on the activated carbon in gac eop was electrolyzed immediately which avoided serious blockage of the channels and retained the physisorption capacity to remove amx effectively the results of sem analysis proved it again as shown in fig 4 the surface of a ac involved in gac ads became rough inferring the adsorption of amx however the e ac surface after gac eop was smooth it was indicated that some of the adsorbed amx and intermediates had been removed from the e ac surface because of the electro regeneration effect of gac eop furthermore the surfaces of o ac and e ac were similar which demonstrated the stability of the e ac during the gac eop the elemental compositions of o ac a ac and e ac are given in table 3 apparently all of them were made up primarily of c and o oxygen is generally the most important element with a major effect on activated carbon chemical characteristics taken into account the high content and importance of oxygen oxygen containing functional groups of the three activated carbons were investigated fig 5 by exploring the functional groups that made a difference in amx adsorption the chemisorption capacity could be estimated from the content variations of these oxygen containing surface functional groups the xps characteristics were shown in fig 5 all element peaks were calibrated by cc peak binding energy to 284 6 284 8 ev in c 1s spectra after calibration the o 1s spectra were separated into five peaks by gaussian lorentzian method they were binding energy b e at 531 0 531 9 ev for carbonyl oxygen co b e at 532 3 532 8 ev for oxygen atom in phenolic hydroxyl oh b e at 533 1 533 8 ev for oxygen atom of ether bond in lactone and anhydride coc b e at 534 3 535 4 ev for oxygen atom in carboxyl cooh b e at 536 0 536 5 ev for water or oxygen adsorbed on adsorbent table 4 lists the distributions of functional groups in detail compared to o ac the content of carbonyl co and phenolic hydroxyl oh on a ac declined significantly thus these two surface functional groups were presumed to work for amx adsorption by combining with functional groups in amx therefore one possible mechanism responsible for amx adsorption was the reaction between carbonyl co of activated carbon and ammonium group nh3 in amx structure to form carbon nitrogen double bond cn as shown in fig 6 a in addition the decrease in phenolic hydroxyl oh content and the increase in ether bond coc content might be attributed to another adsorption mechanism the combination of phenolic hydroxyl oh on the surface of activated carbon and the carboxylate coo in amx structure led to the formation of ether bond coc as shown in fig 6 b different from a ac the content of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of e ac did not change much through the gac eop it revealed that due to the effect of electrolysis the newly formed chemical bonds by chemisorption were broken and went back to original state that was the reaction shown in fig 6 could be reversible during the gac eop and thus the e ac was able to play a stabilizing role in amx chemisorption which was an important reason for such a good long term performance of gac eop 3 3 fifty times recycle of the gac eop in further research the gac eop system was set up to continuously run 50 times in order to explore the longer term performance on amx removal besides every ten consecutive runs of gac eop a special in situ electro regeneration was carried out to restore some amx removal capability with the treatment conditions described in section 2 2 current density of 10 ma cm2 and 3 g l nacl solution as electrolyte as shown in table 5 during the 50 runs of gac eop the amx removal efficiency was no less than 60 each time even in the 31 40 and 41 50 run times the average removal efficiency reached 86 1 and 99 1 respectively these results demonstrated the good longer time performance of gac eop along with special electro regeneration option moreover taking the electricity consumption of gac eop and electro regeneration into account the total energy consumption of this experiment was 0 041 kw h g amx in previous study 16 by contrast the same plate electrode ti ruo2 was used to construct a traditional two dimensional electrode reactor without particle filled in in that case the energy consumption was 0 408 kw h g toc corresponding to 0 137 kw h g amx after conversion which was considerably higher than this study 0 041 kw h g amx meanwhile it was worth noting that the amx removal rate of gac eop had shown an upward tendency since the 31st run time even stood at higher than 90 in 41 50 runs after the fourth special electro regeneration this specific phenomenon also has been observed in another research 1 where the cod removal rate increased as the run times went up in a particle activated carbon electrode system after analysis there might be two reasons for the phenomenon in this study firstly some powered activated carbon pac was observed to appear gradually in the reactor with the increase of run times especially after the 20th run it could be because the coconut shell based gac used in gac eop wasn t hard enough like some others such as coal based activated carbon thus they were partially ground to pac with the effect of water scouring increasing the specific surface area and promoting amx adsorption capacity secondly when nacl solution served as electrolyte the amount of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of activated carbon would rise with the aid of electro polarization 3 10 therefore in this study as the run times went up the polarization time went up correspondingly along with this came an increase of the oxygen containing functional groups that was considered beneficial to amx chemisorption which could be the second leading cause of the increasing amx removal efficiency in summary gac eop had given a good longer term performance on amx removal not only it overcame the challenge of high cost and waste activated carbon disposal caused by constantly replacing fresh gac but also the energy consumption was well below traditional two dimensional electrode system 4 conclusion this study investigated the long term performance of gac eop on amx removal in this system activated carbon was considered to be not only particle electrode but also adsorbent to adsorb organics moreover the results of xps analysis suggested that carbonyl co and phenolic hydroxyl oh on gac took the leading role in amx chemisorption by combining with carboxyl cooh and ammonium group nh3 respectively in amx structure different from gac ads with the aid of electro oxidation in gac eop amx adsorption and electro regeneration took place simultaneously on the surface of activated carbon which made it possible to keep effective physisorption and chemisorption the longer term experiments revealed that not only the amx removal efficiency in gac eop was relatively stable even on an uptrend in the latter part but also the energy consumption was far below the traditional two dimensional electrode reactor this study explored the long term performance and mechanism of gac eop which provided new

could be reversible during the gac eop and thus the e ac was able to play a stabilizing role in amx chemisorption which was an important reason for such a good long term performance of gac eop 3 3 fifty times recycle of the gac eop in further research the gac eop system was set up to continuously run 50 times in order to explore the longer term performance on amx removal besides every ten consecutive runs of gac eop a special in situ electro regeneration was carried out to restore some amx removal capability with the treatment conditions described in section 2 2 current density of 10 ma cm2 and 3 g l nacl solution as electrolyte as shown in table 5 during the 50 runs of gac eop the amx removal efficiency was no less than 60 each time even in the 31 40 and 41 50 run times the average removal efficiency reached 86 1 and 99 1 respectively these results demonstrated the good longer time performance of gac eop along with special electro regeneration option moreover taking the electricity consumption of gac eop and electro regeneration into account the total energy consumption of this experiment was 0 041 kw h g amx in previous study 16 by contrast the same plate electrode ti ruo2 was used to construct a traditional two dimensional electrode reactor without particle filled in in that case the energy consumption was 0 408 kw h g toc corresponding to 0 137 kw h g amx after conversion which was considerably higher than this study 0 041 kw h g amx meanwhile it was worth noting that the amx removal rate of gac eop had shown an upward tendency since the 31st run time even stood at higher than 90 in 41 50 runs after the fourth special electro regeneration this specific phenomenon also has been observed in another research 1 where the cod removal rate increased as the run times went up in a particle activated carbon electrode system after analysis there might be two reasons for the phenomenon in this study firstly some powered activated carbon pac was observed to appear gradually in the reactor with the increase of run times especially after the 20th run it could be because the coconut shell based gac used in gac eop wasn t hard enough like some others such as coal based activated carbon thus they were partially ground to pac with the effect of water scouring increasing the specific surface area and promoting amx adsorption capacity secondly when nacl solution served as electrolyte the amount of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of activated carbon would rise with the aid of electro polarization 3 10 therefore in this study as the run times went up the polarization time went up correspondingly along with this came an increase of the oxygen containing functional groups that was considered beneficial to amx chemisorption which could be the second leading cause of the increasing amx removal efficiency in summary gac eop had given a good longer term performance on amx removal not only it overcame the challenge of high cost and waste activated carbon disposal caused by constantly replacing fresh gac but also the energy consumption was well below traditional two dimensional electrode system 4 conclusion this study investigated the long term performance of gac eop on amx removal in this system activated carbon was considered to be not only particle electrode but also adsorbent to adsorb organics moreover the results of xps analysis suggested that carbonyl co and phenolic hydroxyl oh on gac took the leading role in amx chemisorption by combining with carboxyl cooh and ammonium group nh3 respectively in amx structure different from gac ads with the aid of electro oxidation in gac eop amx adsorption and electro regeneration took place simultaneously on the surface of activated carbon which made it possible to keep effective physisorption and chemisorption the longer term experiments revealed that not only the amx removal efficiency in gac eop was relatively stable even on an uptrend in the latter part but also the energy consumption was far below the traditional two dimensional electrode reactor this study explored the long term performance and mechanism of gac eop which provided new

13116,electrocoagulation ec is known as an electrochemical process for the efficient removal of various pollutants including fluoride and nitrate anions continuous electrocoagulation cec was applied to synthetic aqueous solutions containing mixtures of nitrate and fluoride anions both at initial concentrations of 0 1 g l 1 for simulation of effluents arising from the etching process in microelectronic industries several parameters such as electrode material ph current density initial concentration as well as the presence of co existing ions were studied without addition of an electrolyte the optimizing conditions were found for aluminum electrodes at ph 5 94 current density of 9 09 ma cm 2 and distance between electrodes of 18 mm leading to removal rates of 42 83 and 88 28 for nitrate and fluoride anions respectively the isolated electrogenerated solids were characterized by energy dispersion spectroscopy eds coupled to sem ft ir xrd xps tga and raman spectroscopy all the characterizations agree with the removals of nitrate and fluoride anions by reduction and adsorption respectively the anode and the cathode were involved but the reduction and adsorption processes were independent of each other the nitrate reduction was a cathodic reaction leading to hydroxide anions which were involved in the formation of electrogenerated adsorbents by reaction with the aluminum cations or metal cations arising from the anode oxidation a modelling kinetic theory for a continuous electrocoagulation process was developed and applied to the treatment of artificial and

concentration variation in the collecting tank 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical treatment involving the preparation of coagulant ions thanks to the anodic dissolution of the corresponding metals a lot of reviews illustrate the great variety of applications in pollution treatments recent general reviews deal with the treatment of water and wastewaters 1 4 including the special cases of defluoridation 5 the depollution of pharmaceutical wastewaters 6 and industrial wastewaters 7 the role of electrogenerated flocs has been analyzed 8 various combined processes have been developed in order to enhance the efficiency of classical electrocoagulations 9 11 improved ec removal technologies have been performed thanks to the hybridization of ec with membrane process 12 by coupling with ultrasounds 13 14 or supplementary adsorbents 15 16 photocatalysis 17 electrocatalysis 18 electrochemical oxidation 19 advanced oxidation 20 21 and biological treatment 22 many academic investigations are performed on the treatment of single pollutants however since industrial wastewaters and drinking water generally contain more than one pollutant recent works have been devoted to the simultaneous removal of several compounds by using only one method so the removal of arsenic and fluoride was carried out by adsorption 23 and electrocoagulation 24 26 adsorption has been applied to the removal of phosphate and fluoride 27 the removal of nitrate and fluoride 28 and the removal of nitrate fluoride and phosphate anions 29 various attempts on simultaneous removals have been performed by photoelectrocatalysis 30 radical induced oxidation 31 and with the use of nanoparticles 32 ec is generally carried out for the removal of single pollutant since ec works with two electrodes it would be interesting to develop the use of both electrodes in dual treatments of pollutants for example the dissolution of the anode leading to an electrogenerated coagulant involved in the removal of one pollutant coupled to the removal of the second pollutant thanks to the reduction at the cathode the present work is devoted to the simultaneous treatment of fluoride and nitrate anions both anions may be found in drinking water or in industrial wastewaters arising from surface treatment industries the simultaneous removal of nitrate and fluoride anions has been investigated by adsorption 28 29 33 ion exchange 34 35 electrodialysis 36 37 capacitive deionization 38 precipitation 39 and reduction by zero valence iron 40 only rare studies of simultaneous removal of nitrate and fluoride anions from drinking water were performed by electrocoagulation 41 43 the present paper reports the treatment by a continuous electrocoagulation of artificial polluted solutions and industrial wastewaters arising from the etching process of silicon wafers in microelectronic industries for the first time this paper presents the modelling of a continuous electrocoagulation 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions all chemicals which were used in the study were of analytical grade and they were purchased from sigma aldrich france the synthetic solutions of fluoride and nitrate ions were made with deionized water 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions were used to adjust the ph of the solutions real wastewaters arose from the semiconductor research center for energy algiers algeria they were formed during the etching of silicon wafers with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid nitric acid and acetic acid followed by several rinsing operations with distilled water until the neutrality of the rinsing water was reached all the rinsing wastewaters were put together and the acidity was neutralized with ca oh 2 after filtration of the precipitates nacl 1 g l 1 was added to the filtrate in order to increase its conductivity for a better electrocoagulation treatment typically the concentrations of nitrate and fluoride anions were of 88 2 mg l 1 and 40 6 mg l 1 respectively samples of real wastewaters were carried out in polypropylene tanks the composition of the investigated real wastewater is given in supplementary data table s1 2 2 continuous electrocoagulation process cep the continuous electrocoagulation treatment was performed with the equipment which is presented in fig 1 the main elements were 1 an influent feeding tank of 3 l 2 a peristaltic pump heidolph model hei flow value working at the rate of 8 33 ml min 1 3 an electrocoagulation reactor of 1 5 l equipped with four monopolar electrodes which were connected to a current generator 7 yizhan ps 305d aluminum and iron electrodes of dimensions 10 cm 10 cm 0 1 cm were immersed with an active area of 55 cm2 and arranged with a gap of 10 or 18 mm between two successive electrodes before all the electrocoagulation experiments the electrodes were cleaned first by abrasion with sandpaper followed by a washing in 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl for aluminum or iron electrodes respectively then the electrodes were rinsed with distilled water and finally dried for 1 h in an oven at 100 c the treated solution left the electrocoagulation reactor at the same rate which was controlled at the entry by the peristaltic pump one electrocoagulation experiment needed 3 l of solution and a duration of 3 h 1 5 l of solution was put in tank 1 and 1 5 l was put in the electrocoagulation reactor 3 all the analyses which were done versus the electrolysis time were performed on the collected effluent of tank 6 the effect of coexisting anions was investigated by adding sodium salts of chloride sulfate carbonate and phosphate with a concentration of 1 g l 1 of these salts for the needs of analysis samples of the solutions were removed during the electrocoagulation processes or at their ends and then they were filtrated for the separation of the electrogenerated solid material from the liquid phase after determining the concentration of fluoride and nitrate anions the percentage removal was expressed by eq 1 where a 0 and a t are the initial concentration and concentration at time t respectively 1 removal 100 a 0 a 0 a t 2 3 instrumental

cathode cell combination the removal of nitrate ions was found less efficient than the one of fluoride anions and this is why the search of the best abatement was performed on this reaction fig 2 shows the anode cathode combination for effective removal of nitrate ions in this study it appears for the same cathode material that the nitrate removal was always more efficient with an aluminum anode for an iron cathode the removal was 30 better when an aluminum anode was used analogous conclusion is drawn for an aluminum cathode the removal rate was 17 better when an aluminum anode was used these results suggest a possible involvement of the electrogenerated aluminum hydroxide in the nitrate removal process all the subsequent experiments were performed with the combination pair of al anode and fe cathode the effect of the cathode nature was not so clear for an aluminum anode the removal rate increased with 5 for an iron cathode when compared to an aluminum cathode whereas for an iron anode the removal rate decreased in 10 for an iron cathode compared to an aluminum cathode results of fig 2 disagree with the works of majlesi et al 45 and berkani et al 46 showing that the best nitrate removal was obtained with two aluminum electrodes lacasa et al 47 observed that the nitrate removal did not show a difference during the electrocoagulation with aluminum or iron electrodes our results agree with those of govindan et al 48 who found that the use of an anode cathode combination of aluminum iron led to a better nitrate removal when compared to the use of two aluminum electrodes 3 1 2 effect of the current density on the removal rates of fluoride and nitrate anions fig 3 presents the effect of the current density on the removal rates of fluoride and nitrate anions when they are alone or in the same solution in all the cases the removal rates increase and reach a plateau this observation can be attributed to a kinetic effect where the formation of the electrogenerated adsorbent is faster than the fluoride adsorption or the nitrate reduction the removal rates of fluoride anion are always greater than those of nitrate anion and this is observed despite the higher molar concentration of fluoride anion on considering the removal rates in a solution containing fluoride and nitrate anions the presence of one anion fluoride or nitrate decreases the removal rate of the other anion this type of decrease is more pronounced for the fluoride adsorption than for the nitrate reduction an explanation can be found in the low effect of nitrate as a co existing anion on the fluoride removal 49 while the electrocatalytic activity of the iron cathode may be influenced by the presence of fluoride anions 3 1 3 ph variation and influence of the solution ph fig 4a presents the ph variation during the removal of fluoride and nitrate ions by electrocoagulation of individual solutions as known for electrocoagulation in the presence of nitrate and chloride ions the ph increases and reaches a plateau of about 9 3 and 9 6 respectively 49 the ph difference between the plateaus is due to a different mechanism in the ph increases in the presence of chloride anions the ph increase is the result of a substitution reaction of hydroxyl group by chloride in the electrogenerated alumina in the presence of nitrate anions the ph increase is the result of a proton consumption during the reduction of these ions leading to ammonium cations which have a buffer effect fig 4b shows the effect of initial ph on the removal rate of nitrate and fluoride ions alone and in a mixture since the ph was not buffered it is expected that at the end of the electrocoagulation the ph reached the final values given in fig 4a whatever the ph the fluoride anion removal was always more efficient than the nitrate removal in the ph range 4 10 the defluoridation by the electrogenerated coagulants seems approximately constant irrespective of the presence of nitrate ions this result shows that at the concentration of 100 mg l 1 the nitrate anions and their reduction products did not show any negative effect on the adsorption of the fluoride anions on the other hand the presence of fluoride anions shows a noticeable negative effect of about 17 against the nitrate removal this effect can be the result of a negative influence of fluoride anions on the electrocatalytic activity of the iron cathode in the nitrate anion reduction 3 1 4 influence of initial concentrations of fluoride and nitrate ions the results of the influence of initial concentrations on the removal of nitrate and fluoride ions are shown in fig 5 the removal rate of nitrate anions alone fig 5a decreased from 47 7 to 25 5 in the concentration range 0 1 1 0 g l 1 in the same range the presence of 0 1 g l 1 of fluoride anions decreased the removal rate of nitrate ions of about 5 on the other hand the removal rate of fluoride anions alone fig 5b decreased from 87 to 46 in the concentration range 0 1 1 0 g l 1 whereas the presence of 0 1 g l 1 of nitrate anions gave an additional decrease of about 3 5 to the removal rate 3 1 5 effect of coexisting anions the effect of coexisting anions has been investigated with the addition of 1 g l 1 of sodium salts to the initial solution containing nitrate and fluoride 0 1 g l 1 in 1 g l 1 nacl solution the results are presented in fig 6 the addition of nacl increased the removal rate of nitrate and fluoride anions of 3 2 and 4 8 respectively conversely all the other investigated anions showed negative effects the decrease in the removal rate of nitrate was 4 5 11 4 and 9 8 in the presence of carbonate sulfate and phosphate anions respectively the decrease was relatively noticeable because the initial removal rate of nitrate anions was 42 0 although the removal rate of fluoride anions was high with 88 7 without accompanying any other anions the carbonate sulfate and phosphate anions inhibited the fluoride anions removal with the lessened efficiency of 32 2 41 9 and 38 7 respectively high negative effect or inhibition from these anions is already known in fluoride removal by adsorption onto electrogenerated adsorbents 50 and bayerite boehmite nanocomposites 51 3 2 characterization of electrogenerated sludges 3 2 1 scanning electron microscopic study with eds analysis the eds diagrams of sludge samples are gathered together in fig 7 all the samples show the signals of al and o as expected for electro generated aluminas several samples contain si compounds which probably arise from a contamination several samples also contain fe whose origin is the corrosion of the iron cathode of the cep process fluoride was observed for samples c d and e which were sludges isolated after the treatment of synthetic fluoride solution synthetic fluoride nitrate solution and real wastewater respectively sample a arising from cep of nacl solution shows the signal of cl at 2 6 kev but with the absence of na as already published 49 these observations prove the substitution of hydroxyl by chloride anions in the electro generated aluminas and this reaction explains the ph increase during the cep process all the treated solutions contained nacl but the presence of cl element was not observed for all the analyzed samples it seems that the presence of coexisting nitrate ions inhibits the chloride substitution calcium was clearly detected in the sludge e arising from the cep treatment of the real wastewater effluent which was previously treated by ca oh 2 3 2 2 x ray diffraction study and thermal studies xrd diagrams of the isolated sludges are presented in fig 8a these patterns reveal only the crystallized phases sludge a arising from cep of nacl solution a shows the presence of bayerite al oh 3 and boehmite alo oh characterized by sharp and broad reflections respectively the simultaneous presence of nitrate anions and chloride anions in solution b seems leading mainly to crystallized bayerite whereas all other solutions c d and e which contained fluoride anions led to boehmite the formation of crystallized bayerite was not observed for sludges d and e the pattern of e which arose from cep of the real wastewater effluent shows the presence of calcite caco3 which was identified thanks to its reflections at 2θ of 23 0 29 4 35 9 39 4 43 1 and 47 1 52 the formation of calcite is not surprising since the real wastewater contained calcium ions and the increase of ph during the cep allows the formation of ca oh 2 and then caco3 after absorption of atmospheric co2 additional reflections were observed at 2θ of 28 27 and 47 01 they were attributed to caf2 which was formed during the acid neutralization of the real wastewater the presence of this compound is due to the difficulties in the separation of caf2 after its precipitation in real wastewater 53 the tg dta studies of the isolated sludges are presented in fig 8b sludge b shows a great mass change at about 280 c which can be attributed to the dehydration of bayerite leading to al2o3 which presents a mass change at 300 c 54 all other sludges show a first mass change before 100 c which can be attributed to the loss of adsorbed water sludges a c d and e present three mass changes before 100 c and at about 265 c and 400 c the first mass loss corresponds to a water desorption and agrees with the thermal behavior of boehmite 55 the second and third mass changes are due to the dehydration of bayerite and boehmite even when crystalized bayerite is not observed in the xrd pattern fig 8a these mass changes occur at temperatures in agreement with the literature for the dehydration of bayerite 54 and boehmite 55 sludge e shows at 680 c a mass change which must be attributed to the thermal behavior of the calcite observed in the xrd diagram fig 8a the mass changes between 150 c and 600 c for sludges b and d were 29 and 20 respectively the theoretical mass changes for a dehydration of bayerite and boehmite are of 34 6 and 15 0 respectively the calculation process of the experimental mass changes leads to 80 of al oh 3 and 20 of alo oh for sludge b and 37 of al oh 3 and 63 of alo oh for sludge d so the thermogravimetry analysis reveals the presence of amorphous boehmite in the electrogenerated sludge as shown by their similar shapes the thermograms of sludges a c and e confirm the simultaneous presence of bayerite and boehmite 3 2 3 ftir and raman spectroscopy ftir and raman spectra patterns fig s1 did not give much information about the structures of the electrogenerated sludges the most important point is the absence of vibrations at 1384 cm 1 which would be expected for adsorbed nitrate anions 3 2 4 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xps spectra of all sludges are gathered together in fig 9 confirming the chemical composition given by sds fig 7 regarding the adsorbed fluoride anions f1s is observed with a binding energy of 685 ev for sludges c d and e cl is observed at 199 ev for sludge a n is not observed for sludges b d and e in agreement with the absence of adsorbed nitrate anions or their reduction products a desorption of nitrate anions by fluoride anions is involved as already observed by ftir and xps 51 for sludge b analogous explanation could be given by a possible desorption of nitrate anions by chloride anions 3 3 adsorption kinetics theory in a continuous process for a first order kinetics batch experiments of electrocoagulation bec are always treated as batch experiment of adsorption with the notable difference that the adsorbent is continuously added as soon as it is formed by dissolution of the anode the decrease of the sorbent concentration allows the determination of adsorption capacities adsorption rate constants and the choice of the best model of isotherm adsorption all these characteristics are important but bec does help for a continuous application a continuous electrocoagulation cec or a continuous electrocoagulation process cep is a better treatment from an engineering point of view a cep is easy to perform with the successive assembling of a feeding tank a pump an ec reactor and finally a collecting tank for the continuously treated solution 56 62 such experiments can be seen as the pilot of industrial equipment the aim of a cec is to work at a stationary state or steady state operation conditions so the behavior of a cec treatment cannot be modelled as a bec 63 depending upon the experimental conditions the stationary state is reached more or less quickly and this creates two situations with different modelling treatments 3 3 1 at steady state operation conditions the electrocoagulation experiments were carried out in a perfectly stirred open reactor in this situation the use of differential form of the rate cannot be used because the adsorption of the substrates is not alone involved in the variation of the concentrations considering a the sorbent the balance relationship can be written for a stationary state by eq 2 where q in is the flow rate at the entry of the ec reactor c ain is the concentration at the entry of the ec reactor v is the volume of the ec reactor a is the concentration of a in the ec reactor q ex is the solution flow at the exit of the ec reactor and c aex is the concentration of a at the exit of the reactor 2 q in c ain v d a dt q

shown in eq 3 where k 1 is the first order rate constant of the reaction and the balance relationship for eq 2 can be written by eq 4 then further rearrangement leads to eq 5 and finally the concentration of a at the exit of the ec reactor is given by eq 6 3 d a dt k 1 c a 4 q in c ain k 1 v c aex q ex c aex 0 5 q fr c ain c aex k 1 v q fr 6 c aex q fr c ain k 1 v q fr c ain 1 k 1 v q fr

3 3 2 determination of adsorption capacity at steady state conditions at a stationary state the difference between concentrations of influent and effluent of the ec reactor is the result of the treatment by the ec current it may be assumed that the electro generated adsorbent already present in the reactor is not involved in the removal process in accordance with the following theory for a given δv volume of flowing solution during a given time δt the quantity of adsorbed species q ads is calculated by eq 9 where c 0 and c st are the initial concentration and the concentration at the stationary state respectively and where δv is q fr δt with q fr the flow of the solution during time δt 9 q ads c 0 c st v or c t v the quantity of ega q ega in g produced for a given time δt is

experimental results in the papers of betancor abreu et al and mena et al 56 57 confirm for a cec that the fluoride anion removal increases with an increase of the electrolysis current as expected from eq 13 the fluoride removal in a cec 59 shows an increase of the abatement δc t when the current increases and when the flow rate decreases the results of the real wastewater treatment fig 10 corroborated that the fluoride removal reached a stationary state from the observed abatement of 39 72 mg l 1 for a current intensity of 0 5 a and a solution flow of 0 138 10 3 l s 1 an adsorption capacity of 47 87 mg g 1 of ega was calculated the present adsorption capacity of ega may be considered in good agreement with the capacity of 56 8 mg g 1 obtained by jia et al 51 for a bayerite boehmite nano composite 3 3 3 determination of adsorption capacity before reaching the steady state at the time t the quantity of adsorbed fluoride q ads is the sum eq 14 of the amounts adsorbed in the ec reactor and that in the treated solution v t at the exit of the reactor 14 q ads c ecr v v t c ct δc ecr c 0 c t ecr is the concentration variation in the ec reactor v is the reactor volume v t

solution was calculated by a numerical integration eq 15 where δv is the integration step 15 v t c ct δ c δ v a set of results is given in fig 11 for the removal of fluoride assuming that these removals follow a first order kinetics as already published for fluoride adsorption 65 67 the kinetics of the nitrate reduction is also known to follow a first order 68 70 but in our hands the nitrate ion abatement was lower than the fluoride ion and it did not give a good modelling so these results could not be kinetically treated fig 11 shows a slight decrease of the fluoride adsorption capacity during the course of the cep in the literature the fluoride adsorption capacity is not a physical constant it greatly varies with the alumina nature or the electrochemical parameters the present results agree with the sedimentation investigation during electrocoagulation experiments which showed variations in the behavior of electro generated alumina 71 fig 12 shows the decrease of fluoride anion concentration during cep for various current electrolysis the concentrations followed decreasing exponential equations since stationary states were not reached during the experiments the results were used in a mathematical modelling leading to eq 16 see appendix a1 in supplementary materials where a and b are constants c t and c are concentration at time t and time infinity respectively 16 c t a exp bt c the modelling concentrations at the infinity are equal to the concentrations at stationary state with these results adsorption capacities were calculated leading to values gathered in table 1 these calculated adsorption capacities are lower than the values gathered in fig 11 all the calculated values which are in table 1 and in fig 11 provide the same order of magnitude of literature values the simulated concentration at stationary state allows the calculation of kinetic constants for a first order kinetics the adsorption constants k 1 were calculated with eq 8 leading to results which are gathered together in table 2 the adsorption constant is not a strong physicochemical characteristic of an adsorption process in bec predicted rate constants have been established in the ranges 0 05 0 25 min 1 67 and 0 02 0 06 min 1 65 these rate constants depend on experimental parameters such as ph electrolysis current initial fluoride concentration distance between the electrodes conductivity and temperature considering a possible involvement of these parameters the first order kinetic constants of table 2 are in the same order of magnitude of literature values 3 4

anions alone and in the presence of arsenic follows a pseudo second order model with rate constants of 0 014 and 0 006 l mg 1 min 1 or 14 and 6 l g 1 min 1 respectively 72 the removal of fluoride from synthetic ground water gives decreasing rate constants in the range 62 9 5 3 l g 1 min 1 when the fluoride anion concentration increases from 3 to 12 mg l 1 71 in these cited papers 72 73 models of pseudo first order and pseudo second order were applied and the second order model was found with better correlation coefficients r2 the results of the present study can be considered in the same order of magnitude of literature values but the kinetic study of the cep cannot give a clear conclusion about the best occurrence of the kinetic order 3 5 mechanism discussion of separate removal of fluoride and nitrate ions 3 5 1 fluoride anions removal by adsorption all the papers dealing with fluoride anions removal agree with an adsorption process there is no unanimity in the kinetics of fluoride anions removal by adsorption onto the electro generated aluminas several papers dealing with a removal by bec batch electro coagulation have shown that the reaction followed a first order 65 67 or a second order kinetics 74 75 adsorption onto five aluminas 76 and a sludge resulting after the electrocoagulation 77 showed a second order kinetics 3 5 2 nitrate anions removal by adsorption or reduction all the papers reporting the treatment of nitrate anions by ec agree with a removal but there is no unanimity about the involved mechanism few papers concluded that an adsorption occurred without giving proof of such reactions 78 79 in few papers the nitrate removal was reported due to the occurrence of adsorption and reduction 46 48 80 for other authors the nitrate removal was due to a reduction leading to ammonium cation ammonia and gaseous nitrogen compounds 68 69 in the present paper no proof for nitrate or ammonia adsorption was obtained by ftir and xps analysis of the sludge fig s1 fig 7 and ammonium was detected as a reduction product the first order kinetics of the nitrate removal is compatible with an exponential decrease of an electro active substrate in an electrochemical reaction 81 3 6 treatment of the real wastewater 3 6 1 compositions of the real wastewater before and after cep the treatment of wastewaters arising from semiconductor industries has been carried out with bec using aluminum or iron electrodes 82 86 or with a cep 87 these wastewaters generally contain high concentration of fluoride anions silicate calcium and caf2 microparticles the compositions of the real wastewater before and after the cep are given in supplementary materials table s1 the variations of the concentrations of fluoride and nitrate anions during a cep are presented in fig 10 after this experiment the concentrations of main elements are gathered in table s1 as expected for an ec treatment all the heavy metals were quantitatively removed in addition the other elements such as ca mg and si are also removed by ec and show great abatements the removal efficiency of nitrate and fluoride anions was 53 1 and 97 9 respectively after 180 min of cep 3 6 2 cep treatment at the end of the cep the residual concentrations of fluoride and nitrate anions were lower than the regulated concentrations for this kind of wastewater assuming that stationary states could be reached it would be possible to use eq 13 and fluoride adsorption capacity of 47 87 mg g 1 to choose the ec current i and the solution flow q for a given concentration of the effluent since the fluoride adsorption capacity decreases when the current increases according to eq 13 a targeted concentration abatement c t can be reached only with a decrease of solution flux q fr the effluent discharge regulations for the fluoride and nitrate anions are 10 mg l 1 86 and 10 mg n l 1 or 44 28 mg no3 l 1 89 respectively based on the obtained results from fig 10 the regulated concentrations of fluoride and nitrate were achieved after 30 min and 150 min respectively it was the nitrate abatement which controlled the wastewater treatment fig 3 shows that an increase of the cep current does not improve the removal rate of nitrate anions so the experimental conditions of the cep are almost optimized for the used reactor with a solution flow rate of 0 138 ml s 1 and a current density of 9 09 ma cm 2 3 7 efficiency energy consumption and cost evaluation the ec reactor is almost optimized the energy and efficiency must be calculated for the cep current which allowed the obtaining of a depolluted effluent in the cep the energy consumption enc is calculated as a function of the volume of the effluent to be treated and it is given by eq 23 where u is the electric voltage of the ec reactor v i is the current a t cep is the time of the treatment process h and v is the volume of effluent to be treated m3 the treatment for 3 h of 1 5 l with a current of 0 5 a was performed with a voltage of 4 9 v or 9 4 v for a synthetic solution or the real wastewater and it gave enc values of 4 9 kwh m 3 or 9 4 kwh m 3 for a synthetic solution or the real wastewater respectively 23 enc kwh m 3 ui t cep v in the same conditions the amount of electrode consumed elc was 0 34 kg m 3 on the basis of calculation by faraday s law using eq 24 where i a is the ec current t s is the duration of the ec m is the molecular weight of al n 3 the electron number f the faraday constant and v m3 the volume of treated solution 24 elc kg m 3 i t m 10 3 n f v the treatment cost tc of the cep must include the costs of all consumed electricity in the ec reactor and for the pumping of solution electrode material al and the consumed chemicals excluding the costs of sodium fluoride and sodium nitrate and the cost of the sludge separation and treatment the treatment cost tc for the synthetic and real wastewaters is calculated in appendix 2 only with known terms of electricity consumed in the ec reactor 130 of the electrode material calculated with the faraday law and the consumed sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide the consumed electrode material is always greater than the calculated value tc of 2 1792 usd per m3 and 2 3097 usd per m3 were found for the synthetic solution and the real wastewater respectively the most important costs are the aluminum material and the sodium hydroxide used in the ph control there is only a slight effect of the voltage on tc an improvement of tc could be obtained thanks to the change of sodium hydroxide by a cheaper base in the present cep treatment it was not possible to reach the regulated concentrations 88 of both fluoride and nitrate anions the treatment of the real wastewater showed that the removal of nitrate anions was the determining step of the process and it was observed after 160 min of ec which correspond to 1 33 l of treated solution but this does not involve a modification of the calculated enc and elc thakur et al 90 and mena et al 57 performed similar type of continuous process at low cost less than 0 4 usd per m3 and achieved the removal efficiency of 87 94 but using synthetic fluoride solutions between 9 mg l 1 and 12 mg l 1 respectively in the present work the cost was greater for more concentrated solutions moreover it was the removal of nitrate anions which needed a more expensive treatment remarkably the present contribution extended the practicability of cep in the treatment of a real wastewater which contained 80 22 mg l 1 of nitrate anions and 40 57 mg l 1 of fluoride anions moreover as shown by the concentrations in table s1 the ec treatment is efficient in the removal of si na mg k cr cu al pb mn fe ni p and zn ions present in real wastewater 4 conclusions in the present research contribution the simultaneous removal of fluoride and nitrate anions was investigated by using a cep the eds analysis xps spectra and xrd patterns confirmed that fluoride anions were adsorbed onto the electro generated aluminas and that nitrate anions were reduced during the process the cep was applied to a real wastewater which contained high concentrations of fluoride and nitrate anions the recommended discharge regulation of fluoride was reached faster than the one of nitrate anions the application of this treatment in a microelectronic industry would need a change in the electrocoagulation reactor such as a greater cathode than anode or by using another cathode nature in order to improve the nitrate anion removal by reduction from an engineering point of view the theoretical behavior of cep which was developed in the present paper would need to be extended to other pollutants with various changes in the reactor structure credit authorship contribution statement h tounsi investigation t

13116,electrocoagulation ec is known as an electrochemical process for the efficient removal of various pollutants including fluoride and nitrate anions continuous electrocoagulation cec was applied to synthetic aqueous solutions containing mixtures of nitrate and fluoride anions both at initial concentrations of 0 1 g l 1 for simulation of effluents arising from the etching process in microelectronic industries several parameters such as electrode material ph current density initial concentration as well as the presence of co existing ions were studied without addition of an electrolyte the optimizing conditions were found for aluminum electrodes at ph 5 94 current density of 9 09 ma cm 2 and distance between electrodes of 18 mm leading to removal rates of 42 83 and 88 28 for nitrate and fluoride anions respectively the isolated electrogenerated solids were characterized by energy dispersion spectroscopy eds coupled to sem ft ir xrd xps tga and raman spectroscopy all the characterizations agree with the removals of nitrate and fluoride anions by reduction and adsorption respectively the anode and the cathode were involved but the reduction and adsorption processes were independent of each other the nitrate reduction was a cathodic reaction leading to hydroxide anions which were involved in the formation of electrogenerated adsorbents by reaction with the aluminum cations or metal cations arising from the anode oxidation a modelling kinetic theory for a continuous electrocoagulation process was developed and applied to the treatment of artificial and

concentration variation in the collecting tank 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical treatment involving the preparation of coagulant ions thanks to the anodic dissolution of the corresponding metals a lot of reviews illustrate the great variety of applications in pollution treatments recent general reviews deal with the treatment of water and wastewaters 1 4 including the special cases of defluoridation 5 the depollution of pharmaceutical wastewaters 6 and industrial wastewaters 7 the role of electrogenerated flocs has been analyzed 8 various combined processes have been developed in order to enhance the efficiency of classical electrocoagulations 9 11 improved ec removal technologies have been performed thanks to the hybridization of ec with membrane process 12 by coupling with ultrasounds 13 14 or supplementary adsorbents 15 16 photocatalysis 17 electrocatalysis 18 electrochemical oxidation 19 advanced oxidation 20 21 and biological treatment 22 many academic investigations are performed on the treatment of single pollutants however since industrial wastewaters and drinking water generally contain more than one pollutant recent works have been devoted to the simultaneous removal of several compounds by using only one method so the removal of arsenic and fluoride was carried out by adsorption 23 and electrocoagulation 24 26 adsorption has been applied to the removal of phosphate and fluoride 27 the removal of nitrate and fluoride 28 and the removal of nitrate fluoride and phosphate anions 29 various attempts on simultaneous removals have been performed by photoelectrocatalysis 30 radical induced oxidation 31 and with the use of nanoparticles 32 ec is generally carried out for the removal of single pollutant since ec works with two electrodes it would be interesting to develop the use of both electrodes in dual treatments of pollutants for example the dissolution of the anode leading to an electrogenerated coagulant involved in the removal of one pollutant coupled to the removal of the second pollutant thanks to the reduction at the cathode the present work is devoted to the simultaneous treatment of fluoride and nitrate anions both anions may be found in drinking water or in industrial wastewaters arising from surface treatment industries the simultaneous removal of nitrate and fluoride anions has been investigated by adsorption 28 29 33 ion exchange 34 35 electrodialysis 36 37 capacitive deionization 38 precipitation 39 and reduction by zero valence iron 40 only rare studies of simultaneous removal of nitrate and fluoride anions from drinking water were performed by electrocoagulation 41 43 the present paper reports the treatment by a continuous electrocoagulation of artificial polluted solutions and industrial wastewaters arising from the etching process of silicon wafers in microelectronic industries for the first time this paper presents the modelling of a continuous electrocoagulation 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions all chemicals which were used in the study were of analytical grade and they were purchased from sigma aldrich france the synthetic solutions of fluoride and nitrate ions were made with deionized water 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions were used to adjust the ph of the solutions real wastewaters arose from the semiconductor research center for energy algiers algeria they were formed during the etching of silicon wafers with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid nitric acid and acetic acid followed by several rinsing operations with distilled water until the neutrality of the rinsing water was reached all the rinsing wastewaters were put together and the acidity was neutralized with ca oh 2 after filtration of the precipitates nacl 1 g l 1 was added to the filtrate in order to increase its conductivity for a better electrocoagulation treatment typically the concentrations of nitrate and fluoride anions were of 88 2 mg l 1 and 40 6 mg l 1 respectively samples of real wastewaters were carried out in polypropylene tanks the composition of the investigated real wastewater is given in supplementary data table s1 2 2 continuous electrocoagulation process cep the continuous electrocoagulation treatment was performed with the equipment which is presented in fig 1 the main elements were 1 an influent feeding tank of 3 l 2 a peristaltic pump heidolph model hei flow value working at the rate of 8 33 ml min 1 3 an electrocoagulation reactor of 1 5 l equipped with four monopolar electrodes which were connected to a current generator 7 yizhan ps 305d aluminum and iron electrodes of dimensions 10 cm 10 cm 0 1 cm were immersed with an active area of 55 cm2 and arranged with a gap of 10 or 18 mm between two successive electrodes before all the electrocoagulation experiments the electrodes were cleaned first by abrasion with sandpaper followed by a washing in 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl for aluminum or iron electrodes respectively then the electrodes were rinsed with distilled water and finally dried for 1 h in an oven at 100 c the treated solution left the electrocoagulation reactor at the same rate which was controlled at the entry by the peristaltic pump one electrocoagulation experiment needed 3 l of solution and a duration of 3 h 1 5 l of solution was put in tank 1 and 1 5 l was put in the electrocoagulation reactor 3 all the analyses which were done versus the electrolysis time were performed on the collected effluent of tank 6 the effect of coexisting anions was investigated by adding sodium salts of chloride sulfate carbonate and phosphate with a concentration of 1 g l 1 of these salts for the needs of analysis samples of the solutions were removed during the electrocoagulation processes or at their ends and then they were filtrated for the separation of the electrogenerated solid material from the liquid phase after determining the concentration of fluoride and nitrate anions the percentage removal was expressed by eq 1 where a 0 and a t are the initial concentration and concentration at time t respectively 1 removal 100 a 0 a 0 a t 2 3 instrumental

cathode cell combination the removal of nitrate ions was found less efficient than the one of fluoride anions and this is why the search of the best abatement was performed on this reaction fig 2 shows the anode cathode combination for effective removal of nitrate ions in this study it appears for the same cathode material that the nitrate removal was always more efficient with an aluminum anode for an iron cathode the removal was 30 better when an aluminum anode was used analogous conclusion is drawn for an aluminum cathode the removal rate was 17 better when an aluminum anode was used these results suggest a possible involvement of the electrogenerated aluminum hydroxide in the nitrate removal process all the subsequent experiments were performed with the combination pair of al anode and fe cathode the effect of the cathode nature was not so clear for an aluminum anode the removal rate increased with 5 for an iron cathode when compared to an aluminum cathode whereas for an iron anode the removal rate decreased in 10 for an iron cathode compared to an aluminum cathode results of fig 2 disagree with the works of majlesi et al 45 and berkani et al 46 showing that the best nitrate removal was obtained with two aluminum electrodes lacasa et al 47 observed that the nitrate removal did not show a difference during the electrocoagulation with aluminum or iron electrodes our results agree with those of govindan et al 48 who found that the use of an anode cathode combination of aluminum iron led to a better nitrate removal when compared to the use of two aluminum electrodes 3 1 2 effect of the current density on the removal rates of fluoride and nitrate anions fig 3 presents the effect of the current density on the removal rates of fluoride and nitrate anions when they are alone or in the same solution in all the cases the removal rates increase and reach a plateau this observation can be attributed to a kinetic effect where the formation of the electrogenerated adsorbent is faster than the fluoride adsorption or the nitrate reduction the removal rates of fluoride anion are always greater than those of nitrate anion and this is observed despite the higher molar concentration of fluoride anion on considering the removal rates in a solution containing fluoride and nitrate anions the presence of one anion fluoride or nitrate decreases the removal rate of the other anion this type of decrease is more pronounced for the fluoride adsorption than for the nitrate reduction an explanation can be found in the low effect of nitrate as a co existing anion on the fluoride removal 49 while the electrocatalytic activity of the iron cathode may be influenced by the presence of fluoride anions 3 1 3 ph variation and influence of the solution ph fig 4a presents the ph variation during the removal of fluoride and nitrate ions by electrocoagulation of individual solutions as known for electrocoagulation in the presence of nitrate and chloride ions the ph increases and reaches a plateau of about 9 3 and 9 6 respectively 49 the ph difference between the plateaus is due to a different mechanism in the ph increases in the presence of chloride anions the ph increase is the result of a substitution reaction of hydroxyl group by chloride in the electrogenerated alumina in the presence of nitrate anions the ph increase is the result of a proton consumption during the reduction of these ions leading to ammonium cations which have a buffer effect fig 4b shows the effect of initial ph on the removal rate of nitrate and fluoride ions alone and in a mixture since the ph was not buffered it is expected that at the end of the electrocoagulation the ph reached the final values given in fig 4a whatever the ph the fluoride anion removal was always more efficient than the nitrate removal in the ph range 4 10 the defluoridation by the electrogenerated coagulants seems approximately constant irrespective of the presence of nitrate ions this result shows that at the concentration of 100 mg l 1 the nitrate anions and their reduction products did not show any negative effect on the adsorption of the fluoride anions on the other hand the presence of fluoride anions shows a noticeable negative effect of about 17 against the nitrate removal this effect can be the result of a negative influence of fluoride anions on the electrocatalytic activity of the iron cathode in the nitrate anion reduction 3 1 4 influence of initial concentrations of fluoride and nitrate ions the results of the influence of initial concentrations on the removal of nitrate and fluoride ions are shown in fig 5 the removal rate of nitrate anions alone fig 5a decreased from 47 7 to 25 5 in the concentration range 0 1 1 0 g l 1 in the same range the presence of 0 1 g l 1 of fluoride anions decreased the removal rate of nitrate ions of about 5 on the other hand the removal rate of fluoride anions alone fig 5b decreased from 87 to 46 in the concentration range 0 1 1 0 g l 1 whereas the presence of 0 1 g l 1 of nitrate anions gave an additional decrease of about 3 5 to the removal rate 3 1 5 effect of coexisting anions the effect of coexisting anions has been investigated with the addition of 1 g l 1 of sodium salts to the initial solution containing nitrate and fluoride 0 1 g l 1 in 1 g l 1 nacl solution the results are presented in fig 6 the addition of nacl increased the removal rate of nitrate and fluoride anions of 3 2 and 4 8 respectively conversely all the other investigated anions showed negative effects the decrease in the removal rate of nitrate was 4 5 11 4 and 9 8 in the presence of carbonate sulfate and phosphate anions respectively the decrease was relatively noticeable because the initial removal rate of nitrate anions was 42 0 although the removal rate of fluoride anions was high with 88 7 without accompanying any other anions the carbonate sulfate and phosphate anions inhibited the fluoride anions removal with the lessened efficiency of 32 2 41 9 and 38 7 respectively high negative effect or inhibition from these anions is already known in fluoride removal by adsorption onto electrogenerated adsorbents 50 and bayerite boehmite nanocomposites 51 3 2 characterization of electrogenerated sludges 3 2 1 scanning electron microscopic study with eds analysis the eds diagrams of sludge samples are gathered together in fig 7 all the samples show the signals of al and o as expected for electro generated aluminas several samples contain si compounds which probably arise from a contamination several samples also contain fe whose origin is the corrosion of the iron cathode of the cep process fluoride was observed for samples c d and e which were sludges isolated after the treatment of synthetic fluoride solution synthetic fluoride nitrate solution and real wastewater respectively sample a arising from cep of nacl solution shows the signal of cl at 2 6 kev but with the absence of na as already published 49 these observations prove the substitution of hydroxyl by chloride anions in the electro generated aluminas and this reaction explains the ph increase during the cep process all the treated solutions contained nacl but the presence of cl element was not observed for all the analyzed samples it seems that the presence of coexisting nitrate ions inhibits the chloride substitution calcium was clearly detected in the sludge e arising from the cep treatment of the real wastewater effluent which was previously treated by ca oh 2 3 2 2 x ray diffraction study and thermal studies xrd diagrams of the isolated sludges are presented in fig 8a these patterns reveal only the crystallized phases sludge a arising from cep of nacl solution a shows the presence of bayerite al oh 3 and boehmite alo oh characterized by sharp and broad reflections respectively the simultaneous presence of nitrate anions and chloride anions in solution b seems leading mainly to crystallized bayerite whereas all other solutions c d and e which contained fluoride anions led to boehmite the formation of crystallized bayerite was not observed for sludges d and e the pattern of e which arose from cep of the real wastewater effluent shows the presence of calcite caco3 which was identified thanks to its reflections at 2θ of 23 0 29 4 35 9 39 4 43 1 and 47 1 52 the formation of calcite is not surprising since the real wastewater contained calcium ions and the increase of ph during the cep allows the formation of ca oh 2 and then caco3 after absorption of atmospheric co2 additional reflections were observed at 2θ of 28 27 and 47 01 they were attributed to caf2 which was formed during the acid neutralization of the real wastewater the presence of this compound is due to the difficulties in the separation of caf2 after its precipitation in real wastewater 53 the tg dta studies of the isolated sludges are presented in fig 8b sludge b shows a great mass change at about 280 c which can be attributed to the dehydration of bayerite leading to al2o3 which presents a mass change at 300 c 54 all other sludges show a first mass change before 100 c which can be attributed to the loss of adsorbed water sludges a c d and e present three mass changes before 100 c and at about 265 c and 400 c the first mass loss corresponds to a water desorption and agrees with the thermal behavior of boehmite 55 the second and third mass changes are due to the dehydration of bayerite and boehmite even when crystalized bayerite is not observed in the xrd pattern fig 8a these mass changes occur at temperatures in agreement with the literature for the dehydration of bayerite 54 and boehmite 55 sludge e shows at 680 c a mass change which must be attributed to the thermal behavior of the calcite observed in the xrd diagram fig 8a the mass changes between 150 c and 600 c for sludges b and d were 29 and 20 respectively the theoretical mass changes for a dehydration of bayerite and boehmite are of 34 6 and 15 0 respectively the calculation process of the experimental mass changes leads to 80 of al oh 3 and 20 of alo oh for sludge b and 37 of al oh 3 and 63 of alo oh for sludge d so the thermogravimetry analysis reveals the presence of amorphous boehmite in the electrogenerated sludge as shown by their similar shapes the thermograms of sludges a c and e confirm the simultaneous presence of bayerite and boehmite 3 2 3 ftir and raman spectroscopy ftir and raman spectra patterns fig s1 did not give much information about the structures of the electrogenerated sludges the most important point is the absence of vibrations at 1384 cm 1 which would be expected for adsorbed nitrate anions 3 2 4 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xps spectra of all sludges are gathered together in fig 9 confirming the chemical composition given by sds fig 7 regarding the adsorbed fluoride anions f1s is observed with a binding energy of 685 ev for sludges c d and e cl is observed at 199 ev for sludge a n is not observed for sludges b d and e in agreement with the absence of adsorbed nitrate anions or their reduction products a desorption of nitrate anions by fluoride anions is involved as already observed by ftir and xps 51 for sludge b analogous explanation could be given by a possible desorption of nitrate anions by chloride anions 3 3 adsorption kinetics theory in a continuous process for a first order kinetics batch experiments of electrocoagulation bec are always treated as batch experiment of adsorption with the notable difference that the adsorbent is continuously added as soon as it is formed by dissolution of the anode the decrease of the sorbent concentration allows the determination of adsorption capacities adsorption rate constants and the choice of the best model of isotherm adsorption all these characteristics are important but bec does help for a continuous application a continuous electrocoagulation cec or a continuous electrocoagulation process cep is a better treatment from an engineering point of view a cep is easy to perform with the successive assembling of a feeding tank a pump an ec reactor and finally a collecting tank for the continuously treated solution 56 62 such experiments can be seen as the pilot of industrial equipment the aim of a cec is to work at a stationary state or steady state operation conditions so the behavior of a cec treatment cannot be modelled as a bec 63 depending upon the experimental conditions the stationary state is reached more or less quickly and this creates two situations with different modelling treatments 3 3 1 at steady state operation conditions the electrocoagulation experiments were carried out in a perfectly stirred open reactor in this situation the use of differential form of the rate cannot be used because the adsorption of the substrates is not alone involved in the variation of the concentrations considering a the sorbent the balance relationship can be written for a stationary state by eq 2 where q in is the flow rate at the entry of the ec reactor c ain is the concentration at the entry of the ec reactor v is the volume of the ec reactor a is the concentration of a in the ec reactor q ex is the solution flow at the exit of the ec reactor and c aex is the concentration of a at the exit of the reactor 2 q in c ain v d a dt q

shown in eq 3 where k 1 is the first order rate constant of the reaction and the balance relationship for eq 2 can be written by eq 4 then further rearrangement leads to eq 5 and finally the concentration of a at the exit of the ec reactor is given by eq 6 3 d a dt k 1 c a 4 q in c ain k 1 v c aex q ex c aex 0 5 q fr c ain c aex k 1 v q fr 6 c aex q fr c ain k 1 v q fr c ain 1 k 1 v q fr

7 and the rate constant k 1 is given by eq 8 a relation equivalent to eq 7 can be found for a first order kinetics in a perfectly mixed flow reactor 64 7 c aex c ain 1 k 1 τ 8 k 1 c ain c aex c aex τ 3 3 2 determination of adsorption capacity at steady state conditions at a stationary state the difference between concentrations of influent and effluent of the ec reactor is the result of the treatment by the ec current it may be assumed that the electro generated adsorbent already present in the reactor is not involved in the removal process in accordance with the following theory for a given δv volume of flowing solution during a given time δt the quantity of adsorbed species q ads is calculated by eq 9 where c 0 and c st are the initial concentration and the concentration at the stationary state respectively and where δv is q fr δt with q fr the flow of the solution during time δt 9 q ads c 0 c st v or c t v the quantity of ega q ega in g produced for a given time δt is calculated by faraday law eq 10 where i a is the current intensity n is the number of electrons involved in the anodic dissolution of aluminum n 3 f is the faraday constant f 96 485c mol 1 and m ega

experimental results in the papers of betancor abreu et al and mena et al 56 57 confirm for a cec that the fluoride anion removal increases with an increase of the electrolysis current as expected from eq 13 the fluoride removal in a cec 59 shows an increase of the abatement δc t when the current increases and when the flow rate decreases the results of the real wastewater treatment fig 10 corroborated that the fluoride removal reached a stationary state from the observed abatement of 39 72 mg l 1 for a current intensity of 0 5 a and a solution flow of 0 138 10 3 l s 1 an adsorption capacity of 47 87 mg g 1 of ega was calculated the present adsorption capacity of ega may be considered in good agreement with the capacity of 56 8 mg g 1 obtained by jia et al 51 for a bayerite

removals follow a first order kinetics as already published for fluoride adsorption 65 67 the kinetics of the nitrate reduction is also known to follow a first order 68 70 but in our hands the nitrate ion abatement was lower than the fluoride ion and it did not give a good modelling so these results could not be kinetically treated fig 11 shows a slight decrease of the fluoride adsorption capacity during the course of the cep in the literature the fluoride adsorption capacity is not a physical constant it greatly varies with the alumina nature or the electrochemical parameters the present results agree with the sedimentation investigation during electrocoagulation experiments which showed variations in the behavior of electro generated alumina 71 fig 12 shows the decrease of fluoride anion concentration during cep for various current electrolysis the concentrations followed decreasing exponential equations since stationary states were not reached during the experiments the results were used in a mathematical modelling leading to eq 16 see appendix a1 in supplementary materials where a and b are constants c t and c are concentration at time t and time infinity respectively 16 c t a exp bt c the modelling concentrations at the infinity are equal to the concentrations at stationary state with these results adsorption capacities were calculated leading to values gathered in table 1 these calculated adsorption capacities are lower than the values gathered in fig 11 all the calculated values which are in table 1 and in fig 11 provide the same order of magnitude of literature values the simulated concentration at stationary state allows the calculation of kinetic constants for a first order kinetics the adsorption constants k 1 were calculated with eq 8 leading to results which are gathered together in table 2 the adsorption constant is not a strong physicochemical characteristic of an adsorption process in bec predicted rate constants have been established in the ranges 0 05 0 25 min 1 67 and 0 02 0 06 min 1 65 these rate constants depend on experimental parameters such as ph electrolysis current initial fluoride concentration distance between the electrodes conductivity and temperature considering a possible involvement of these parameters the first order kinetic constants of table 2 are in the same order of magnitude of literature values 3 4

anions alone and in the presence of arsenic follows a pseudo second order model with rate constants of 0 014 and 0 006 l mg 1 min 1 or 14 and 6 l g 1 min 1 respectively 72 the removal of fluoride from synthetic ground water gives decreasing rate constants in the range 62 9 5 3 l g 1 min 1 when the fluoride anion concentration increases from 3 to 12 mg l 1 71 in these cited papers 72 73 models of pseudo first order and pseudo second order were applied and the second order model was found with better correlation coefficients r2 the results of the present study can be considered in the same order of magnitude of literature values but the kinetic study of the cep cannot give a clear conclusion about the best occurrence of the kinetic order 3 5 mechanism discussion of separate removal of fluoride and nitrate ions 3 5 1 fluoride anions removal by adsorption all the papers dealing with fluoride anions removal agree with an adsorption process there is no unanimity in the kinetics of fluoride anions removal by adsorption onto the electro generated aluminas several papers dealing with a removal by bec batch electro coagulation have shown that the reaction followed a first order 65 67 or a second order kinetics 74 75 adsorption onto five aluminas 76 and a sludge resulting after the electrocoagulation 77 showed a second order kinetics 3 5 2 nitrate anions removal by adsorption or reduction all the papers reporting the treatment of nitrate anions by ec agree with a removal but there is no unanimity about the involved mechanism few papers concluded that an adsorption occurred without giving proof of such reactions 78 79 in few papers the nitrate removal was reported due to the occurrence of adsorption and reduction 46 48 80 for other authors the nitrate removal was due to a reduction leading to ammonium cation ammonia and gaseous nitrogen compounds 68 69 in the present paper no proof for nitrate or ammonia adsorption was obtained by ftir and xps analysis of the sludge fig s1 fig 7 and ammonium was detected as a reduction product the first order kinetics of the nitrate removal is compatible with an exponential decrease of an electro active substrate in an electrochemical reaction 81 3 6 treatment of the real wastewater 3 6 1 compositions of the real wastewater before and after cep the treatment of wastewaters arising from semiconductor industries has been carried out with bec using aluminum or iron electrodes 82 86 or with a cep 87 these wastewaters generally contain high concentration of fluoride anions silicate calcium and caf2 microparticles the compositions of the real wastewater before and after the cep are given in supplementary materials table s1 the variations of the concentrations of fluoride and nitrate anions during a cep are presented in fig 10 after this experiment the concentrations of main elements are gathered in table s1 as expected for an ec treatment all the heavy metals were quantitatively removed in addition the other elements such as ca mg and si are also removed by ec and show great abatements the removal efficiency of nitrate and fluoride anions was 53 1 and 97 9 respectively after 180 min of cep 3 6 2 cep treatment at the end of the cep the residual concentrations of fluoride and nitrate anions were lower than the regulated concentrations for this kind of wastewater assuming that stationary states could be reached it would be possible to use eq 13 and fluoride adsorption capacity of 47 87 mg g 1 to choose the ec current i and the solution flow q for a given concentration of the effluent since the fluoride adsorption capacity decreases when the current increases according to eq 13 a targeted concentration abatement c t can be reached only with a decrease of solution flux q fr the effluent discharge regulations for the fluoride and nitrate anions are 10 mg l 1 86 and 10 mg n l 1 or 44 28 mg no3 l 1 89 respectively based on the obtained results from fig 10 the regulated concentrations of fluoride and nitrate were achieved after 30 min and 150 min respectively it was the nitrate abatement which controlled the wastewater treatment fig 3 shows that an increase of the cep current does not improve the removal rate of nitrate anions so the experimental conditions of the cep are almost optimized for the used reactor with a solution flow rate of 0 138 ml s 1 and a current density of 9 09 ma cm 2 3 7 efficiency energy consumption and cost evaluation the ec reactor is almost optimized the energy and efficiency must be calculated for the cep current which allowed the obtaining of a depolluted effluent in the cep the energy consumption enc is calculated as a function of the volume of the effluent to be treated and it is given by eq 23 where u is the electric voltage of the ec reactor v i is the current a t cep is the time of the treatment process h and v is the volume of effluent to be treated m3 the treatment for 3 h of 1 5 l with a current of 0 5 a was performed with a voltage of 4 9 v or 9 4 v for a synthetic solution or the real wastewater and it gave enc values of 4 9 kwh m 3 or 9 4 kwh m 3 for a synthetic solution or the real wastewater respectively 23 enc kwh m 3 ui t cep v in the same conditions the amount of electrode consumed elc was 0 34 kg m 3 on the basis of calculation by faraday s law using eq 24 where i a is the ec current t s is the duration of the ec m is the molecular weight of al n 3 the electron number f the faraday constant and v m3 the volume of treated solution 24 elc kg m 3 i t m 10 3 n f v the treatment cost tc of the cep must include the costs of all consumed electricity in the ec reactor and for the pumping of solution electrode material al and the consumed chemicals excluding the costs of sodium fluoride and sodium nitrate and the cost of the sludge separation and treatment the treatment cost tc for the synthetic and real wastewaters is calculated in appendix 2 only with known terms of electricity consumed in the ec reactor 130 of the electrode material calculated with the faraday law and the consumed sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide the consumed electrode material is always greater than the calculated value tc of 2 1792 usd per m3 and 2 3097 usd per m3 were found for the synthetic solution and the real wastewater respectively the most important costs are the aluminum material and the sodium hydroxide used in the ph control there is only a slight effect of the voltage on tc an improvement of tc could be obtained thanks to the change of sodium hydroxide by a cheaper base in the present cep treatment it was not possible to reach the regulated concentrations 88 of both fluoride and nitrate anions the treatment of the real wastewater showed that the removal of nitrate anions was the determining step of the process and it was observed after 160 min of ec which correspond to 1 33 l of treated solution but this does not involve a modification of the calculated enc and elc thakur et al 90 and mena et al 57 performed similar type of continuous process at low cost less than 0 4 usd per m3 and achieved the removal efficiency of 87 94 but using synthetic fluoride solutions between 9 mg l 1 and 12 mg l 1 respectively in the present work the cost was greater for more concentrated solutions moreover it was the removal of nitrate anions which needed a more expensive treatment remarkably the present contribution extended the practicability of cep in the treatment of a real wastewater which contained 80 22 mg l 1 of nitrate anions and 40 57 mg l 1 of fluoride anions moreover as shown by the concentrations in table s1 the ec treatment is efficient in the removal of si na mg k cr cu al pb mn fe ni p and zn ions present in real wastewater 4 conclusions in the present research contribution the simultaneous removal of fluoride and nitrate anions was investigated by using a cep the eds analysis xps spectra and xrd patterns confirmed that fluoride anions were adsorbed onto the electro generated aluminas and that nitrate anions were reduced during the process the cep was applied to a real wastewater which contained high concentrations of fluoride and nitrate anions the recommended discharge regulation of fluoride was reached faster than the one of nitrate anions the application of this treatment in a microelectronic industry would need a change in the electrocoagulation reactor such as a greater cathode than anode or by using another cathode nature in order to improve the nitrate anion removal by reduction from an engineering point of view the theoretical behavior of cep which was developed in the present paper would need to be extended to other pollutants with various changes in the reactor structure credit authorship contribution statement h tounsi investigation t

13117,algal blooms in lake and reservoir water lead to water quality problems including water odors algal toxins and disinfection byproducts a novel dissolved air flotation process that incorporates positively charged bubbles posidaf can effectively remove algae in lakes and reservoirs chitosan as a modified bubble agent in the posidaf process has attracted extensive attention due to its natural nontoxicity and good flocculation properties in this paper three types of amphiphilic chitosan with different lengths of carbon chains were prepared via amphiphilic modification and were used as bubble modifiers to remove microcystis aeruginosa in the posidaf process the effects of algae removal under different dosage of modifiers were compared and the role of algal organic matter was investigated results showed that the water solubility of chitosan was markedly enhanced after amphiphilic modification while thermal stability were decreased when using butyl n 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl chitosan ammonium chloride c4 htcc the effect of modified air flotation was the best and the removal ratio of algae was 93 47 when the c4 htcc dosage was 1 0 mg l the presence of aom enhanced the overall effect of algae removal and electrostatic attraction was the primary adhesion mechanism of the microbubble amphiphilic chitosan algal organic matter algal cell system in addition

lakes reservoirs in china that have been designated for nutritional status monitoring mild eutrophication is present in 23 6 of the lakes and moderate eutrophication is present in 4 5 1 eutrophication of lake and reservoir water leads to serious algal blooms resulting in water quality problems such as odor algal organic matter aom algal toxins and the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps 1 3 during disinfection aom will produce carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps with carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic effects such as halomethane and haloacetic acid and many nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps which cause serious harm to water supply security and the ecological environment 4 7 because algae cells have small specific gravities high negative charges and high stabilities they do not typically sink in water resulting in low removal efficiency in traditional coagulation and sedimentation processes which typically has a negative impact on the process performance of water plants and the quality of effluent decreases 7 10 therefore algae removal efficiency must urgently be improved dissolved air floatation daf technology is widely used for drinking water treatment due to its high algae removal efficiency low release probability of algal toxins short pretreatment time low reagent consumption and low operation cost 11 16 however there are still some problems in the traditional dissolved air flotation process such as unstable adhesion between bubbles and flocs and low efficiency of algae removal 17 in recent years the positively charged bubble dissolved air flotation posidaf process has attracted the attention of researchers 18 20 in this technology surface modifiers cationic surfactants cationic polymers etc are added to the dissolved gas system to make the microbubbles have the functional characteristics of bridging and positive charge on the surface 21 22 surface modified microbubbles then overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them and algae cells improving their collision and adhesion efficiency eliminating dependence on coagulation pretreatment 23 24 when cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab was used as a surfactant to modify the microbubbles the average algae removal rate increased and the change in zeta potential of the effluent was inconspicuous 25 when the commercial poly n n diallyl n n dimethylammonium chloride pdadmac was used to modify microbubbles to treat microcystis aeruginosa algae were almost completely removed 26 however ctab is irritating and corrosive to skin and eyes and pdadmac produces n n dimethyl nitramine with chloramine during disinfection which poses a potential threat to human health 27 therefore chitosan cts is not only a kind of safe and non toxic bubble modifier but also easy to be modified and has attracted extensive attention in recent years 28 shi et al 29 demonstrated that the increase in the dissolved organic carbon doc removal rate was between 4 3 and 8 0 after the daf process using chitosan as the coagulant aid and bubble modifier wang et al 30 enhanced the removal efficiency of algal cells and hydrophobic macromolecular organics by adding chitosan as a microbubble surface modifier in the air flotation process however the high zeta potential of effluent indicated that chitosan is easy to desorb and there are some problems such as poor water solubility unstable adhesion with microbubbles and unclear mechanism of adhesion between bubbles and flocs which severely limits its application in the field of water supply air flotation they made various experimental modifications to solve these problems via the improvement of modified chitosan which has been used in various fields such as recovering gold ions azo dye degradation pb ii removal and removal of toxic anions 31 36 however modified chitosan has not been widely studied and applied in the field of posidaf a simple efficient green environmentally friendly and novel bubble modifier was prepared by introducing quaternary ammonium groups and alkyl groups into the chitosan molecular chain a series of posidaf experiments to remove microcystis aeruginosa were carried out the adhesion effects between amphiphilic chitosan and bubbles were investigated and the best type and dosage of amphiphilic chitosan were determined the dominant adhesion mechanism and synergistic removal mechanism of the microbubble amphiphilic chitosan aom algal cell system were also explored 2 materals and methods 2 1 chemicals chitosan with a deacetylation degree of 95 was provided by mclean reagent co ltd n butanal 98 n octanal 97 lauraldehyde 95 and glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtmac 95 were delivered by aladdin shanghai china sodium hydroxide isopropanol glacial acetic acid absolute ethanol sodium cyanoborohydride and acetone were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china the test water was deionized water di water had a resistivity of 18 mω cm and was obtained from a milli q water system 2 2 influent water quality synthetic daf influent water was prepared by taking a stock solution of microcystis aeruginosa in the logarithmic growth period and di water in proportion and cultured cells were diluted to 6 105 8 105 cells ml the cultures were subjected to a 12 h light and dark cycles with an associated temperature control of 27 c 25 c the water quality indices of the influent are shown in table s1 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 synthesis of amphiphilic chitosan the synthesis of amphiphilic chitosan was performed via quaternization and alkylation of the polymer the quaternization of amphiphilic chitosan was performed by synthesizing n 2 hydroxy propyl 3 trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride htcc from chitosan and gtmac chitosan 3 g was dissolved in 150 ml of 2 acetic acid solution the solution was adjusted to ph 9 by adding 1 mol l naoh to precipitate chitosan and then the solution was stirred and alkalized at 25 c for 12 h the above precipitate was washed until neutral with di water mixed with 100 ml isopropanol and then transferred to a three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser chitosan was stirred vigorously at 50 c for 1 h to ensure even dispersion and was then heated slowly to 75 c gtmac mass ratio of 2 1 to chitosan was dissolved in 20 ml of isopropanol and added to the three necked flask within 1 h then stirring continued and the reaction was performed for 8 h the compound was precipitated and washed with absolute ethanol dried at 50 c for 24 h and then ground to obtain htcc also known as quaternized chitosan the reaction scheme is described in fig s1a the alkylation of htcc was performed from htcc butyraldehyde octanal lauraldehyde and sodium cyanobohydride solution nabh3cn 0 5 g of htcc was dissolved in 50 ml di water and then transferred to a three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser tube which was preplaced in an anhydrous ethanol solution of butyraldehyde and heated the specific preparation conditions are shown in table s2 after the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature it reacted with sodium cyanoborohydrin solution nabh3cn for 12 h and the molar ratio of nabh3cn to htcc was 1 1 1 the amphiphilic chitosan butyl htcc c4 htcc was prepared by precipitation with acetone washing the product several times and vacuum drying at 50 c octyl htcc c8 htcc and lauryl htcc c12 htcc were prepared by a similar process the reaction scheme is described in fig s1b 2 3 2 posidaf algae removal experiment three amphiphilic chitosans c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc were used as bubble modifiers at dosages of 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 mg l the removal effect of posidaf on algal cells and organic matter was explored and the amphiphilic chitosan with the best modification effect was selected the flotation time was 15 min the dissolved air pressure was 0 5 mpa and the reflux ratio was 20 as shown in fig s2 the experimental device was composed of a microbubble generator air flotation reaction tank and circulating water tank in addition the effect of aom content on the algae removal process of posidaf was investigated aom was extracted based on the method of narasinga rao et al 37 first cells were separated from aom by centrifugation at 4000 r min for 15 min with a tg16 ws centrifuge changsha xiangzhi china and then passed through a 0 45 μm membrane to filter the supernatants algal cells from the bottom of the centrifuge tube and the surface of the 0 45 μm membrane were collected and resuspended in 0 6 nacl solution of the same volume as aom solution the resuspended algal cells were centrifuged at 10000 r min for 15 min and passed through a 0 45 μm membrane to filter the supernatants to further extract the tightly bound aom on the surface of algal cells the supernatants of the above two steps were mixed to obtain aom of microcystis aeruginosa and the concentration of doc was adjusted to 1 mg l the algal cells removed from the surface aom were resuspended in 0 6 nacl and diluted to 6 105 8 105 cells ml with di water aom was added to the algal solution at dosages of 0 2 1 0 mg l to form the raw water of this experiment each analysis was performed in triplicate the data in the figures are mean values and the error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean values this group of experiments was performed to explore the effect of aom on posidaf algae removal 2 4 characterization and analytical methods 2 4 1 amphiphilic chitosan characterization the functional group structure of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized via a nexus 670 fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet america the sample preparation method was the potassium bromide pellet technique the dried potassium bromide powder and the solid powder of the sample to be tested were ground and mixed and then pressed into thin sheets with a thickness of 0 1 1 0 mm and a diameter of 10 mm the fraction of the infrared spectrometer was 2 cm 1 and the scanning range was 400 4000 cm 1 38 the water solubility of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized by turbidimetric method the 40 mg sample was dissolved in 20 ml 2 acetic acid solution and the ph of the system was gradually adjusted with 1 mol l sodium hydroxide solution the projection rate of the solution at different ph values was detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 600 nm 39 the thermal stability of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized using a sta449c thermal gravimetric analyzer netsch germany an appropriate amount of samples pre vacuum dried were weighed and added to the sample tray and thermogravimetric measurement and analysis were performed with a synchronous thermal analyzer the temperature rise rate was adjusted to 10 c min while nitrogen was introduced and the temperature range was from room temperature to 800 c 39 the surface morphology of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized using a merlin fe sem scanning electron microscope carl zeiss germany the sample powder was adhered to the test bed and treated by gold spraying for 2 min at an acceleration voltage of 2 kv 40 2 4 2 effluent analysis analysis of the treated water after the posidaf tests included measurement of turbidity using a 2100 n turbidimeter hach america determination of zeta potential utilizing a js94h microelectrophoresis meter powereach china and measurement of uv254 and od680 using a p7 uv vis spectrophotometer mapada china the methods used to determine these indicators were performed as described previously 41 an f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan was used for sem characterization of air flotation scum the hydrogen bonding force was detected by a nexus 670 fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet america photos of adhesion between microbubbles and flocs during air flotation were taken by a speedcam macrovis eosens high speed camera hsvision germany and the molecular weight of dissolved organic carbon doc was detected and analyzed by liquid chromatography organic carbon detection doc labor germany when a fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to detect the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum the instrument conditions were set as follows excitation wavelength 220 450 nm step size 5 nm emission wavelength 220 550 nm step size 5 nm and slit width 5 nm ultrapure water was used as a blank to deduce raman scattering other analysis methods are the same as those described in the previous section 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of amphiphilic chitosan fig 1a presents the ftir spectra of chitosan htcc c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc the peaks presented at 1480 cm 1 1600 cm 1 1680 cm 1 2857 cm 1 2928 cm 1 and 3481 cm 1 refer to ch3 in quaternary ammonium group nh2 characteristic absorption nh characteristic absorption ch2 stretching vibration ch3 stretching vibration and oh stretching vibration of chitosan respectively 42 45 due to quaternization modification the absorption peak of free nh2 of chitosan was weakened the characteristic absorption peak representing nh and ch3 in quaternary ammonium group appeared indicating that gtmac reacted with nh2 of chitosan to form htcc after alkylation modification of htcc the peak intensities at 2928 cm 1 and 2857 cm 1 increased with increasing carbon chain length and the absorption peak of nh was also enhanced compared with htcc demonstrating that aldehydes reacted with nh2 of htcc to form c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc in addition the characteristic absorption peak intensity of ch3 in the quaternary ammonium group decreased which may be due to the reduction of its relative content due to the introduction of long chain alkyl groups 33 the water solubilities of chitosan and c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc at different ph are shown in fig 1b the transmittance of chitosan c4 htcc and c8 htcc in the solution was more than 95 when ph 4 indicating that they have good water solubility under acidic conditions when ph 4 the gradual decrease of the transmittance of the c8 htcc solution was not as strong as that of chitosan with increasing ph suggesting that the water solubility of the sample was improved to a certain extent compared with chitosan in general the transmittance of c4 htcc was stable above 95 throughout the ph range indicating that the sample has the best water solubility and the best modification effect c12 htcc had poor solubility which can be attributed to its relatively high molecular weight and strong hydrophobicity 39 as shown in fig 1c at the beginning of heating chitosan and amphiphilic chitosan lost weight marginally due to the volatilization of adsorbed water chitosan exhibited a marked weight loss from 256 c to 351 c due to the degradation of molecular chains with increasing temperature after amphiphilic modification the loss of focus of chitosan shifted to the left the thermal stability decreased and there was an marked weight loss from 235 c to 287 c at the same temperature the weight loss of amphiphilic chitosan was more serious than that of chitosan the thermal stability of c4 htcc was greater than that of the other two amphiphilic chitosans which shows that the thermal stability of amphiphilic chitosan decreases with increasing alkyl carbon chain length sem images of chitosan htcc c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc are shown in fig 2 fig 2a and b shows that before modification chitosan exhibited a flake structure with a smooth surface uniform morphology small porosity and high crystallinity which is consistent with the conclusion of zheng 39 after quaternization modification as shown in fig 2c and d the surface of the htcc became rough and dense pores appeared these changes may have been induced by the introduction of quaternary ammonium groups which destroyed the samples crystallinity and loosened its structure fig 2e f g h i and j presents that the surface morphologies of the three samples were relatively similar with the introduction of alkyl carbon chains the modified chitosan was looser and rougher than the htcc and a layered structure developed the lamellar structure of c12 htcc was the loosest among the five materials and many aggregate particles appeared on the surface due to the serious weakening of its crystal structure compared with unmodified chitosan 3 2 algae removal effect of posidaf 3 2 1 types and dosing methods of amphiphilic chitosan it can be seen from fig 3a b and c shows that with increasing posidaf dosage the removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity gradually increased and reached their maximum values when the dosage was 1 0 mg l when c4 htcc was used as a bubble modifier in the posidaf process the highest removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity were achieved with 93 47 81 48 and 92 89 which increased by 45 64 37 04 and 44 57 compared with the dosage of 0 4 mg l when c8 htcc was added as a bubble modifier the highest removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity were 24 32 21 62 and 26 81 higher than those at 0 4 mg l therefore with increasing amphiphilic chitosan dosage the efficiency of c4 htcc was higher than that of c8 htcc this is because c4 htcc has better water solubility and is insensitive to ph 26 more protonate amino nh3 was produced by adding c4 htcc than by adding c8 htcc under neutral conditions when the dosage was 0 4 mg l the algae and turbidity removal capacity of c8 htcc was 17 04 and 2 48 higher than that of c4 htcc respectively this result likely occurred because at low dosages the effect of bubble modification was weak and the adsorption bridging role played a major role in the pollution removal process as a result of its long carbon chain c8 htcc more easily captured negatively charged algal cells and organic matter suspended in water and the removal rate of algal cells and turbidity were higher 29 the removal rate of each index for c12 htcc was far lower than c4 htcc and c8 htcc because it could not be ionized in water to produce adequate nh3 due to its poor water solubility and it could not effectively adhere to microbubbles and modify them with a positive charge conversely a higher molecular weight led to a larger extension space forming a high charge concentration region after adsorption on the surface of microbubbles resulting in electrostatic repulsion which inhibited the adsorption of more c12 htcc on microbubbles 26 fig 3d shows the variation of zeta potential of effluent after posidaf process with the dosage of amphiphilic chitosan changed from 0 1 2 mg l when the amphiphilic chitosan dosage was less than 1 0 mg l the zeta potential of effluent after posidaf rose slowly as the c4 htcc dosage increased however compared with c8 htcc 17 7 mv and c12 htcc 16 4 mv it did not rise at low dosages which can be attributed to the fact that most c4 htcc adhered to the surface of microbubbles and rose to the water surface resulting in the residual amount in water being low c8 htcc and c12 htcc were primarily suspended in water due to poor water solubility resulting in high water zeta potential after floating when the dosage was greater than 1 0 mg l the zeta potential of the effluent increased when c4 htcc and c8 htcc were used as bubble surface modifiers and there were more effluent residues the reasons for these results are as follows this is consistent with the trend of previous studies 46 first a large number of amphiphilic chitosan adhered to the bubble surface with increasing dosage under the action of hydrophobic force which resulted in steric hindrance and limited the further adhesion of other chitosan monomers second a large amount of amphiphilic chitosan was adhered by the positively modified bubbles thus free chitosan monomers in water were hindered from adhering more due to electrostatic repulsion 47 in short c4 htcc has the best decontamination effect followed by c8 htcc c12 htcc did not exhibit an ideal decontamination performance due to its poor water solubility low dosage of algae removal is not good while excessive amphiphilic chitosan dosage cannot improve the adhesion effect but remains in water resulting in a waste of resources therefore the dosage of the modifier was 1 0 mg l to explore the effect of aom on posidaf algae removal 3 2 2 effect of aom on algae removal by posidaf as shown in fig 4 when c4 htcc was used as a modifier the removal effect of several pollutants was the best over the entire range of aom dosages however its removal effect did not apparently increase with increasing aom dosage which indicates that it is difficult to bridge across long aom chains in water to form a large interception network due to the short butyl carbon chain therefore the removal effect was not further improved the removal rate of pollutants in water increased with increasing aom dosage when c8 htcc was used as a bubble modifier achieving the best removal ratio at an aom concentration of 0 8 mg l the removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity increased by 18 28 14 86 and 20 18 respectively compared with the aom dosage of 0 2 mg l these results indicate that in addition to generating electrostatic attraction a long chain structure with negatively charged aom may also bridge with octyl carbon chain adsorption on the surface of modified bubbles to form a large interception network therefore the effect of net trapping increased and the removal effect of pollutants enhanced in water when the dose of aom exceeded 0 8 mg l the removal rate inapparently decreased which indicated that the interception network was formed by octyl carbon chains and that aom was relatively stable in contrast the decontamination efficiency of c12 htcc decreased with increasing aom dosage which may be due to the long lauryl carbon chain and the excessively large interception network formed with aom thus c12 htcc easily desorbs and remains in water after adhering to a large number of pollutants fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was used to qualitatively analyze the organic matter in raw water and posidaf effluent to describe the removal of dissolved organic matter by the content of aom in water in the posidaf process fig 5a shows the raw water with aom dosage of 0 mg l fig 5b e and g demonstrates the posidaf effluent when c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc were used as bubble modifier respectively fig 5b shows the raw water with aom dosage of 0 8 mg l fig 5d f h displays the posidaf effluent when c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc were used as bubble modifier respectively fig 5a and b shows that the dissolved organic matter in raw water was primarily soluble microbial products smp before aom was added followed by tryptophan and tyrosine humic acid and a small amount of fulvic acid the content of smp increased markedly after aom was added indicating that the primary component of aom is macromolecular smp which is consistent with the conclusion of rao et al 48 compared with fig 5c e g the color of each organic matter area in fig 5c was weakened most seriously when the dosage of aom was 0 mg l illustrating that c4 htcc had the best removal effect on several dissolved organic matters it can be seen from fig 5d and f that when c8 htcc was used as a bubble modifier the removal effect was marginally better than that of c4 htcc under the condition of adding aom compared with fig 5e f g and h the color of the humic acid area was significantly weakened which again shows that the bridging ability is the best between the octyl carbon chain and aom and high molecular weight organic matter with strong hydrophobicity was intercepted to a high degree 3 3 algae removal mechanism of posidaf 3 3 1 mechanism of adhesion between bubbles and flocs to explore the advantages and disadvantages of amphiphilic chitosan as a bubble modifier in posidaf this research characterized the scum produced in the posidaf process by sem and ftir photographed and recorded the adhesion process between bubbles and flocs explored the mechanism of action of hydrogen bonds and analyzed the adhesion process and mechanism among modified microbubbles algal cells and floc particles when the dosage of aom was 0 mg l in raw water fig 6a c e which contained air flotation scum with c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc as modifiers the relative strengths of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds were relatively close and were formed by c4 htcc and c8 htcc there was little difference between the intermolecular hydrogen bonds because the effect of algae removal only depended on electrostatic attraction and mutual adhesion of the hydrophobic interface 49 when the dosage of aom was 0 8 mg l in raw water fig 6b d and f which show the air flotation scum with c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc as modifiers respectively the relative strength of hydroxyl radical groups in c8 htcc scum decreased and the relative strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonds increased by 6 28 compared with c4 htcc which indicates that a relatively stable network structure was formed between the octyl carbon chain and aom due to strong hydrogen bonds 50 c12 htcc has difficulty forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to its poor water solubility the relative strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond of scum after posidaf may be attributed to the structural characteristics of nh2 oh etc contained in the modifier itself as shown in fig 6i when the dosage of aom was 0 mg l in raw water the bridging effect of the aom long chain and octyl carbon chain was lost and electrostatic attraction was the only effect which is consistent with the conclusion of nam 51 most of the foam flocs formed by single modified microbubbles adhered to multiple algal cells after posidaf when c8 htcc was used as a modifier fig 6g shows that multiple microbubbles adhered to algae cells although the flocs formed in the posidaf process with c4 htcc as the modifier had no bridging effect therefore c4 htcc has a better modification effect on microbubbles and stronger electrostatic attraction compared with the butyl carbon chain the octyl carbon chain had a wider trapping area in water and provided more attachment points for algal cells therefore microbubbles modified by c8 htcc can adhere to a wider range of algal cells as shown in fig 6g and i only a few cells adhered during posidaf with c12 htcc as a modifier fig 6k indicating that the surface modification effect of microbubbles was poor and that there was no strong electrostatic attraction between them when aom was added to the raw water the algae removal effects were improved to varying degrees due to the bridging effect between aom and the alkyl carbon chain on the surface of the modified microbubbles it can be seen from fig 7b d and f that the adhesion effect between algal cells and microbubbles modified by c4 htcc was strongest and the flocs were larger and more closely combined than before the microbubbles modified by c8 htcc also formed vesicles with multiple bubbles adhering to algal cells but the improvement was not as strong as that of c4 htcc the reason for this result might be that its influence was weak and electrostatic attraction was the primary mechanism although adsorption bridging played a positive role the improvement of the air flotation effect is the weakest when c12 htcc was used as a modifier this compound may not be well integrated into the air flotation reaction due to its poor solubility the addition of chitosan increased the density of flocs resulting in the reduction of floc pores and the encapsulation of algal cells fig 7b and c presents scum surface images when c4 htcc and c8 htcc were used as bubble modifiers when c4 htcc was embedded in the flocs the floc cluster phenomenon was stronger and the density further increased the flocs composed of c8 htcc and algal cells were flaked and evenly distributed and a filamentous structure developed in the gap this phenomena shows that the amphiphilic chitosan long chain encouraged adsorption bridging and provided a positive charge to overcome electrostatic repulsion in the process of air flotation to make the flocs denser 15 when modified by c12 htcc fig 7d the number of algal cells in the scum was small which might be due to the poor water solubility of c12 htcc combined with the removal effect electrostatic attraction was the primary mechanism to strengthen the adhesion between microbubbles and particles the longer alkyl carbon chain also produced a bridging effect providing more attachment points for macromolecular organics the two adsorbed each other to form a more complex network structure and played a positive role in the adhesion between floc particles and between microbubbles and floc particles 3 3 2 characteristics and functions of aom to analyze the synergistic removal of algal cells by aom and modified bubbles in more detail the molecular weight of dissolved organic carbon doc in algae containing water before and after treatment was detected and analyzed by liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd tables s3 and s4 show the content distribution of various types of doc in algal water containing different doses of aom before and after posidaf respectively table s3 shows that posidaf had a certain removal effect on doc when c4 htcc and c8 htcc were used as modifiers however the content of biopolymers in the effluent using c8 htcc and c12 htcc was higher than that when c4 htcc was used which indicates that there are more residues of the two modifiers in the effluent the reason for these results might be that the solubility of the two modifiers was poor thus they accumulated in water also c8 htcc and c12 htcc possessed long carbon chains and intercepted excessive algae cells and other substances in the process of rising to the liquid level with the bubbles thus they fell off and returned to the water body table s4 shows that biopolymers in water increased significantly while hydrophobic doc decreased with increasing aom therefore aom is primarily composed of biopolymers by comparing tables s3 and s4 this research finds that the removal rate of doc was improved after posidaf treatment with c4 htcc and c8 htcc as modifiers which shows that aom did play a positive role in the adhesion between modified bubbles and algae cells the removal effect of doc was significantly enhanced up to 27 6 when c8 htcc was used as a modifier this result may have occurred because after aom in water increased it adsorbed with octyl carbon chains to form a network structure and net trapping ability increased 4 conclusions and suggestion hydrophilic group quaternary ammonium groups and hydrophobic group alkyl groups were introduced via amphiphilic modification of chitosan the thermal stability of cts decreased with increasing alkyl carbon chain length while the solubility of amphiphilic chitosan increased when the dissolved gas pressure was 0 5 mpa and the reflux ratio was 20 the highest removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity were achieved with values of 93 47 81 48 and 92 89 respectively at a dosage of c4 htcc of 1 0 mg l there was good electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic effects between the modified bubbles and algal cells under this condition aom can improve the decontamination effect of posidaf by promoting adhesion between the bubbles and the flocs and the synergistic effect of c8 htcc and aom was strongest although c4 htcc had the best decontamination effect it was not sensitive to the content of aom c4 htcc can produce nh3 by dissolving and ionizing in water which can promote adhesion under the action of electrostatic attraction c8 htcc has a wider trapping area and is easy to bridge with aom the interception network formed can enhance the removal effect of pollutants in general electrostatic attraction is the primary adhesion mechanism of the microbubble amphiphilic chitosan aom algal cell system in addition adsorption bridging and net trapping also play a positive role in the future surface force tester and atomic force microscope can be used to comprehensively detect and identify various molecular forces between aom and amphiphilic chitosan so as to further explore the leading mechanism of flocculation adhesion the separation of the two chitosan and aom residues in water should be investigated in future experiments using high performance gel permeation chromatography and then the aom content can be detected declaration of competing interest this study was financially

13117,algal blooms in lake and reservoir water lead to water quality problems including water odors algal toxins and disinfection byproducts a novel dissolved air flotation process that incorporates positively charged bubbles posidaf can effectively remove algae in lakes and reservoirs chitosan as a modified bubble agent in the posidaf process has attracted extensive attention due to its natural nontoxicity and good flocculation properties in this paper three types of amphiphilic chitosan with different lengths of carbon chains were prepared via amphiphilic modification and were used as bubble modifiers to remove microcystis aeruginosa in the posidaf process the effects of algae removal under different dosage of modifiers were compared and the role of algal organic matter was investigated results showed that the water solubility of chitosan was markedly enhanced after amphiphilic modification while thermal stability were decreased when using butyl n 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl chitosan ammonium chloride c4 htcc the effect of modified air flotation was the best and the removal ratio of algae was 93 47 when the c4 htcc dosage was 1 0 mg l the presence of aom enhanced the overall effect of algae removal and electrostatic attraction was the primary adhesion mechanism of the microbubble amphiphilic chitosan algal organic matter algal cell system in addition

lakes reservoirs in china that have been designated for nutritional status monitoring mild eutrophication is present in 23 6 of the lakes and moderate eutrophication is present in 4 5 1 eutrophication

during disinfection aom will produce carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps with carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic effects such as halomethane and haloacetic acid and many nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps which cause serious harm to water supply security and the ecological environment 4 7 because algae cells have small specific gravities high negative charges and high stabilities they do not typically sink in water resulting in low removal efficiency in traditional coagulation and sedimentation processes which typically has a negative impact on the process performance of water plants and the quality of effluent decreases 7 10 therefore algae removal efficiency must urgently be improved dissolved air floatation daf technology is widely used for drinking water treatment due to its high algae removal efficiency low release probability of algal toxins short pretreatment time low reagent consumption and low operation cost 11 16 however there are still some problems in the traditional dissolved air flotation process such as unstable adhesion between bubbles and flocs and low efficiency of algae removal 17 in recent years the positively charged bubble dissolved air flotation posidaf process has attracted the attention of researchers 18 20 in this technology surface modifiers cationic surfactants cationic polymers etc are added to the dissolved gas system to make the microbubbles have the functional characteristics of bridging and positive charge on the surface 21 22 surface modified microbubbles then overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them and algae cells improving their collision and adhesion efficiency eliminating dependence on coagulation pretreatment 23 24 when cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab was used as a surfactant to modify the microbubbles the average algae removal rate increased and the change in zeta potential of the effluent was inconspicuous 25 when the commercial poly n n diallyl n n dimethylammonium chloride pdadmac was used to modify microbubbles to treat microcystis aeruginosa algae were almost completely removed 26 however ctab is irritating and corrosive to skin and eyes and pdadmac produces n n dimethyl nitramine with chloramine during disinfection which poses a potential threat to human health 27 therefore chitosan cts is not only a kind of safe and non toxic bubble modifier but also easy to be modified and has attracted extensive attention in recent years 28 shi et al 29 demonstrated that the increase in the dissolved organic carbon doc removal rate was between 4 3 and 8 0 after the daf process using chitosan as the coagulant aid and bubble modifier wang et al 30 enhanced the removal efficiency of algal cells and hydrophobic macromolecular organics by adding chitosan as a microbubble surface modifier in the air flotation process however the high zeta potential of effluent indicated that chitosan is easy to desorb and there are some problems such as poor water solubility unstable adhesion with microbubbles and unclear mechanism of adhesion between bubbles and flocs which severely limits its application in the field of water supply air flotation they made various experimental modifications to solve these problems via the improvement of modified chitosan which has been used in various fields such as recovering gold ions azo dye degradation pb ii removal and removal of toxic anions 31 36 however modified chitosan has not been widely studied and applied in the field of posidaf a simple efficient green environmentally friendly and novel bubble modifier was prepared by introducing quaternary ammonium groups and alkyl groups into the chitosan molecular chain a series of posidaf experiments to remove microcystis aeruginosa were carried out the adhesion effects between amphiphilic chitosan and bubbles were investigated and the best type and dosage of amphiphilic chitosan were determined the dominant adhesion mechanism and synergistic removal mechanism of the microbubble amphiphilic chitosan aom algal cell system were also explored 2 materals and methods 2 1 chemicals chitosan with a deacetylation degree of 95 was provided by mclean reagent co ltd n butanal 98 n octanal 97 lauraldehyde 95 and glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtmac 95 were delivered by aladdin shanghai china sodium hydroxide isopropanol glacial acetic acid absolute ethanol sodium cyanoborohydride and acetone were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china the test water was deionized water di water had a resistivity of 18 mω cm and was obtained from a milli q water system 2 2 influent water quality synthetic daf influent water was prepared by taking a stock solution of microcystis aeruginosa in the logarithmic growth period and di water in proportion and cultured cells were diluted to 6 105 8 105 cells ml the cultures were subjected to a 12 h light and dark cycles with an associated temperature control of 27 c 25 c the water quality indices of the influent are shown in table s1 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 synthesis of amphiphilic chitosan the synthesis of amphiphilic chitosan was performed via quaternization and alkylation of the polymer the quaternization of amphiphilic chitosan was performed by synthesizing n 2 hydroxy propyl 3 trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride htcc from chitosan and gtmac chitosan 3 g was dissolved in 150 ml of 2 acetic acid solution the solution was adjusted to ph 9 by adding 1 mol l naoh to precipitate chitosan and then the solution was stirred and alkalized at 25 c for 12 h the above precipitate was washed until neutral with di water mixed with 100 ml isopropanol and then transferred to a three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser chitosan was stirred vigorously at 50 c for 1 h to ensure even dispersion and was then heated slowly to 75 c gtmac mass ratio of 2 1 to chitosan was dissolved in 20 ml of isopropanol and added to the three necked flask within 1 h then stirring continued and the reaction was performed for 8 h the compound was precipitated and washed with absolute ethanol dried at 50 c for 24 h and then ground to obtain htcc also known as quaternized chitosan the reaction scheme is described in fig s1a the alkylation of htcc was performed from htcc butyraldehyde octanal lauraldehyde and sodium cyanobohydride solution nabh3cn 0 5 g of htcc was dissolved in 50 ml di water and then transferred to a three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser tube which was preplaced in an anhydrous ethanol solution of butyraldehyde and heated the specific preparation conditions are shown in table s2 after the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature it reacted with sodium cyanoborohydrin solution nabh3cn for 12 h and the molar ratio of nabh3cn to htcc was 1 1 1 the amphiphilic chitosan butyl htcc c4 htcc was prepared by precipitation with acetone washing the product several times and vacuum drying at 50 c octyl htcc c8 htcc and lauryl htcc c12 htcc were prepared by a similar process the reaction scheme is described in fig s1b 2 3 2 posidaf algae removal experiment three amphiphilic chitosans c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc were used as bubble modifiers at dosages of 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 mg l the removal effect of posidaf on algal cells and organic matter was explored and the amphiphilic chitosan with the best modification effect was selected the flotation time was 15 min the dissolved air pressure was 0 5 mpa and the reflux ratio was 20 as shown in fig s2 the experimental device was composed of a microbubble generator air flotation reaction tank and circulating water tank in addition the effect of aom content on the algae removal process of posidaf was investigated aom was extracted based on the method of narasinga rao et al 37 first cells were separated from aom by centrifugation at 4000 r min for 15 min with a tg16 ws centrifuge changsha xiangzhi china and then passed through a 0 45 μm membrane to filter the supernatants algal cells from the bottom of the centrifuge tube and the surface of the 0 45 μm membrane were collected and resuspended in 0 6 nacl solution of the same volume as aom solution the resuspended algal cells were centrifuged at 10000 r min for 15 min and passed through a 0 45 μm membrane to filter the supernatants to further extract the tightly bound aom on the surface of algal cells the supernatants of the above two steps were mixed to obtain aom of microcystis aeruginosa and the concentration of doc was adjusted to 1 mg l the algal cells removed from the surface aom were resuspended in 0 6 nacl and diluted to 6 105 8 105 cells ml with di water aom was added to the algal solution at dosages of 0 2 1 0 mg l to form the raw water of this experiment each analysis was performed in triplicate the data in the figures are mean values and the error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean values this group of experiments was performed to explore the effect of aom on posidaf algae removal 2 4 characterization and analytical methods 2 4 1 amphiphilic chitosan characterization the functional group structure of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized via a nexus 670 fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet america the sample preparation method was the potassium bromide pellet technique the dried potassium bromide powder and the solid powder of the sample to be tested were ground and mixed and then pressed into thin sheets with a thickness of 0 1 1 0 mm and a diameter of 10 mm the fraction of the infrared spectrometer was 2 cm 1 and the scanning range was 400 4000 cm 1 38 the water solubility of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized by turbidimetric method the 40 mg sample was dissolved in 20 ml 2 acetic acid solution and the ph of the system was gradually adjusted with 1 mol l sodium hydroxide solution the projection rate of the solution at different ph values was detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 600 nm 39 the thermal stability of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized using a sta449c thermal gravimetric analyzer netsch germany an appropriate amount of samples pre vacuum dried were weighed and added to the sample tray and thermogravimetric measurement and analysis were performed with a synchronous thermal analyzer the temperature rise rate was adjusted to 10 c min while nitrogen was introduced and the temperature range was from room temperature to 800 c 39 the surface morphology of amphiphilic chitosan was characterized using a merlin fe sem scanning electron microscope carl zeiss germany the sample powder was adhered to the test bed and treated by gold spraying for 2 min at an acceleration voltage of 2 kv 40 2 4 2 effluent analysis analysis of the treated water after the posidaf tests included measurement of turbidity using a 2100 n turbidimeter hach america determination of zeta potential utilizing a js94h microelectrophoresis meter powereach china and measurement of uv254 and od680 using a p7 uv vis spectrophotometer mapada china the methods used to determine these indicators were performed as described previously 41 an f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan was used for sem characterization of air flotation scum the hydrogen bonding force was detected by a nexus 670 fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet america photos of adhesion between microbubbles and flocs during air flotation were taken by a speedcam macrovis eosens high speed camera hsvision germany and the molecular weight of dissolved organic carbon doc was detected and analyzed by liquid chromatography organic carbon detection doc labor germany when a fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to detect the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum the instrument conditions were set as follows excitation wavelength 220 450 nm step size 5 nm emission wavelength 220 550 nm step size 5 nm and slit width 5 nm ultrapure water was used as a blank to deduce raman scattering other analysis methods are the same as those described in the previous section 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of amphiphilic chitosan fig 1a presents the ftir spectra of chitosan htcc c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc the peaks presented at 1480 cm 1 1600 cm 1 1680 cm 1 2857 cm 1 2928 cm 1 and 3481 cm 1 refer to ch3 in quaternary ammonium group nh2 characteristic absorption nh characteristic absorption ch2 stretching vibration ch3 stretching vibration and oh stretching vibration of chitosan respectively 42 45 due to quaternization modification the absorption peak of free nh2 of chitosan was weakened the characteristic absorption peak representing nh and ch3 in quaternary ammonium group appeared indicating that gtmac reacted with nh2 of chitosan to form htcc after alkylation modification of htcc the peak intensities at 2928 cm 1 and 2857 cm 1 increased with increasing carbon chain length and the absorption peak of nh was also enhanced compared with htcc demonstrating that aldehydes reacted with nh2 of htcc to form c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc in addition the characteristic absorption peak intensity of ch3 in the quaternary ammonium group decreased which may be due to the reduction of its relative content due to the introduction of long chain alkyl groups 33 the water solubilities of chitosan and c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc at different ph are shown in fig 1b the transmittance of chitosan c4 htcc and c8 htcc in the solution was more than 95 when ph 4 indicating that they have good water solubility under acidic conditions when ph 4 the gradual decrease of the transmittance of the c8 htcc solution was not as strong as that of chitosan with increasing ph suggesting that the water solubility of the sample was improved to a certain extent compared with chitosan in general the transmittance of c4 htcc was stable above 95 throughout the ph range indicating that the sample has the best water solubility and the best modification effect c12 htcc had poor solubility which can be attributed to its relatively high molecular weight and strong hydrophobicity 39 as shown in fig 1c at the beginning of heating chitosan and amphiphilic chitosan lost weight marginally due to the volatilization of adsorbed water chitosan exhibited a marked weight loss from 256 c to 351 c due to the degradation of molecular chains with increasing temperature after amphiphilic modification the loss of focus of chitosan shifted to the left the thermal stability decreased and there was an marked weight loss from 235 c to 287 c at the same temperature the weight loss of amphiphilic chitosan was more serious than that of chitosan the thermal stability of c4 htcc was greater than that of the other two amphiphilic chitosans which shows that the thermal stability of amphiphilic chitosan decreases with increasing alkyl carbon chain length sem images of chitosan htcc c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc are shown in fig 2 fig 2a and b shows that before modification chitosan exhibited a flake structure with a smooth surface uniform morphology small porosity and high crystallinity which is consistent with the conclusion of zheng 39 after quaternization modification as shown in fig 2c and d the surface of the htcc became rough and dense pores appeared these changes may have been induced by the introduction of quaternary ammonium groups which destroyed the samples crystallinity and loosened its structure fig 2e f g h i and j presents that the surface morphologies of the three samples were relatively similar with the introduction of alkyl carbon chains the modified chitosan was looser and rougher than the htcc and a layered structure developed the lamellar structure of c12 htcc was the loosest among the five materials and many aggregate particles appeared on the surface due to the serious weakening of its crystal structure compared with unmodified chitosan 3 2 algae removal effect of posidaf 3 2 1 types and dosing methods of amphiphilic chitosan it can be seen from fig 3a b and c shows that with increasing posidaf dosage the removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity gradually increased and reached their maximum values when the dosage was 1 0 mg l when c4 htcc was used as a bubble modifier in the posidaf process the highest removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity were achieved with 93 47 81 48 and 92 89 which increased by 45 64 37 04 and 44 57 compared with the dosage of 0 4 mg l when c8 htcc was added as a bubble modifier the highest removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity were 24 32 21 62 and 26 81 higher than those at 0 4 mg l therefore with increasing amphiphilic chitosan dosage the efficiency of c4 htcc was higher than that of c8 htcc this is because c4 htcc has better water solubility and is insensitive to ph 26 more protonate amino nh3 was produced by adding c4 htcc than by adding c8 htcc under neutral conditions when the dosage was 0 4 mg l the algae and turbidity removal capacity of c8 htcc was 17 04 and 2 48 higher than that of c4 htcc respectively this result likely occurred because at low dosages the effect of bubble modification was weak and the adsorption bridging role played a major role in the pollution removal process as a result of its long carbon chain c8 htcc more easily captured negatively charged algal cells and organic matter suspended in water and the removal rate of algal cells and turbidity were higher 29 the removal rate of each index for c12 htcc was far lower than c4 htcc and c8 htcc because it could not be ionized in water to produce adequate nh3 due to its poor water solubility and it could not effectively adhere to microbubbles and modify them with a positive charge conversely a higher molecular weight led to a larger extension space forming a high charge concentration region after adsorption on the surface of microbubbles resulting in electrostatic repulsion which inhibited the adsorption of more c12 htcc on microbubbles 26 fig 3d shows the variation of zeta potential of effluent after posidaf process with the dosage of amphiphilic chitosan changed from 0 1 2 mg l when the amphiphilic chitosan dosage was less than 1 0 mg l the zeta potential of effluent after posidaf rose slowly as the c4 htcc dosage increased however compared with c8 htcc 17 7 mv and c12 htcc 16 4 mv it did not rise at low dosages which can be attributed to the fact that most c4 htcc adhered to the surface of microbubbles and rose to the water surface resulting in the residual amount in water being low c8 htcc and c12 htcc were primarily suspended in water due to poor water solubility resulting in high water zeta potential after floating when the dosage was greater than 1 0 mg l the zeta potential of the effluent increased when c4 htcc and c8 htcc were used as bubble surface modifiers and there were more effluent residues the reasons for these results are as follows this is consistent with the trend of previous studies 46 first a large number of amphiphilic chitosan adhered to the bubble surface with increasing dosage under the action of hydrophobic force which resulted in steric hindrance and limited the further adhesion of other chitosan monomers second a large amount of amphiphilic chitosan was adhered by the positively modified bubbles thus free chitosan monomers in water were hindered from adhering more due to electrostatic repulsion 47 in short c4 htcc has the best decontamination effect followed by c8 htcc c12 htcc did not exhibit an ideal decontamination performance due to its poor water solubility low dosage of algae removal is not good while excessive amphiphilic chitosan dosage cannot improve the adhesion effect but remains in water resulting in a waste of resources therefore the dosage of the modifier was 1 0 mg l to explore the effect of aom on posidaf algae removal 3 2 2 effect of aom on algae removal by posidaf as shown in fig 4 when c4 htcc was used as a modifier the removal effect of several pollutants was the best over the entire range of aom dosages however its removal effect did not apparently increase with increasing aom dosage which indicates that it is difficult to bridge across long aom chains in water to form a large interception network due to the short butyl carbon chain therefore the removal effect was not further improved the removal rate of pollutants in water increased with increasing aom dosage when c8 htcc was used as a bubble modifier achieving the best removal ratio at an aom concentration of 0 8 mg l the removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity increased by 18 28 14 86 and 20 18 respectively compared with the aom dosage of 0 2 mg l these results indicate that in addition to generating electrostatic attraction a long chain structure with negatively charged aom may also bridge with octyl carbon chain adsorption on the surface of modified bubbles to form a large interception network therefore the effect of net trapping increased and the removal effect of pollutants enhanced in water when the dose of aom exceeded 0 8 mg l the removal rate inapparently decreased which indicated that the interception network was formed by octyl carbon chains and that aom was relatively stable in contrast the decontamination efficiency of c12 htcc decreased with increasing aom dosage which may be due to the long lauryl carbon chain and the excessively large interception network formed with aom thus c12 htcc easily desorbs and remains in water after adhering to a large number of pollutants fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was used to qualitatively analyze the organic matter in raw water and posidaf effluent to describe the removal of dissolved organic matter by the content of aom in water in the posidaf process fig 5a shows the raw water with aom dosage of 0 mg l fig 5b e and g demonstrates the posidaf effluent when c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc were used as bubble modifier respectively fig 5b shows the raw water with aom dosage of 0 8 mg l fig 5d f h displays the posidaf effluent when c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc were used as bubble modifier respectively fig 5a and b shows that the dissolved organic matter in raw water was primarily soluble microbial products smp before aom was added followed by tryptophan and tyrosine humic acid and a small amount of fulvic acid the content of smp increased markedly after aom was added indicating that the primary component of aom is macromolecular smp which is consistent with the conclusion of rao et al 48 compared with fig 5c e g the color of each organic matter area in fig 5c was weakened most seriously when the dosage of aom was 0 mg l illustrating that c4 htcc had the best removal effect on several dissolved organic matters it can be seen from fig 5d and f that when c8 htcc was used as a bubble modifier the removal effect was marginally better than that of c4 htcc under the condition of adding aom compared with fig 5e f g and h the color of the humic acid area was significantly weakened which again shows that the bridging ability is the best between the octyl carbon chain and aom and high molecular weight organic matter with strong hydrophobicity was intercepted to a high degree 3 3 algae removal mechanism of posidaf 3 3 1 mechanism of adhesion between bubbles and flocs to explore the advantages and disadvantages of amphiphilic chitosan as a bubble modifier in posidaf this research characterized the scum produced in the posidaf process by sem and ftir photographed and recorded the adhesion process between bubbles and flocs explored the mechanism of action of hydrogen bonds and analyzed the adhesion process and mechanism among modified microbubbles algal cells and floc particles when the dosage of aom was 0 mg l in raw water fig 6a c e which contained air flotation scum with c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc as modifiers the relative strengths of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds were relatively close and were formed by c4 htcc and c8 htcc there was little difference between the intermolecular hydrogen bonds because the effect of algae removal only depended on electrostatic attraction and mutual adhesion of the hydrophobic interface 49 when the dosage of aom was 0 8 mg l in raw water fig 6b d and f which show the air flotation scum with c4 htcc c8 htcc and c12 htcc as modifiers respectively the relative strength of hydroxyl radical groups in c8 htcc scum decreased and the relative strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonds increased by 6 28 compared with c4 htcc which indicates that a relatively stable network structure was formed between the octyl carbon chain and aom due to strong hydrogen bonds 50 c12 htcc has difficulty forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to its poor water solubility the relative strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond of scum after posidaf may be attributed to the structural characteristics of nh2 oh etc contained in the modifier itself as shown in fig 6i when the dosage of aom was 0 mg l in raw water the bridging effect of the aom long chain and octyl carbon chain was lost and electrostatic attraction was the only effect which is consistent with the conclusion of nam 51 most of the foam flocs formed by single modified microbubbles adhered to multiple algal cells after posidaf when c8 htcc was used as a modifier fig 6g shows that multiple microbubbles adhered to algae cells although the flocs formed in the posidaf process with c4 htcc as the modifier had no bridging effect therefore c4 htcc has a better modification effect on microbubbles and stronger electrostatic attraction compared with the butyl carbon chain the octyl carbon chain had a wider trapping area in water and provided more attachment points for algal cells therefore microbubbles modified by c8 htcc can adhere to a wider range of algal cells as shown in fig 6g and i only a few cells adhered during posidaf with c12 htcc as a modifier fig 6k indicating that the surface modification effect of microbubbles was poor and that there was no strong electrostatic attraction between them when aom was added to the raw water the algae removal effects were improved to varying degrees due to the bridging effect between aom and the alkyl carbon chain on the surface of the modified microbubbles it can be seen from fig 7b d and f that the adhesion effect between algal cells and microbubbles modified by c4 htcc was strongest and the flocs were larger and more closely combined than before the microbubbles modified by c8 htcc also formed vesicles with multiple bubbles adhering to algal cells but the improvement was not as strong as that of c4 htcc the reason for this result might be that its influence was weak and electrostatic attraction was the primary mechanism although adsorption bridging played a positive role the improvement of the air flotation effect is the weakest when c12 htcc was used as a modifier this compound may not be well integrated into the air flotation reaction due to its poor solubility the addition of chitosan increased the density of flocs resulting in the reduction of floc pores and the encapsulation of algal cells fig 7b and c presents scum surface images when c4 htcc and c8 htcc were used as bubble modifiers when c4 htcc was embedded in the flocs the floc cluster phenomenon was stronger and the density further increased the flocs composed of c8 htcc and algal cells were flaked and evenly distributed and a filamentous structure developed in the gap this phenomena shows that the amphiphilic chitosan long chain encouraged adsorption bridging and provided a positive charge to overcome electrostatic repulsion in the process of air flotation to make the flocs denser 15 when modified by c12 htcc fig 7d the number of algal cells in the scum was small which might be due to the poor water solubility of c12 htcc combined with the removal effect electrostatic attraction was the primary mechanism to strengthen the adhesion between microbubbles and particles the longer alkyl carbon chain also produced a bridging effect providing more attachment points for macromolecular organics the two adsorbed each other to form a more complex network structure and played a positive role in the adhesion between floc particles and between microbubbles and floc particles 3 3 2 characteristics and functions of aom to analyze the synergistic removal of algal cells by aom and modified bubbles in more detail the molecular weight of dissolved organic carbon doc in algae containing water before and after treatment was detected and analyzed by liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd tables s3 and s4 show the content distribution of various types of doc in algal water containing different doses of aom before and after posidaf respectively table s3 shows that posidaf had a certain removal effect on doc when c4 htcc and c8 htcc were used as modifiers however the content of biopolymers in the effluent using c8 htcc and c12 htcc was higher than that when c4 htcc was used which indicates that there are more residues of the two modifiers in the effluent the reason for these results might be that the solubility of the two modifiers was poor thus they accumulated in water also c8 htcc and c12 htcc possessed long carbon chains and intercepted excessive algae cells and other substances in the process of rising to the liquid level with the bubbles thus they fell off and returned to the water body table s4 shows that biopolymers in water increased significantly while hydrophobic doc decreased with increasing aom therefore aom is primarily composed of biopolymers by comparing tables s3 and s4 this research finds that the removal rate of doc was improved after posidaf treatment with c4 htcc and c8 htcc as modifiers which shows that aom did play a positive role in the adhesion between modified bubbles and algae cells the removal effect of doc was significantly enhanced up to 27 6 when c8 htcc was used as a modifier this result may have occurred because after aom in water increased it adsorbed with octyl carbon chains to form a network structure and net trapping ability increased 4 conclusions and suggestion hydrophilic group quaternary ammonium groups and hydrophobic group alkyl groups were introduced via amphiphilic modification of chitosan the thermal stability of cts decreased with increasing alkyl carbon chain length while the solubility of amphiphilic chitosan increased when the dissolved gas pressure was 0 5 mpa and the reflux ratio was 20 the highest removal rates of algal cells uv254 and turbidity were achieved with values of 93 47 81 48 and 92 89 respectively at a dosage of c4 htcc of 1 0 mg l there was good electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic effects between the modified bubbles and algal cells under this condition aom can improve the decontamination effect of posidaf by promoting adhesion between the bubbles and the flocs and the synergistic effect of c8 htcc and aom was strongest although c4 htcc had the best decontamination effect it was not sensitive to the content of aom c4 htcc can produce nh3 by dissolving and ionizing in water which can promote adhesion under the action of electrostatic attraction c8 htcc has a wider trapping area and is easy to bridge with aom the interception network formed can enhance the removal effect of pollutants in general electrostatic attraction is the primary adhesion mechanism of the microbubble amphiphilic chitosan aom algal cell system in addition adsorption bridging and net trapping also play a positive role in the future surface force tester and atomic force microscope can be used to comprehensively detect and identify various molecular forces between aom and amphiphilic chitosan so as to further explore the leading mechanism of flocculation adhesion the separation of the two chitosan and aom residues in water should be investigated in future experiments using high performance gel permeation chromatography and then the aom content can be detected declaration of competing interest this study was financially

13118,this study evaluates the crvi breakthrough behaviors of a continuous flow column packed with composite chitosan mwcnts iron beads under various operating conditions under the tested range of experimental parameters a maximum of 54 of crvi removal was achieved at water flow rate 1 ml min feed crvi concentration 30 mg l and packed bed height 8 cm a homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm involving convection dispersion and diffusion equations was formulated numerically solved and experimentally validated the high degree of conformity between the calculated and experimental breakthrough curves facilitated the determination of mass transfer parameters including axial dispersion d l 1 30 10 8 to 1 56 10 7 m2 s and surface diffusion d s 7 28 10 11 to 1 80 10 10 m2 s via an error minimizing approach the d l value was a function of molecular diffusion which varied with the flow velocity mass loading and bed height the d s values were slightly higher than those previously reported owing to the heterogeneous nature of the adsorbent the external film diffusion coefficient k f was also determined by using wilson geankoplis empirical correlation which was recognized as a rate controlling factor during crvi mass transfer to the adsorbent beads furthermore sensitivity analysis showed that a transition from diffuse to shock front occurred with a decreasing d l while a decrease in the slope of breakthrough curves was observed by decreasing d s and bed porosity and increasing k f and langmuir parameters lastly the study demonstrated a high correlation between utilization of fractional bed capacity and axial peclet number this method is suitable for optimizing operating conditions to maximize the utilization of a fixed bed columns graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chitosan mwcnts hexavalent chromium fixed bed adsorption hsdm axial dispersion surface diffusion comsol 1 introduction to date activated carbon adsorption remains the most widely used method for removing toxic heavy metal ions from impaired water due to its reliability operational versatility and low cost 1 the development of convection dispersion diffusion models has markedly facilitated the design and prediction of field scale packed bed systems loaded with activated carbon and other materials with high specific surface area 2 3 in a dynamic adsorption process a continuous solute flow passes through a column packed with specific adsorbents a breakthrough curve for the column adsorption process can be calculated from the ratio of metal ions concentrations at outflow and inflow of the column as a function of time the higher specific surface area often combined with appropriate surface charges generally allows such systems to capture heavy metal ions effectively the microporous characteristic of these materials generating their high surface area is also responsible for the rate limiting mass transfer of molecules once they reach the solid surface such mass transfer phenomenon has been conceptually and mathematically described by film transfer surface diffusion and pore diffusion incorporating the various mass transfer mechanisms into the convection dispersion diffusion models has proven effective in delineating the packed bed column breakthrough behaviors 4 9 the recent material advances trend towards modifying functional components by crosslinking and grafting to improve both adsorption performance and regeneration such engineered composite materials aim to either increase adsorption sites or to be selective to a specific contaminant in water matrices when tested either in batch or continuous process for instance researchers have identified several types of materials for uptake of chromium cr and other heavy metal ions with excellent selectivity high uptake capacity and fast adsorption kinetics at low concentrations of metal ions these materials includes chitosan flakes 10 cross linked chitosan iron iii composite 11 iron decorated mwcnts modified with chitosan film 12 chitosan coated carboxylic mwcnts 13 chitosan modified magnetic graphene oxide 14 mwcnts grafted with polypropylene amine 15 amino functionalized graphene oxide 16 tailor made polymer nanoparticles 17 and mesoporous silica functionalized with thiol group 18 the sorbent materials mentioned above have demonstrated excellent adsorption performances however these studies lack the rigor to provide an in depth analysis of detailed adsorption and mass transfer mechanisms and so their results can only be used for case specific projections recently our research group prepared an encapsulated chitosan modified iron oxide carbon nanotubes cs mwcnts fe beads for the uptake of aqueous phase crvi hexavalent chromium the more toxic and mobile state of cr ions as compared to criii trivalent chromium 19 20 the beads were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem coupled energy dispersive spectrometer eds for morphological topography and elemental mapping fourier transform infrared ftir powder x ray diffractometer xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps for physical and chemical properties and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis tga and dta for thermal stability of the beads these beads exhibited the following properties density 1 38 g cm3 average diameter 1 0 mm phpzc 5 0 indicating the acid nature of its surface that would be positively charged if ph phpzc maximum crvi adsorption capacity 119 mg g at ph 4 0 and 80 of crvi removal efficiency after five cycles of adsorption desorption process the beads also exhibited good stability within the ph range of 1 to 9 where marginal weight loss was observed the presence of mwcnts offered enhanced porosity surface area and supporting functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the electrostatic interactions and the complexation between crvi ions and amine groups incorporated in chitosan worked synergistically in the cs mwcnts fe beads further confirmed by xps analysis the evolution of criii indicates a possible charge transfer effect of feii and or feiii mediated through conductive carbon nanotubes leading to the reduction of crvi ions 19 we further performed packed bed column studies and fitted the breakthrough data with various empirical one phase resistance models such as the thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart models while these empirical models fitted well with the experimental data and provided first level information on the adsorption rate removal capacity and service time of the adsorbent bed they are highly case specific and only account for global mass transfer in addition packed bed column process showed a selective adsorption of crvi ions in the presence of cuii cdii and po4 3 20 see fig s1 for removal mechanism considering the heterogeneous nature of the composite materials for heavy metal ions adsorption one has to hypothesize that the underlying mass transfer steps differ from those well established for homogeneous microporous activated carbon therefore this study aims to elucidate the mass transfer mechanisms involved in packed bed columns loaded with cs mwcnts fe beads to uptake crvi from synthetic solutions specific objectives are i to apply the convection dispersion diffusion model determining the rate limiting mass transport steps including axial dispersion external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion limitations and velocity variations along the fixed bed column specifically we hypothesize that the homogeneous surface diffusion hsdm model would best describe the mass transfer process in this application ii to validate the model using experimentally derived crvi breakthrough curves under the influence of flow rate feed crvi concentration and bed height by optimizing major design parameters such as the axial dispersion and surface diffusion coefficients iii to optimize the column operation by correlating utilization of fractional bed capacity f bcu and axial peclet numbers pe ax at varying experimental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 column breakthrough studies a glass column with an internal diameter of 2 cm and a length of 14 cm was used to conduct continuous adsorption tests under the following experimental conditions volumetric flow rate 1 2 3 and 4 ml min bed height 4 6 and 8 cm inlet crvi concentration 30 50 and 100 mg l throughout these experiments the ph value of 4 was maintained as this was the value achieving the optimal equilibrium adsorption capacity for crvi 19 20 after packing with the cs mwcnts fe beads to a prescribed height the crvi solution of predetermined concentrations and ph were fed to the column using a peristaltic pump eyela mp 2000 japan with specified flow rates in the downward direction the influent and effluent samples collected were analyzed for residual crvi ions using a spectrophotometer t60uv visible spectrophotometer u k at the wavelength of 540 nm with 1 5 diphenylcarbazide as a colorimetric reagent 20 the performance of the fixed bed column can be evaluated in terms of breakthrough behavior determined by plotting c t c 0 ratio of outlet to inlet concentration against time t here eq 1 sets out the expression for percent removal of crvi ions by the adsorption column 1 r q total m total 100 where q total mg and m total mg are the amount of total crvi ions adsorbed in the column and that passed through the column respectively they can be determined using the following equations 2 q total q v 1000 t 0 t t total c 0 c t dt 3 m total c 0 q v t total 1000 where q v is the volumetric flow rate ml min c 0 mg l is the influent concentration and t total min is the total operating time of the column other experimental parameters are breakthrough time t b and saturation time t s herein defined as the time required to reach c t c 0 of 0 05 and 0 95 respectively 2 2 model conceptualization and formulation fig 1 shows the graphical representation of the model and phenomenology of the adsorption process principally we adopted the convection dispersion equation coupled with diffusion and adsorption inside the particles to depict the governing mass transport dynamics of the fixed column mathematically the equation accounts for the effects of key operational parameters such as the superficial flow velocity bed height feed concentration and packing porosity furthermore we conceptualized that surface diffusion dominates the intraparticle mass transfer considering the low particle void fraction exhibited by the cs mwcnts fe composite particles this hypothesis is driven by the particle characteristics with predominantly micropores distributed across a particle where crvi is captured by the rich amine and hydroxyl functions groups of cs and mwcnts pore diffusion which occurs when molecules are migrated from the particle s interior to reach the micro structured surfaces through the bi disperse pore structure of the particles can therefore be neglected the importance of experimental parameters lies in determining the performance of the adsorbent beads in capturing crvi ions however designing a process that merely measures these parameters is inadequate and prediction of breakthrough behavior of the effluent is needed mathematical models can help to explain the kinetics of fixed bed columns and analyze the characteristics of the adsorption breakthrough curve modeling usually describes the mechanisms involved in the mass transfer process and therefore it assists in predicting the overall efficiency of the process which in turn supports the scaling up of the process from laboratory to pilot scale and finally to field applications based on the following assumptions the mathematical model is formulated to explain the transport and removal of crvi in a fixed bed column 1 the system operates in isobaric and isothermal conditions 2 axial dispersion along the longitudinal axis is taken into account and the axial flow is uniform across the cross sectional area of the column 3 sphered shaped adsorbent particles are uniform in size and density and column void fraction remains constant during the adsorption process 4 surface diffusion dominates the intraparticle mass transfer where solid liquid equilibrium is characterized by the langmuir adsorption isotherm 19 5 the physical properties of the adsorbents and liquid phase remain constant 6 the system does not undergo any chemical reaction by applying the liquid phase mass balance i e accumulation output input generation due to mass transfer one can express the one dimensional convection dispersion equation as follows 4 c z t t d l 2 c z t z 2 v s c z t t 1 ε b ε b ρ b q z t t the last term represents the generation term q z t t being the solid mass transfer rate and c z t t being the accumulation term in the column bed in the equation d l m2 s is the axial dispersion coefficient z m is the length of the longitudinal axis of the bed vs m s is the interstitial velocity t h is the time of column operation and ε b is the bed porosity furthermore the last term in eq 4 is related to the mass transfer of crvi ions driven by the concentration gradient across the stagnant boundary layer of the adsorbent particle 5 ρ b q z t t 3 k f r p c z t c z t r r p where k f m s is the film mass transfer coefficient r p m is particle radius and c s mg l is the concentration of crvi ions at the surface of adsorbent particle eq 5 can be substituted into eq 4 to obtain 6 c z t t d l 2 c z t z 2 v s c z t t 1 ε b ε b 3 k f r p c z t c s z t r r p the following initial and boundary conditions were applied to the column inlet and outlet 7a c z t 0 0 7b c z 0 t z v s c z 0 t c 0 d l 7c c z l t z 0 the mass balance equation for concentration profiles inside the adsorbent particle accounting for surface diffusion in the radial direction is given as follows 8 q r t t d s r 2 r r 2 q r t r where d s m2 s is the surface diffusion coefficient and r m is the radial coordinate the corresponding initial and boundary conditions are given as follows 9a q r t 0 0 9b q r r 0 t 0 9c q r 0 t q e 9d ρ b d s q r r r p t 1 ε ε k f c z t c s z t r r p to describe the fluid and solid phase equilibrium at the surface of the adsorbent particle we used the langmuir isotherm expressed in eq 10 and computed in our previous study 19 10 q e k l q max c s 1 k l c s where k l l mg and q max mg g are the equilibrium constant and maximum adsorption capacity respectively the model equations that account for the effects of axial dispersion film diffusion and surface diffusion are generally referred to as the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm previous studies have described the kinetics of fixed bed columns by using numerical models that include external and internal mass transfer limitations with a non ideal plug flow ignoring axial dispersion 2 3 21 23 nonetheless axial dispersion remains a crucial aspect along with the column domain concerning the mass transfer process empirical correlations involving dimensionless numbers such as reynold number re schmidt number sc sherwood number sh and biot number bi are helpful for evaluating the rate limiting steps these dimensionless parameters are given as follows 11 sh 1 09 ε b re 0 33 sc 0 33 for 0 00015 re 55 where r e v s ρ l d p μ and s c μ d m ρ l in which ρ l g l and μ g m s denote to the density and viscosity of liquid phase respectively d m m2 s and d p m denote to the molecular diffusivity of crvi ions and particle diameter respectively the film mass transfer coefficient can be calculated using eq 12 12 k f sh d m d p the breakthrough curves obtained may have a significant effect due to small variations in k f which gives the coefficient of sensitivity analysis with regards to evaluating the sensitivity of film resistance the biot number is applied as follows 13 bi k f d p c 0 2 d s ρ p q 0 where ρ p kg m3 is particle density and q 0 is the adsorbed crvi concentration corresponding to c 0 the biot number determines the influence of intraparticle diffusion compared to mass transfer across a film layer when bi 1 film diffusion dominates the adsorption rate whereas surface diffusion is the major resistance when bi 1 24 numerically solving the model equations eqs 4 10 allows for evaluating the mass transport parameters independently namely the axial dispersion and surface diffusion coefficients by fitting the simulated breakthrough curves with the corresponding experimental curves the order of magnitude of these parameters is highly dependent on adsorption rates and flow conditions geometric parameters such as bed height bed porosity and particle size of the applied adsorbent as well surface diffusivity of the adsorbate by including the axial dispersion term we calculated the axial peclet number pe ax using eq 14 and correlated it with other operational parameters 14 pe ax v s l c d l where l c m is the characteristic length of the column 2 3 numerical solution of the formulated model comsol multiphysics comsol inc version 5 6 was used to solve the model equations numerically we employed the chemical species transport cst module for one dimensional for liquid phase pde and two dimensional for particle phase pde and time dependent study the comsol solver uses the finite element method to discretize the spatial boundaries and adaptive meshing and error control algorithms in the cst module a sub module i e mass transport of diluted species through porous media was adopted to incorporate the convection and diffusion equations within the column domain fig 2 shows a flowchart of the route followed for the simulation process using comsol multiphysics fig 3 illustrates the spatial discretization scheme for implementing the model equations with corresponding initial and boundary conditions the one dimensional geometry of the fixed bed column was first discretized into a set of smaller elements to describe mass transfer by surface diffusion in the radial direction the one dimensional mesh was extruded to a two dimensional mesh for a dimensionless particle radius where the rectangular spatial elements can be observed the convection dispersion equation was used to simulate the distribution of crvi ions in the axial direction of the bed in contrast the diffusion equation was used to estimate the mass transport of crvi ions inside the adsorbent particles using the convection dispersion equation the bulk concentration of crvi ions and the danckwerts boundary condition i e n d c uc z 0 n uc 0 are set at the inlet i e c 0 and convective influx i e n d c 0 at the outlet the reaction term r was substituted for the mass transfer rate of crvi ions at the solid liquid interface as expressed in the last term of eq 6 in addition for the diffusion equation one can assume the following i all solid phase elements were free of initial crvi concentration i e q 0 ii the diffusive flux in the center of the particle followed symmetry i e n d q 0 and iii the diffusive flux at the outer surface followed a boundary condition in eq 9d i e ρ p d s q 1 ε b ε b k f c c s 2 4 model validation to validate the hsdm model the first step was to employ the finite element algorithm solution under various experimental conditions to compute d l and d s by minimizing the objective function as follows 15 1 n c exp c 0 c cal c 0 2 where c exp and c cal mg l are the experimental and calculated crvi concentrations respectively at the outlet of the column and n is the total number of observations the degree of correlation between the computed and the experimental data was evaluated based on the values of coefficient of determination r 2 and the sum of squared error sse the d l values computed through model fitting were compared with the various correlations reported in the literature after validating the model the sensitivity analysis was performed for the different parameters in model equations including mass transfer parameters d l d s k f adsorption parameters q max k l and geometric parameters ε b the other hydrodynamic parameters pe ax re sc sh and bi were not subjected to the sensitivity analysis because they depend on the mass transfer parameters and were measured from empirical correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation table 1 summarizes the numerical values of the key parameters evaluated in the study including the control variables q v l and c 0 the resulting breakthrough properties t b t s and removal the fitted mass transfer parameters d l d s k f and the corresponding dimensionless groups pe ax re sc sh and bi the synchrony between t s and t b reflects the symmetric pattern s shaped of the breakthrough curves both t s and t b values markedly decrease with greater pollutant mass loadings by increasing either the flow rate or the influent concentration evidently the theory of moving mass transfer zone mtz applies in this study when crvi is introduced into a fixed bed column propagating the mtz towards the column outlet at a constant velocity the time difference between breakthrough and saturation t s t b which characterizes the s shaped zone of the breakthrough curve decreases as the inlet crvi concentration and flow rate increases the higher the adsorbate concentration the faster the adsorption sites on the adsorbent are saturated fig 4a c shows that the model and experimental results are well correlated and that the convection dispersion diffusion model applies appropriately to the fixed bed columns packed with cs mwcnts fe beads as manifested by the high values of r 2 0 980 to 0 997 and low sse values 4 93 10 2 to 0 99 10 2 the computed mass transfer parameters namely d l and d s are dependent of the experimental conditions such as flow velocity bed height and feed crvi concentration in contrast the k f value obtained from the empirical correlation changes only with flow velocity suggesting that the mass transfer coefficient depends primarily on the hydrodynamic factors for specific adsorbate adsorbent systems the computed d l values range of 10 8 to 10 7 m2 s as indicated in table 1 as d l is known to be a function of the adsorbent s geometry several theoretical correlations have been used to estimate the dispersion coefficient based on the characteristics and mass transport properties of adsorbents and adsorbates 25 31 details can be found in table s1 among these correlations edward and richardson 25 proposed an empirical expression for estimating d l values relating to molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion 16 d l 0 73 d m 0 5 v s d p 1 9 7 d m v s d p for 0 008 re 50 and 0 377 dp 6 mm this correlation assumes that molecular diffusion dominates at low re values while eddy diffusion dominates at high re values the value of d m can be calculated from the following correlation 32 17 d m 2 74 10 9 m w 1 3 where m w g mol is the molecular weight of the solute the d m value obtained was in the order of 10 9 m2 s consistent with what has been reported in the literature 33 34 the calculated d l values using edward and richardson correlation are within the same range as those obtained by fitting experimental data using hsdm with a valid re ranging from 0 020 to 0 079 table s1 these findings support the model s applicability for predicting the behavior of breakthrough curves and determining the mass transfer parameters in the cs mwcnts packed column the optimal value of d s was found to be in the range of 10 11 to 10 10 m2 s which is slightly higher than those determined in earlier studies using the hsdm see table s2 the changing values of d s with experimental conditions suggest that this parameter is weakly dependent on the fluid solid phase loading this result deviates from the prevailing assumption that the surface diffusion coefficient is a constant for a specific adsorbate adsorption system for instance several researchers reported a constant value of d s in their fluid solid phase systems whose loading conditions affected the external diffusion but not the intraparticle diffusion with the latter identified as the rate controlling step 24 35 43 see table s2 for a comparison of d s values the heterogeneous nature of the adsorbent particles used in this study macro pores on the outer alginate surfaces and meso and micro pores on the chitosan and carbon nanotube surfaces may have precipitated the varying surface diffusion coefficient we will corroborate this argument in the discussion of sensitivity analysis of d s section 3 2 1 3 1 1 breakthrough responding to varying flow rates fig 4a displays the experimental and computed crvi adsorption breakthrough profiles using varying flow rates 1 2 3 and 4 ml min and constant bed height 8 cm and feed crvi concentration 30 mg l the results indicate that mass transfer parameters such as d l k f and d s are a function of the flow velocity the d l increases with flow rate due to local concentration gradients resulting from non homogeneities in liquid phase concentrations it is well established that with increasing flow rates convection dispersion prevails over molecular diffusion 44 however the lower range of re 0 020 to 0 079 signifies that molecular diffusion should also be notable 25 considering the low re values applied in this study and the interrelationship between axial dispersion and molecular diffusion as described in eq 16 the role of axial diffusion in the column mass transfer process needs to be accounted for at lower flow rates molecular diffusion occurs slowly decreasing the column s dispersion significantly as reflected by the increase in pe ax 45 table 1 the k f value calculated based on an empirical correlation increases with flow rates due to the decrease in mass transfer resistance in the film layer 7 consequently the increases in d s value from 7 28 10 11 to 1 74 10 10 m2 s corresponding to the increasing flow rates from 1 to 4 ml min suggests that surface diffusion is not only the rate determining step during the mass transfer process but external film diffusion also plays a significant role this is consistent with the implication of decreasing values of bi with increasing flow rates when its value remains less than unity film diffusion is the major rate controlling step during the mass transfer process especially in the early phase of the breakthrough therefore it can be deduced that if film diffusion is the rate determining step the residence time decreases with increasing flow rates will result in lower crvi removal table 1 3 1 2 breakthrough responding to varying bed heights fig 4b shows the experimental and simulated breakthrough curves of crvi adsorption over the range of 4 to 8 cm in bed height with a constant flow rate 1 ml min and feed crvi concentration 30 mg l the excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves supports the model s suitability under varying bed heights a greater bed height tends to increase pe ax minimizing the axial dispersion 46 thus the column gets saturated earlier with a smaller value of pe ax and the saturation time lengthens as pe ax increases resulting in higher crvi removal table 1 conversely the d s value increases with decreasing bed height indicating an increase in intraparticle resistance this observation can be further supported by the decreasing bi values with bed height suggesting an increased film mass transfer at lower bed height 3 1 3 breakthrough responding to varying influent crvi concentrations fig 4c shows the adsorption and simulated breakthrough curves obtained for varying feed crvi concentrations of 30 to 100 mg l at a constant flow rate 1 ml min and bed height 8 cm with decreasing feed crvi concentrations 100 to 30 mg l the slope of the breakthrough curves decreases this result is attributed to the smaller mass transfer flux from the bulk to the surface of the adsorbent caused by a weaker concentration gradient as the driving force in the film transfer process consequently the assumption of an instantaneous equilibrium following the langmuir isotherms holds the increasing value of bi with feed crvi concentration also indicates a more intense mass transfer at the film layer as compared to the intraparticle mass transfer ultimately resulting in the desorption of crvi ions 7 24 and a decrease in crvi removal 3 2 sensitivity analysis fig 5a f illustrates the sensitivity of the mass transfer and adsorption parameters included in the hsdm the sensitivity analysis was performed by varying one parameter and holding others constant in each simulation the baseline experimental conditions were flow rate 1 ml min bed height 8 cm and influent crvi concentration 30 mg l 3 2 1 mass transfer parameters fig 5a shows that when the d l value was increased from 25 to 90 from its base case t b decreased by about 11 to 24 and t s increased by about 4 resulting in diffuse solute fronts conversely when the d l value was decreased from 25 to 90 the breakthrough curves sharpened increasing t b by 12 to 50 and shortening t s by 4 to 15 the sharpened solute front appeared due to minimum mass transfer resistance and decreasing axial dispersion indicating the maximal utilization of bed capacity however diffuse fronts appeared due to significant mass transfer resistance and increasing axial dispersion resulting in lower bed capacity utilization fig 5b shows that when the d s value was increased from 25 to 90 from the base value the extent by which t s reduced increased by about 4 to 8 conversely decreasing the d s value in the same range led to a significant decrease in the slope of the breakthrough curves and the increase in corresponding t s value however altering d s from the base case did not affect the breakthrough time this result clearly distinguishes the mass transfer process between the applied composite beads and other well established adsorbent materials for instance some researchers determined that altering the d s values from its base value significantly affected the breakthrough point of the curve 3 47 while some showed otherwise and treated surface diffusion as a constant irrespective of experimental conditions 7 24 48 this study determines that with a varying t s value but relatively constant t b value the initial phase of the breakthrough curve experiences minimal surface diffusion resistance in contrast film diffusion at the external boundary layer is a critical rate limiting step this result is consistent with the sensitivity of k f when its value increased from 25 to 90 the incipient t b also increased by 12 fig 5c furthermore we observed that the slope of the curve exhibited a negative correlation with k f i e the slope decreased with increasing k f and vice versa this result revealed that the mass transport was mainly governed by intraparticle diffusion in the latter part of the breakthrough curve while k f controlled the initial breakthrough point 3 2 2 adsorption parameters fig 5d and e shows the sensitivity of the maximum adsorption capacity q max and the langmuir constant k l increasing either of the two parameters by an extent from 25 to 90 of their base values resulted in a change of t s by 3 to 7 while t b remained unchanged contrarily decreasing the values of these parameters resulted in decreasing t b and t s by 12 and 15 respectively evidently both q max and k l are key parameters dictating the prolonged operation of the fixed bed columns fig 4f shows the effect of bed porosity in the column a decrease in bed porosity resulted in a slightly prolonged breakthrough time presumably lowering the bed porosity leads to an increase in the surface area within a confined space by reducing the volume of void fraction in the bed the crvi ions can achieve a longer contact time with the adsorbent particle and result in a longer saturation time 3 3 utilization of fractional bed capacity fig 6a h illustrates the iso concentration contours of crvi along the length of the cs mwcnts fe packed adsorption columns in these plots the crvi concentration near the column inlet x l 0 is equal to c 0 since this segment is quickly saturated with crvi ions the crvi concentration decreases as it propagates along the column and finally reaches zero as crvi ions are completely adsorbed this concentration front moves along the column axis over time notably one can observe the presence of diffuse crvi concentration profiles in response to higher bed height 8 cm and lower solute concentrations those generated by altering either the solute mass 30 mg l or the flow rate 1 ml min fig 6a the slope of the concentration profiles further decreased with increasing feed crvi concentration and flow rate and decreasing bed height fig 6b h additionally each of the concentration profiles travels a different distance in the column during the same interval eventually the column experiences a breakthrough when crvi ions are no longer completely adsorbed leaving a fraction of the bed unused for instance at x l 1 the solute front is stopped upon reaching a concentration of 100 mg l of crvi ions even though a significant fraction of the adsorbent bed has yet been fully equilibrated with the inlet concentration observing the area between the concentration profiles one can identify that the amount of saturated adsorbent varies with feed concentration flow rate and bed height two indicators namely the stoichiometric length and the mtz of the adsorbent bed can effectively characterize the step function behavior of column operations a highly efficient adsorption column should operate under optimized bed utilization by minimizing unused bed portions we herein introduce the concept of fractional bed capacity utilization f bcu given by the following expression 49 18 f bcu 1 0 5 mtz l f bcu allows the column to be optimized for the time it takes to use its maximum length while avoiding the addition of extra length that would otherwise result in a sustained breakthrough however crvi should be transported primarily through convection or axial dispersion during its propagation through the utilized length to investigate this correlation we plotted f bcu versus pe ax as shown in fig 7 the column experiments performed at various flow rates bed heights and feed crvi concentrations lead to the following correlations between pe ax and f bcu 19a f bcu 0 0011 pe ax 0 5306 for 17 8 pe ax 119 8 19b f bcu 0 0008 pe ax 0 5713 for 20 0 pe ax 119 8 19c f bcu 0 0011 pe ax 0 5362 for 7 3 pe ax 119 8 the experiments performed at a low flow rate low re resulted in superior column utilization high f bcu the trend accurately reflected a transition from 1 to 4 ml min re from 0 020 to 0 079 in which an increase in re correlated linearly with a reduction in the value of pe ax and f bcu eq 19a the correlation between f bcu and pe ax under the influence of varying bed height is given in eq 19b due to the significant effect of axial dispersion f bcu decreases with decreasing bed height which results in a linear decrease in pe ax as discussed previously eq 19c shows the correlation between f bcu and pe ax under the influence of feed crvi concentration with an increasing feed crvi concentration from 30 to 100 mg l almost the same portion of f bcu was accounted for in the case of increasing flow rate and decreasing bed height additionally f bcu increases with decreasing the feed crvi concentration from 100 to 30 mg l increasing the concentration from 30 to 100 mg l resulted in a reduced pe ax and an increased inactive zone in the column smaller f bcu we concluded that having high values of f bcu is beneficial to reduce the unused bed which can be achieved by either lowering the flow rate or the feed crvi concentration combined with increasing the bed height of the column 4 conclusions the hsdm model was successfully validated with the experimental breakthrough data of cs mwcnts fe beads for crvi removal from the aqueous solution in fixed bed columns by minimizing the objective function between the experimental and calculated breakthrough profiles the model also allowed the determination of key mass transfer parameters including those describing axial dispersion surface diffusion and film transfer under the influence of flow rates bed height and feed crvi concentrations the resulting axial dispersion coefficient varied in the range between 10 8 and 10 7 m2 s and the diffusion coefficient in the range between 10 11 and 10 10 m2 s both ranges agreed well with those reported in the literature and were a function of the hydrodynamic conditions depicted by the dimensionless pe ax the external film diffusion was deemed a rate limiting step in the initial part of a breakthrough whereas surface diffusion plays a prominent role in the latter part of the breakthrough we further introduced the method of utilization of fractional bed capacity whose correlation with pe ax can characterize the bed utilization efficiency low flow rates low feed crvi concentrations and deeper bed heights improved the

involving convection dispersion and diffusion equations was formulated numerically solved and experimentally validated the high degree of conformity between the calculated and experimental breakthrough curves facilitated the determination of mass transfer parameters including axial dispersion d l 1 30 10 8 to 1 56 10 7 m2 s and surface diffusion d s 7 28 10 11 to 1 80 10 10 m2 s via an error minimizing approach the d l value was a function of molecular diffusion which varied with the flow velocity mass loading and bed height the d s values were slightly higher than those previously reported owing to the heterogeneous nature of the adsorbent the external film diffusion coefficient k f was also determined by using wilson geankoplis empirical correlation which was recognized as a rate controlling factor during crvi mass transfer to the adsorbent beads furthermore sensitivity analysis showed that a transition from diffuse to shock front occurred with a decreasing d l while a decrease in the slope of breakthrough curves was observed by decreasing d s and bed porosity and increasing k f and langmuir parameters lastly the study demonstrated a high correlation between utilization of fractional bed capacity and axial peclet number this method is suitable for optimizing operating conditions to maximize the utilization of a fixed bed columns graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chitosan mwcnts hexavalent chromium fixed bed adsorption hsdm axial dispersion surface diffusion comsol 1 introduction to date activated carbon adsorption remains the most widely used method for removing toxic heavy metal ions from impaired water due to its reliability operational versatility and low cost 1 the development of convection dispersion diffusion models has markedly facilitated the design and prediction of field scale packed bed systems loaded with activated carbon and other materials with high specific surface area 2 3 in a dynamic adsorption process a continuous solute flow passes through a column packed with specific adsorbents a breakthrough curve for the column adsorption process can be calculated from the ratio of metal ions concentrations at outflow and inflow of the column as a function of time the higher specific surface area often combined with appropriate surface charges generally allows such systems to capture heavy metal ions effectively the microporous characteristic of these materials generating their high surface area is also responsible for the rate limiting mass transfer of molecules once they reach the solid surface such mass transfer phenomenon has been conceptually and mathematically described by film transfer surface diffusion and pore diffusion incorporating the various mass transfer mechanisms into the convection dispersion diffusion models has proven effective in delineating the packed bed column breakthrough behaviors 4 9 the recent material advances trend towards modifying functional components by crosslinking and grafting to improve both adsorption performance and regeneration such engineered composite materials aim to either increase adsorption sites or to be selective to a specific contaminant in water matrices when tested either in batch or continuous process for instance researchers have identified several types of materials for uptake of chromium cr and other heavy metal ions with excellent selectivity high uptake capacity and fast adsorption kinetics at low concentrations of metal ions these materials includes chitosan flakes 10 cross linked chitosan iron iii composite 11 iron decorated mwcnts modified with chitosan film 12 chitosan coated carboxylic mwcnts 13 chitosan modified magnetic graphene oxide 14 mwcnts grafted with polypropylene amine 15 amino functionalized graphene oxide 16 tailor made polymer nanoparticles 17 and mesoporous silica functionalized with thiol group 18 the sorbent materials mentioned above have demonstrated excellent adsorption performances however these studies lack the rigor to provide an in depth analysis of detailed adsorption and mass transfer mechanisms and so their results can only be used for case specific projections recently our research group prepared an encapsulated chitosan modified iron oxide carbon nanotubes cs mwcnts fe beads for the uptake of aqueous phase crvi hexavalent chromium the more toxic and mobile state of cr ions as compared to criii trivalent chromium 19 20 the beads were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem coupled energy dispersive

cycles of adsorption desorption process the beads also exhibited good stability within the ph range of 1 to 9 where marginal weight loss was observed the presence of mwcnts offered enhanced porosity surface area and supporting functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the electrostatic interactions and the complexation between crvi ions and amine groups incorporated in chitosan worked synergistically in the cs mwcnts fe beads further confirmed by xps analysis the evolution of criii indicates a possible charge transfer effect of feii and or feiii mediated through conductive carbon nanotubes leading to the reduction of crvi ions 19 we further performed packed bed column studies and fitted the breakthrough data with various empirical one phase resistance models such as the thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart models while these empirical models fitted well with the experimental data and provided first level information on the adsorption rate removal capacity and service time of the adsorbent bed they are highly case specific and only account for global mass transfer in addition packed bed column process showed a selective adsorption of crvi ions in the presence of cuii cdii and po4 3 20 see fig s1 for removal mechanism considering the heterogeneous nature of the composite materials for heavy metal ions adsorption one has to hypothesize that the underlying mass transfer steps differ from those well established for homogeneous microporous activated carbon therefore this study aims to elucidate the mass transfer mechanisms involved in packed bed columns loaded with cs mwcnts fe beads to uptake crvi from synthetic solutions specific objectives are i to apply the convection dispersion diffusion model determining the rate limiting mass transport steps including axial dispersion external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion limitations and velocity variations along the fixed bed column specifically we hypothesize that the homogeneous surface diffusion hsdm model would best describe the mass transfer process in this application ii to validate the model using experimentally derived crvi breakthrough curves under the influence of flow rate feed crvi concentration and bed height by optimizing major design parameters such as the axial dispersion and surface diffusion coefficients iii to optimize the column operation by correlating utilization of fractional bed capacity f bcu and axial peclet numbers pe ax at varying experimental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 column breakthrough studies a glass column with an internal diameter of 2 cm and a length of 14 cm was used to conduct continuous adsorption tests under the following experimental conditions volumetric flow rate 1 2 3 and 4 ml min bed height 4 6 and 8 cm inlet crvi concentration 30 50 and 100 mg l throughout these experiments the ph value of 4 was maintained as this was the value achieving the optimal equilibrium adsorption capacity for crvi 19 20 after packing with the cs mwcnts fe beads to a prescribed height the crvi solution of predetermined concentrations and ph were fed to the column using a peristaltic pump eyela mp 2000 japan with specified flow rates in the downward direction the influent and effluent samples collected were analyzed for residual crvi ions using a spectrophotometer t60uv visible spectrophotometer u k at the wavelength of 540 nm with 1 5 diphenylcarbazide as a colorimetric reagent 20 the performance of the fixed bed column can be evaluated in terms of breakthrough behavior determined by plotting c t c 0 ratio of outlet to inlet concentration against time t here eq 1 sets out the expression for percent removal of crvi ions by the adsorption column 1 r q total m total 100 where q total mg and m total mg are the amount of

breakthrough time t b and saturation time t s herein defined as the time required to reach c t c 0 of 0 05 and 0 95 respectively 2 2 model conceptualization and formulation fig 1 shows the graphical representation of the model and phenomenology of the adsorption process principally we adopted the convection dispersion equation coupled with diffusion and adsorption inside the particles to depict the governing mass transport dynamics of the fixed column mathematically the equation accounts for the effects of key operational parameters such as the superficial flow velocity bed height feed concentration and packing porosity furthermore we conceptualized that surface diffusion dominates the intraparticle mass transfer considering the low particle void fraction exhibited by the cs mwcnts fe composite particles this hypothesis is driven by the particle characteristics with predominantly micropores distributed across a particle where crvi is captured by the rich amine and hydroxyl functions groups of cs and mwcnts pore diffusion which occurs when molecules are migrated from the particle s interior to reach the micro structured surfaces through the bi disperse pore structure of the particles can therefore be neglected the importance of experimental parameters lies in determining the performance of the adsorbent beads in capturing crvi ions however designing a process that merely measures these parameters is inadequate and prediction of breakthrough behavior of the effluent is needed mathematical models can help to explain the kinetics of fixed bed columns and analyze the characteristics of the adsorption breakthrough curve modeling usually describes the mechanisms involved in the mass transfer process and therefore it assists in predicting the overall efficiency of the process which in turn supports the scaling up of the process from laboratory to pilot scale and finally to field applications based on the following assumptions the mathematical model is formulated to explain the transport and removal of crvi in a fixed bed column 1 the system operates in isobaric and isothermal conditions 2 axial dispersion along the longitudinal axis is taken into account and the axial flow is uniform across the cross sectional area of the column 3 sphered shaped adsorbent particles are uniform in size and density and column void fraction remains constant during the adsorption process 4 surface diffusion dominates the intraparticle mass transfer where solid liquid equilibrium is characterized by the langmuir adsorption isotherm 19 5 the physical properties of the adsorbents and liquid phase remain constant 6 the system does not undergo any chemical reaction by applying the liquid phase mass balance i e accumulation output input generation due to mass transfer one can express the one dimensional convection dispersion equation as follows 4 c z t t d l 2 c z t z 2 v s c z t t 1 ε b ε b ρ b q z t t the last term represents the generation term q z t t being the solid mass transfer rate and c z t t being the accumulation term in the column bed in the equation d l m2 s is the axial dispersion coefficient z m is the length of the longitudinal axis of the bed vs m s is the interstitial velocity t h is the time of column operation and ε b is the bed porosity furthermore the last term in eq 4 is related to the mass transfer of crvi ions driven by the concentration gradient across the stagnant boundary layer of the adsorbent particle 5 ρ b q z t t 3 k f r p c z t c z t r r p where k f m s is the film mass transfer coefficient r p m is particle radius and c s mg l is the concentration of crvi ions at the surface of adsorbent particle eq 5 can be substituted into eq 4 to obtain 6 c z t t d l 2 c z t z 2 v s c z t t 1 ε b ε b 3 k f r

for concentration profiles inside the adsorbent particle accounting for surface diffusion in the radial direction is given as follows 8 q r t t d s r 2 r r 2 q r t r where d s m2 s is the surface diffusion coefficient and r m is the radial coordinate the corresponding initial and boundary conditions are given as follows 9a q r t 0 0 9b q r r 0 t 0 9c q r 0 t q e 9d ρ b d s q r r r p t 1 ε ε k f c z t c s z t r r p to describe the fluid and solid phase equilibrium at the surface of the adsorbent particle we used the langmuir isotherm expressed in eq 10 and computed in our previous study 19 10 q e k l q max c s 1 k l c s where k l l mg and q max mg g are the equilibrium constant and maximum adsorption capacity respectively the model equations that account for the effects of axial dispersion film diffusion and surface diffusion are generally referred to as the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm previous studies have described the kinetics of fixed bed columns by using numerical models that include external and internal mass transfer limitations with a non ideal plug flow ignoring axial dispersion 2 3 21 23 nonetheless axial dispersion remains a crucial aspect along with the column domain concerning the mass transfer process empirical correlations involving dimensionless numbers such as reynold number re schmidt number sc sherwood number sh and biot number bi are helpful for evaluating the rate limiting steps these dimensionless parameters are given as follows 11 sh 1 09 ε b re 0 33 sc 0 33 for 0 00015 re 55 where r e v s ρ l d p μ and s c μ d m ρ l in which ρ l g l and μ g m s denote to the density and viscosity of liquid phase respectively d m m2 s and d p m denote to the molecular diffusivity of crvi ions and particle diameter respectively the film mass transfer coefficient can be calculated using eq 12 12 k f sh d m d p the breakthrough curves obtained may have a significant effect due to small variations in k f which gives the coefficient of sensitivity analysis with regards to evaluating the sensitivity of film resistance the biot number is applied as follows 13 bi k f d p c 0 2 d s ρ p q 0 where ρ p kg m3 is particle density and q 0 is the adsorbed crvi concentration corresponding to c 0 the biot number determines the influence of intraparticle diffusion compared to mass transfer across a film layer when bi 1 film diffusion dominates the adsorption rate whereas surface diffusion is the major resistance when bi 1 24 numerically solving the model equations eqs 4 10 allows for evaluating the mass transport parameters independently namely the axial dispersion and surface diffusion coefficients by fitting the simulated breakthrough curves with the corresponding experimental curves the order of magnitude of these parameters is highly dependent on adsorption rates and flow conditions geometric parameters such as bed height bed porosity and particle size of the applied adsorbent as well surface diffusivity of the adsorbate by including the axial dispersion term we calculated the axial peclet number pe ax using eq 14 and correlated it with other operational parameters 14 pe ax v s l c d l where l c m is the characteristic length of the column 2 3 numerical solution of the formulated model comsol multiphysics comsol inc version 5 6 was used to solve the model equations numerically we employed the chemical species transport cst module for one dimensional for liquid phase pde and two dimensional for particle phase pde and time dependent study the comsol solver uses the finite element method to discretize the spatial boundaries and adaptive meshing and error control algorithms in the cst module a sub module i e mass transport of diluted species through porous media was adopted to incorporate the convection and diffusion equations within the column domain fig 2 shows a flowchart of the route followed for the simulation process using comsol multiphysics fig 3 illustrates the spatial discretization scheme for implementing the model equations with corresponding initial and boundary conditions the one dimensional geometry of the fixed bed column was first discretized into a set of smaller elements to describe mass transfer by surface diffusion in the radial direction the one dimensional mesh was extruded to a two dimensional mesh for a dimensionless particle radius where the rectangular spatial elements can be observed the convection dispersion equation was used to simulate the distribution of crvi ions in the axial direction of the bed in contrast the diffusion equation was used to estimate the mass transport of crvi ions inside the adsorbent particles using the convection dispersion equation the bulk concentration of crvi ions and the danckwerts boundary condition i e n d c uc z 0 n uc 0 are set at the inlet i e c 0 and convective influx i e n d c 0 at the outlet the reaction term r was substituted for the mass transfer rate of crvi ions at the solid liquid interface as expressed in the last term of eq 6 in addition for the diffusion equation one can assume the following i all solid phase elements were free of initial crvi concentration i e q 0 ii the diffusive flux in the center of the particle followed symmetry i e n d q 0 and iii the diffusive flux at the outer surface followed a boundary condition in eq 9d i e ρ p d s q 1 ε b ε b k f c c s 2 4 model validation to validate the hsdm model the first step was to employ the finite element algorithm solution under various experimental conditions to compute d l and d s by minimizing the objective function as follows 15 1 n c exp c 0 c cal c 0 2 where c exp and c cal mg l are the experimental and calculated crvi concentrations respectively at the outlet of the column and n is the total number of observations the degree of correlation between the computed and the experimental data was evaluated based on the values of coefficient of determination r 2 and the sum of squared error sse the d l values computed through model fitting were compared with the various correlations reported in the literature after validating the model the sensitivity analysis was performed for the different parameters in model equations including mass transfer parameters d l d s k f adsorption parameters q max k l and geometric parameters ε b the other hydrodynamic parameters pe ax re sc sh and bi were not subjected to the sensitivity analysis because they depend on the mass transfer parameters and were measured from empirical correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation table 1 summarizes the numerical values of the key parameters evaluated in the study including the control variables q v l and c 0 the resulting breakthrough properties t b t s and removal the fitted mass transfer parameters d l d s k f and the corresponding dimensionless groups pe ax re sc sh and bi the synchrony between t s and t b reflects the symmetric pattern s shaped of the breakthrough curves both t s and t b values markedly decrease with greater pollutant mass loadings by increasing either the flow rate or the influent concentration evidently the theory of moving mass transfer zone mtz applies in this study when crvi is introduced into a fixed bed column propagating the mtz towards the column outlet at a constant velocity the time difference between breakthrough and saturation t s t b which characterizes the s shaped zone of the breakthrough curve decreases as the inlet crvi concentration and flow rate increases the higher the adsorbate concentration the faster the adsorption sites on the adsorbent are saturated fig 4a c shows that the model and experimental results are well correlated and that the convection dispersion diffusion model applies appropriately to the fixed bed columns packed with cs mwcnts fe beads as manifested by the high values of r 2 0 980 to 0 997 and low sse values 4 93 10 2 to 0 99 10 2 the computed mass transfer parameters namely d l and d s are dependent of the experimental conditions such as flow velocity bed height and feed crvi concentration in contrast the k f value obtained from the empirical correlation changes only with flow velocity suggesting that the mass transfer coefficient depends primarily on the hydrodynamic factors for specific adsorbate adsorbent systems the computed d l values range of 10 8 to 10 7 m2 s as indicated in table 1 as d l is known to be a function of the adsorbent s geometry several theoretical correlations have been used to estimate the dispersion coefficient based on the characteristics and mass transport properties of adsorbents and adsorbates 25 31 details can be found in table s1 among these correlations edward and richardson 25 proposed an empirical expression for estimating d l values relating to molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion 16 d l 0 73 d m 0 5 v s d p 1 9 7 d m v s d p for 0 008 re 50 and 0 377 dp 6 mm this correlation assumes that molecular diffusion dominates at low re values while eddy diffusion dominates at high re values the value of d m can be calculated from the following correlation 32 17 d m 2 74 10 9 m w 1 3 where m w g mol is the molecular weight of the solute the d m value obtained was in the order of 10 9 m2 s consistent with what has been reported in the literature 33 34 the calculated d l values using edward and richardson correlation are within the same range as those obtained by fitting experimental data using hsdm with a valid re ranging from 0 020 to 0 079 table s1 these findings support the model s applicability for predicting the behavior of breakthrough curves and determining the mass transfer parameters in the cs mwcnts packed column the optimal value of d s was found to be in the range of 10 11 to 10 10 m2 s which is slightly higher than those determined in earlier studies using the hsdm see table s2 the changing values of d s with experimental conditions suggest that this parameter is weakly dependent on the fluid solid phase loading this result deviates from the prevailing assumption that the surface diffusion coefficient is a constant for a specific adsorbate adsorption system for instance several researchers reported a constant value of d s in their fluid solid phase systems whose loading conditions affected the external diffusion but not the intraparticle diffusion with the latter identified as the rate controlling step 24 35 43 see table s2 for a comparison of d s values the heterogeneous nature of the adsorbent particles used in this study macro pores on the outer alginate surfaces and meso and micro pores on the chitosan and carbon nanotube surfaces may have precipitated the varying surface diffusion coefficient we will corroborate this argument in the discussion of sensitivity analysis of d s section 3 2 1 3 1 1 breakthrough responding to varying flow rates fig 4a displays the experimental and computed crvi adsorption breakthrough profiles using varying flow rates 1 2 3 and 4 ml min and constant bed height 8 cm and feed crvi concentration 30 mg l the results indicate that mass transfer parameters such as d l k f and d s are a function of the flow velocity the d l increases with flow rate due to local concentration gradients resulting from non homogeneities in liquid phase concentrations it is well established that with increasing flow rates convection dispersion prevails over molecular diffusion 44 however the lower range of re 0 020 to 0 079 signifies that molecular diffusion should also be notable 25 considering the low re values applied in this study and the interrelationship between axial dispersion and molecular diffusion as described in eq 16 the role of axial diffusion in the column mass transfer process needs to be accounted for at lower flow rates molecular diffusion occurs slowly decreasing the column s dispersion significantly as reflected by the increase in pe ax 45 table 1 the k f value calculated based on an empirical correlation increases with flow rates due to the decrease in mass transfer resistance in the film layer 7 consequently the increases in d s value from 7 28 10 11 to 1 74 10 10 m2 s corresponding to the increasing flow rates from 1 to 4 ml min suggests that surface diffusion is not only the rate determining step during the mass transfer process but external film diffusion also plays a significant role this is consistent with the implication of decreasing values of bi with increasing flow rates when its value remains less than unity film diffusion is the major rate controlling step during the mass transfer process especially in the early phase of the breakthrough therefore it can be deduced that if film diffusion is the rate determining step the residence time decreases with increasing flow rates will result in lower crvi removal table 1 3 1 2 breakthrough responding to varying bed heights fig 4b shows the experimental and simulated breakthrough curves of crvi adsorption over the range of 4 to 8 cm in bed height with a constant flow rate 1 ml min and feed crvi concentration 30 mg l the excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves supports the model s suitability under varying bed heights a greater bed height tends to increase pe ax minimizing the axial dispersion 46 thus the column gets saturated earlier with a smaller value of pe ax and the saturation time lengthens as pe ax increases resulting in higher crvi removal table 1 conversely the d s value increases with decreasing bed height indicating an increase in intraparticle resistance this observation can be further supported by the decreasing bi values with bed height suggesting an increased film mass transfer at lower bed height 3 1 3 breakthrough responding to varying influent crvi concentrations fig 4c shows the adsorption and simulated breakthrough curves obtained for varying feed crvi concentrations of 30 to 100 mg l at a constant flow rate 1 ml min and bed height 8 cm with decreasing feed crvi concentrations 100 to 30 mg l the slope of the breakthrough curves decreases this result is attributed to the smaller mass transfer flux from the bulk to the surface of the adsorbent caused by a weaker concentration gradient as the driving force in the film transfer process consequently the assumption of an instantaneous equilibrium following the langmuir isotherms holds the increasing value of bi with feed crvi concentration also indicates a more intense mass transfer at the film layer as compared to the intraparticle mass transfer ultimately resulting in the desorption of crvi ions 7 24 and a decrease in crvi removal 3 2 sensitivity analysis fig 5a f illustrates the sensitivity of the mass transfer and adsorption parameters included in the hsdm the sensitivity analysis was performed by varying one parameter and holding others constant in each simulation the baseline experimental conditions were flow rate 1 ml min bed height 8 cm and influent crvi concentration 30 mg l 3 2 1 mass transfer parameters fig 5a shows that when the d l value was increased from 25 to 90 from its base case t b decreased by about 11 to 24 and t s increased by about 4 resulting in diffuse solute fronts conversely when the d l value was decreased from 25 to 90 the breakthrough curves sharpened increasing t b by 12 to 50 and shortening t s by 4 to 15 the sharpened solute front appeared due to minimum mass transfer resistance and decreasing axial dispersion indicating the maximal utilization of bed capacity however diffuse fronts appeared due to significant mass transfer resistance and increasing axial dispersion resulting in lower bed capacity utilization fig 5b shows that when the d s value was increased from 25 to 90 from the base value the extent by which t s reduced increased by about 4 to 8 conversely decreasing the d s value in the same range led to a significant decrease in the slope of the breakthrough curves and the increase in corresponding t s value however altering d s from the base case did not affect the breakthrough time this result clearly distinguishes the mass transfer process between the applied composite beads and other well established adsorbent materials for instance some researchers determined that altering the d s values from its base value significantly affected the breakthrough point of the curve 3 47 while some showed otherwise and treated surface diffusion as a constant irrespective of experimental conditions 7 24 48 this study determines that with a varying t s value but relatively constant t b value the initial phase of the breakthrough curve experiences minimal surface diffusion resistance in contrast film diffusion at the external boundary layer is a critical rate limiting step this result is consistent with the sensitivity of k f when its value increased from 25 to 90 the incipient t b also increased by 12 fig 5c furthermore we observed that the slope of the curve exhibited a negative correlation with k f i e the slope decreased with increasing k f and vice versa this result revealed that the mass transport was mainly governed by intraparticle diffusion in the latter part of the breakthrough curve while k f controlled the initial breakthrough point 3 2 2 adsorption parameters fig 5d and e shows the sensitivity of the maximum adsorption capacity q max and the langmuir constant k l increasing either of the two parameters by an extent from 25 to 90 of their base values resulted in a change of t s by 3 to 7 while t b remained unchanged contrarily decreasing the values of these parameters resulted in decreasing t b and t s by 12 and 15 respectively evidently both q max and k l are key parameters dictating the prolonged operation of the fixed bed columns fig 4f shows the effect of bed porosity in the column a decrease in bed porosity resulted in a slightly prolonged breakthrough time presumably lowering the bed porosity leads to an increase in the surface area within a confined space by reducing the volume of void fraction in the bed the crvi ions can achieve a longer contact time with the adsorbent particle and result in a longer saturation time 3 3 utilization of fractional bed capacity fig 6a h illustrates the iso concentration contours of crvi along the length of the cs mwcnts fe packed adsorption columns in these plots the crvi concentration near the column inlet x l 0 is equal to c 0 since this segment is quickly saturated with crvi ions the crvi concentration decreases as it propagates along the column and finally reaches zero as crvi ions are completely adsorbed this concentration front moves along the column axis over time notably one can observe the presence of diffuse crvi concentration profiles in response to higher bed height 8 cm and lower solute concentrations those generated by altering either the solute mass 30 mg l or the flow rate 1 ml min fig 6a the slope of the concentration profiles further decreased with increasing feed crvi concentration and flow rate and decreasing bed height fig 6b h additionally each of the concentration profiles travels a different distance in the column during the same interval eventually the column experiences a breakthrough when crvi ions are no longer completely adsorbed leaving a fraction of the bed unused for instance at x l 1 the solute front is stopped upon reaching a concentration of 100 mg l of crvi ions even though a significant fraction of the adsorbent bed has yet been fully equilibrated with the inlet concentration observing the area between the concentration profiles one can identify that the amount of saturated adsorbent varies with feed concentration flow rate and bed height two indicators namely the stoichiometric length and the mtz of the adsorbent bed can effectively characterize the step function behavior of column operations a highly efficient adsorption column should operate under optimized bed utilization by minimizing unused bed portions we herein introduce the concept of fractional bed capacity utilization f bcu given by the following expression 49 18 f bcu 1 0 5 mtz l f bcu allows the column to be optimized for the time it takes to use its maximum length while avoiding the addition of extra length that would otherwise result in a sustained breakthrough however crvi should be transported primarily through convection or axial dispersion during its propagation through the utilized length to investigate this correlation we plotted f bcu versus pe ax as shown in fig 7 the column experiments performed at various flow rates bed heights and feed crvi concentrations lead to the following correlations between pe ax and f bcu 19a f bcu 0 0011 pe ax 0 5306 for 17 8 pe ax 119 8 19b f bcu 0 0008 pe ax 0 5713 for 20 0 pe ax 119 8 19c f bcu 0 0011 pe ax 0 5362 for 7 3 pe ax 119 8 the experiments performed at a low flow rate low re resulted in superior column utilization high f bcu the trend accurately reflected a transition from 1 to 4 ml min re from 0 020 to 0 079 in which an increase in re correlated linearly with a reduction in the value of pe ax and f bcu eq 19a the correlation between f bcu and pe ax under the influence of varying bed height is given in eq 19b due to the significant effect of axial dispersion f bcu decreases with decreasing bed height which results in a linear decrease in pe ax as discussed previously eq 19c shows the correlation between f bcu and pe ax under the influence of feed crvi concentration with an increasing feed crvi concentration from 30 to 100 mg l almost the same portion of f bcu was accounted for in the case of increasing flow rate and decreasing bed height additionally f bcu increases with decreasing the feed crvi concentration from 100 to 30 mg l increasing the concentration from 30 to 100 mg l resulted in a reduced pe ax and an increased inactive zone in the column smaller f bcu we concluded that having high values of f bcu is beneficial to reduce the unused bed which can be achieved by either lowering the flow rate or the feed crvi concentration combined with increasing the bed height of the column 4 conclusions the hsdm model was successfully validated with the experimental breakthrough data of cs mwcnts fe beads for crvi removal from the aqueous solution in fixed bed columns by minimizing the objective function between the experimental and calculated breakthrough profiles the model also allowed the determination of key mass transfer parameters including those describing axial dispersion surface diffusion and film transfer under the influence of flow rates bed height and feed crvi concentrations the resulting axial dispersion coefficient varied in the range between 10 8 and 10 7 m2 s and the diffusion coefficient in the range between 10 11 and 10 10 m2 s both ranges agreed well with those reported in the literature and were a function of the hydrodynamic conditions depicted by the dimensionless pe ax the external film diffusion was deemed a rate limiting step in the initial part of a breakthrough whereas surface diffusion plays a prominent role in the latter part of the breakthrough we further introduced the method of utilization of fractional bed capacity whose correlation with pe ax can characterize the bed utilization efficiency low flow rates low feed crvi concentrations and deeper bed heights improved the

13119,this study achieved stable nitritation by eliminating both nitrobacter and nitrospira through combing nitrite exposure inhibition with high dissolved oxygen do reactivation after treated by nitrite exposure 5 30 mg l 1 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob of two nitrifying reactors rl and rh was suppressed seriously than ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob with faster activity decay rate 0 035 0 003 d 1 and larger population reduction as well as slower functional gene transcription wherein nitrobacter was inhibited more significantly than nitrospira during reactivation period the rh high do 2 5 3 0 mg l 1 achieved nitritation with high nar of 97 9 which was twice faster than rl low do 0 1 0 6 mg l 1 though temperature declined to 16 6 c rh remained constant nitritation with ideal effluent no2 n nh4 n of 1 1 for anammox further analysis indicated that high do reactivation accelerated aob overcome nob by promoting aob growth but severely inhibited nitrospira the findings provided novel insights into suppressing nob in targeted ways which facilitated mainstream deammonifcation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox nitritation nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrite exposure oxygen control 1 introduction nitritation has been recognized as a promising alternative to reduce aeration and carbon consumption and is one of the crucial prerequisites to the autotrophic nitrogen process combining nitritation and anammox process 1 the critical point to apply partial nitrification is the elimination of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob without seriously affecting ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob 2 to date several strategies have been established to promote aob overcome nob sludge treatment by free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa are two of the most effective strategies 3 notwithstanding owing to the high nitrite or ammonia concentration required by the implementation of fa or fna treatment the nitritation realization in ammonium rich sewage i e landfill leachate anaerobic digester supernatant treatment system was much easier than in domestic sewage treatment system 4 and the complicated procedure of ph and temperature control and operational cost during fa and fna treatment also hurdles their application in mainstream municipal sewage treatment it s been documented that nitrite can impose inhibitory effects on biomass under neutral conditions 5 6 latterly selectively elimination of nob was achieved and realization of nitritation was promoted by pre exposing activated sludge to low concentration of nitrite during domestic sewage treatment 7 which provided another effective strategy that properly adjusted the strength of mainstream sewage however the decay of aob is also inevitable during the sludge treatment through nitrite exposure and how to selectively enrich aob was still unclear 7 therefore selective enrichment of aob in the meantime or after eliminating nob is considered as the most crucial challenge for stable nitritation 8 in addition to fa and fna several factors have been proposed to affect the growth kinetics of aob and nob such as sludge retention time srt do and temperature 9 combining these parameters led to comparatively stable nitritation merely in ammonium rich sewage 8 nevertheless it is hard to exert selective pressures to inhibit nob while still enabling aob to grow 8 due to the relatively lower nitrogen concentration and temperature of mainstream sewage compared to ammonium rich wastewater 10 as an alternative combination strategy low do concentration is commonly recognized as an effective additional selective pressure against nob because the oxygen half saturation constant ko of nob is lower than that of aob 11 however different types of nob exhibit different growth characteristics as two major types of nob population nitrospira can adapt to low do conditions owing to its higher oxygen affinity than nitrobacter thus nitritation might be disrupted by dominant nob genera shift which means effective nitritation establish strategy must wash out either nitrobacter or nitrospira additionally bioactivities of nitrifiers were reported to be inhibited with limited do levels and thus led to the low nar owing to the oxygen competition from heterotrophic organisms consequently it will face more challenges to realize stable nitritation with a limited level of do more importantly some other studies suggested contradicting findings that high levels of do 1 5 mg l 1 also facilitate aob to overcome nob 12 therefore whether low do condition could contribute to the stable nitritation establishment rather than high do condition requires further research this study aimed to establish a promising strategy for stable nitritation realization through a novel combined strategy of nitrite exposure integration with do reactivation control two nitrifying reactors were controlled at two representative do conditions rl low do range from 0 1 to 0 6 mg l 1 rh high do range from 2 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 treating real municipal wastewater under room temperature the influence of nitrite exposure on nitrifiers was first investigated then the effect of two levels of do control on nitrite accumulation and nitrogen removal performance was evaluated finally the abundance and key functional genes of nitrifying bacteria were also studied to shed light on the mechanism of stable nitritation realization the findings concluded here expanded insights of suppressing nob contrapuntally with type distinguish 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up two sbrs were parallel set up with each working volume capacity of 3 l and volume exchange ratio of 50 real municipal sewage was fed in the reactors at room temperature temperature ph and do were monitored and continuously recorded using a multi analyzer wtw company germany during the operation periods the aeration intensity was controlled using gas flowmeter to maintain the do at the required interval during the aeration period 2 2 experimental procedure the nitrifying reactors were operated 114 days and divided into three phases feeding mainstream wastewater obtained from the beijing university of technology the activated sludge was inoculated from gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant wwtp beijing china and separated into rl and rh in phase i days 1 14 complete nitrification was obtained in both reactors with inoculation of nitrifying sludge each cycle consisted of steps of 10 min feeding 1 5 l of municipal wastewater aeration stage the aerobic reaction time was adjusted according to the ammonia oxidation performance 50 min anoxic reaction 50 min setting 10 min decanting and 150 min idle also noteworthy in each aeration phase over the entire operation period the do in rl was controlled around 0 1 to 0 6 mg l 1 while the do in rh was set around 2 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 in phase ii days 15 47 rl and rh were designed into in situ sludge treatment through nitrite exposure during this period the aeration was in the closing state with stirring opening and ph value and the temperature changed freely without artificial control meanwhile rl and rh were kept exposing to nitrite with concentration of 5 to 30 mg l 1 by adding sodium nitrite in phase iii days 48 114 rl and rh were restarted with wastewater feeding with temperature decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c rl in and from 26 7 c to 16 4 c in rh fig s1 both reactors were operated as the same operation way in phase i under their controlled do conditions and during the steady stage of this phase days 84 114 the effluent of the rl and rh were separately fed into two parallel anammox uasb reactors working volume of 4 l and the temperature was controlled at 30 0 5 c the up flow rate of the anammox uasb reactors was 0 517 m h and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 180 min in phase ii days 15 47 rl and rh were designed into in situ sludge treatment through nitrite exposure during this period the aeration was in the closing state with stirring opening and ph value and the temperature changed freely without artificial control meanwhile rl and rh were kept exposing to nitrite with concentration of 5 to 30 mg l 1 by adding sodium nitrite in phase iii days 48 114 rl and rh were restarted with wastewater feeding with temperature decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c rl in and from 26 7 c to 16 4 c in rh fig s1 both reactors were operated as the same operation way in phase i under their controlled do conditions and during the steady stage of this phase days 84 114 the effluent of the rl and rh were separately fed into two parallel anammox uasb reactors working volume of 4 l and the temperature was controlled at 30 0 5 c the up flow rate of the anammox uasb reactors was 0 517 m h and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 180 min all three phases were operated without any sludgy exaction except the ex situ our measurements and the effluent biomass calculated based on these consumptions the average sludge retention time was 36 days 2 3 ex situ batch tests for activity decay and recovery rates during the period of nitrite exposure treatment phase ii six ex situ aerobic batch tests were conducted to assess the nitrification rates for rl and rh the mixed sludge samples 100 ml were regularly taken from each bioreactor to measure nitrification rates and evaluate the decay rates 13 and during reactivation period phase iii the recovery rates of nitrifying activity were evaluated by conducting the consumption of oxygen uptake rate our tests as formulated in 13 2 4 analytical methods and calculations the concentrations of ammonia nitrite nitrate mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured according to the standard methods 14 the abundances of aob amoa and nob nitrobacter and nitrospira were quantified using qpcr to analyze the variations of nitrifiers the dna extraction and qpcr were assessed according to the method described by 4 the abundance of key functional genes in the nitrification process were determined using real time qpcr by the method reported before 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance and achievement of nitritation in phase i nitrifying activated sludge was inoculated and real sewage was treated in rl and rh the ammonia removal efficiency of the two reactors were all above 92 fig 1a with the average ammonium removal rate arr were all around 8 5 g n m 3 h 1 complete nitrification was obtained with average nitrite accumulation rate nar of below 3 5 in both reactors during phase ii in situ sludge treatment through nitrite exposure was performed in rl and rh two reactors were continuously stirred without sewage supplied and the nano2 was intermittently added in two reactors resulting in the nitrite in the range of 5 to 30 mg l 1 in each reactor fig 2a b in phase iii the rl and rh were restarted and fed with domestic sewage the nitrification performance declined and the arr in rl and rh were 3 7 g n m 3 h 1 and 5 2 g n m 3 h 1 respectively these rates were lower than the initial rates before nitrite exposure treatment indicating the repressing effect on nitrifiers then the arr of two reactors were gradually increased to the normal nitrifying level wherein the arr of rl increased to 8 0 g n m 3 h 1 in 6 days and that of rh raised to 8 3 g n m 3 h 1 in 4 days more importantly the initial nar of rl and rh in the recovery period were 10 01 and 35 09 which indicates the more severe inhibition of nitrite oxidation then the nar in rh improved above 90 in 18 days while the nar in rl increased above 90 consumed 28 days these findings show that high do level of rh accelerated its ammonia oxidation rate and accordingly facilitated the achievement of nitritation with high nitrite accumulation afterward though the average temperature of rl and rh decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c and 26 7 c to 16 4 c fig s1 the average nar of rl and rh maintained stable at 96 4 and 97 9 indicating the nitritation remained constant even at low temperature condition furthermore at the steady state of phase iii both reactors achieved stable nitritation with effluent no2 n to nh4 n ratio roughly at 1 1 which is widely known as the ideal molar ratio of no2 n to nh4 n for anammox process 16 therefore the effluent obtained in the current study could be used as the influent with stable nitrite for the mainstream anammox system fig 1b in phase iii the rl and rh were restarted and fed with domestic sewage the nitrification performance declined and the arr in rl and rh were 3 7 g n m 3 h 1 and 5 2 g n m 3 h 1 respectively these rates were lower than the initial rates before nitrite exposure treatment indicating the repressing effect on nitrifiers then the arr of two reactors were gradually increased to the normal nitrifying level wherein the arr of rl increased to 8 0 g n m 3 h 1 in 6 days and that of rh raised to 8 3 g n m 3 h 1 in 4 days more importantly the initial nar of rl and rh in the recovery period were 10 01 and 35 09 which indicates the more severe inhibition of nitrite oxidation then the nar in rh improved above 90 in 18 days while the nar in rl increased above 90 consumed 28 days these findings show that high do level of rh accelerated its ammonia oxidation rate and accordingly facilitated the achievement of nitritation with high nitrite accumulation afterward though the average temperature of rl and rh decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c and 26 7 c to 16 4 c fig s1 the average nar of rl and rh maintained stable at 96 4 and 97 9 indicating the nitritation remained constant even at low temperature condition furthermore at the steady state of phase iii both reactors achieved stable nitritation with effluent no2 n to nh4 n ratio roughly at 1 1 which is widely known as the ideal molar ratio of no2 n to nh4 n for anammox process 16 therefore the effluent obtained in the current study could be used as the influent with stable nitrite for the mainstream anammox system fig 1b 3 2 effect of nitrite exposure treatment on nitrifying bacteria the nitrite exposure treatment has shown different degrees of activity inhibition on nitrifiers thus the activity of nitrifying bacteria in both reactors were decayed on account of the oxidation rates of nh4 n and no2 n during the treatment phase and the fit exponential functions the activity decay rates of aob and nob d aob and d nob in rl during the nitrite exposure treatment period were 0 020 0 005 d 1 and 0 035 0 002 d 1 respectively fig 2c concurrently d aob and d nob in rh were 0 017 0 009 d 1 and 0 034 0 002 d 1 fig 2e the proximity of the decay rates between rl and rh systems demonstrated the commensurate inhibition of in situ sludge treatment nitrite exposure on nitrifying bacteria remarkably the greater d nob indicated that nob was more sensitive to the nitrite exposure which caused the slow oxidation rate of nitrite during the initial recovery period phase iii furthermore before nitrite exposure treatment the population abundance of nob nitrobacter and nitrospira in rl and rh were 4 5 times higher than that of aob amoa fig 3 after the nitrite exposure the absolute abundance of nob in rl and rh were significantly reduced to 1 09 0 03 109 and 1 37 0 11 108 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively conversely the aob absolute abundance in rl and rh were both increased from 3 79 0 27 108 to 3 93 0 10 109 and from 8 22 0 87 108 to 2 57 0 05 109 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively consequently the value of aob aob nob increased from 22 84 3 01 to 78 33 1 88 in rl and increased from 27 57 6 37 to 65 18 4 59 in rh respectively therefore aob became dominant over nob in nitrifying bacteria after the sludge treatment through nitrite exposure with slower activity decay rates and higher abundance in both two reactors which induced the nitrite accumulation while substrate feeding after the reactivation process began to further investigate microbial characteristics of the nitrifying bacteria response to in situ nitrite exposure the transcript levels of key functional genes in the nitrification process were quantified by real time qpcr during the nitrite exposure period phase ii the nitrifying gene transcription decreased gradually to low level in both reactors fig 4a b however the transcription of nxrb gene dropped more significantly and the transcription of amoa gene was 2 61 and 3 71 fold of nxrb gene in rl and rh at the end of phase ii meanwhile the hao gene transcription was were 2 28 and 4 69 fold of nxrb gene in rl and rh respectively fig 4a b this re emphasizes that nitrite exposure could be a fruitful way to inhibit nob not only in aspect of activity decay and population decrease but also on severe inhibition of nxrb gene transcription most notably as two major genera of nob nitrobacter and nitrospira exhibited differently under the nitrite exposure stress after nitrite exposure period the relative abundance of nitrobacter decreased significantly by 0 77 0 09 in rl fig 3a and dropped by 0 61 0 10 in rh fig 3b nevertheless the relative abundance of nitrospira slightly reduced by 0 15 0 09 in rl and 0 04 0 02 in rh fig 3a b these results indicated that nitrite exposure is an effective manner to eliminate nitrobacter while nitrospira are more tolerant to nitrite stress than nitrobacter these results are in agreement with reported studies that nitrospira are adapted to lower concentration of nitrite but nitrobacter are willing to grow in higher nitrite conditions 17 3 3 performance of nitrifying bacteria under low and high do levels during reactivation period after the nitrite exposure the reactors were restarted to normal operation mode with municipal sewage fed phase iii during the reactivation period of this phase the activity of nitrifying bacteria gradually recovered building upon the oxygen uptake rates and the fit exponential functions the recovery rates of aob and nob activity r aob and r nob in rl were 0 029 0 004 d 1 and 0 026 0 005 d 1 fig 2d and r aob and r nob in rh were 0 032 0 006 d 1 and 0 006 0 007 d 1 fig 2f respectively the higher r aob had maximized its activity difference of aob from nob thus led to the gradually increasing nar in the recovery period moreover the high do condition in rh resulted in a higher activity rate than that in rl which suggests that high do level accelerated the reactivation of aob compared with low do level moreover at the last stage of phase iii the aob gene copies of rl and rh increased to 4 11 0 00 109 5 42 0 04 109 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively fig 3a b however the absolute abundance of nob in rl and rh decreased to 5 81 0 51 108 1 24 0 58 108 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively fig 3a b therefore the aob aob nob ratio in rl and rh reached the maximum value of 87 60 5 15 and 95 75 3 96 fig 3a b respectively these results showed that the aob population was dominant in nitrifiers within nob population gradually eliminated most importantly the amoa and hao mrna in rl and rh increased to a high level in 7 days while the nxrb mrna responded much slower in both reactors this illustrated that the transcription of nxrb gene recovered with requirements of longer time than amoa and hao gene fig 4a b in addition the operation under high do level in rh caused a further distinctly reduction in the relative abundance of nitrospira from 0 92 0 15 to 0 02 0 01 while that of aob increased markedly from 1 95 0 04 to 4 86 0 01 in comparison that of aob in rl raised from 3 18 0 02 to 4 47 0 05 but that of nitrospira slightly decreased from 0 61 0 42 to 0 59 0 17 meanwhile the transcriptions of amoa and hao in rh were higher than that in rl fig 4a b but the transcription of nxrb gene in rh was lower than that in rl this sufficiently indicates that high do reactivation could offer total supremacy for aob over nitrospira when the reactor re operated after the inhibition treatment through nitrite exposure furthermore nitrosomonas was the main aob genus detected by high throughput sequencing analysis in current study fig 4c therefore the findings above are consistent with the resource ratio theory that nitrospira are k strategists grow slowly with slower reaction rates and prefer lower substrates i e low do conditions while nitrosomonas are categorized as r strategists grow quickly with high concentration of substrates 18 the other genera with high abundances most were heterotrophic bacteria which is known to have heterotrophic denitrification capability while using organic compounds as electron donors 19 such as genera of thauera denitratisoma unclassified f comamonadaceae and ottowia 20 fig 4c the increase of those genera strengthens the competition for do during aeration period which might promote aob within a competitive advantage over nob under oxygen limited conditions 21 in conclusion stable nitritation for mainstream sewage treatment was achieved through the combined effect of nitrite exposure and do control faster achieved under high do reactivation than under low do reactivation nitrite exposure was primarily responsible for the washout of nitrobacter whereas high do reactivation promoted rapid growth of aob and further eliminated the nitrospira thus widened the disparity of aob and nob in the aspects of activity and population abundance a swell as transcription of functional genes 3 4 potential applications of the findings from this study nowadays several nitritation anammox processes have been successfully applied to industrial wastewater and sidestream municipal sewage treatment driven by energy positive of wwtps nevertheless there are still great significance and tremendous need to broadly apply efficient technologies in the treatment of mainstream wastewater the novel combined strategy presented in the current study successfully removed one of the critical barriers in mainstream anammox treatment stable nitritation with many qualities in practical implementation the proposed strategy is more energy efficient with a low concentration of nitrite and without ph adjustment and the combination of do control is much convenient and could effectively reduce the sludge treatment frequency also worth noting is that the combined strategy with nitrite exposure and high do reactivation obtained stable nitritation with effluent no2 n to nh4 n ratio roughly at 1 1 which is very suitable for anammox process moreover the temperature of the reactors in current study fluctuated with the season and the

13119,this study achieved stable nitritation by eliminating both nitrobacter and nitrospira through combing nitrite exposure inhibition with high dissolved oxygen do reactivation after treated by nitrite exposure 5 30 mg l 1 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob of two nitrifying reactors rl and rh was suppressed seriously than ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob with faster activity decay rate 0 035 0 003 d 1 and larger population reduction as well as slower functional gene transcription wherein nitrobacter was inhibited more significantly than nitrospira during reactivation period the rh high do 2 5 3 0 mg l 1 achieved nitritation with high nar of 97 9 which was twice faster than rl low do 0 1 0 6 mg l 1 though temperature declined to 16 6 c rh remained constant nitritation with ideal effluent no2 n nh4 n of 1 1 for anammox further analysis indicated that high do reactivation accelerated aob overcome nob by promoting aob growth but severely inhibited nitrospira the findings provided novel insights into suppressing nob in targeted ways which facilitated mainstream deammonifcation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox nitritation nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrite exposure oxygen control 1 introduction nitritation has been recognized as a promising alternative to reduce aeration and carbon consumption and is one of the crucial prerequisites to the autotrophic nitrogen process combining nitritation and anammox process 1 the critical point to apply partial nitrification is the elimination of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob without seriously affecting ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob 2 to date several strategies have been established to promote aob overcome nob sludge treatment by free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa are two of the most effective strategies 3 notwithstanding owing to the high nitrite or ammonia concentration required by the implementation of fa or fna treatment the nitritation realization in ammonium rich sewage i e landfill leachate anaerobic digester supernatant treatment system was much easier than in domestic sewage treatment system 4 and the complicated procedure of ph and temperature control and operational cost during fa and fna treatment also hurdles their application in mainstream municipal sewage treatment it s been documented that nitrite can impose inhibitory effects on biomass under neutral conditions 5 6 latterly selectively elimination of nob was achieved and realization of nitritation was promoted by pre exposing activated sludge to low concentration of nitrite during domestic sewage treatment 7 which provided another effective strategy that properly adjusted the strength of mainstream sewage however the decay of aob is also inevitable during the sludge treatment through nitrite exposure and how to selectively enrich aob was still unclear 7 therefore selective enrichment of aob in the meantime or after eliminating nob is considered as the most crucial challenge for stable nitritation 8 in addition to fa and fna several factors have been proposed to affect the growth kinetics of aob and nob such as sludge retention time srt do and temperature 9 combining these parameters led to comparatively stable nitritation merely in ammonium rich sewage 8 nevertheless it is hard to exert selective pressures to inhibit nob while still enabling aob to grow 8 due to the relatively lower nitrogen concentration and temperature of mainstream sewage compared to ammonium rich wastewater 10 as an alternative combination strategy low do concentration is commonly recognized as an effective additional selective pressure against nob because the oxygen half saturation constant ko of nob is lower than that of aob 11 however different types of nob exhibit different growth characteristics as two major types of nob population nitrospira can adapt to low do conditions owing to its higher oxygen affinity than nitrobacter thus nitritation might be disrupted by dominant nob genera shift which means effective nitritation establish strategy must wash out either nitrobacter or nitrospira additionally bioactivities of nitrifiers were reported to be inhibited with limited do levels and thus led to the low nar owing to the oxygen competition from heterotrophic organisms consequently it will face more challenges to realize stable nitritation with a limited level of do more importantly some other studies suggested contradicting findings that high levels of do 1 5 mg l 1 also facilitate aob to overcome nob 12 therefore whether low do condition could contribute to the stable nitritation establishment rather than high do condition requires further research this study aimed to establish a promising strategy for stable nitritation realization through a novel combined strategy of nitrite exposure integration with do reactivation control two nitrifying reactors were controlled at two representative do conditions rl low do range from 0 1 to 0 6 mg l 1 rh high do range from 2 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 treating real municipal wastewater under room temperature the influence of nitrite exposure on nitrifiers was first investigated then the effect of two levels of do control on nitrite accumulation and nitrogen removal performance was evaluated finally the abundance and key functional genes of nitrifying bacteria were also studied to shed light on the mechanism of stable nitritation realization the findings concluded here expanded insights of suppressing nob contrapuntally with type distinguish 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up two sbrs were parallel set up with each working volume capacity of 3 l and volume exchange ratio of 50 real municipal sewage was fed in the reactors at room temperature temperature ph and do were monitored and continuously recorded using a multi analyzer wtw company germany during the operation periods the aeration intensity was controlled using gas flowmeter to maintain the do at the required interval during the aeration period 2 2 experimental procedure the nitrifying reactors were operated 114 days and divided into three phases feeding mainstream wastewater obtained from the beijing university of technology the activated sludge was inoculated from gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant wwtp beijing china and separated into rl and rh in phase i days 1 14 complete nitrification was obtained in both reactors with inoculation of nitrifying sludge each cycle consisted of steps of 10 min feeding 1 5 l of municipal wastewater aeration stage the aerobic reaction time was adjusted according to the ammonia oxidation performance 50 min anoxic reaction 50 min setting 10 min decanting and 150 min idle also noteworthy in each aeration phase over the entire operation period the do in rl was controlled around 0 1 to 0 6 mg l 1 while the do in rh was set around 2 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 in phase ii days 15 47 rl and rh were designed into in situ sludge treatment through nitrite exposure during this period the aeration was in the closing state with stirring opening and ph value and the temperature changed freely without artificial control meanwhile rl and rh were kept exposing to nitrite with concentration of 5 to 30 mg l 1 by adding sodium nitrite in phase iii days 48 114 rl and rh were restarted with wastewater feeding with temperature decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c rl in and from 26 7 c to 16 4 c in rh fig s1 both reactors were operated as the same operation way in phase i under their controlled do conditions and during the steady stage of this phase days 84 114 the effluent of the rl and rh were separately fed into two parallel anammox uasb reactors working volume of 4 l and the temperature was controlled at 30 0 5 c the up flow rate of the anammox uasb reactors was 0 517 m h and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 180 min in phase ii days 15 47 rl and rh were designed into in situ sludge treatment through nitrite exposure during this period the aeration was in the closing state with stirring opening and ph value and the temperature changed freely without artificial control meanwhile rl and rh were kept exposing to nitrite with concentration of 5 to 30 mg l 1 by adding sodium nitrite in phase iii days 48 114 rl and rh were restarted with wastewater feeding with temperature decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c rl in and from 26 7 c to 16 4 c in rh fig s1 both reactors were operated as the same operation way in phase i under their controlled do conditions and during the steady stage of this phase days 84 114 the effluent of the rl and rh were separately fed into two parallel anammox uasb reactors working volume of 4 l and the temperature was controlled at 30 0 5 c the up flow rate of the anammox uasb reactors was 0 517 m h and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 180 min all three phases were operated without any sludgy exaction except the ex situ our measurements and the effluent biomass calculated based on these consumptions the average sludge retention time was 36 days 2 3 ex situ batch tests for activity decay and recovery rates during the period of nitrite exposure treatment phase ii six ex situ aerobic batch tests were conducted to assess the nitrification rates for rl and rh the mixed sludge samples 100 ml were regularly taken from each bioreactor to measure nitrification rates and evaluate the decay rates 13 and during reactivation period phase iii the recovery rates of nitrifying activity were evaluated by conducting the consumption of oxygen uptake rate our tests as formulated in 13 2 4 analytical methods and calculations the concentrations of ammonia nitrite nitrate mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured according to the standard methods 14 the abundances of aob amoa and nob nitrobacter and nitrospira were quantified using qpcr to analyze the variations of nitrifiers the dna extraction and qpcr were assessed according to the method described by 4 the abundance of key functional genes in the nitrification process were determined using real time qpcr by the method reported before 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance and achievement of nitritation in phase i nitrifying activated sludge was inoculated and real sewage was treated in rl and rh the ammonia removal efficiency of the two reactors were all above 92 fig 1a with the average ammonium removal rate arr were all around 8 5 g n m 3 h 1 complete nitrification was obtained with average nitrite accumulation rate nar of below 3 5 in both reactors during phase ii in situ sludge treatment through nitrite exposure was performed in rl and rh two reactors were continuously stirred without sewage supplied and the nano2 was intermittently added in two reactors resulting in the nitrite in the range of 5 to 30 mg l 1 in each reactor fig 2a b in phase iii the rl and rh were restarted and fed with domestic sewage the nitrification performance declined and the arr in rl and rh were 3 7 g n m 3 h 1 and 5 2 g n m 3 h 1 respectively these rates were lower than the initial rates before nitrite exposure treatment indicating the repressing effect on nitrifiers then the arr of two reactors were gradually increased to the normal nitrifying level wherein the arr of rl increased to 8 0 g n m 3 h 1 in 6 days and that of rh raised to 8 3 g n m 3 h 1 in 4 days more importantly the initial nar of rl and rh in the recovery period were 10 01 and 35 09 which indicates the more severe inhibition of nitrite oxidation then the nar in rh improved above 90 in 18 days while the nar in rl increased above 90 consumed 28 days these findings show that high do level of rh accelerated its ammonia oxidation rate and accordingly facilitated the achievement of nitritation with high nitrite accumulation afterward though the average temperature of rl and rh decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c and 26 7 c to 16 4 c fig s1 the average nar of rl and rh maintained stable at 96 4 and 97 9 indicating the nitritation remained constant even at low temperature condition furthermore at the steady state of phase iii both reactors achieved stable nitritation with effluent no2 n to nh4 n ratio roughly at 1 1 which is widely known as the ideal molar ratio of no2 n to nh4 n for anammox process 16 therefore the effluent obtained in the current study could be used as the influent with stable nitrite for the mainstream anammox system fig 1b in phase iii the rl and rh were restarted and fed with domestic sewage the nitrification performance declined and the arr in rl and rh were 3 7 g n m 3 h 1 and 5 2 g n m 3 h 1 respectively these rates were lower than the initial rates before nitrite exposure treatment indicating the repressing effect on nitrifiers then the arr of two reactors were gradually increased to the normal nitrifying level wherein the arr of rl increased to 8 0 g n m 3 h 1 in 6 days and that of rh raised to 8 3 g n m 3 h 1 in 4 days more importantly the initial nar of rl and rh in the recovery period were 10 01 and 35 09 which indicates the more severe inhibition of nitrite oxidation then the nar in rh improved above 90 in 18 days while the nar in rl increased above 90 consumed 28 days these findings show that high do level of rh accelerated its ammonia oxidation rate and accordingly facilitated the achievement of nitritation with high nitrite accumulation afterward though the average temperature of rl and rh decreased from 26 6 c to 16 6 c and 26 7 c to 16 4 c fig s1 the average nar of rl and rh maintained stable at 96 4 and 97 9 indicating the nitritation remained constant even at low temperature condition furthermore at the steady state of phase iii both reactors achieved stable nitritation with effluent no2 n to nh4 n ratio roughly at 1 1 which is widely known as the ideal molar ratio of no2 n to nh4 n for anammox process 16 therefore the effluent obtained in the current study could be used as the influent with stable nitrite for the mainstream anammox system fig 1b 3 2 effect of nitrite exposure treatment on nitrifying bacteria the nitrite exposure treatment has shown different degrees of activity inhibition on nitrifiers thus the activity of nitrifying bacteria in both reactors were decayed on account of the oxidation rates of nh4 n and no2 n during the treatment phase and the fit exponential functions the activity decay rates of aob and nob d aob and d nob in rl during the nitrite exposure treatment period were 0 020 0 005 d 1 and 0 035 0 002 d 1 respectively fig 2c concurrently d aob and d nob in rh were 0 017 0 009 d 1 and 0 034 0 002 d 1 fig 2e the proximity of the decay rates between rl and rh systems demonstrated the commensurate inhibition of in situ sludge treatment nitrite exposure on nitrifying bacteria remarkably the greater d nob indicated that nob was more sensitive to the nitrite exposure which caused the slow oxidation rate of nitrite during the initial recovery period phase iii furthermore before nitrite exposure treatment the population abundance of nob nitrobacter and nitrospira in rl and rh were 4 5 times higher than that of aob amoa fig 3 after the nitrite exposure the absolute abundance of nob in rl and rh were significantly reduced to 1 09 0 03 109 and 1 37 0 11 108 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively conversely the aob absolute abundance in rl and rh were both increased from 3 79 0 27 108 to 3 93 0 10 109 and from 8 22 0 87 108 to 2 57 0 05 109 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively consequently the value of aob aob nob increased from 22 84 3 01 to 78 33 1 88 in rl and increased from 27 57 6 37 to 65 18 4 59 in rh respectively therefore aob became dominant over nob in nitrifying bacteria after the sludge treatment through nitrite exposure with slower activity decay rates and higher abundance in both two reactors which induced the nitrite accumulation while substrate feeding after the reactivation process began to further investigate microbial characteristics of the nitrifying bacteria response to in situ nitrite exposure the transcript levels of key functional genes in the nitrification process were quantified by real time qpcr during the nitrite exposure period phase ii the nitrifying gene transcription decreased gradually to low level in both reactors fig 4a b however the transcription of nxrb gene dropped more significantly and the transcription of amoa gene was 2 61 and 3 71 fold of nxrb gene in rl and rh at the end of phase ii meanwhile the hao gene transcription was were 2 28 and 4 69 fold of nxrb gene in rl and rh respectively fig 4a b this re emphasizes that nitrite exposure could be a fruitful way to inhibit nob not only in aspect of activity decay and population decrease but also on severe inhibition of nxrb gene transcription most notably as two major genera of nob nitrobacter and nitrospira exhibited differently under the nitrite exposure stress after nitrite exposure period the relative abundance of nitrobacter decreased significantly by 0 77 0 09 in rl fig 3a and dropped by 0 61 0 10 in rh fig 3b nevertheless the relative abundance of nitrospira slightly reduced by 0 15 0 09 in rl and 0 04 0 02 in rh fig 3a b these results indicated that nitrite exposure is an effective manner to eliminate nitrobacter while nitrospira are more tolerant to nitrite stress than nitrobacter these results are in agreement with reported studies that nitrospira are adapted to lower concentration of nitrite but nitrobacter are willing to grow in higher nitrite conditions 17 3 3 performance of nitrifying bacteria under low and high do levels during reactivation period after the nitrite exposure the reactors were restarted to normal operation mode with municipal sewage fed phase iii during the reactivation period of this phase the activity of nitrifying bacteria gradually recovered building upon the oxygen uptake rates and the fit exponential functions the recovery rates of aob and nob activity r aob and r nob in rl were 0 029 0 004 d 1 and 0 026 0 005 d 1 fig 2d and r aob and r nob in rh were 0 032 0 006 d 1 and 0 006 0 007 d 1 fig 2f respectively the higher r aob had maximized its activity difference of aob from nob thus led to the gradually increasing nar in the recovery period moreover the high do condition in rh resulted in a higher activity rate than that in rl which suggests that high do level accelerated the reactivation of aob compared with low do level moreover at the last stage of phase iii the aob gene copies of rl and rh increased to 4 11 0 00 109 5 42 0 04 109 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively fig 3a b however the absolute abundance of nob in rl and rh decreased to 5 81 0 51 108 1 24 0 58 108 gene copies g 1 mlss respectively fig 3a b therefore the aob aob nob ratio in rl and rh reached the maximum value of 87 60 5 15 and 95 75 3 96 fig 3a b respectively these results showed that the aob population was dominant in nitrifiers within nob population gradually eliminated most importantly the amoa and hao mrna in rl and rh increased to a high level in 7 days while the nxrb mrna responded much slower in both reactors this illustrated that the transcription of nxrb gene recovered with requirements of longer time than amoa and hao gene fig 4a b in addition the operation under high do level in rh caused a further distinctly reduction in the relative abundance of nitrospira from 0 92 0 15 to 0 02 0 01 while that of aob increased markedly from 1 95 0 04 to 4 86 0 01 in comparison that of aob in rl raised from 3 18 0 02 to 4 47 0 05 but that of nitrospira slightly decreased from 0 61 0 42 to 0 59 0 17 meanwhile the transcriptions of amoa and hao in rh were higher than that in rl fig 4a b but the transcription of nxrb gene in rh was lower than that in rl this sufficiently indicates that high do reactivation could offer total supremacy for aob over nitrospira when the reactor re operated after the inhibition treatment through nitrite exposure furthermore nitrosomonas was the main aob genus detected by high throughput sequencing analysis in current study fig 4c therefore the findings above are consistent with the resource ratio theory that nitrospira are k strategists grow slowly with slower reaction rates and prefer lower substrates i e low do conditions while nitrosomonas are categorized as r strategists grow quickly with high concentration of substrates 18 the other genera with high abundances most were heterotrophic bacteria which is known to have heterotrophic denitrification capability while using organic compounds as electron donors 19 such as genera of thauera denitratisoma unclassified f comamonadaceae and ottowia 20 fig 4c the increase of those genera strengthens the competition for do during aeration period which might promote aob within a competitive advantage over nob under oxygen limited conditions 21 in conclusion stable nitritation for mainstream sewage treatment was achieved through the combined effect of nitrite exposure and do control faster achieved under high do reactivation than under low do reactivation nitrite exposure was primarily responsible for the washout of nitrobacter whereas high do reactivation promoted rapid growth of aob and further eliminated the nitrospira thus widened the disparity of aob and nob in the aspects of activity and population abundance a swell as transcription of functional genes 3 4 potential applications of the findings from this study nowadays several nitritation anammox processes have been successfully applied to industrial wastewater and sidestream municipal sewage treatment driven by energy positive of wwtps nevertheless there are still great significance and tremendous need to broadly apply efficient technologies in the treatment of mainstream wastewater the novel combined strategy presented in the current study successfully removed one of the critical barriers in mainstream anammox treatment stable nitritation with many qualities in practical implementation the proposed strategy is more energy efficient with a low concentration of nitrite and without ph adjustment and the combination of do control is much convenient and could effectively reduce the sludge treatment frequency also worth noting is that the combined strategy with nitrite exposure and high do reactivation obtained stable nitritation with effluent no2 n to nh4 n ratio roughly at 1 1 which is very suitable for anammox process moreover the temperature of the reactors in current study fluctuated with the season and the nitrite accumulation maintained stable even at low temperatures therefore stable nitritation can be achieved even with temperature fluctuates with seasons in addition different types of aob and nob characterize various microbial characteristics and growth kinetics targeted measures i e high throughput sequencing analysis could be taken immediately to confirm the specific kinds of aob and nob thus the specially designated strategy could be used to realize or maintain the superiority of aob in both high or low strength sewage treatment 4 conclusions this study reported a novel combined strategy of nitrite exposure 5 30 mg l 1 inhibition and high do 2 5 3 0 mg l 1 reactivation to rapidly achieve low strength wastewater nitritation by eliminating both nitrobacter and nitrospira stable nitritation with high nar above 97 was obtained even temperature declined to 16 6 c further analysis indicated that nitrite exposure inhibited nob more seriously than aob with higher activity and population decay and slower functional gene transcription and nitrite exposure treatment suppressed nitrobacter to more significantly than nitrospira while high do reactivation promoted aob but further inhibited nitrospira to a serve extent accelerating the rapid achievement of stable nitritation the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 the cod removal
