18490,plastic particle ingestion has become of concern as a possible threat to human health previous works have already explored the presence of microplastic mp in bottled drinking water as a source of mp intake here we consider the release of mp particles from single use pet mineral water bottles upon exposure to mechanical stress utilizing sem plus eds which allows the implementation of morphological and elemental analysis of the plastic material surface and quantification of particle concentrations in sample water the aim of this study was to better evaluate the sources of mp intake from plastic bottles especially considering the effect of daily use on these bottles such as the abrasion of the plastic material for that we analysed mp release of pet bottlenecks and hdpe caps on their surfaces after a series of bottle openings closings 1 x 10 x 100 x furthermore we investigated if the inner surface of the pet bottles released mps counted particle increase of the water and identified mps in the pet bottled water after exposing the bottles to mechanical stress squeezing treatment none 1 min 10 min the results showed a considerable increase of mp particle occurrence on the surface of pet and hdpe material bottlenecks and caps after opening and closing the bottles after 100 times the effect was impressive especially on caps moreover great differences exist in cap abrasion between brands which uncovers a discrepancy in plastic behavior of brands interestingly particle concentrations in the bottled mineral water did not significantly increase after exposure to mechanical stress squeezing treatment the morphological analysis of the inner wall surface of the bottles supported this observation as no stress cracks could be detected after the treatment implying that the bottles itself are not a consistent source of mp particles after this extent of mechanical stress however chances of mp ingestion by humans increase with frequent use of the same single use plastic bottle though only from the bottleneck cap system graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic sources drinking water scanning electron microscopy water bottles plastic degradation

poly vinyl chloride sem scanning electron microscopy 1 introduction microplastic mp contamination of food and drinking water is a topical area of plastic pollution investigations triggered by the numerous studies on mp occurrence in our environment and reinforced by the detection of mps in human stool liebmann et al 2018 plastic pollution has become of concern as potential threat to human health too sources of mp ingestion by humans have already been discussed in several studies bouwmeester et al 2015 galloway 2015 lehner et al 2019 schirinzi et al 2017 wright and kelly 2017 moreover the recent studies by mason et al 2018 ossmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 zuccarello et al 2019 attracted the attention of researchers and the general public as they confirmed the presence of mps in bottled drinking water reported particle concentrations differ substantially among these studies due to the application of different methods of sampling isolating purifying and identifying mps which vary greatly among studies moreover koelmans et al 2019 questions the quality of occurrence studies and highlights the need for a standardization of mp analysis improvement of quality assurance the most produced types of plastic worldwide are used for packaging and they are polyethylene pe mainly in its low density form ldpe bin bags plastic wraps shopping bags and high density form hdpe shopping bags bottle caps detergent bottles polypropylene pp yoghurt packaging straws semi rigid containers polystyrene ps foamed food containers plastic cutlery polyvinyl chloride pvc toys pipes and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles food trays the essential compounds of plastics are chains of monomers mostly deriving from non renewable fossil fuel which are molecules capable of combining to form a polymer unep 2016 to alter the physico chemical properties of the polymers such as flame resistance colour plasticity viscosity and lubricity other chemicals e g bisphenol a phthalate fatty acids can be added to the polymer itself hammer et al 2012 some of the chemical additives as well as some monomers used for the synthesis of polymers are classified as hazardous to human health and the environment in fact when released through use and degradation of plastic products they can be mutagenic and or carcinogenic or act as endocrine disruptors lithner et al 2011 however very little information is available on the toxic potential of mps and their additives which strongly depends on size and shape of the plastic particles and dose of the released chemical additives waring et al 2018 considering the potential harmful effects of mps there is a significant need to better understand possible sources of mp intake to assess quantities and risks related to their properties indeed reports focusing on mps in bottled mineral water are very scarce and the reported works have explored solely the presence of mps in the bottled water here we considered also the release of mp particles wear particles and fragments from breakage of single use water bottles upon exposure to mechanical stress utilizing scanning electron microscopy sem in conjunction with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds while eds provided spectra revealing the elemental compositions of particles sem images were used to quantify detected particles and to morphologically examine all the bottle components furthermore we implemented an additive analysis on hdpe caps of the three brands by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to determine the lubricant substances and their corresponding concentrations the final goal of the present study was to better evaluate single use plastic bottles as one of proven sources of mp intake by humans especially considering the effects of daily use on these bottles such as the abrasion of the plastic material for that we 1 analysed mp release of pet bottlenecks and hdpe caps on their surfaces after a series of bottle openings closings 2 performed a morphological analysis of the pet bottle inner wall surface after a squeezing crushing treatment and 3 subsequently counted particle increase and identified mps in the pet bottled water 2 material and methods 2 1 sample material and preparation for the analysis of particle release from bottle material upon exposure to mechanical stress three different mineral water bottles 0 5 l were chosen based on the bottle texture plastic thickness and hence bottle weight generally sparkling and not sparkling water are associated with heavier and lighter bottles respectively with thickness weight differences among brands we selected three brands representative for light medium and heavy bottles to test their reaction to mechanical stress mineral water bottles of the selected brands were purchased in italian supermarkets in a set of 6 in order to have replicates within the same lot of bottles all samples were single use bottles made of pet with screw caps made of hdpe the water types and bottle net weights without cap and label were natural water in 9 61 g bottles brand 1 sparkling water in 12 03 g bottles brand 2 and sparkling water in 16 03 g bottles brand 3 cap weights of respective brands were 1 15 g 1 27 g and 1 78 g for brand 1 2 3 respectively by including different bottle and cap net weights the effect of flexibility of pet and hdpe material could be taken into consideration a complete scheme of the experimental plan which includes bottleneck and cap analyses section 2 1 1 bottle water and bottle inner wall surface analyses section 2 1 2 is shown in fig 1 images of the bottles of the three brands after mechanical stress are presented in supporting information s1 2 1 1 bottlenecks and caps mp particle release from bottleneck and cap material from the three brands was studied after an opening and closing procedure three treatments were implemented for the first one bottles were opened only once in order to analyse bottleneck and cap from the inside for the second treatment bottles were opened closed 10 times and for the third one 100 times with 1 min pause every 20 times the treatments were applied on a second set of bottles from each brand to obtain a true replicate for each treatment and bottle brand while the same treatment on bottles of different brands represented pseudo replicates for the applied treatment particular emphasis was laid on using the same pressure same operators and pressure point when turning the caps this section marked before procedure was then analysed by sem for all brands and treatments in order to have consistent analyses among samples bottlenecks and caps were removed closed from the bottle by a scalpel and stored until analysis in order to avoid post treatment contaminations precautions to avoid post treatment contaminations are described later because they were taken also for the analysis of the inner surface of the plastic bottle and for water filtrates 2 1 2 bottle water and bottle inner wall surface to identify a potential mp release from bottle inner wall surface upon mechanical stress bottles of the three brands were treated the following no treatment at all 1 min and 10 min of rolling the bottles on a smooth surface under a vessel having a weight of 5 kg at the speed of one complete bottle round per second this treatment was performed to mimic the squeezing crushing effects that plastic bottles are subjected to during handling and use particularly when re using the bottles in order to carry out the treatment it was necessary to beforehand remove 250 ml water from the initial volume of each bottle therefore the sample volume in each bottle was 250 ml each water sample was filtered via vacuum using an in house manufactured glass filtration apparatus that allows filtering up to four samples simultaneously three samples and a blank but can individually regulate the vacuum supporting information s2 samples were filtered in blocks of samples of the same brand for that sample water was poured into the respective reservoir flasks and covered with aluminium foil to prevent filtering air vacuum was turned off subsequent to water addition the filters specified below were carefully removed and attached onto standard sem stubs immediately after filtration then they were placed within a glass container and dried for 48 h in a glass desiccator in order to identify a potential mp source from the bottle inner wall a piece of bottle wall was taken from the same area of each bottle after the water filtration supporting information s1 the plastic piece was cut out of the bottle with a scalpel avoiding abrasions and the inner surface mounted on standard aluminium stubs and kept within a glass container until sem analysis bottle water and bottle inner wall surface analyses were repeated twice for three bottles however in the second replicate of the filtered bottle water we decided to change the filters in order to obtain a better ratio between the sem analysed area and the filtered one the analysed area could not be increased unless loosing minimum size detection therefore lowering the filtering area was the only feasible solution for raising the analysed filtered area ratio details are reported in section 2 4 2 2 blanks and positive control to assess sample contamination during the procedure in the lab particle deposit we included procedural air blank samples using the same filter used for water analyses air blank samples underwent the same procedure as the water sample experimental set up filtration transport storage preparation for analysis analysis itself furthermore three positive control samples of standard mp in 250 ml milli q filtered water served as a functionality control for the full applied methodology for this purpose a mp solution was prepared by suspending 6 23 μl of a standard polystyrene solution 50 g l dark blue calibrated particle size 2 91 μm density 1 51 g cm3 sigma adlrich chemie gmbh steinheim germany in 1 l ultrapure milli q water filtered three times through glass fibre membrane pore size 0 7 μm resulting in a concentration of 16 000 000 particles l p l dilution by 1 10 and 1 100 provided the following concentrations 1 600 000 p l and 160 000 p l subsequently 250 ml of each mp solution containing 4 000 000 400 000 and 40 000 particles were filtered as described in section 2 1 2 on silver membrane filters and quantitatively analysed by sem supporting information s3 mp bead numbers were counted in 10 randomly selected fields and the mean counted numbers for the three dilutions were extrapolated to the total filtered particles based on the analysed filtered area ratio the filtration process was considered as applicable when counted and extrapolated concentration of mp beads matched the expected mp concentration of the control sample for the first control solution a mean of 52 2 4 9 standard deviation sd mp beads were counted corresponding to a total extrapolated number of 3 866 000 362 900 4 000 000 expected in the second control a mean of 90 5 15 6 sd mp beads were counted corresponding to an extrapolated number of 606 000 104 500 400 000 expected and the third control showed a mean of 8 7 3 5 sd mp beads corresponding to an extrapolated number of 58 300 23 500 40 000 expected the analysis of sem images of the positive control samples revealed acceptable matches of expected and actually counted mp beads in the three control solutions even if precision and accuracy decreased when lowering the concentration it is worth mentioning that applied glass fibre filters which were used to prepare milli q water for the control solution released glass fibres into our stock solution hence the stock solution contained glass fibres which were filtered amongst the mp beads supporting information s3 highlighting the problem of a safe use of such filters and of particles released by the filters in general 2 3 precautions to reduce contamination and loss of sample material to minimise background contamination during the analysis samples were placed in closed glass containers whenever transported or stored preparation of the water samples was performed in a laminar flow box which was previously cleaned with ethanol all glassware such as the filtration apparatus was first cleaned and then rinsed with deionized water executive persons wore cotton lab coats and washed their hands regularly 2 4 sem imaging and eds analyses the combination of sem and eds provides high resolution imaging of material surface structures as well as elemental composition signatures in order to confirm the nature of particles after samples were attached onto standard sem stubs and coated with a thin film of evaporated gold they were placed in a zeiss leo 1430 sem coupled with an oxford detector for eds analysis for the morphological analysis of the inner surface of bottle material samples bottleneck cap and bottle inner wall sem images were taken from different areas of a sample with varying magnifications 15 1000 x the areas were chosen consistently applying a consistent pattern within a sample kind operating conditions were accelerating voltage 10 20 kv probe current 80 μa and working distance varying from 10 0 to 15 0 mm sem images of caps from bottles opened closed 100 x were further processed to count particles on the sample material for that particles within a vertical line of the sample from the top to the bottom edge of the inner cap surface magnification 750 x consistent over all samples were counted and their area measured automatically with the image process program imagej supporting information s4 to account for irregularities of the detected particles reported sizes refer to the diameter of a spherical particle of the same area as the detected irregular particle to give indications about mp particle densities on caps counted particle numbers in analysed areas were reported as mp particles mm2 mps mm2 inner surface of cap subsequently hdpe cap material from bottles that were opened and closed 100 times was inspected for elemental analysis with eds for that individual candidate microplastic particles on bottle cap samples were analysed using the oxford instruments inca ver 4 04 software abingdon uk the smallest particle size analysed was 3 μm preoperational eds tests on pure hdpe cap and pet bottle material resulted in an elemental composition of 100 carbon for hdpe with trace of gold 1 deriving from the coating procedure and for pet in an elemental composition ratio of c o 73 27 always with a gold trace with 5 variability for each element and no significant differences between the three brands the measured elemental composition corresponds to the composition stoichiometry of c o ratio in pet c10h8o4 n and pe c2h4 n giving that hydrogen doesn t give a detectable peak in the eds spectrum a particle found on bottle cap sample was identified as pet or hdpe when eds spectra revealed the same elemental composition and when measured peaks matched those of spectra from the preoperational test filtered particles from bottle water were analysed for elemental composition by eds all elemental signatures were documented particles on filters were identified as pet when measured peaks matched those from spectra in the preoperational tests and when analysed c o ratio lied within the variability range of preoperational measured elemental composition an elemental composition of 100 carbon indicated polymeric origin such as pe hdpe or ldpe pp or ps but could not be further specified since these polymers consist of no other elements besides carbon and hydrogen to distinguish them from each other sem images of analysed areas were taken and area and shape of all detected particles were measured with the image process program imagej schneider et al 2012 again to account for irregularities of the detected particles reported sizes refer to the diameter of a spherical particle of the same area as the one detected as reported in section 2 1 2 in order to obtain a better ratio between the sem analysed area and the filtered one the second set of water samples was filtered on different filters the first replicate s filter consisted of a mixed cellulose ester membrane 0 45 μm pore size 25 mm diameter filtration area 176 6 mm2 and had an analysed area filter area ratio of 0 67 resulting from 50 analysed vertically fields and 50 fields horizontally magnification 1000 x total analysed area 0 012 mm2 while the second replicate s filters was a silver membrane filter 0 8 μm pore size 13 mm diameter filtration area 19 6 mm2 with an analysed area filter area ratio of 5 54 20 fields vertically 20 fields horizontally magnification 500 x total analysed area 0 027 mm2 procedural blanks were analysed the same way 2 5 chemical analyses of lubricants lubricant analyses were performed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography detection gc according to garrido lópez et al 2006 briefly one cap of each brand was sectioned by steel scissors in small pieces nearly of the same size of a hdpe sample used as positive control consisting of small hpde pellets containing 10 of behenamide samples were extracted with 2 propanol sigma aldrich schnelldorf germany in a soxhlet apparatus falc instruments lurano italy samples were then concentrated by a rotary evaporator laborota 4000 heidolph instruments schwabach germany until dryness and dissolved in 2 ml of the same solvent under 20 min of sonication for the lubricant identification and quantification in caps the gc and mass spectrometer trace isq qd single quadrupole gc ms thermo fisher was used an aliquot of 1 μl was injected in splitless mode in a zebron 5ms plus capillary column 60 m 0 32 mm 1 μm oven program started at 200 c for 0 min then 10 c min to 280 c for 0 finally 10 c min to 340 c for 30 min run time was 44 min helium was used as carrier gas at the flow rate at 1 2 ml min inlet temperature ms transfer line and the ion source was 300 c ionization was obtained by electron impact at 70 ev and acquisition mode operated by full scan for selecting ions of interest and by sim mode for quantification the qualifier ions having m z of 59 72 128 and 339 and those having m z values of 59 72 126 and 337 were selected for behenamide and erucamide quantification behenamide and erucamide analytical standards were purchased by sigma aldrich schnelldorf germany and dissolved in 2 propanol analyses were performed by external calibration curves using peak area as independent variable correction for recovery was applied each sample was injected twice and the mean value was considered for quantification quality assurance qa and quality control qc were performed by procedural blanks replicates analyses and recovery tests no peaks were detected in blank and the positive control sample gives a recovery of 72 2 6 statistical analyses statistically analysis was implemented on the particle concentration in bottled mineral water particles per 250 ml sample volume identified by sem using the rstudio statistical software two way anova with p 0 05 was applied to test for possible effects of treatment mechanical stress and bottle weight brand dunnett s test with p 0 05 was applied to test for differences between blanks and bottle water samples further statistical analysis was performed on particle dimensions of filtered bottle water and air blanks using the spss statistical software mann whitney test with p 0 05 was applied to test for differences between particle sizes in water and blanks kruskal wallis tests with p 0 05 were used to test for differences between particle sizes among treatments and brands 3 results 3 1 microplastic on caps and bottlenecks the opening closing treatment showed a strong effect on cap material fig 2 on caps opened just once in order to perform the analysis we observed no evident signs of deformation and no evident particle release we detected only few single flakes of polymer half detached at the edge of the closing sectors since caps showed no signs of abrasions it seemed very likely that these deformations derived from the production processes injection molding on caps opened closed 10 times loose particles were still not abundant but we noted an increase in the effects of mechanical stress on cap structures interestingly caps from brand 2 bottles showed the worst condition with deep signs of abrasion and abundant material detached from the cap structure samples of bottle caps deriving from bottles opened closed 100 times showed impressive signs of mechanical stress such as abrasions and deep grooves fig 2 at higher magnification the effects detected on caps after mechanical stress were even worse increasing the magnitude of damages and the number of released particles in the low dimensional range fig 3 in detail we observed tears and widespread abrasions fig 3a and b torn up particles fig 3c and numerous detached particles even on bottleneck rings fig 3d among the three brands caps of brand 2 showed the worst state in both abrasion and detached particles in order to confirm these results caps and bottlenecks were prepared again on new bottles and similar results were obtained to quantify the effect of particle release from the three caps all particles along a vertical line from the cap edge to the cap bottom of the bottles opened closed 100 times were counted and measured results of the particle density analysis of these cap samples confirmed major differences between brands revealing caps from brand 2 to release exceedingly more mps than brand 1 and 3 fig 4 a extrapolating the hdpe particle density to the entire inner cap surface we obtained a total particle number of 63 400 1 225 500 and 333 800 for caps of brand 1 2 and 3 respectively of all three brands detached mps varied in size ranging from 0 54 to 39 9 μm the majority of these mps fell into the size category of 1 5 μm 64 then in the size range of 0 5 1 25 μm and finally those in the range 5 40 μm 11 hence nearly 90 of released particles were 5 μm however caps from brand 2 and 3 released relatively more smaller particles 0 5 1 μm than from brand 1 fig 4b though a correlation with cap weight could not be identified fig 5 shows the extent of mechanical stress to bottleneck samples in bottles opened closed 1 and 10 times bottlenecks of the three brands did not show any evident sign of abrasion and only after 100 times signs of mechanical damage were observed this goes in line with the known differences in the material hardness with pet generally being harder than hdpe average hardness of hdpe is 65 shore d whereas for pet is 85 shore d according to astm 2015 no free particles have been observed on the necks of 1 time opened bottles and very few have been found on those opened closed 10 times the picture changed in the samples from bottles opened closed 100 times showing many particles spread on their neck near the edge of the bottle or attached to the closing rings fig 5 since pet and hdpe displayed different eds spectra particles of these two materials could be easily distinguished from each other on hdpe cap samples we randomly selected 10 particles per brand 9 out of 10 two brands and 10 out of 10 the third analysed particles consisted of 100 carbon which is consistent with hdpe this result clearly indicated that nearly all of them came from their respective caps and not from bottleneck which is made of pet carbon and oxygen peaks in the spectra the two not identified particles showed eds spectra characterized mainly by carbon but having only traces of oxygen not enough to be consistent with pet composition the obtained results go in line with the different hardness of pet and hdpe and indicated the cap as the weakest link of the system an exemplary hdpe particle with its respective spectrum is shown in fig 6 results from gc ms analyses showed that caps from brand 1 bottles did not present peaks corresponding to the analysed lubricants while caps from brand 2 and brand 3 bottles contained 1 0 and 0 08 of behenamide respectively caps with the highest release of particles brand 2 contained the highest lubricant content 1 behenamide 3 2 microplastic on pet inner surface looking for a possible mp release from the bottle inner wall surface due to mechanical stress bottle samples of the three brands were analysed by sem morphological analyses of their respective inner walls revealed pet to be resistant towards the treatment procedure without showing severe effects of mechanical damage pet resulted as a polymer with a very ductile behavior samples from no treated bottles and from bottles squeezed for 1 min did not show any differences in material morphology and also bottles subjected to 10 min treatment showed no evidence of breaks or abrasions some deformation lines excluded fig 7 at our experimental conditions and at rt 21 22 c the viscoelastic nature of pet is not questioned and no release of wear particles was observed in the samples independently from both the brand and treatment time 3 3 microplastic in bottled water the comparison of particle numbers in water samples exposed to the three treatments on silver filters was compatible to the results obtained on cellulose filters against our assumptions brands and treatments had no significant influence on particle concentration in water two way anova f2 4 4 29 p 0 10 and f2 4 6 10 p 0 06 respectively the mean total particle number in water samples on silver filters was 980 320 standard error se per l no significant differences existed between the total number of particles in blank and bottle water samples of the three treatments dunnett p 0 23 p 0 26 and p 0 91 for 0 1 and 10 min respectively however the particle size distribution between blanks and bottle water samples differed significantly mann whitney p 0 001 fig 8 a in fact the majority almost 90 of particles in procedural blanks were of small size 5 μm while in water samples about half of the particles were bigger 5 μm supporting information s5 examples of particles with different shapes found in our samples can be seen in supporting information s6 comparison of particle sizes between the three treatment and the three brands showed no significant differences kruskal wallis χ2 1 2 d f 2 p 0 28 and χ2 2 5 d f 2 p 0 28 respectively these results confirmed the analyses on the total number of particles and on those 3 μm fig 8b which were those analysed for the elemental composition to discriminate mps from other materials two way anova f2 4 5 19 p 0 08 and f2 4 3 70 p 0 12 for brands and treatments respectively the identification by elemental analysis of the number of mps is more interesting than the total number of particles even though the instrumental limit allowed us to consider only particle 3 μm elemental analyses performed on 58 particles on cellulose filters revealed that only two particles 3 4 had a c o ratio corresponding to that of pet 17 29 had a slightly different c o ratio thus could not be confirmed as pet and the remaining 39 69 showed variable elemental compositions the two pet particles derived one from water of no treatment bottle from brand 3 3 3 μm and the other from water of the 10 min treatment bottle from brand 2 25 4 μm on silver filters out of 50 analysed particles one particle showed an elemental composition of 100 carbon consistent with the hpde of the cap fig 9 a and three with a c o ratio corresponding to that of pet fig 9b reaching 8 of mps on total particles among the other 12 24 had a slightly different c o ratio and 34 68 showed a variable composition mainly with si ca and fe fig 9c interestingly the morphological features of the particle with 100 c fig 9a were very similar to those derived from cap abrasion for comparison see figs 3c d and 6 the particle consistent to hdpe 28 μm and the three corresponding to pet composition ranged between 22 0 and 23 2 μm were detected in water of 10 min treatment bottle from brand 3 no pet or polymer particle with 100 carbon in their spectra were detected in procedural blanks considering all the analysed water samples and particles identified as mps we can calculate a mean mp concentration of 148 253 sd mp l 4 discussion 4 1 cap bottleneck friction a source of microplastics results from our analyses showed that particle release increased with extended mechanical stress on hdpe caps and pet bottlenecks this was more the case for brand 2 than for brand 1 and 3 with caps from brand 1 being least sensible to abrasion this was confirmed by the quantitative analysis of particle density on caps opened closed 100 times revealing brand 2 to release the most particles and brand 1 the least obviously our data about hpde particles on caps are extrapolations and they intended to show the potential amounts of mps released by a single cap from a plastic bottle as a consequence of mechanical stress hdpe being softer than pet is the crucial component of plastic bottles differently from the existing studies on mp concentration in bottled water by mason et al 2018 ossmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 and zuccarello et al 2019 our results were not obtained from water samples they represent direct exposure source during drinking straight from the bottle the industrial approach to contain mp production is the use of lubricant incorporated as slip additive to the polymer surface to reduce friction of the material and therefore the torque on the cap dulal et al 2017 amongst the common lubricants applied on hdpe caps and listed as indirect additive for food contact substances fda 2018 are oleamide behenamide and erucamide long chain primary alkylamides the latter being the most commonly used lubricants show a different crystal structure and rheology and therefore differ in their effectivity ramírez et al 2002 further influence on their performance have the surface amounts distribution and storage condition such as temperature dulal et al 2017 pan et al 2017 according to the european union commission regulation no 10 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food the named additives have no specific migration limit sml which means they have a generic migration limit of 60 mg kg of food particular caps with these additives shall not transfer their constituents to food simulants in quantities exceeding 10 mg of total constituents released per dm2 of food contact surface mg dm2 ec 2011a regarding toxicity the potential risk of erucamide to human health is considered to be low eccc hc 2018 no hazards were identified for behenamide echa 2019 however studies investigating the health effects of oleamide are limited and read across from erucamide are applied to fill the data gaps addressing the human health increasing the uncertainty for risk assessment to human health eccc hc 2018 since the information about the use of lubricant is not required by law we performed additional gc ms analyses on caps from the three brands trying to correlate the observed damages and particle release to a specific compound or dose our chemical analyses revealed very different lubricant contents in the three caps they weren t detected in caps from brand 1 while caps from brand 2 and 3 contained 1 0 and 0 08 of behenamide respectively by these results the extent of mp release was not related to the lubricant content on the contrary the brand with the higher release of mp showed the highest lubricant content brand 2 while the brand with the lowest release of mp did not present any lubricant brand 1 suggesting that other features than lubricant content should explain the extent of mp release the great difference existing in cap abrasion among the different brands with brand 2 releasing more than 10 times higher than brand 1 could be explained by the structural features of the cap bottleneck system the cap neck friction and the subsequent release of mps from brand 2 could have been caused by the sequence of sectors of its bottleneck visible in fig 5 rather than a continuous ring as in brand 1 and 3 this structural difference in bottleneck design is clearly an important element and could explain our results the bottleneck structure divided by sectors as the one of brand 2 can be the main reason of increased mp particle release in our samples it must be considered that our results derive from a series of 100 times opening closing which is normally hard to obtain with a 500 ml plastic bottle nonetheless such a result can be achieved by the systematic reuse of the same bottle throughout a week or even for longer period the repeated refilling of the same pet bottle and mainly the reuse of its hdpe cap is certainly more sustainable but indeed generates a greater number of mp particles which leads to a higher mp exposure in the plastic bottle users with potentially risks to human health welle and franz 2018 who published a literature review on the existing studies on mps in bottled mineral water evaluated the risk for humans based on reported mp content and total mass transfer of small molecules like additives and oligomers concluding that exposure estimations would not raise a safety concern for consumers by our results if plastic bottles are to be re used we recommend rinsing the bottleneck as well as the cap of the bottles to prevent accumulation of mps on their surface results from our analyses showed that most of the mp particles produced by repeated opening and closing series derived from the cap hdpe and stayed below 5 μm in size about 80 98 and 89 for brand 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 4b and that for brand 2 and 3 bottles about one third of the whole particles were below 1 μm size class 0 5 0 99 μm confirming the very small nature of these mps analogous to nonplastic nanomaterials it is very likely that also for mps size may play a pivotal role in their toxicity with the smallest particles being the most dangerous this has already been reported in mammals kubo et al 1999 literature about potential toxicity of mps is constantly increasing in number but data on the effects of mps on living organisms are sometimes contradictory in fact while many studies have demonstrated that mp ingestion is able to induce sub lethal adverse effects on different animals alomar et al 2017 blarer and burkhardt holm 2016 lu et al 2016 other studies have reported light or null effects imhof et al 2017 kaposi et al 2014 weber et al 2018 unfortunately no information on the effects of ingested mps in humans is available so far even though in human the intestinal absorption of mps appears to be limited the epithelium of the gut is not impenetrable to nanoplastics nps indeed in vivo human data on nps are not available and only ps has been used as model particle in mammalian in vivo and in vitro studies lusher et al 2017 we were not able to detect nps which are smaller than 100 nm by definition ec 2011b however their possible toxicity despite their relative low mass is worth of further and more detailed studies a very recent review eerkes medrano et al 2019 underlined this issue additionally reporting that bottled water had the highest number of mps with respect to tap water but with a considerably lower mass due to their small size since all plastics contain reactive oxygen species ros due to their polymerization and processing history wright and kelly 2017 mps ingested via drinking water can produce oxidative stress which may lead to chronic inflammation and tissue damage even by minimizing the possible mp uptake with the simplest one time use of pet bottled water one opening only which did not produce an evident release of mps in the cap bottleneck area the re use of pet bottles and especially the repeated cap bottleneck frictions can produce impressive mp numbers up to millions of particles and consequently a higher exposure risk 4 2 effects of mechanical stress on pet bottles results from our analyses of filtered water after 0 1 and 10 min squeezing bottle test showed no significant differences among the samples neither considering the total particle number nor the particles 3 μm accordingly the eds analysis confirmed only few particles to be of plastic origin and looking at the inner wall surfaces of the pet bottles subjected to continued crushing squeezing test no ultrastructural differences were observed by sem even after 10 min of treatment some minor deformation lines excluded fig 7 the mechanical stress tested in this paper wanted to mime a normal bottle use considering that such a stress can derive during drinking carrying and by handling bottles especially when they are half empty even 10 min treatment does not seem unrealistic the experimental set up was designed to primarily determine possible mp i e particles from both pet bottle and pe cap increase in water due to the treatments although mp identification via eds is solely based on the elemental composition and c o ratio the risk of misinterpretation for pet particles is low due to the very clear c o ratio and strong oxygen peak on the contrary particles on filters identified as hdpe could potentially derive from other polymers containing only carbon and hydrogen such as pp or ps anyway sem imaging is a powerful tool for material inspection the analysis of the inner bottle surface the morphological study of the bottle neck design and cap opening system greatly help in identifying new mp generation and detachment sites mainly in a study that aims at finding potential sources of mps after the application of strong mechanical stress thus sem eds results were suitable for our purposes even though limiting when polymers with no distinct element peaks such as oxygen in pet and chlorine in pvc need to be identified wang et al 2017 the presence of mps in water from single use pet bottled was already considered data from the few published papers reported inconsistent results mainly due the use of non standardized procedures in preparing and analysing the samples wiesheu et al 2016 considering a bottled mineral water and using μ raman spectroscopy did not reported significant differences between the sample and the controls both showing a high number of fibres in the size range between 1 and 5 μm schymanski et al 2018 found 14 14 mps l 5 μm applying μ raman spectroscopy while ossmann et al 2018 by the same methodology identified 2649 2857 mps l 1 μm with more than 98 being 5 μm mason et al 2018 applying the nile red tagging methodology party combined with ftir spectroscopy reported that 93 of all tested single use pet bottles showed signs of mp contamination with an average of 325 mps l 6 5 μm more recently zuccarello et al 2019 by sem eds methodology found 5 42e 07 1 95e 07 mps l bottled water 0 5 10 μm unfortunately this paper does not describe the details for the mps extraction and analytical method referring to a patent for industrial invention registered to the italian ministry of economic development which is not of public domain moreover the reported concentrations refer to the general particle content and could not distinguish between plastic polymer dust or other components that might explain the exceedingly high number of detected mps apart from this they further found a correlation of water particle content and bottle plastic thickness hard plastics cause the release of bigger fragments but in minor number which could not be confirmed by our study according to a recent comment on the study by zuccarello et al 2019 published by ossmann et al 2019 the results of the study are more than questionable the authors not only criticize the lack of information about the methodology but also highlight the need for good quality research in order to deliver reliable data for an adequate assessment therefore we excluded the very high values by zuccarello et al 2019 from our analysis in general a comparison of mp content in bottled mineral water with results from the available studies is difficult due to the different experimental setup and targeted plastic polymers our results 148 253 sd mps l compared to those by the other studies for single use pet bottles zuccarello s excluded are summarized in table 1 values were directly taken from the respective articles differences in the number of mps l among published studies can be explained by considering the different size limit of detectable particle due to the applied technique which varies within these studies as increasing concentration values are correlated to decreasing particle size limit for polymer identification mason et al 2018 was limited to a polymer identification of particles larger than 100 μm hence the small number compared to our results however also mp concentration by schymanski et al 2018 and ossmann et al 2018 differed from ours despite the particle size limits for polymer identification differed only slightly to ours it gives proof to the findings by ossmann et al 2018 who found increasing number of mps with decreasing particle size with 98 of particles in single use bottles being smaller than 5 μm as ossmann et al 2018 already stated every extrapolation causes increasing uncertainty nevertheless our results support the findings by ossmann et al 2018 and schymanski et al 2018 who report pet to be the predominant polymer type present in bottled mineral water this contradicts the findings by mason et al 2018 who suspect caps to be the main source of pollution as they mainly found pe particles in their water since the detected pet particles in the present study did not significantly increase with the treatment it is likely that they were due to the wear of the plastic bottles before purchasing as before schymanski et al 2018 suggested or to the filling processes it must be noted that the highest mp concentration was found in both treated and untreated samples confirming that the applied mechanical treatment did not produce an evident effect on mp particle release this indicates a reliable behavior of the plastic polymers used in the bottles selected for our test and confirms pet as an effective material capable to sustain repeated squeezing without gross deteriorations at least at rt since the concentration in mass of microplastic per volume of beverage in μg l has become an important parameter value for risk assessment welle and franz 2018 we calculated the concentration of mp particles from the number of particles and their sizes following welle and franz 2018 the calculation is presented in the supporting information table s1 and resulting values are given in table 1 data highlight the differences between the studies regarding particle sizes with ossmann et al 2018 having a much lower mass concentration than schymanski et al 2018 despite the much higher particle number our value 1 71 μg l is very near to that of schymanski et al 2018 1 8 μg l following welle and franz 2018 our exposure estimations would not raise a safety concern for consumers 5 conclusions this study provides more data for exposure estimates to mps of plastic bottled mineral water we found pet bottlenecks and hdpe caps to present a serious source of mps especially following extended mechanical stress opening and closing procedure interestingly high differences in measured mp density on caps surface existed among brands likely related to the structural design of the bottleneck for brand 1 2 and 3 we measured 63 400 1 225 500 and 333 800 hdpe particles on the inner cap surface respectively revealing brand 2 to release the most mps we detected mps also in drinking water which extrapolated to 1l sum up to 148 253 mps l differently from caps mp occurrence in water samples was not significantly related neither to the applied treatments nor to different bottle types brand supporting the results of total particle counts which were not significantly higher after treatment therefore pet material of our tested brands was resistant towards mechanical stress squeezing crushing test mps in filtered water likely derived from contamination of the water before bottling or due to wear of the bottles before purchase sem eds was suitable for our experimental set up as it provided high resolution images of the plastic surfaces to reveal abrasion quantify particle release and the detection of pet particles in filtered water however this technique reaches its limit when a differentiation of polymers showing only carbon in their eds spectra is desired the use of positive controls proved the functionality of the applied system but blanks revealed the sensitivity of this kind of analysis towards external contamination according to these results though being declared as food safe pet and hdpe used for food packaging exhibit deficiencies such as the release of mps due to frequent use moreover the observed differences in the extent of mp release of bottlenecks caps between the bottle brands reveals a variety in the plastic behavior that should be considered to an optimization of the admission criteria for food contact substances chances of mp ingestion by humans increase with frequent use of the same single use plastic bottle though only from the bottleneck cap system according to welle and franz 2018 mp content in water of previous studies with lower and higher mp content compared to our is not considered a safety concern however there is a lack of information regarding the potential toxicity of plastic polymers to human health research has to be intensified considering the degradation of plastic material and the release potential of particles

18490,plastic particle ingestion has become of concern as a possible threat to human health previous works have already explored the presence of microplastic mp in bottled drinking water as a source of mp intake here we consider the release of mp particles from single use pet mineral water bottles upon exposure to mechanical stress utilizing sem plus eds which allows the implementation of morphological and elemental analysis of the plastic material surface and quantification of particle concentrations in sample water the aim of this study was to better evaluate the sources of mp intake from plastic bottles especially considering the effect of daily use on these bottles such as the abrasion of the plastic material for that we analysed mp release of pet bottlenecks and hdpe caps on their surfaces after a series of bottle openings closings 1 x 10 x 100 x furthermore we investigated if the inner surface of the pet bottles released mps counted particle increase of the water and identified mps in the pet bottled water after exposing the bottles to mechanical stress squeezing treatment none 1 min 10 min the results showed a considerable increase of mp particle occurrence on the surface of pet and hdpe material bottlenecks and caps after opening and closing the bottles after 100 times the effect was impressive especially on caps moreover great differences exist in cap abrasion between brands which uncovers a discrepancy in plastic behavior of brands interestingly particle concentrations in the bottled mineral water did not significantly increase after exposure to mechanical stress squeezing treatment the morphological analysis of the inner wall surface of the bottles supported this observation as no stress cracks could be detected after the treatment implying that the bottles itself are not a consistent source of mp particles after this extent of mechanical stress however chances of mp ingestion by humans increase with frequent use of the same single use plastic bottle though only from the bottleneck cap system graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic sources drinking water scanning electron microscopy water bottles plastic degradation

numerous studies on mp occurrence in our environment and reinforced by the detection of mps in human stool liebmann et al 2018 plastic pollution has become of concern as potential threat to human health too sources of mp ingestion by humans have already been discussed in several studies bouwmeester et al 2015 galloway 2015 lehner et al 2019 schirinzi et al 2017 wright and kelly 2017 moreover the recent studies by mason et al 2018 ossmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 zuccarello et al 2019 attracted the attention of researchers and the general public as they confirmed the presence of mps in bottled drinking water reported particle concentrations differ substantially among these studies due to the application of different methods of sampling isolating purifying and identifying mps which vary greatly among studies moreover koelmans et al 2019 questions the quality of occurrence studies and highlights the need for a standardization of mp analysis improvement of quality assurance the most produced types of plastic worldwide are used for packaging and they are polyethylene pe mainly in its low density form ldpe bin bags plastic wraps shopping bags and high density form hdpe shopping bags bottle caps detergent bottles polypropylene pp yoghurt packaging straws semi rigid containers polystyrene ps foamed food containers plastic cutlery polyvinyl chloride pvc toys pipes and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles food trays the essential compounds of plastics are chains of monomers mostly deriving from non renewable fossil fuel which are molecules capable of combining to form a polymer unep 2016 to alter the physico chemical properties of the polymers such as flame resistance colour plasticity viscosity and lubricity other chemicals e g bisphenol a phthalate fatty acids can be added to the polymer itself hammer et al 2012 some of the chemical additives as well as some monomers used for the synthesis of polymers are classified as hazardous to human health and the environment in fact when released through use and degradation of plastic products they can be mutagenic and or carcinogenic or act as endocrine disruptors lithner et al 2011 however very little information is available on the toxic potential of mps and their additives which strongly depends on size and shape of the plastic particles and dose of the released chemical additives waring et al 2018 considering the potential harmful effects of mps there is a significant need to better understand possible sources of mp intake to assess quantities and risks related to their properties indeed reports focusing on mps in bottled mineral water are very scarce and the reported works have explored solely the presence of mps in the bottled water here we considered also the release of mp particles wear particles and fragments from breakage of single use water bottles upon exposure to mechanical stress utilizing scanning electron microscopy sem in conjunction with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds while eds provided spectra revealing the elemental compositions of particles sem images were used to quantify detected particles and to morphologically examine all the bottle components furthermore we implemented an additive analysis on hdpe caps of the three brands by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to determine the lubricant substances and their corresponding concentrations the final goal of the present study was to better evaluate single use plastic bottles as one of proven sources of mp intake by humans especially considering the effects of daily use on these bottles such as the abrasion of the plastic material for that we 1 analysed mp release of pet bottlenecks and hdpe caps on their surfaces after a series of bottle openings closings 2 performed a morphological analysis of the pet bottle inner wall surface after a squeezing crushing treatment and 3 subsequently counted particle increase and identified mps in the pet bottled water 2 material and methods 2 1 sample material and preparation for the analysis of particle release from bottle material upon exposure to mechanical stress three different mineral water bottles 0 5 l were chosen based on the bottle texture plastic thickness and hence bottle weight generally sparkling and not sparkling water are associated with heavier and lighter bottles respectively with thickness weight differences among brands we selected three brands representative for light medium and heavy bottles to test their reaction to mechanical stress mineral water bottles of the selected brands were purchased in italian supermarkets in a set of 6 in order to have replicates within the same lot of bottles all samples were single use bottles made of pet with screw caps made of hdpe the water types and bottle net weights without cap and label were natural water in 9 61 g bottles brand 1 sparkling water in 12 03 g bottles brand 2 and sparkling water in 16 03 g bottles brand 3 cap weights of respective brands were 1 15 g 1 27 g and 1 78 g for brand 1 2 3 respectively by including different bottle and cap net weights the effect of flexibility of pet and hdpe material could be taken into consideration a complete scheme of the experimental plan which includes bottleneck and cap analyses section 2 1 1 bottle water and bottle inner wall surface analyses section 2 1 2 is shown in fig 1 images of the bottles of the three brands after mechanical stress are presented in supporting information s1 2 1 1 bottlenecks and caps mp particle release from bottleneck and cap material from the three brands was studied after an opening and closing procedure three treatments were implemented for the first one bottles were opened only once in order to analyse bottleneck and cap from the inside for the second treatment bottles were opened closed 10 times and for the third one 100 times with 1 min pause every 20 times the treatments were applied on a second set of bottles from each brand to obtain a true replicate for each treatment and bottle brand while the same treatment on bottles of different brands represented pseudo replicates for the applied treatment particular emphasis was laid on using the same pressure same operators and pressure point when turning the caps this section marked before procedure was then analysed by sem for all brands and treatments in order to have consistent analyses among samples bottlenecks and caps were removed closed from the bottle by a scalpel and stored until analysis in order to avoid post treatment contaminations precautions to avoid post treatment contaminations are described later because they were taken also for the analysis of the inner surface of the plastic bottle and for water filtrates 2 1 2 bottle water and bottle inner wall surface to identify a potential mp release from bottle inner wall surface upon mechanical stress bottles of the three brands were treated the following no treatment at all 1 min and 10 min of rolling the bottles on a smooth surface under a vessel having a weight of 5 kg at the speed of one complete bottle round per second this treatment was performed to mimic the squeezing crushing effects that plastic bottles are subjected to during handling and use particularly when re using the bottles in order to carry out the treatment it was necessary to beforehand remove 250 ml water from the initial volume of each bottle therefore the sample volume in each bottle was 250 ml each water sample was filtered via vacuum using an in house manufactured glass filtration apparatus that allows filtering up to four samples simultaneously three samples and a blank but can individually regulate the vacuum supporting information s2 samples were filtered in blocks of samples of the same brand for that sample water was poured into the respective reservoir flasks and covered with aluminium foil to prevent filtering air vacuum was turned off subsequent to water addition the filters specified below were carefully removed and attached onto standard sem stubs immediately after filtration then they were placed within a glass container and dried for 48 h in a glass desiccator in order to identify a potential mp source from the bottle inner wall a piece of bottle wall was taken from the same area of each bottle after the water filtration supporting information s1 the plastic piece was cut out of the bottle with a scalpel avoiding abrasions and the inner surface mounted on standard aluminium stubs and kept within a glass container until sem analysis bottle water and bottle inner wall surface analyses were repeated twice for three bottles however in the second replicate of the filtered bottle water we decided to change the filters in order to obtain a better ratio between the sem analysed area and the filtered one the analysed area could not be increased unless loosing minimum size detection therefore lowering the filtering area was the only feasible solution for raising the analysed filtered area ratio details are reported in section 2 4 2 2 blanks and positive control to assess sample contamination during the procedure in the lab particle deposit we included procedural air blank samples using the same filter used for water analyses air blank samples underwent the same procedure as the water sample experimental set up filtration transport storage preparation for analysis analysis itself furthermore three positive control samples of standard mp in 250 ml milli q filtered water served as a functionality control for the full applied methodology for this purpose a mp solution was prepared by suspending 6 23 μl of a standard polystyrene solution 50 g l dark blue calibrated particle size 2 91 μm density 1 51 g cm3 sigma adlrich chemie gmbh steinheim germany in 1 l ultrapure milli q water filtered three times through glass fibre membrane pore size 0 7 μm resulting in a concentration of 16 000 000 particles l p l dilution by 1 10 and 1 100 provided the following concentrations 1 600 000 p l and 160 000 p l subsequently 250 ml of each mp solution containing 4 000 000 400 000 and 40 000 particles were filtered as described in section 2 1 2 on silver membrane filters and quantitatively analysed by sem supporting information s3 mp bead numbers were counted in 10 randomly selected fields and the mean counted numbers for the three dilutions were extrapolated to the total filtered particles based on the analysed filtered area ratio the filtration process was considered as applicable when counted and extrapolated concentration of mp beads matched the expected mp concentration of the control sample for the first control solution a mean of 52 2 4 9 standard deviation sd mp beads were counted corresponding to a total extrapolated number of 3 866 000 362 900 4 000 000 expected in the second control a mean of 90 5 15 6 sd mp beads were counted corresponding to an extrapolated number of 606 000 104 500 400 000 expected and the third control showed a mean of 8 7 3 5 sd mp beads corresponding to an extrapolated number of 58 300 23 500 40 000 expected the analysis of sem images of the positive control samples revealed acceptable matches of expected and actually counted mp beads in the three control solutions even if precision and accuracy decreased when lowering the concentration it is worth mentioning that applied glass fibre filters which were used to prepare milli q water for the control solution released glass fibres into our stock solution hence the stock solution contained glass fibres which were filtered amongst the mp beads supporting information s3 highlighting the problem of a safe use of such filters and of particles released by the filters in general 2 3 precautions to reduce contamination and loss of sample material to minimise background contamination during the analysis samples were placed in closed glass containers whenever transported or stored preparation of the water samples was performed in a laminar flow box which was previously cleaned with ethanol all glassware such as the filtration apparatus was first cleaned and then rinsed with deionized water executive persons wore cotton lab coats and washed their hands regularly 2 4 sem imaging and eds analyses the combination of sem and eds provides high resolution imaging of material surface structures as well as elemental composition signatures in order to confirm the nature of particles after samples were attached onto standard sem stubs and coated with a thin film of evaporated gold they were placed in a zeiss leo 1430 sem coupled with an oxford detector for eds analysis for the morphological analysis of the inner surface of bottle material samples bottleneck cap and bottle inner wall sem images were taken from different areas of a sample with varying magnifications 15 1000 x the areas were chosen consistently applying a consistent pattern within a sample kind operating conditions were accelerating voltage 10 20 kv probe current 80 μa and working distance varying from 10 0 to 15 0 mm sem images of caps from bottles opened closed 100 x were further processed to count particles on the sample material for that particles within a vertical line of the sample from the top to the bottom edge of the inner cap surface magnification 750 x consistent over all samples were counted and their area measured automatically with the image process program imagej supporting information s4 to account for irregularities of the detected particles reported sizes refer to the diameter of a spherical particle of the same area as the detected irregular particle to give indications about mp particle densities on caps counted particle numbers in analysed areas were reported as mp particles mm2 mps mm2 inner surface of cap subsequently hdpe cap material from bottles that were opened and closed 100 times was inspected for elemental analysis with eds for that individual candidate microplastic particles on bottle cap samples were analysed using the oxford instruments inca ver 4 04 software abingdon uk the smallest particle size analysed was 3 μm preoperational eds tests on pure hdpe cap and pet bottle material resulted in an elemental composition of 100 carbon for hdpe with trace of gold 1 deriving from the coating procedure and for pet in an elemental composition ratio of c o 73 27 always with a gold trace with 5 variability for each element and no significant differences between the three brands the measured elemental composition corresponds to the composition stoichiometry of c o ratio in pet c10h8o4 n and pe c2h4 n giving that hydrogen doesn t give a detectable peak in the eds spectrum a particle found on bottle cap sample was identified as pet or hdpe when eds spectra revealed the same elemental composition and when measured peaks matched those of spectra from the preoperational test filtered particles from bottle water were analysed for elemental composition by eds all elemental signatures were documented particles on filters were identified as pet when measured peaks matched those from spectra in the preoperational tests and when analysed c o ratio lied within the variability range of preoperational measured elemental composition an elemental composition of 100 carbon indicated polymeric origin such as pe hdpe or ldpe pp or ps but could not be further specified since these polymers consist of no other elements besides carbon and hydrogen to distinguish them from each other sem images of analysed areas were taken and area and shape of all detected particles were measured with the image process program imagej schneider et al 2012 again to account for irregularities of the detected particles reported sizes refer to the diameter of a spherical particle of the same area as the one detected as reported in section 2 1 2 in order to obtain a better ratio between the sem analysed area and the filtered one the second set of water samples was filtered on different filters the first replicate s filter consisted of a mixed cellulose ester membrane 0 45 μm pore size 25 mm diameter filtration area 176 6 mm2 and had an analysed area filter area ratio of 0 67 resulting from 50 analysed vertically fields and 50 fields horizontally magnification 1000 x total analysed area 0 012 mm2 while the second replicate s filters was a silver membrane filter 0 8 μm pore size 13 mm diameter filtration area 19 6 mm2 with an analysed area filter area ratio of 5 54 20 fields vertically 20 fields horizontally magnification 500 x total analysed area 0 027 mm2 procedural blanks were analysed the same way 2 5 chemical analyses of lubricants lubricant analyses were performed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography detection gc according to garrido lópez et al 2006 briefly one cap of each brand was sectioned by steel scissors in small pieces nearly of the same size of a hdpe sample used as positive control consisting of small hpde pellets containing 10 of behenamide samples were extracted with 2 propanol sigma aldrich schnelldorf germany in a soxhlet apparatus falc instruments lurano italy samples were then concentrated by a rotary evaporator laborota 4000 heidolph instruments schwabach germany until dryness and dissolved in 2 ml of the same solvent under 20 min of sonication for the lubricant identification and quantification in caps the gc and mass spectrometer trace isq qd single quadrupole gc ms thermo fisher was used an aliquot of 1 μl was injected in splitless mode in a zebron 5ms plus capillary column 60 m 0 32 mm 1 μm oven program started at 200 c for 0 min then 10 c min to 280 c for 0 finally 10 c min to 340 c for 30 min run time was 44 min helium was used as carrier gas at the flow rate at 1 2 ml min inlet temperature ms transfer line and the ion source was 300 c ionization was obtained by electron impact at 70 ev and acquisition mode operated by full scan for selecting ions of interest and by sim mode for quantification the qualifier ions having m z of 59 72 128 and 339 and those having m z values of 59 72 126 and 337 were selected for behenamide and erucamide quantification behenamide and erucamide analytical standards were purchased by sigma aldrich schnelldorf germany and dissolved in 2 propanol analyses were performed by external calibration curves using peak area as independent variable correction for recovery was applied each sample was injected twice and the mean value was considered for quantification quality assurance qa and quality control qc were performed by procedural blanks replicates analyses and recovery tests no peaks were detected in blank and the positive control sample gives a recovery of 72 2 6 statistical analyses statistically analysis was implemented on the particle concentration in bottled mineral water particles per 250 ml sample volume identified by sem using the rstudio statistical software two way anova with p 0 05 was applied to test for possible effects of treatment mechanical stress and bottle weight brand dunnett s test with p 0 05 was applied to test for differences between blanks and bottle water samples further statistical analysis was performed on particle dimensions of filtered bottle water and air blanks using the spss statistical software mann whitney test with p 0 05 was applied to test for differences between particle sizes in water and blanks kruskal wallis tests with p 0 05 were used to test for differences between particle sizes among treatments and brands 3 results 3 1 microplastic on caps and bottlenecks the opening closing treatment showed a strong effect on cap material fig 2 on caps opened just once in order to perform the analysis we observed no evident signs of deformation and no evident particle release we detected only few single flakes of polymer half detached at the edge of the closing sectors since caps showed no signs of abrasions it seemed very likely that these deformations derived from the production processes injection molding on caps opened closed 10 times loose particles were still not abundant but we noted an increase in the effects of mechanical stress on cap structures interestingly caps from brand 2 bottles showed the worst condition with deep signs of abrasion and abundant material detached from the cap structure samples of bottle caps deriving from bottles opened closed 100 times showed impressive signs of mechanical stress such as abrasions and deep grooves fig 2 at higher magnification the effects detected on caps after mechanical stress were even worse increasing the magnitude of damages and the number of released particles in the low dimensional range fig 3 in detail we observed tears and widespread abrasions fig 3a and b torn up particles fig 3c and numerous detached particles even on bottleneck rings fig 3d among the three brands caps of brand 2 showed the worst state in both abrasion and detached particles in order to confirm these results caps and bottlenecks were prepared again on new bottles and similar results were obtained to quantify the effect of particle release from the three caps all particles along a vertical line from the cap edge to the cap bottom of the bottles opened closed 100 times were counted and measured results of the particle density analysis of these cap samples confirmed major differences between brands revealing caps from brand 2 to release exceedingly more mps than brand 1 and 3 fig 4 a extrapolating the hdpe particle density to the entire inner cap surface we obtained a total particle number of 63 400 1 225 500 and 333 800 for caps of brand 1 2 and 3 respectively of all three brands detached mps varied in size ranging from 0 54 to 39 9 μm the majority of these mps fell into the size category of 1 5 μm 64 then in the size range of 0 5 1 25 μm and finally those in the range 5 40 μm 11 hence nearly 90 of released particles were 5 μm however caps from brand 2 and 3 released relatively more smaller particles 0 5 1 μm than from brand 1 fig 4b though a correlation with cap weight could not be identified fig 5 shows the extent of mechanical stress to bottleneck samples in bottles opened closed 1 and 10 times bottlenecks of the three brands did not show any evident sign of abrasion and only after 100 times signs of mechanical damage were observed this goes in line with the known differences in the material hardness with pet generally being harder than hdpe average hardness of hdpe is 65 shore d whereas for pet is 85 shore d according to astm 2015 no free particles have been observed on the necks of 1 time opened bottles and very few have been found on those opened closed 10 times the picture changed in the samples from bottles opened closed 100 times showing many particles spread on their neck near the edge of the bottle or attached to the closing rings fig 5 since pet and hdpe displayed different eds spectra particles of these two materials could be easily distinguished from each other on hdpe cap samples we randomly selected 10 particles per brand 9 out of 10 two brands and 10 out of 10 the third analysed particles consisted of 100 carbon which is consistent with hdpe this result clearly indicated that nearly all of them came from their respective caps and not from bottleneck which is made of pet carbon and oxygen peaks in the spectra the two not identified particles showed eds spectra characterized mainly by carbon but having only traces of oxygen not enough to be consistent with pet composition the obtained results go in line with the different hardness of pet and hdpe and indicated the cap as the weakest link of the system an exemplary hdpe particle with its respective spectrum is shown in fig 6 results from gc ms analyses showed that caps from brand 1 bottles did not present peaks corresponding to the analysed lubricants while caps from brand 2 and brand 3 bottles contained 1 0 and 0 08 of behenamide respectively caps with the highest release of particles brand 2 contained the highest lubricant content 1 behenamide 3 2 microplastic on pet inner surface looking for a possible mp release from the bottle inner wall surface due to mechanical stress bottle samples of the three brands were analysed by sem morphological analyses of their respective inner walls revealed pet to be resistant towards the treatment procedure without showing severe effects of mechanical damage pet resulted as a polymer with a very ductile behavior samples from no treated bottles and from bottles squeezed for 1 min did not show any differences in material morphology and also bottles subjected to 10 min treatment showed no evidence of breaks or abrasions some deformation lines excluded fig 7 at our experimental conditions and at rt 21 22 c the viscoelastic nature of pet is not questioned and no release of wear particles was observed in the samples independently from both the brand and treatment time 3 3 microplastic in bottled water the comparison of particle numbers in water samples exposed to the three treatments on silver filters was compatible to the results obtained on cellulose filters against our assumptions brands and treatments had no significant influence on particle concentration in water two way anova f2 4 4 29 p 0 10 and f2 4 6 10 p 0 06 respectively the mean total particle number in water samples on silver filters was 980 320 standard error se per l no significant differences existed between the total number of particles in blank and bottle water samples of the three treatments dunnett p 0 23 p 0 26 and p 0 91 for 0 1 and 10 min respectively however the particle size distribution between blanks and bottle water samples differed significantly mann whitney p 0 001 fig 8 a in fact the majority almost 90 of particles in procedural blanks were of small size 5 μm while in water samples about half of the particles were bigger 5 μm supporting information s5 examples of particles with different shapes found in our samples can be seen in supporting information s6 comparison of particle sizes between the three treatment and the three brands showed no significant differences kruskal wallis χ2 1 2 d f 2 p 0 28 and χ2 2 5 d f 2 p 0 28 respectively these results confirmed the analyses on the total number of particles and on those 3 μm fig 8b which were those analysed for the elemental composition to discriminate mps from other materials two way anova f2 4 5 19 p 0 08 and f2 4 3 70 p 0 12 for brands and treatments respectively the identification by elemental analysis of the number of mps is more interesting than the total number of particles even though the instrumental limit allowed us to consider only particle 3 μm elemental analyses performed on 58 particles on cellulose filters revealed that only two particles 3 4 had a c o ratio corresponding to that of pet 17 29 had a slightly different c o ratio thus could not be confirmed as pet and the remaining 39 69 showed variable elemental compositions the two pet particles derived one from water of no treatment bottle from brand 3 3 3 μm and the other from water of the 10 min treatment bottle from brand 2 25 4 μm on silver filters out of 50 analysed particles one particle showed an elemental composition of 100 carbon consistent with the hpde of the cap fig 9 a and three with a c o ratio corresponding to that of pet fig 9b reaching 8 of mps on total particles among the other 12 24 had a slightly different c o ratio and 34 68 showed a variable composition mainly with si ca and fe fig 9c interestingly the morphological features of the particle with 100 c fig 9a were very similar to those derived from cap abrasion for comparison see figs 3c d and 6 the particle consistent to hdpe 28 μm and the three corresponding to pet composition ranged between 22 0 and 23 2 μm were detected in water of 10 min treatment bottle from brand 3 no pet or polymer particle with 100 carbon in their spectra were detected in procedural blanks considering all the analysed water samples and particles identified as mps we can calculate a mean mp concentration of 148 253 sd mp l 4 discussion 4 1 cap bottleneck friction a source of microplastics results from our analyses showed that particle release increased with extended mechanical stress on hdpe caps and pet bottlenecks this was more the case for brand 2 than for brand 1 and 3 with caps from brand 1 being least sensible to abrasion this was confirmed by the quantitative analysis of particle density on caps opened closed 100 times revealing brand 2 to release the most particles and brand 1 the least obviously our data about hpde particles on caps are extrapolations and they intended to show the potential amounts of mps released by a single cap from a plastic bottle as a consequence of mechanical stress hdpe being softer than pet is the crucial component of plastic bottles differently from the existing studies on mp concentration in bottled water by mason et al 2018 ossmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 and zuccarello et al 2019 our results were not obtained from water samples they represent direct exposure source during drinking straight from the bottle the industrial approach to contain mp production is the use of lubricant incorporated as slip additive to the polymer surface to reduce friction of the material and therefore the torque on the cap dulal et al 2017 amongst the common lubricants applied on hdpe caps and listed as indirect additive for food contact substances fda 2018 are oleamide behenamide and erucamide long chain primary alkylamides the latter being the most commonly used lubricants show a different crystal structure and rheology and therefore differ in their effectivity ramírez et al 2002 further influence on their performance have the surface amounts distribution and storage condition such as temperature dulal et al 2017 pan et al 2017 according to the european union commission regulation no 10 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food the named additives have no specific migration limit sml which means they have a generic migration limit of 60 mg kg of food particular caps with these additives shall not transfer their constituents to food simulants in quantities exceeding 10 mg of total constituents released per dm2 of food contact surface mg dm2 ec 2011a regarding toxicity the potential risk of erucamide to human health is considered to be low eccc hc 2018 no hazards were identified for behenamide echa 2019 however studies investigating the health effects of oleamide are limited and read across from erucamide are applied to fill the data gaps addressing the human health increasing the uncertainty for risk assessment to human health eccc hc 2018 since the information about the use of lubricant is not required by law we performed additional gc ms analyses on caps from the three brands trying to correlate the observed damages and particle release to a specific compound or dose our chemical analyses revealed very different lubricant contents in the three caps they weren t detected in caps from brand 1 while caps from brand 2 and 3 contained 1 0 and 0 08 of behenamide respectively by these results the extent of mp release was not related to the lubricant content on the contrary the brand with the higher release of mp showed the highest lubricant content brand 2 while the brand with the lowest release of mp did not present any lubricant brand 1 suggesting that other features than lubricant content should explain the extent of mp release the great difference existing in cap abrasion among the different brands with brand 2 releasing more than 10 times higher than brand 1 could be explained by the structural features of the cap bottleneck system the cap neck friction and the subsequent release of mps from brand 2 could have been caused by the sequence of sectors of its bottleneck visible in fig 5 rather than a continuous ring as in brand 1 and 3 this structural difference in bottleneck design is clearly an important element and could explain our results the bottleneck structure divided by sectors as the one of brand 2 can be the main reason of increased mp particle release in our samples it must be considered that our results derive from a series of 100 times opening closing which is normally hard to obtain with a 500 ml plastic bottle nonetheless such a result can be achieved by the systematic reuse of the same bottle throughout a week or even for longer period the repeated refilling of the same pet bottle and mainly the reuse of its hdpe cap is certainly more sustainable but indeed generates a greater number of mp particles which leads to a higher mp exposure in the plastic bottle users with potentially risks to human health welle and franz 2018 who published a literature review on the existing studies on mps in bottled mineral water evaluated the risk for humans based on reported mp content and total mass transfer of small molecules like additives and oligomers concluding that exposure estimations would not raise a safety concern for consumers by our results if plastic bottles are to be re used we recommend rinsing the bottleneck as well as the cap of the bottles to prevent accumulation of mps on their surface results from our analyses showed that most of the mp particles produced by repeated opening and closing series derived from the cap hdpe and stayed below 5 μm in size about 80 98 and 89 for brand 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 4b and that for brand 2 and 3 bottles about one third of the whole particles were below 1 μm size class 0 5 0 99 μm confirming the very small nature of these mps analogous to nonplastic nanomaterials it is very likely that also for mps size may play a pivotal role in their toxicity with the smallest particles being the most dangerous this has already been reported in mammals kubo et al 1999 literature about potential toxicity of mps is constantly increasing in number but data on the effects of mps on living organisms are sometimes contradictory in fact while many studies have demonstrated that mp ingestion is able to induce sub lethal adverse effects on different animals alomar et al 2017 blarer and burkhardt holm 2016 lu et al 2016 other studies have reported light or null effects imhof et al 2017 kaposi et al 2014 weber et al 2018 unfortunately no information on the effects of ingested mps in humans is available so far even though in human the intestinal absorption of mps appears to be limited the epithelium of the gut is not impenetrable to nanoplastics nps indeed in vivo human data on nps are not available and only ps has been used as model particle in mammalian in vivo and in vitro studies lusher et al 2017 we were not able to detect nps which are smaller than 100 nm by definition ec 2011b however their possible toxicity despite their relative low mass is worth of further and more detailed studies a very recent review eerkes medrano et al 2019 underlined this issue additionally reporting that bottled water had the highest number of mps with respect to tap water but with a considerably lower mass due to their small size since all plastics contain reactive oxygen species ros due to their polymerization and processing history wright and kelly 2017 mps ingested via drinking water can produce oxidative stress which may lead to chronic inflammation and tissue damage even by minimizing the possible mp uptake with the simplest one time use of pet bottled water one opening only which did not produce an evident release of mps in the cap bottleneck area the re use of pet bottles and especially the repeated cap bottleneck frictions can produce impressive mp numbers up to millions of particles and consequently a higher exposure risk 4 2 effects of mechanical stress on pet bottles results from our analyses of filtered water after 0 1 and 10 min squeezing bottle test showed no significant differences among the samples neither considering the total particle number nor the particles 3 μm accordingly the eds analysis confirmed only few particles to be of plastic origin and looking at the inner wall surfaces of the pet bottles subjected to continued crushing squeezing test no ultrastructural differences were observed by sem even after 10 min of treatment some minor deformation lines excluded fig 7 the mechanical stress tested in this paper wanted to mime a normal bottle use considering that such a stress can derive during drinking carrying and by handling bottles especially when they are half empty even 10 min treatment does not seem unrealistic the experimental set up was designed to primarily determine possible mp i e particles from both pet bottle and pe cap increase in water due to the treatments although mp identification via eds is solely based on the elemental composition and c o ratio the risk of misinterpretation for pet particles is low due to the very clear c o ratio and strong oxygen peak on the contrary particles on filters identified as hdpe could potentially derive from other polymers containing only carbon and hydrogen such as pp or ps anyway sem imaging is a powerful tool for material inspection the analysis of the inner bottle surface the morphological study of the bottle neck design and cap opening system greatly help in identifying new mp generation and detachment sites mainly in a study that aims at finding potential sources of mps after the application of strong mechanical stress thus sem eds results were suitable for our purposes even though limiting when polymers with no distinct element peaks such as oxygen in pet and chlorine in pvc need to be identified wang et al 2017 the presence of mps in water from single use pet bottled was already considered data from the few published papers reported inconsistent results mainly due the use of non standardized procedures in preparing and analysing the samples wiesheu et al 2016 considering a bottled mineral water and using μ raman spectroscopy did not reported significant differences between the sample and the controls both showing a high number of fibres in the size range between 1 and 5 μm schymanski et al 2018 found 14 14 mps l 5 μm applying μ raman spectroscopy while ossmann et al 2018 by the same methodology identified 2649 2857 mps l 1 μm with more than 98 being 5 μm mason et al 2018 applying the nile red tagging methodology party combined with ftir spectroscopy reported that 93 of all tested single use pet bottles showed signs of mp contamination with an average of 325 mps l 6 5 μm more recently zuccarello et al 2019 by sem eds methodology found 5 42e 07 1 95e 07 mps l bottled water 0 5 10 μm unfortunately this paper does not describe the details for the mps extraction and analytical method referring to a patent for industrial invention registered to the italian ministry of economic development which is not of public domain moreover the reported concentrations refer to the general particle content and could not distinguish between plastic polymer dust or other components that might explain the exceedingly high number of detected mps apart from this they further found a correlation of water particle content and bottle plastic thickness hard plastics cause the release of bigger fragments but in minor number which could not be confirmed by our study according to a recent comment on the study by zuccarello et al 2019 published by ossmann et al 2019 the results of the study are more than questionable the authors not only criticize the lack of information about the methodology but also highlight the need for good quality research in order to deliver reliable data for an adequate assessment therefore we excluded the very high values by zuccarello et al 2019 from our analysis in general a comparison of mp content in bottled mineral water with results from the available studies is difficult due to the different experimental setup and targeted plastic polymers our results 148 253 sd mps l compared to those by the other studies for single use pet bottles zuccarello s excluded are summarized in table 1 values were directly taken from the respective articles differences in the number of mps l among published studies can be explained by considering the different size limit of detectable particle due to the applied technique which varies within these studies as increasing concentration values are correlated to decreasing particle size limit for polymer identification mason et al 2018 was limited to a polymer identification of particles larger than 100 μm hence the small number compared to our results however also mp concentration by schymanski et al 2018 and ossmann et al 2018 differed from ours despite the particle size limits for polymer identification differed only slightly to ours it gives proof to the findings by ossmann et al 2018 who found increasing number of mps with decreasing particle size with 98 of particles in single use bottles being smaller than 5 μm as ossmann et al 2018 already stated every extrapolation causes increasing uncertainty nevertheless our results support the findings by ossmann et al 2018 and schymanski et al 2018 who report pet to be the predominant polymer type present in bottled mineral water this contradicts the findings by mason et al 2018 who suspect caps to be the main source of pollution as they mainly found pe particles in their water since the detected pet particles in the present study did not significantly increase with the treatment it is likely that they were due to the wear of the plastic bottles before purchasing as before schymanski et al 2018 suggested or to the filling processes it must be noted that the highest mp concentration was found in both treated and untreated samples confirming that the applied mechanical treatment did not produce an evident effect on mp particle release this indicates a reliable behavior of the plastic polymers used in the bottles selected for our test and confirms pet as an effective material capable to sustain repeated squeezing without gross deteriorations at least at rt since the concentration in mass of microplastic per volume of beverage in μg l has become an important parameter value for risk assessment welle and franz 2018 we calculated the concentration of mp particles from the number of particles and their sizes following welle and franz 2018 the calculation is presented in the supporting information table s1 and resulting values are given in table 1 data highlight the differences between the studies regarding particle sizes with ossmann et al 2018 having a much lower mass concentration than schymanski et al 2018 despite the much higher particle number our value 1 71 μg l is very near to that of schymanski et al 2018 1 8 μg l following welle and franz 2018 our exposure estimations would not raise a safety concern for consumers 5 conclusions this study provides more data for exposure estimates to mps of plastic bottled mineral water we found pet bottlenecks and hdpe caps to present a serious source of mps especially following extended mechanical stress opening and closing procedure interestingly high differences in measured mp density on caps surface existed among brands likely related to the structural design of the bottleneck for brand 1 2 and 3 we measured 63 400 1 225 500 and 333 800 hdpe particles on the inner cap surface respectively revealing brand 2 to release the most mps we detected mps also in drinking water which extrapolated to 1l sum up to 148 253 mps l differently from caps mp occurrence in water samples was not significantly related neither to the applied treatments nor to different bottle types brand supporting the results of total particle counts which were not significantly higher after treatment therefore pet material of our tested brands was resistant towards mechanical stress squeezing crushing test mps in filtered water likely derived from contamination of the water before bottling or due to wear of the bottles before purchase sem eds was suitable for our experimental set up as it provided high resolution images of the plastic surfaces to reveal abrasion quantify particle release and the detection of pet particles in filtered water however this technique reaches its limit when a differentiation of polymers showing only carbon in their eds spectra is desired the use of positive controls proved the functionality of the applied system but blanks revealed the sensitivity of this kind of analysis towards external contamination according to these results though being declared as food safe pet and hdpe used for food packaging exhibit deficiencies such as the release of mps due to frequent use moreover the observed differences in the extent of mp release of bottlenecks caps between the bottle brands reveals a variety in the plastic behavior that should be considered to an optimization of the admission criteria for food contact substances chances of mp ingestion by humans increase with frequent use of the same single use plastic bottle though only from the bottleneck cap system according to welle and franz 2018 mp content in water of previous studies with lower and higher mp content compared to our is not considered a safety concern however there is a lack of information regarding the potential toxicity of plastic polymers to human health research has to be intensified considering the degradation of plastic material and the release potential of particles

18491,various aromatic compounds in wastewater especially industrial wastewater are treated by biological processes in bioreactors which are regarded as hotspots and reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args yet little is known about the relationship between the aromatic compound degradation process and antibiotic resistance here we report on the co occurrence of args and aromatic degradation genes adgs in bacteria in bioreactors we confirmed this by bioreactor experiments and bioinformatics analysis of over 10 000 publicly available bacterial genomes we observed a significant enrichment of args in bioreactors treating wastewater that contained p aminophenol and p nitrophenol the potential hosts harboring args and adgs were mainly pseudomonas leucobacter xanthobacter acinetobacter and burkholderiaceae genome analysis revealed that 67 6 of the publicly available bacterial genomes harboring adgs also harbor args over 80 of burkholderiales xanthomonales enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter pseudomonas and nocardiaceae genomes harbor both args and adgs which strongly suggests the co occurrence of these genes furthermore bacteria carrying adgs harbored more than twice the number of args than bacteria only carrying args network analysis suggested that multidrug beta lactam aminoglycoside macrolide lincosamide streptogramin and polymyxin resistance genes are the major args associated with adgs taken together the presented findings improve the understanding of arg prevalence in biological wastewater treatment plants and highlight the potential risk of the effect of regular aromatic compounds on the selection and spread of args graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance aromatic degradation wastewater treatment activated sludge metagenomics 1 introduction as a public health concern antibiotic resistance has attracted increasing attention in recent years berendonk et al 2015 pei et al 2006 in addition to clinical settings the environment also plays an important role in dissemination of antibiotic resistance wastewater treatment plants wwtps that treat water containing antibiotics and other pollutants are considered as hotspots and reservoirs for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment calero cáceres et al 2014 guo et al 2017 it has been reported that arg harboring bacteria persist in all treatment units of wwtp mao et al 2015 and that some of them can survive disinfection shi et al 2013 and pass through the distribution system to the reclaimed water fahrenfeld et al 2013 args in the discharged activated sludge and treated water may greatly add to the presence of args in the soil chen et al 2016 and natural water lapara et al 2011 hinder the use of reclaimed water hong et al 2013 and impose potential risks to human health therefore it is very important to investigate args in bioreactors factors that affect their occurrence and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies some studies have investigated the diversity and abundance of args in wastewater treatment bioreactors calero cáceres et al 2014 guo et al 2017 mao et al 2015 and showed that antibiotics guo et al 2018 nanomaterials ma et al 2016 and heavy metals di cesare et al 2016 could alter the arg profiles in bioreactors however the knowledge of the relationship between the removal process of various pollutants and its impact on arg abundance in wastewater treatment bioreactors is still quite limited understanding the drivers of arg occurrence is a fundamental step for formulating strategies to mitigate arg propagation in the environment singer et al 2016 it is widely accepted that antibiotics are one of the major drivers of arg occurrence however the co occurrence of args and other genes is also commonly observed in antibiotic resistant bacteria that are resistant to harmful chemicals resistance gene co occurrence is worthy of attention because antibiotics are not the only chemicals that select args for example environmental heavy metal pressure may facilitate the proliferation of args by co selection of antibiotic and metal resistance baker austin et al 2006 di cesare et al 2016 furthermore a growing body of research has shown that co selection of genes resistant to other harmful compounds such as disinfectants ferro et al 2016 nanomaterials ma et al 2016 and biocides wales and davies 2015 also drives selection for antibiotic resistance aromatic compounds are an important class of organic compounds they are ubiquitous in wastewater especially in industrial wastewater fatone et al 2011 stepnowski et al 2002 many of these compounds are not only toxic but also recalcitrant to biodegradation and they can elicit dramatic shifts in microbial community composition and diversity wang et al 2014 it was reported that args could be enriched in aromatics contaminated soils chen et al 2017 moreover a previous study also showed that aromatic compounds might stimulate horizontal transfer of args jiao et al 2017 however little is known about their roles in the co selection of args bacteria and resistance genes that tend to be selected under aromatic compound stress are also not clear in the current study we aimed to investigate the associations between the degradation of aromatic compounds and the selection of args we operated bioreactors to treat wastewater containing p aminophenol pap and p nitrophenol pnp which are important and fundamental materials to produce pharmaceuticals pesticides dyes etc and commonly found in industrial wastewater at relatively high concentrations 100mg l liu et al 2016 mei et al 2019 mohajerani et al 2012 high throughput metagenomic sequencing was used to characterize the dynamics of args aromatic degradation genes adgs and the microbial community structure during reactor operation furthermore with the advent of high throughput sequencing large numbers of complete bacterial genomes from a variety of ecosystems are being deposited in the whole genome database loman and pallen 2015 enabling comprehensive investigation of the co occurrence patterns and associations among different genes in different bacterial species using publicly available bacterial genomes we systematically analyzed the co occurrence of args and adgs and used these data to confirm and extend the experimental results the presented findings increase the understanding of the impact of aromatic compounds on the proliferation of args in wastewater treatment bioreactors 2 methods 2 1 reactor operation three sequencing batch bioreactors sbr r0 r1 and r2 were operated to investigate the influence of aromatic compounds on the bacterial args during wastewater treatment process each bioreactor has an internal diameter of 10 cm and an effective working volume of 2 l the seed sludge of the reactors was taken from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp in nanjing china the mixed liquid suspended solid mlss concentration in each reactor was maintained at 3000mg l during the operation period r0 was used as the control reactor and no aromatic compounds were fed the experimental process was divided into three phases in which three concentrations 10 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 of pap and pnp were successively applied in the influent of r1 and r2 respectively each phase was operated for 40 50 days detailed reactor operating parameters and conditions are described in table s1 2 2 chemical analysis the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n in the effluent from each reactor were measured according to standard methods for wastewater analysis eaton et al 2005 in addition the concentrations of pap and pnp in the effluent were measured using high performance liquid chromatography 1260 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with a c 18 column coupled to an ultraviolet detector at 210 nm and 246 nm respectively a mixture of water ph adjusted to 3 4 using o phosphoric acid and acetonitrile 55 45 v v flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and a mixture of methanol and water 50 50 v v flow rate of 0 7 ml min 1 were used as mobile phases for pap and pnp detection respectively 2 3 sample collection and high throughput sequencing for the study 16 activated sludge samples were collected from the reactors during the operation period one seed sludge sample and five samples from each reactor at different phases the basic information on these samples is summarized in table s2 dna was extracted from each sample

strategy in addition to the 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing was also conducted to obtain the entire genomic information from the sludge samples dna extracted from each sample was used for metagenomic library construction and then sequenced using an illumina hiseq 4000 platform san diego ca usa with a paired end 2 150 sequencing strategy overall 855 million reads corresponding to 128 gbp were obtained the raw metagenome reads and raw 16s rrna amplicon sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive and are available under the bioproject prjna511512 all other data generated and analyzed for supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the additional files 2 4 collection of the public bacterial genomes a total of 10 243 bacterial genomes representing 41 phyla were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genome database in july 2018 ftp ftp ncbi nlm nih gov genomes genbank bacteria to reduce redundancy we removed the duplicate strains according to the organism name for the genomes without strain information in their organism names one representative genome was randomly selected from each species consequently 5585 completed genomes were collated and used for downstream analysis 2 5 microbial community analysis the 16s rrna raw reads were processed and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology tool qiime v 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 briefly paired reads were joined overlapping pairs and grouped by samples according to the barcodes and the barcodes were then removed low quality reads were removed using the quality filtering functions of the split libraries fastq py command in qiime with default parameters all samples were then rarefied to 50 000 reads and operation taxonomic unit otu clustering was performed using the usearch v 6 1 544 edgar 2010 at a 97 identity level the representative sequence of each otu was assigned taxonomy using the rdp classifier as implemented in the parallel assign taxonomy rdp py script in qiime in addition the alpha diversity of each sample was analyzed by using the alpha rarefaction py script in qiime and the shannon chao1

annotated as args by either of the above two tools were retrieved in addition to identify the potential adgs the short reads and assembled contigs were compared with the sequences in aromadeg duarte et al 2014 a novel database for the phylogenomics of aerobic bacterial degradation of aromatics using diamond buchfink et al 2014 a sequence was annotated as an adg like fragment if it met the following requirements sequence identity 90 for short reads or 80 for contigs and alignment length 70 of the query sequence considering the gene length the relative abundances of args and adgs were normalized with reads per kilobase of gene per million mapped reads rpkm 2 8 quantitative real time pcr qpcr analysis according to the metagenomic sequencing results four representative args acrb baca vanra and adeg strongly associated with adgs were selected for qpcr analysis to confirm the results of metagenomic analysis extracted dna was used to quantify the args and 16s rrna genes and the arg

was quantified by qpcr in triplicate using an abi 7300 real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city ca usa a comparative cycle threshold approach was used to calculate the fold change values of the targeted args chen et al 2016 2 9 statistical analysis and network analysis the statistical analysis was conducted using pheatmap ampvis2 hmisc and vegan packages in r non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was applied to cluster samples based on the relative abundance of args adgs and bacterial otus procrustes analysis and mantel test were adopted to explore the existence of a significant correlation between the bacterial community and arg or adg the variations in arg adg and bacterial community composition in different reactors were analyzed using wilcoxon rank sum test spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the associations among args adgs and the bacterial community args strongly associated with adgs are termed adg related args r 0 8 p 0 01 regression analysis was used to evaluate whether the adg related args differed in different reactors and the contribution to the total arg abundance increase network analysis was performed by using gephi v 0 9 2 https gephi org to investigate the co occurrence patterns of args and adgs in the publicly available bacterial genomes and metagenome assembled genomes mags in addition phylot http phylot biobyte de was used to construct phylogenetic trees based on the ncbi taxonomy and itol v4 letunic and bork 2016 was used to visualize a tree based on the presence of arg and adg in different bacterial taxa 3 results 3 1 reactor performance and pollutant removal in the current study three sbrs r0 r1 and r2 were operated for 130 d the control reactor r0 fed with sodium acetate exhibited consistently high cod removal efficiency throughout the reactor operation fig s1a for r1 and r2 the operation process could be divided into three phases based on the concentrations of aromatic compounds in the influents fig s1a during phase i 10 mg l 1 of pap or 10 mg l 1 pnp were added to the r1 or r2 influent respectively the concentration of pap in the r1 effluent decreased from 6 mg l 1 to 2 mg l 1 and the concentration of pnp in the r2 effluent was generally maintained at 3 mg l 1 during phase ii the concentrations of pap and pnp in r1 and r2 influents respectively were increased to 50 mg l 1 the effluent cod concentrations in r1 and r2 reactors greatly increased to 196 mg l 1 and 147 mg l 1 respectively in the r1 effluent the concentration of pap decreased slowly and remained at a relatively high level of 23 86 mg l 1 until the end of phase ii by contrast the pnp concentration in the r2 effluent was maintained at a low level 2 30 5 49 mg l 1 throughout the entire phase ii during phase iii with the increase of the pap and pnp concentrations in the r1 and r2 influents respectively to 100 mg l 1 cod removal deteriorated again in r1 reactor that was not observed in r2 reactor where a relatively high cod removal performance was apparent throughout phase iii the ammonia nitrogen was effectively removed in the three reactors in phases i and ii the removal efficiency was over 80 in most cases during phase iii the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the r1 and r2 effluents increased obviously fig s1b 3 2 profiles of args in different reactors as shown in fig 1 a and b the arg diversity and relative abundance obviously changed in the reactors during their operation notably the total arg abundance in r1 and r2 reactors appreciably increased by 14 7 and 19 2 within the first 34 d respectively after that with the increasing pap and pnp concentrations the total arg abundance in r1 continuously increase to a peak value of 7175 rpkm while the total arg abundance in r2 did not increase and was maintained at 5983 6520 rpkm this was probably because the sludge had acclimated to the aromatics and the microbial community in the reactors tended to be stable by contrast the total arg abundance in r0 reactor which was only fed acetate as the carbon source obviously decreased from 6043 to 4821 rpkm during reactor operation the different arg abundances in the three reactors suggested that the organic substrates in the influent greatly affected arg abundance in the wastewater treatment reactors wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare arg abundance in different samples from the three reactors args with significant differences in abundance p 0 05 are shown in fig 1c the analysis revealed that multidrug beta lactam and glycopeptide arg classes were more abundant in r1 and r2 reactors than in r0 reactor on the other hand only few args e g norb msre and tetc were abundant in r0 reactor the dynamic changes of the top 100 args are shown in fig s2 over 80 of the args were more abundant in sludge samples exposed to aromatic compounds than in unexposed samples in addition to the metagenomic analysis independent qpcr analysis indicated that the relative abundance of the four args tested acrb baca vanra and adeg in r1 and r2 reactors was significantly higher than in r0 reactor fig s3 we then investigated arg diversity in the three reactors overall 28 arg classes which included 1417 different args were detected in the 16 sludge samples by metagenomic sequencing the most dominant arg classes identified were multidrug resistance genes 28 77 followed by macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls 21 04 bacitracin 8 28 trimethoprim 6 11 and polymyxin resistance genes 5 75 these args are commonly detected in wwtps johnning et al 2013 liu et al 2014 further the arg diversity in r1 and r2 samples was comparable while it was much lower in r0 samples approximately 9 1 and 11 4 lower than in r1 and r2 samples respectively as shown in fig 1b 430 args were shared by all the samples and unique args in different reactors accounted for a considerable proportion of args the seed sludge 15 5 r1 14 91 r2 13 31 and r0 6 22 notably the dominant unique arg classes in r1 samples were multidrug 33 02 and mls 21 70 resistance genes in r2 samples beta lactam 79 8 resistance genes were the single dominant class this indicated that aromatic compounds promoted the enrichment of bacteria carrying args and that different aromatic compounds may differently affect the enrichment of different arg classes 3 3 correlation of args with microbial community composition and adgs based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing data the nmds plot separated samples from different reactors into different groups fig 2 indicating the importance of aromatic compounds in shaping the bacterial community according to the alpha diversity indices table s4 the bacterial diversity of the seed sludge was the highest followed by the r1 reactor with those in the r2 and r0 reactors generally comparable the bacterial community compositions were also analyzed otus with relative abundance 1 were not considered fig s4 in the control reactor r0 rhodocyclaceae were relatively highly abundant 40 which was obviously different from the other two reactors the major taxa in r1 reactor were microbacteriaceae 7 94 and rhodobacteraceae 9 57 while the dominant family in r2 reactor was micrococcaceae 10 58 of note the abundance of pseudomonas was significantly elevated in r1 1 83 and r2 reactors 2 58 members of this genus play an important role in the wastewater treatment process because of their ability to biodegrade many aromatic compounds fernández et al 2009 to investigate the relationships between the microbial community args and adgs procrustes analysis was performed to relate the 16s rrna gene sequencing data to arg and adg data the analysis revealed a significant correlation between args and the otu dataset fig 2a further adgs were also significantly correlated with the otu dataset fig 2b mantel test was performed to confirm the arg otu association m 0 3685 p 0 001 999 permutations and the adg otu association m 0 3747 p 0 001 999 permutations to further investigate the relationships between args adgs and microbial community composition the co occurrence patterns of args adgs and otus were reconstructed using a network analysis approach based on the spearman s correlation r 0 8 p 0 01 as shown in fig 3 a the co occurrence network consisted of 110 nodes 42 otus 47 args and 21 adgs and 132 edges detailed information about the linkage between arg and adg and otus related to arg and adg are provided in tables s5 and s6 notably over 42 of otus associated with adgs were also highly correlated with args which suggested that these bacterial species are potential hosts of both agrs and adgs as shown in fig 3b these potential hosts were significantly enriched after phenolic compounds had been added to the reactors among these potential hosts pseudomonas caulobacteraceae and leucobacter have been reported as arg harboring bacteria in previous studies gerzova et al 2014 strateva and yordanov 2009 by contrast the relative abundance of potential bacteria harboring both args and adgs i e otus in fig 3b decreased in the control reactor r0 during its operation further we analyzed the dynamics of adg related args in the reactors fig 3c the abundance of adg related args in r1 and r2 reactors was significantly higher than that in r0 reactor these args may have contributed to the overall arg increase in r1 r 0 8673 regression analysis and r2 reactors r 0 8062 regression analysis furthermore as shown in fig 3d the abundance of args belonging to the classes of multidrug mupirocin polymyxin and aminocoumarin resistance genes increased significantly in r1 and r2 reactors the abundances of arg related adgs in different reactors are shown in fig 3e as expected the overall abundance of arg related adgs generally remained unchanged in r0 reactor while these genes were obviously enriched in r1 and r2 reactors as in the case of args the abundance of all types of adgs increased in r1 and r2 reactors compared with r0 reactor moreover 17 adgs having significantly different abundances in different bioreactors were identified and listed in table s7 3 4 co occurrence of args and adgs in mags in addition to the above statistical analysis we investigated the co occurrence of args and adgs based on genome binning 110 high quality mags completeness 90 and contamination 5 were obtained from the 128 gbp metagenomic sequencing data detailed information on these mags is provided in table s8 and mags harboring args and adgs are listed in table s9 among the 110 mags 23 were annotated as carriers of adgs and 21 were annotated as harboring args such as bacitracin multidrug beta lactam triclosan mupirocin polymyxin and tetracycline resistance genes further 59 of mags harboring adgs also harbored args fig 4 b multidrug and bacitracin resistance genes were frequently observed in the obtained mags and present in 25 and 56 9 of mags harboring both args and adgs respectively fig 4c interestingly all mags harboring both args and adgs were assigned to proteobacteria and 50 of them were affiliated with gammaproteobacteria especially burkholderiaceae and pseudomonadaceae further the metagenomic sequencing reads were mapped to mag contigs to calculate the coverage of each mag to be used as a proxy for the relative mag abundance the total coverage of mags harboring both args and adgs was significantly higher in r1 and r2 reactors than in r0 reactor especially in the late period of reactor operation fig 4a these findings were generally consistent with the statistical analysis presented above 3 5 arg and adg profiles of the publicly available bacterial genomes although it has been reported that args might be enriched in aromatics contaminated soils chen et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge the co occurrence of adgs and args has not been reported before to further understand the associations between args and adgs in bacteria we comprehensively investigated the abundance profiles and co occurrence of args and adgs by analyzing all bacterial genomes available in the ncbi database in general args and adgs were detected in 19 6 1095 genomes from nine phyla and 31 8 1776 genomes from 24 phyla respectively of 5585 non redundant complete bacterial genomes fig s5 as shown in fig 5 a args and adgs were identified in a broad spectrum of taxa and certain args and adgs correlated with specific microbial communities particularly proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria in addition over 67 6 of genomes carrying adgs also harbored args furthermore the genomes harboring both adgs and args belonged to some specific taxa with over 80 of burkholderiales xanthomonales enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter pseudomonas and nocardiaceae genomes harboring both args and adgs fig 5b further the genomes harboring both args and adgs tended to harbor more args two times more on average than the genomes harboring only args fig 5c to evaluate the underlying arg and adg co occurrence profiles in different genomes a count matrix of the arg adg pairs e g uppp benzoate xi and class pairs e g bacitracin benzoate was generated if both genes were on the same genome the numbers of different class pairs are shown in fig s6 further the co occurrence frequency cf was introduced to assess the number of co occurrence of both genes in bacterial genomes as shown in fig s7a five arg classes multidrug beta lactam aminoglycoside mls and polymyxin and adg classes benzoate miscellaneous homoprotocatechuate gentisate protocatechuate and biphenyl were strongly correlated cf 1000 for further analysis the co occurrence network of 578 args and 189 adgs was constructed the entire network 774 nodes and 3752 edges could be roughly divided into two parts fig s7b in the part on the right some specific adgs acted as the center points surrounded by diverse args mainly representing multidrug aminoglycoside and beta lactam resistance genes most args were associated with the following 10 major adgs benzoate xi cf 1617 benzoate i cf 776 gentisate xvi cf 1382 biphenyl xxxix cf 687 homoprotocatechuate vii cf 2461 protocatechuate xxx cf 1039 protocatechuate v cf 586 miscellaneous xx cf 1061 miscellaneous xviii cf 231 and monocyclic xi cf 358 interestingly multidrug resistance genes with the highest cf among all arg classes tended to be loosely distributed by contrast the cf value of the bacitracin class genes was not very high cf 165 2090 and the class was treated as others in the network while uppp bacitracin resistance genes and baca bacitracin resistance genes were both highly represented core points in the part of the network on the left fig s7b this suggested that some args such as uppp baca and ampc beta lactam may serve as potential indicators for assessing the degradation ability of a microbial community 4 discussion in the current study based on the investigation of wastewater treatment bioreactors and the analysis of publicly available bacterial genomes we found the co occurrence of antibiotic resistance and aromatic degradation and we also demonstrated that aromatic compounds may lead to arg proliferation in bioreactors it is known that microbial community structures are strongly associated with environmental conditions which are considered as an important factor promoting the spread of args novo et al 2013 aromatic compounds can cause dramatic shifts in the microbial community composition and diversity in natural and engineered systems because of their toxic and refractory features fang et al 2016 indeed previous studies have shown that organic biocides and antimicrobial chemicals such as triclosan and triclocarban can increase arg abundance by altering the microbial community structure hartmann et al 2016 pal et al 2015 here we demonstrated that pap and pnp two common aromatic pollutants of wastewater guo et al 2016 kuşçu and sponza 2005 can similarly co select for antibiotic resistance and increase the arg abundance in wastewater treatment bioreactors based on the metagenomic analysis of bioreactor samples and the publicly available bacterial genomes from the ncbi database we determined a strong co occurrence of args and adgs this suggested that not only antimicrobials but also other aromatic compounds present in wastewater can result in arg proliferation in bioreactors by shaping the microbial community in the current study many taxa were found to harbor both args and adgs as illustrated in fig s8 abundant args and adgs are present in a typical pseudomonas species pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas species are widely found in the soil and water and have been extensively studied because of their superior ability to degrade a wide range of aromatic compounds such as benzene and benzopyrene fernández et al 2009 wu et al 2011 these bacteria can also degrade naphthalene in the soil gao et al 2017 and are typically resistant to the commonly used antibiotics molina et al 2014 although antibiotic resistance and aromatic compound degrading activities of these bacteria have been separately explored in previous studies degand et al 2015 manchanda et al 2010 partridge 2011 the co occurrence of args and adgs has not been noted and reported the bacteria mentioned above are commonly detected in the natural environment water or the soil however co occurring args and adgs are also prevalent in enterobacteriaceae fig 5b a typical gut taxon this is in agreement with a previous study which showed that many non antibiotic drugs that may contain complex organic compounds can lead to increased arg abundance in human gut bacteria maier et al 2018 of note bacteria with aromatic compound degrading activity tend to harbor more args than bacteria only harboring args fig 5c therefore when these degraders are employed in wastewater treatment systems or the natural environment for bio augmentation purposes the potential ecological risks should be considered multidrug resistance genes fig 1c were the most abundant args in r1 and r2 reactors this is not unexpected because multidrug resistant genes which encode several multidrug efflux pumps are known to mediate decreased susceptibility toward antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents by enabling rapid extrusion of toxins from the cell ramos et al 2002 furthermore aromatic compounds may also increase antibiotic tolerance because of co regulation of resistance genes for example the soxs protein is a regulator for the acrb efflux system in escherichia coli and the expression of soxs is increased in the presence of p nitrophenyl edward et al 2003 the subsequently increased production of the acrb pump could additionally enhance tolerance towards such antibiotics as chloramphenicol tetracycline novobiocin nafcillin and oxacillin edward et al 2003 this is consistent with the results of the current study as shown in fig s3 the abundance of acrb gene was considerably increased in reactors upon pap and pnp treatment in the current study network analysis provided a comprehensive insight into the args and adgs in the generated metagenomic data and the publicly available bacterial genomes bioinformatics analyses revealed 48 adg arg pairs belonging to six adg and 13 arg classes the arg and adg co occurrence patterns in the bioreactor samples were well supported by the results of bacterial genome analysis the comprehensive arg and adg co occurrence patterns further enhance the understanding of their relationship the top six arg classes most likely related to adgs were multidrug beta lactam aminoglycoside mls chloramphenicol and polymyxin resistance genes among 10 adg classes detected genes for the degradation of protocatechuate homoprotocatechuate biphenyl benzoate miscellaneous and gentisate accounted for almost all 96 3 adgs retrieved generally resistance genes for commonly consumed antibiotics were more likely to be highly abundant than other resistance genes which was also demonstrated in a previous abundance based study li et al 2015 it is also worth mentioning that several adgs benzoate xi homoprotocatechuate vii and gentisate xvi were identified as core genes with significant associations with a variety of args fig s7b this implied that should the abundance of a few adgs be elevated by an external stress this would lead to increased abundance of many args interestingly bacitracin resistance gene did not belong to the top six arg classes while uppp was significantly associated with a series of adgs e g adgs in the dashed circle in fig s7b similar observations were made using the mag analysis fig 4 and uppp was present in most mags harboring adgs this may be related to a bacterial defense strategy the uppp gene encodes undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase which is involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall components li and tian 2016 to prevent damage of the cell envelope by antibiotics and other aromatic compounds bacteria need the proteins produced by the uppp gene to maintain cell structure and viability heipieper et al 2007 taitt et al 2014 the ampc gene was also linked to many adgs in some organisms it can reduce influx by outer membrane porin loss or enhance efflux by efflux pump activation jacoby 2009 in addition to the multidrug resistance genes the abundance of other resistance genes such as beta lactam glycopeptide and polymyxin resistance genes also increased during reactor operation this suggested that besides efflux pumps other resistance mechanisms berendonk et al 2015 such as target modification target bypass and inactivation could also be enriched in the bioreactors one possible explanation could be that bacteria with these functions were enriched in the bioreactors in the presence of aromatic compounds as has been confirmed by the current study on other hand some bacteria may acquire resistance upon exposure to aromatic compounds previous studies have shown that some non antibiotic organic chemicals can promote horizontal arg transfer among bacteria jiao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the findings of this study highlight the potential risk associated with the effect of regular aromatic compounds on the selection and spread of args more attention should be paid to the management of systems that treat wastewater containing aromatic compounds from the perspective of arg control in terms of water reuse although aromatic compounds and other organic pollutants could be removed by biological wastewater treatment processes the args occurred in the reclaimed water still deserve attention because args may transfer from one bacterium to another and impose potential microbial risks to the environment and public health hong et al 2013 furthermore we indeed observed some bacteria with aromatic compound degrading functions do not harbor args these bacteria can thus be harnessed for bioremediation and wastewater treatment for the purpose of mitigation of arg incidence however horizontal gene transfer may still occur in these species and allow them to also gain resistance therefore future efforts should be dedicated to assessing the ability of these species to horizontally transfer genes under aromatics stress and developing sustainable bioremediation solutions and wastewater treatment technologies by using the special traits of these bacteria 5 conclusions in this study we provide strong evidence for the co occurrence of bacterial antibiotic resistance and aromatic degradation functions the aromatic pollutants in wastewater can act as major drivers enriching args in the bacterial population and that some args co occur with adgs this was verified by extensive analysis of over 10 000 publicly available bacterial genomes which shows that over 80 of burkholderiales xanthomonales enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter pseudomonas and nocardiaceae genomes harbor both args and adgs and bacteria carrying adgs harbored more than twice the number of args than bacteria only carrying args these findings highlight the potential roles of the aromatic compounds in driving the selection of args declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18491,various aromatic compounds in wastewater especially industrial wastewater are treated by biological processes in bioreactors which are regarded as hotspots and reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args yet little is known about the relationship between the aromatic compound degradation process and antibiotic resistance here we report on the co occurrence of args and aromatic degradation genes adgs in bacteria in bioreactors we confirmed this by bioreactor experiments and bioinformatics analysis of over 10 000 publicly available bacterial genomes we observed a significant enrichment of args in bioreactors treating wastewater that contained p aminophenol and p nitrophenol the potential hosts harboring args and adgs were mainly pseudomonas leucobacter xanthobacter acinetobacter and burkholderiaceae genome analysis revealed that 67 6 of the publicly available bacterial genomes harboring adgs also harbor args over 80 of burkholderiales xanthomonales enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter pseudomonas and nocardiaceae genomes harbor both args and adgs which strongly suggests the co occurrence of these genes furthermore bacteria carrying adgs harbored more than twice the number of args than bacteria only carrying args network analysis suggested that multidrug beta lactam aminoglycoside macrolide lincosamide streptogramin and polymyxin resistance genes are the major args associated with adgs taken together the presented findings improve the understanding of arg prevalence in biological wastewater treatment plants and highlight the potential risk of the effect of regular aromatic compounds on the selection and spread of args graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance aromatic degradation wastewater treatment activated sludge metagenomics 1 introduction as a public health concern antibiotic resistance has attracted increasing attention in recent years berendonk et al 2015 pei et al 2006 in addition to clinical settings the environment also plays an important role in dissemination of antibiotic resistance wastewater treatment plants wwtps that treat water containing antibiotics and other pollutants are considered as hotspots and reservoirs for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment calero cáceres et al 2014 guo et al 2017 it has been reported that arg harboring bacteria persist in all treatment units of wwtp mao et al 2015 and that some of them can survive disinfection shi et al 2013 and pass through the distribution system to the reclaimed water fahrenfeld et al 2013 args in the discharged activated sludge and treated water may greatly add to the presence of args in the soil chen et al 2016 and natural water lapara et al 2011 hinder the use of reclaimed water hong et al 2013 and impose potential risks to human health therefore it is very important to investigate args in bioreactors factors that affect their occurrence and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies some studies have investigated the diversity and abundance of args in wastewater treatment bioreactors calero cáceres et al 2014 guo et al 2017 mao et al 2015 and showed that antibiotics guo et al 2018 nanomaterials ma et al 2016 and heavy metals di cesare et al 2016 could alter the arg profiles in bioreactors however the knowledge of the relationship between the removal process of various pollutants and its impact on arg abundance in wastewater treatment bioreactors is still quite limited understanding the drivers of arg occurrence is a fundamental step for formulating strategies to mitigate arg propagation in the environment singer et al 2016 it is widely accepted that antibiotics are one of the major drivers of arg occurrence however the co occurrence of args and other genes is also commonly observed in antibiotic resistant bacteria that are resistant to harmful chemicals resistance gene co occurrence is worthy of attention because antibiotics are not the only chemicals that select args for example environmental heavy metal pressure may facilitate the proliferation of args by co selection of antibiotic and metal resistance baker austin et al 2006 di cesare et al 2016 furthermore a growing body of research has shown that co selection of genes resistant to other harmful compounds such as disinfectants ferro et al 2016 nanomaterials ma et al 2016 and biocides wales and davies 2015 also drives selection for antibiotic resistance aromatic compounds are an important class of organic compounds they are ubiquitous in wastewater especially in industrial wastewater fatone et al 2011 stepnowski et al 2002 many of these compounds are not only toxic but also recalcitrant to biodegradation and they can elicit dramatic shifts in microbial community composition and diversity wang et al 2014 it was reported that args could be enriched in aromatics contaminated soils chen et al 2017 moreover a previous study also showed that aromatic compounds might stimulate horizontal transfer of args jiao et al 2017 however little is known about their roles in the co selection of args bacteria and resistance genes that tend to be selected under aromatic compound stress are also not clear in the current study we aimed to investigate the associations between the degradation of aromatic compounds and the selection of args we operated bioreactors to treat wastewater containing p aminophenol pap and p nitrophenol pnp which are important and fundamental materials to produce pharmaceuticals pesticides dyes etc and commonly found in industrial wastewater at relatively high concentrations 100mg l liu et al 2016 mei et al 2019 mohajerani et al 2012 high throughput metagenomic sequencing was used to characterize the dynamics of args aromatic degradation genes adgs and the microbial community structure during reactor operation furthermore with the advent of high throughput sequencing large numbers of complete bacterial genomes from a variety of ecosystems are being deposited in the whole genome database loman and pallen 2015 enabling comprehensive investigation of the co occurrence patterns and associations among different genes in different bacterial species using publicly available bacterial genomes we systematically analyzed the co occurrence of args and adgs and used these data to confirm and extend the experimental results the presented findings increase the understanding of the impact of aromatic compounds on the proliferation of args in wastewater treatment bioreactors 2 methods 2 1 reactor operation three sequencing batch bioreactors sbr r0 r1 and r2 were operated to investigate the influence of aromatic compounds on the bacterial args during wastewater treatment process each bioreactor has an internal diameter of 10 cm and an effective working volume of 2 l the seed sludge of the reactors was taken from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp in nanjing china the mixed liquid suspended solid mlss concentration in each reactor was maintained at 3000mg l during the operation period r0 was used as the control reactor and no aromatic compounds were fed the experimental process was divided into three phases in which three concentrations 10 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 of pap and pnp were successively applied in the influent of r1 and r2 respectively each phase was operated for 40 50 days detailed reactor operating parameters and conditions are described in table s1 2 2 chemical analysis the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n in the effluent from each reactor were measured according to standard methods for wastewater analysis eaton et al 2005 in addition the concentrations of pap and pnp in the effluent were measured using high performance liquid chromatography 1260 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with a c 18 column coupled to an ultraviolet detector at 210 nm and 246 nm respectively a mixture of water ph adjusted to 3 4 using o phosphoric acid and acetonitrile 55 45 v v flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and a mixture of methanol and water 50 50 v v flow rate of 0 7 ml min 1 were used as mobile phases for pap and pnp detection respectively 2 3 sample collection and high throughput sequencing for the study 16 activated sludge samples were collected from the reactors during the operation period one seed sludge sample and five samples from each reactor at different phases the basic information on these samples is summarized in table s2 dna was extracted from each sample

gta a 3 and a reverse primer 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 the 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced using an illumina miseq platform san diego ca usa with a paired end 2 250 sequencing strategy in addition to the 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing was also conducted to obtain the entire genomic information from the sludge samples dna extracted from each sample was used for metagenomic library construction and then sequenced using an illumina hiseq 4000 platform san diego ca usa with a paired end 2 150 sequencing strategy overall 855 million reads corresponding to 128 gbp were obtained the raw metagenome reads and raw 16s rrna amplicon sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive and are available under the bioproject prjna511512 all other data generated and analyzed for supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the additional files 2 4 collection of the public bacterial genomes a total of 10 243 bacterial genomes representing 41 phyla were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genome database in july 2018 ftp ftp ncbi nlm nih gov genomes genbank bacteria to reduce redundancy we removed the duplicate strains according to the organism name for the genomes without strain information in their organism names one representative genome was randomly selected from each species consequently 5585 completed genomes were collated and used for downstream analysis 2 5 microbial community analysis the 16s rrna raw reads were processed and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology tool qiime v 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 briefly paired reads were joined overlapping pairs and grouped by samples according to the barcodes and the barcodes were then removed low quality reads were removed using the quality filtering functions of the split libraries fastq py command in qiime with default parameters all samples were then rarefied to 50 000 reads and operation taxonomic unit otu clustering was performed using the usearch v 6 1 544 edgar 2010 at a 97 identity level the representative sequence of each otu was assigned taxonomy using the rdp classifier as implemented in the parallel assign taxonomy rdp py script in qiime in addition the alpha diversity of each sample was analyzed by using the alpha rarefaction py script in qiime and the shannon chao1 and simpson indices and the observed otu number were also calculated 2 6 metagenome assembly and genome binning the metagenomic sequencing data were trimmed and quality filtered using trimmomatic v 0 32 bolger et al 2014 with default parameters then 414 302 854 clean reads from all samples were assembled into contigs using idba ud v 1 1 2 peng et al 2012 with the following parameters pre correction min contig 1000 mink 40 then the reads in each sample were mapped to the assembled contigs using bbmap v 38 26 https sourceforge net projects bbmap a depth file was generated based on the mapping results and used for genome binning using metabat v 0 30 3 kang et al 2015 the quality of the recovered genome bins was assessed by checkm v 1 0 7 parks et al 2015 open reading frames orfs were predicted in the assembled scaffolds using prodigal v 2 6 1 hyatt et al 2010 finally genome taxonomy was assigned using gtdb tk parks et al 2018 2 7 identification of args and adgs clean metagenomic sequencing reads and the orfs were searched for the presence of args using args oap v 2 0 yin et al 2018 and deeparg arango argoty et al 2018 with default parameters reads and orfs annotated as args by either of the above two tools were retrieved in addition to identify the potential adgs the short reads and assembled contigs were compared with the sequences in aromadeg duarte et al 2014 a novel database for the phylogenomics of aerobic bacterial degradation of aromatics using diamond buchfink et al 2014 a sequence was annotated as an adg like fragment if it met the following requirements sequence identity 90 for short reads or 80 for contigs and alignment length 70 of the query sequence considering the gene length the relative abundances of args and adgs were normalized with reads per kilobase of gene per million mapped reads rpkm 2 8 quantitative real time pcr qpcr analysis according to the metagenomic sequencing results four representative args acrb baca vanra and adeg strongly associated with adgs were selected for qpcr analysis to confirm the results of metagenomic analysis extracted dna was used to quantify the args and 16s rrna genes and the arg abundance was normalized to 16s rrna gene copies to enable comparison of different samples tang et al 2016 the primer sets used in the current study are listed in table s3 each qpcr assay was conducted in a volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of sybr premix extaq super mix takara dalian china 0 5 μl of each primer 10 μm 4 μl of dna template 20 ng μl and 5 μl of doubly distilled h2o each arg was quantified by qpcr in triplicate using an abi 7300 real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city ca usa a comparative cycle threshold approach was used to calculate the fold change values of the targeted args chen et al 2016 2 9 statistical analysis and network analysis the statistical analysis was conducted using pheatmap ampvis2 hmisc and vegan packages in r non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was applied to cluster samples based on the relative abundance of args adgs and bacterial otus procrustes analysis and mantel test were adopted to explore the existence of a significant correlation between the bacterial community and arg or adg the variations in arg adg and bacterial community composition in different reactors were analyzed using wilcoxon rank sum test spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the associations among args adgs and the bacterial community args strongly associated with adgs are termed adg related args r 0 8 p 0 01 regression analysis was used to evaluate whether the adg related args differed in different reactors and the contribution to the total arg abundance increase network analysis was performed by using gephi v 0 9 2 https gephi org to investigate the co occurrence patterns of args and adgs in the publicly available bacterial genomes and metagenome assembled genomes mags in addition phylot http phylot biobyte de was used to construct phylogenetic trees based on the ncbi taxonomy and itol v4 letunic and bork 2016 was used to visualize a tree based on the presence of arg and adg in different bacterial taxa 3 results 3 1 reactor performance and pollutant removal in the current study three sbrs r0 r1 and r2 were operated for 130 d the control reactor r0 fed with sodium acetate exhibited consistently high cod removal efficiency throughout the reactor operation fig s1a for r1 and r2 the operation process could be divided into three phases based on the concentrations of aromatic compounds in the influents fig s1a during phase i 10 mg l 1 of pap or 10 mg l 1 pnp were added to the r1 or r2 influent respectively the concentration of pap in the r1 effluent decreased from 6 mg l 1 to 2 mg l 1 and the concentration of pnp in the r2 effluent was generally maintained at 3 mg l 1 during phase ii the concentrations of pap and pnp in r1 and r2 influents respectively were increased to 50 mg l 1 the effluent cod concentrations in r1 and r2 reactors greatly increased to 196 mg l 1 and 147 mg l 1 respectively in the r1 effluent the concentration of pap decreased slowly and remained at a relatively high level of 23 86 mg l 1 until the end of phase ii by contrast the pnp concentration in the r2 effluent was maintained at a low level 2 30 5 49 mg l 1 throughout the entire phase ii during phase iii with the increase of the pap and pnp concentrations in the r1 and r2 influents respectively to 100 mg l 1 cod removal deteriorated again in r1 reactor that was not observed in r2 reactor where a relatively high cod removal performance was apparent throughout phase iii the ammonia nitrogen was effectively removed in the three reactors in phases i and ii the removal efficiency was over 80 in most cases during phase iii the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the r1 and r2 effluents increased obviously fig s1b 3 2 profiles of args in different reactors as shown in fig 1 a and b the arg diversity and relative abundance obviously changed in the reactors during their operation notably the total arg abundance in r1 and r2 reactors appreciably increased by 14 7 and 19 2 within the first 34 d respectively after that with the increasing pap and pnp concentrations the total arg abundance in r1 continuously increase to a peak value of 7175 rpkm while the total arg abundance in r2 did not increase and was maintained at 5983 6520 rpkm this was probably because the sludge had acclimated to the aromatics and the microbial community in the reactors tended to be stable by contrast the total arg abundance in r0 reactor which was only fed acetate as the carbon source obviously decreased from 6043 to 4821 rpkm during reactor operation the different arg abundances in the three reactors suggested that the organic substrates in the influent greatly affected arg abundance in the wastewater treatment reactors wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare arg abundance in different samples from the three reactors args with significant differences in abundance p 0 05 are shown in fig 1c the analysis revealed that multidrug beta lactam and glycopeptide arg classes were more abundant in r1 and r2 reactors than in r0 reactor on the other hand only few args e g norb msre and tetc were abundant in r0 reactor the dynamic changes of the top 100 args are shown in fig s2 over 80 of the args were more abundant in sludge samples exposed to aromatic compounds than in unexposed samples in addition to the metagenomic analysis independent qpcr analysis indicated that the relative abundance of the four args tested acrb baca vanra and adeg in r1 and r2 reactors was significantly higher than in r0 reactor fig s3 we then investigated arg diversity in the three reactors overall 28 arg classes which included 1417 different args were detected in the 16 sludge samples by metagenomic sequencing the most dominant arg classes identified were multidrug resistance genes 28 77 followed by macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls 21 04 bacitracin 8 28 trimethoprim 6 11 and polymyxin resistance genes 5 75 these args are commonly detected in wwtps johnning et al 2013 liu et al 2014 further the arg diversity in r1 and r2 samples was comparable while it was much lower in r0 samples approximately 9 1 and 11 4 lower than in r1 and r2 samples respectively as shown in fig 1b 430 args were shared by all the samples and unique args in different reactors accounted for a considerable proportion of args the seed sludge 15 5 r1 14 91 r2 13 31 and r0 6 22 notably the dominant unique arg classes in r1 samples were multidrug 33 02 and mls 21 70 resistance genes in r2 samples beta lactam 79 8 resistance genes were the single dominant class this indicated that aromatic compounds promoted the enrichment of bacteria carrying args and that different aromatic compounds may differently affect the enrichment of different arg classes 3 3 correlation of args with microbial community composition and adgs based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing data the nmds plot separated samples from different reactors into different groups fig 2 indicating the importance of aromatic compounds in shaping the bacterial community according to the alpha diversity indices table s4 the bacterial diversity of the seed sludge was the highest followed by the r1 reactor with those in the r2 and r0 reactors generally comparable the bacterial community compositions were also analyzed otus with relative abundance 1 were not considered fig s4 in the control reactor r0 rhodocyclaceae were relatively highly abundant 40 which was obviously different from the other two reactors the major taxa in r1 reactor were microbacteriaceae 7 94 and rhodobacteraceae 9 57 while the dominant family in r2 reactor was micrococcaceae 10 58 of note the abundance of pseudomonas was significantly elevated in r1 1 83 and r2 reactors 2 58 members of this genus play an important role in the wastewater treatment process because of their ability to biodegrade many aromatic compounds fernández et al 2009 to investigate the relationships between the microbial community args and adgs procrustes analysis was performed to relate the 16s rrna gene sequencing data to arg and adg data the analysis revealed a significant correlation between args and the otu dataset fig 2a further adgs were also significantly correlated with the otu dataset fig 2b mantel test was performed to confirm the arg otu association m 0 3685 p 0 001 999 permutations and the adg otu association m 0 3747 p 0 001 999 permutations to further investigate the relationships between args adgs and microbial community composition the co occurrence patterns of args adgs and otus were reconstructed using a network analysis approach based on the spearman s correlation r 0 8 p 0 01 as shown in fig 3 a the co occurrence network consisted of 110 nodes 42 otus 47 args and 21 adgs and 132 edges detailed information about the linkage between arg and adg and otus related to arg and adg are provided in tables s5 and s6 notably over 42 of otus associated with adgs were also highly correlated with args which suggested that these bacterial species are potential hosts of both agrs and adgs as shown in fig 3b these potential hosts were significantly enriched after phenolic compounds had been added to the reactors among these potential hosts pseudomonas caulobacteraceae and leucobacter have been reported as arg harboring bacteria in previous studies gerzova et al 2014 strateva and yordanov 2009 by contrast the relative abundance of potential bacteria harboring both args and adgs i e otus in fig 3b decreased in the control reactor r0 during its operation further we analyzed the dynamics of adg related args in the reactors fig 3c the abundance of adg related args in r1 and r2 reactors was significantly higher than that in r0 reactor these args may have contributed to the overall arg increase in r1 r 0 8673 regression analysis and r2 reactors r 0 8062 regression analysis furthermore as shown in fig 3d the abundance of args belonging to the classes of multidrug mupirocin polymyxin and aminocoumarin resistance genes increased significantly in r1 and r2 reactors the abundances of arg related adgs in different reactors are shown in fig 3e as expected the overall abundance of arg related adgs generally remained unchanged in r0 reactor while these genes were obviously enriched in r1 and r2 reactors as in the case of args the abundance of all types of adgs increased in r1 and r2 reactors compared with r0 reactor moreover 17 adgs having significantly different abundances in different bioreactors were identified and listed in table s7 3 4 co occurrence of args and adgs in mags in addition to the above statistical analysis we investigated the co occurrence of args and adgs based on genome binning 110 high quality mags completeness 90 and contamination 5 were obtained from the 128 gbp metagenomic sequencing data detailed information on these mags is provided in table s8 and mags harboring args and adgs are listed in table s9 among the 110 mags 23 were annotated as carriers of adgs and 21 were annotated as harboring args such as bacitracin multidrug beta lactam triclosan mupirocin polymyxin and tetracycline resistance genes further 59 of mags harboring adgs also harbored args fig 4 b multidrug and bacitracin resistance genes were frequently observed in the obtained mags and present in 25 and 56 9 of mags harboring both args and adgs respectively fig 4c interestingly all mags harboring both args and adgs were assigned to proteobacteria and 50 of them were affiliated with gammaproteobacteria especially burkholderiaceae and pseudomonadaceae further the metagenomic sequencing reads were mapped to mag contigs to calculate the coverage of each mag to be used as a proxy for the relative mag abundance the total coverage of mags harboring both args and adgs was significantly higher in r1 and r2 reactors than in r0 reactor especially in the late period of reactor operation fig 4a these findings were generally consistent with the statistical analysis presented above 3 5 arg and adg profiles of the publicly available bacterial genomes although it has been reported that args might be enriched in aromatics contaminated soils chen et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge the co occurrence of adgs and args has not been reported before to further understand the associations between args and adgs in bacteria we comprehensively investigated the abundance profiles and co occurrence of args and adgs by analyzing all bacterial genomes available in the ncbi database in general args and adgs were detected in 19 6 1095 genomes from nine phyla and 31 8 1776 genomes from 24 phyla respectively of 5585 non redundant complete bacterial genomes fig s5 as shown in fig 5 a args and adgs were identified in a broad spectrum of taxa and certain args and adgs correlated with specific microbial communities particularly proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria in addition over 67 6 of genomes carrying adgs also harbored args furthermore the genomes harboring both adgs and args belonged to some specific taxa with over 80 of burkholderiales xanthomonales enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter pseudomonas and nocardiaceae genomes harboring both args and adgs fig 5b further the genomes harboring both args and adgs tended to harbor more args two times more on average than the genomes harboring only args fig 5c to evaluate the underlying arg and adg co occurrence profiles in different genomes a count matrix of the arg adg pairs e g uppp benzoate xi and class pairs e g bacitracin benzoate was generated if both genes were on the same genome the numbers of different class pairs are shown in fig s6 further the co occurrence frequency cf was introduced to assess the number of co occurrence of both genes in bacterial genomes as shown in fig s7a five arg classes multidrug beta lactam aminoglycoside mls and polymyxin and adg classes benzoate miscellaneous homoprotocatechuate gentisate protocatechuate and biphenyl were strongly correlated cf 1000 for further analysis the co occurrence network of 578 args and 189 adgs was constructed the entire network 774 nodes and 3752 edges could be roughly divided into two parts fig s7b in the part on the right some specific adgs acted as the center points surrounded by diverse args mainly representing multidrug aminoglycoside and beta lactam resistance genes most args were associated with the following 10 major adgs benzoate xi cf 1617 benzoate i cf 776 gentisate xvi cf 1382 biphenyl xxxix cf 687 homoprotocatechuate vii cf 2461 protocatechuate xxx cf 1039 protocatechuate v cf 586 miscellaneous xx cf 1061 miscellaneous xviii cf 231 and monocyclic xi cf 358 interestingly multidrug resistance genes with the highest cf among all arg classes tended to be loosely distributed by contrast the cf value of the bacitracin class genes was not very high cf 165 2090 and the class was treated as others in the network while uppp bacitracin resistance genes and baca bacitracin resistance genes were both highly represented core points in the part of the network on the left fig s7b this suggested that some args such as uppp baca and ampc beta lactam may serve as potential indicators for assessing the degradation ability of a microbial community 4 discussion in the current study based on the investigation of wastewater treatment bioreactors and the analysis of publicly available bacterial genomes we found the co occurrence of antibiotic resistance and aromatic degradation and we also demonstrated that aromatic compounds may lead to arg proliferation in bioreactors it is known that microbial community structures are strongly associated with environmental conditions which are considered as an important factor promoting the spread of args novo et al 2013 aromatic compounds can cause dramatic shifts in the microbial community composition and diversity in natural and engineered systems because of their toxic and refractory features fang et al 2016 indeed previous studies have shown that organic biocides and antimicrobial chemicals such as triclosan and triclocarban can increase arg abundance by altering the microbial community structure hartmann et al 2016 pal et al 2015 here we demonstrated that pap and pnp two common aromatic pollutants of wastewater guo et al 2016 kuşçu and sponza 2005 can similarly co select for antibiotic resistance and increase the arg abundance in wastewater treatment bioreactors based on the metagenomic analysis of bioreactor samples and the publicly available bacterial genomes from the ncbi database we determined a strong co occurrence of args and adgs this suggested that not only antimicrobials but also other aromatic compounds present in wastewater can result in arg proliferation in bioreactors by shaping the microbial community in the current study many taxa were found to harbor both args and adgs as illustrated in fig s8 abundant args and adgs are present in a typical pseudomonas species pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas species are widely found in the soil and water and have been extensively studied because of their superior ability to degrade a wide range of aromatic compounds such as benzene and benzopyrene fernández et al 2009 wu et al 2011 these bacteria can also degrade naphthalene in the soil gao et al 2017 and are typically resistant to the commonly used antibiotics molina et al 2014 although antibiotic resistance and aromatic compound degrading activities of these bacteria have been separately explored in previous studies degand et al 2015 manchanda et al 2010 partridge 2011 the co occurrence of args and adgs has not been noted and reported the bacteria mentioned above are commonly detected in the natural environment water or the soil however co occurring args and adgs are also prevalent in enterobacteriaceae fig 5b a typical gut taxon this is in agreement with a previous study which showed that many non antibiotic drugs that may contain complex organic compounds can lead to increased arg abundance in human gut bacteria maier et al 2018 of note bacteria with aromatic compound degrading activity tend to harbor more args than bacteria only harboring args fig 5c therefore when these degraders are employed in wastewater treatment systems or the natural environment for bio augmentation purposes the potential ecological risks should be considered multidrug resistance genes fig 1c were the most abundant args in r1 and r2 reactors this is not unexpected because multidrug resistant genes which encode several multidrug efflux pumps are known to mediate decreased susceptibility toward antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents by enabling rapid extrusion of toxins from the cell ramos et al 2002 furthermore aromatic compounds may also increase antibiotic tolerance because of co regulation of resistance genes for example the soxs protein is a regulator for the acrb efflux system in escherichia coli and the expression of soxs is increased in the presence of p nitrophenyl edward et al 2003 the subsequently increased production of the acrb pump could additionally enhance tolerance towards such antibiotics as chloramphenicol tetracycline novobiocin nafcillin and oxacillin edward et al 2003 this is consistent with the results of the current study as shown in fig s3 the abundance of acrb gene was considerably increased in reactors upon pap and pnp treatment in the current study network analysis provided a comprehensive insight into the args and adgs in the generated metagenomic data and the publicly available bacterial genomes bioinformatics analyses revealed 48 adg arg pairs belonging to six adg and 13 arg classes the arg and adg co occurrence patterns in the bioreactor samples were well supported by the results of bacterial genome analysis the comprehensive arg and adg co occurrence patterns further enhance the understanding of their relationship the top six arg classes most likely related to adgs were multidrug beta lactam aminoglycoside mls chloramphenicol and polymyxin resistance genes among 10 adg classes detected genes for the degradation of protocatechuate homoprotocatechuate biphenyl benzoate miscellaneous and gentisate accounted for almost all 96 3 adgs retrieved generally resistance genes for commonly consumed antibiotics were more likely to be highly abundant than other resistance genes which was also demonstrated in a previous abundance based study li et al 2015 it is also worth mentioning that several adgs benzoate xi homoprotocatechuate vii and gentisate xvi were identified as core genes with significant associations with a variety of args fig s7b this implied that should the abundance of a few adgs be elevated by an external stress this would lead to increased abundance of many args interestingly bacitracin resistance gene did not belong to the top six arg classes while uppp was significantly associated with a series of adgs e g adgs in the dashed circle in fig s7b similar observations were made using the mag analysis fig 4 and uppp was present in most mags harboring adgs this may be related to a bacterial defense strategy the uppp gene encodes undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase which is involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall components li and tian 2016 to prevent damage of the cell envelope by antibiotics and other aromatic compounds bacteria need the proteins produced by the uppp gene to maintain cell structure and viability heipieper et al 2007 taitt et al 2014 the ampc gene was also linked to many adgs in some organisms it can reduce influx by outer membrane porin loss or enhance efflux by efflux pump activation jacoby 2009 in addition to the multidrug resistance genes the abundance of other resistance genes such as beta lactam glycopeptide and polymyxin resistance genes also increased during reactor operation this suggested that besides efflux pumps other resistance mechanisms berendonk et al 2015 such as target modification target bypass and inactivation could also be enriched in the bioreactors one possible explanation could be that bacteria with these functions were enriched in the bioreactors in the presence of aromatic compounds as has been confirmed by the current study on other hand some bacteria may acquire resistance upon exposure to aromatic compounds previous studies have shown that some non antibiotic organic chemicals can promote horizontal arg transfer among bacteria jiao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the findings of this study highlight the potential risk associated with the effect of regular aromatic compounds on the selection and spread of args more attention should be paid to the management of systems that treat wastewater containing aromatic compounds from the perspective of arg control in terms of water reuse although aromatic compounds and other organic pollutants could be removed by biological wastewater treatment processes the args occurred in the reclaimed water still deserve attention because args may transfer from one bacterium to another and impose potential microbial risks to the environment and public health hong et al 2013 furthermore we indeed observed some bacteria with aromatic compound degrading functions do not harbor args these bacteria can thus be harnessed for bioremediation and wastewater treatment for the purpose of mitigation of arg incidence however horizontal gene transfer may still occur in these species and allow them to also gain resistance therefore future efforts should be dedicated to assessing the ability of these species to horizontally transfer genes under aromatics stress and developing sustainable bioremediation solutions and wastewater treatment technologies by using the special traits of these bacteria 5 conclusions in this study we provide strong evidence for the co occurrence of bacterial antibiotic resistance and aromatic degradation functions the aromatic pollutants in wastewater can act as major drivers enriching args in the bacterial population and that some args co occur with adgs this was verified by extensive analysis of over 10 000 publicly available bacterial genomes which shows that over 80 of burkholderiales xanthomonales enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter pseudomonas and nocardiaceae genomes harbor both args and adgs and bacteria carrying adgs harbored more than twice the number of args than bacteria only carrying args these findings highlight the potential roles of the aromatic compounds in driving the selection of args declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18492,improving the yield and methane content of biogas is of great concern for wastewater treatment by anaerobic digestion herein we developed a nanomagnetite enhanced electromethanogenesis emnano process for the first time the sustainable utilization of which improved the biomethane production rate from dairy wastewater the maximum ch4 production rate in the emnano process is 2 3 0 3 fold higher than it is in the conventional methanogenesis cm process and it is accompanied by an almost delay free start up the technical economic evaluation revealed that an 82 1 5 0 greater net benefit was obtained in the third generation of the emnano process compared with the cm process the improved methanogenesis was attributed to the formation of dense planktonic cell co aggregates that are triggered by nanomagnetite which facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during acetoclastic methanogenesis simultaneously a cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity was also formed in the emnano process that decreased the biofilm resistance and facilitated the electron transfer during electromethanogenesis this study is a worthwhile attempt to combine recyclable conductive materials with an electromethanogenesis process for wastewater treatment and it effectively achieves energy recovery with high stability and cost effectiveness graphical abstract image 1 keywords electromethanogenesis nanomagnetite biogas upgrading interaction network technical economic evaluation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion technology has been widely employed for the treatment of organic waste streams with unique environmental advantages including the production of biogas as renewable energy mao et al 2015 the methane ch4 content and yield in biogas determine the economic feasibility of anaerobic digestion technology and research into these fields has attracted great attention in recent years angelidaki et al 2018 although various methods have been provided to promote ch4 production and upgrading in the conventional methanogenesis cm process agneessens et al 2017 serejo et al 2015 augelletti et al 2017 the high cost and operational complexity has prompted researchers to develop more cost effective alternatives electromethanogenesis em is a promising electrically driven technology that introduces electrodes into the anaerobic digestion environment for high grade ch4 production compared with the cm process the electrical current in the em process can supply sustainable electrons for microbial cell metabolism which effectively drives unbalanced anaerobic digestion that does not require stoichiometric balance with respect to the oxidation states of substrates and products sturm richter et al 2015 meanwhile the additional electron source is also beneficial for overcoming the thermodynamic limits to biochemical reactions which are often caused by the transient accumulation of potentially inhibitory substances that slow down or interrupt the anaerobic digestion process by disrupting the homeostatic equilibrium of microbes labatut et al 2014 however the challenge of constructing a highly conductive network for efficient electron transfer even across long distances from the electrode to the medium is a critical limiting factor of em performance a dead inner layer biofilm that is in close contact with the cathode was often observed due to the accumulation of metabolic end products during the em process ren et al 2018 additionally most electroactive bacteria might be forced away from the electrode surface as the biofilm grows liu et al 2018 these problems affect the electron exchange across the biofilm thickness and limit the ch4 production although genetic tools were employed in recent years to induce more electron transfer protein and molecule production on the biocathode min et al 2017 the process was too complex for industrial applications therefore more efforts should be dedicated to developing a highly conductive network for efficient electron transfer in the em process including the biocathode and suspension magnetite is an abundant mineral that might play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles previous studies confirmed that the addition of nanomagnetite enhanced the interaction between syntrophic microorganisms and accelerated ch4 production from different substrates such as ethanol acetate propionate and butyrate martins et al 2018 for instance cruz viggi et al 2014 demonstrated that the supplementation of magnetite particles triggered the more robust syntrophic pathway of methanogenic propionate degradation and enhanced the ch4 production rate by 33 wang et al 2018 also found that adding 50 mg g total solid magnetite clearly reduced the accumulation of short chain fatty acids and improved the ch4 production rate by 26 6 this has inspired our exploration of the potential of magnetite for the improvement of em performance particularly it is of great interest to know the performance stability of the nanomagnetite supported em process emnano when nanomagnetite is recycled by a magnetic field this recycling was enabled because nanomagnetite or nanomagnetite supported aggregates would migrate quickly in the magnetic field due to the excellent magnetic properties and that process might provide an opportunity for their enrichment and reuse as necessary therefore nanomagnetite was selected as the recyclable conductive material and its effects on ch4 production and upgrading with a multi cycle em process was studied for the first time the temporal spatial changes in the viabilities and electrochemical properties of planktonic cells and cathode biofilms in the emnano process were investigated meanwhile the preliminary technical economic evaluation of the emnano process was evaluated this work is expected to provide new insight into the strategies designed for the improvement of em performance during wastewater treatment 2 materials

wastewater next based on the results of preliminary experiments fig s2 0 1 g 2 5 g l of nanomagnetite was added to construct the emnano reactor for investigating its effect on methanogenesis the cm reactor was also constructed in 150 ml anaerobic serum bottles as a control all the reactors were incubated at 35 2 c under continuous mixing with magnetic stirrers after being flushed with n2 gas for 30 min the stirring speed was selected as 150 rpm based on the ch4 production yield and thickness of the cathode biofilm fig s3 once the increasing percentage of ch4 yield was statistically insignificant p 0 05 between two consecutive sampling intervals in the emnano reactor the nanomagnetite particles and nanomagnetite supported aggregates in suspension were harvested from the inner wall of the reactor by a neodymium magnet with a magnetic flux density of 0 82 t fig s4 then nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 0 5 l min was input into the reactors through the gas inlet for 10 min which effectively drove the liquid discharge from the outlet under a strict anaerobic environment after that the neodymium magnet was removed and 40 ml of new dairy farm wastewater was added to the reactors simultaneously the feedstocks in the cm and em reactors were replaced and then the new generation was started for a total of three generations 2 3 analytical methods a gas chromatograph gc2014

generation respectively coupled with a 53 5 7 2 and 38 4 1 5 increase in the maximum ch4 yield p the performance was better than what was reported by wang et al 2018 in which magnetite resulted in the increase in the r max value by 26 6 during the anaerobic digestion of high solids sewage sludge meanwhile the lag phase of the emnano reactor in the third generation was only 0 02 0 01 d demonstrating the almost delay free start up of methanogenesis importantly the ch4 percentage in biogas with the emnano process was always higher than the percentage in the biogas from the cm and em processes over three generations the highest value reached 95 2 0 1 in the third generation of the emnano reactor which met the high fuel standard and could be used as biomethane 95 methane content in biogas angelidaki et al 2018 the results demonstrated the superiority of the emnano process in the in situ upgrading of biogas compared with other upgrading processes such as the exogenous addition of h2 with low water solubility mulat et al 2017 it was possible that nanomagnetite in the emnano process served as an effective solid conduit that might substitute the pili associated cytochrome omcs for quick electron transfer between different microbial species which alleviated the energy needed for the production of c type cytochromes liu et al 2015 in addition magnetite contains fe ii and fe iii which might act as batteries to store electrons from electron releasing microorganisms when no other terminal electron acceptors were available then the electrons could be donated when needed shi et al 2016 therefore the interaction between microorganisms and nanomagnetite provided sufficient reducing equivalents h to achieve co2 to ch4 conversion by methanogens 3 2 nanomagnetite promotes acetoclastic methanogenesis via facilitating electron exchange between planktonic cells complex organic matter is broken down into simple soluble organic compounds during the anaerobic digestion process these compounds include polysaccharides proteins and vfas which are the precursors of ch4 production as shown in fig 1b no obvious difference p 0 05 table s3 in the concentration of soluble organic compounds was observed between three different reactors in the first generation this was probably because the inoculum needed time to synthesize the related enzymes and cell constituents to acclimate to a new environment with the nanomagnetite and current although the positive role of these factors on the anaerobic digestion process was demonstrated ye et al 2018b however the reduction percentages of soluble organic compounds in the emnano reactor reached 60 2 5 6 and 63 8 4 9 in the second and third generations at day 6 respectively which were higher than those in the cm 25 1 2 8 and 36 2 3 2 and em reactors 34 2 2 7 and 43 1 3 1 the results illustrate that the integration of nanomagnetite and current effectively accelerated the degradation of soluble organic compounds the dynamics of which were similar to those of ch4 production as shown in fig 1b vfas contributed the most to the decrease in the soluble organic compounds that could be used for methanogenesis acetate propionate and butyrate iso butyrate and n butyrate were the predominant vfas fig 1c propionate dominated the residual vfas even when acetate and butyrate were almost completely degraded this might have been due to its relatively slow syntrophic acetogenesis which was unfavourable in thermodynamics gibbs free energy δg0 0 ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 h 3h2 δg0 76 1 kj therefore the conversion of propionate to acetate did not occur until the h2 partial pressure decreased below an extremely low level 10 4 atm which probably caused the propionate accumulation in the reactor yang et al 2017 in contrast the quicker syntrophic butyrate degradation might be because the butyrate degradation process could be conducted under much higher h2 partial pressure than propionate degradation schmidt and ahring 1993 meanwhile nanomagnetite enhanced the activities of syntrophomonas species that could preferentially utilize butyrate as substrate as shown in microbial community analysis and then the butyrate degradation to acetate might be promoted li et al 2015 similar results were reported by dang et al 2017 in which the butyrate concentration rapidly dropped while the acetate concentration continued to increase during the anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste with granular activated carbon importantly the acetate consumption in the emnano reactor was faster than it was in the cm and em reactors over three generations the acetate concentration in the emnano reactor was only 0 14 0 03 g cod l in the second generation and 0 05 0 01 g cod l in the third generation after 6 d which were lower than those in the cm 1 60 0 03 and 1 34 0 04 g cod l and em reactors 1 11 0 09 and 0 17 0 02 g cod l the results demonstrated that the emnano process effectively accelerated the acetoclastic methanogenesis the fish images showed the architecture of the planktonic microbial consortium in different reactors microorganisms were loosely organized in the cm and em reactors and a large average intercellular distance with curved and slender rod shapes was observed fig 2 a f in contrast adding nanomagnetite to the em reactor triggered the formation of a denser microbial consortium over time fig 2g i particularly obvious aggregates were observed in the third generation of emnano reactor and the dark parts inside were speculated to be filled with nanomagnetite particles the close contact between bacteria green and archaea red in aggregates could efficiently facilitate electron transfer rotaru et al 2014 which accelerated co2 reduction and biogas upgrading from the degradation of organics similar results were observed by zhang and lu 2016 in which conductive fe3o4 nanoparticles were chosen to accelerate syntrophic ch4 production from butyrate oxidation meanwhile as determined with image pro plus 6 0 the relative abundance of archaea methanogens increased from 46 5 5 2 to 61 1 4 2 over three generations in the emnano reactor which was higher than that reported in other study liu et al 2012 this could be attributed to the additional current that drove the organics oxidation which reduced the acidity to create favourable metabolic environment for archaea methanogens villano et al 2010 similar results were reported by zhao et al 2014 in which the relative abundance of methanogens reached 56 3 in an electric biological anaerobic reactor moreover the porous solid surfaces and electrically conductive properties of nanomagnetite particles enabled the rapid attachment and electron acceptance of methanogens which was also beneficial for the enrichment lei et al 2018 from the tem images fig 2j l it was found that the recycling of nanomagnetite particles effectively facilitated the enrichment of microorganisms particularly more cells were observed that were tightly associated with nanomagnetite in the third generation of the emnano reactor microbial communities were analysed using 16s rrna sequencing to compare the community structure diversity and function in different reactors ecological diversity indices of the planktonic microorganisms in suspension the chao 1 and the shannon indices increased in the first two generations of three reactors table s4 particularly the larger numerical values in the emnano reactor suggested an increase in microbial diversity which might contribute to the quicker degradation of organics in the emnano process compared to other processes unexpectedly the chao 1 and shannon indices of planktonic microorganisms decreased from 921 52 to 749 47 and from 7 22 0 29 to 5 48 0 30 in the third generation of the emnano reactor respectively while the values continued to increase in the cm and em reactors a possible reason for this effect was that the highly enriched microorganisms such as methanogens in the emnano reactor had an obvious advantage over other microorganisms in substrate utilization and inhibited their growth in the third generation the phylogeny and abundance of the top 50 otus species for the planktonic microorganisms in the em and emnano reactors over three generations are shown in fig 3 a apart from 4 unclassified otus 19 otus belonged to firmicutes 13 otus were affiliated with bacteroidetes and the rest were attached to euryarchaeota tenericutes proteobacteria and unidentified bacteria as the dominant methanogen for acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 3a the relative abundance number of reads of methanosarcina otu 1 and otu 627 was continuously increased over three generations in the suspension of the em and emnano reactors which reached 59 3 86 6 and 66 3 88 8 of the total methanogens respectively this might be because new dairy farm wastewater was added to reactors at the end of each generation that provided sufficient organics for microorganisms meanwhile the population of methanocorpusculum otu 6 was also enriched in both reactors which could utilize h2 co2 as a substrate for methanogenesis zhou et al 2016 the recycling of nanomagnetite enhanced the activities of hydrolytic acidification bacteria in planktonic microorganisms including syntrophomonas otu 33 and otu 34 clostridium otu 427 and ruminiclostridium otu 30 species resulting in the quicker degradation of organics over three generations in the emnano reactor lei et al 2016 the type iv pili of these species also prompted the extracellular electron transfer to electron acceptors such as nanomagnetite which was beneficial for methanogenesis wang et al 2018 moreover the facultative anaerobe of the acholeplasma genus otu 89 was enriched with the recycling of nanomagnetite particles they could quickly consume oxygen and maintain the strict anaerobic conditions for methanogens that cannot produce anti oxidative enzymes nguyen and khanal 2018 the results suggested that the nanomagnetite supported aggregates recycled and reused in situ by an external magnet shortened the adaptation time and accelerated the growth of microorganisms 3 3 nanomagnetite promotes electromethanogenesis via development of an interior doped cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity the composition and viability of the cathode biofilms are crucial and significantly influence the long distance electron transfer and interspecies interaction similar to the results for planktonic microorganisms the chao1 and shannon indices of the cathode biofilms in the emnano reactor were higher than those in the em reactor in the first two generations whereas the values decreased in the third generation table s4 community structural analysis showed that the cathode biofilms had different microbial communities than those of the planktonic microorganisms in addition to methanocorpusculum otu 6 and methanosarcina otu 1 and otu 627 methanobacterium species otu 186 that consumed hydrogen for ch4 production were also detected among the top 50 otus particularly in the cathode biofilms of the emnano reactor fig 3b meanwhile hydrogenophaga otu 72 has been identified which was proven to use hydrogen and co2 as sources of both energy and carbon park et al 2014 therefore the increasing relative abundances of these otus over three generations suggested possible hydrogen production and utilization on the biocathode some electroactive microorganisms that interacted with the electrodes via extracellular electron transfer were also identified and enriched with the recycling of nanomagnetite including geobacter soli otu 4 which is known to exchange electrons directly with acetolactic methanogens and then improve the methanogenesis martins et al 2018 the higher abundance of these electroactive microorganisms in the emnano reactor illustrated the positive role of nanomagnetite on the growth of electroactive biofilms similar results were reported by liu et al 2018 in which magnetite was found to facilitate the enrichment of electroactive bacteria and improve the electron transfer efficiency of the electroactive biofilm in the microbial fuel cell the interaction networks of the microbial consortium in the em and emnano reactors were further constructed to provide more information about the microbial community structure as shown in fig 3c and d the interaction networks in the em and emnano reactors were linked by 203 and 287 unique interactions respectively the complicated interaction networks were beneficial for the system stability martiny et al 2015 however the different network structures between em and emnano reactors probably indicated the change in potential connections between various metabolic functions of the microbial community after the addition of nanomagnetite particularly increasing connection degrees of bacteroidetes species e g otu 78 otu 49 otu 31 otu 67 otu 53 and firmicutes species e g otu 57 otu 427 otu 19 otu 12 otu 930 were observed in the emnano reactor which might suggest their more important roles during the metabolic process lin et al 2016 meanwhile compared with methanocorpusculum otu 6 in the em reactor a methanobacterium species otu 186 became the key methanogen with the highest connection degree in the emnano reactor the exact reason should be investigated in future research fluorescent live dead staining showed robust biofilms in the em and emnano reactors that were mainly composed of healthy and metabolically active cells green colour in the first generation fig 4 a b although the biofilms were relatively thin compared to other microorganisms growing on the cathodes nevin et al 2010 after this point a dead inner layer red colour gradually developed at the cathode surface in the em reactor to determine the effects of dead inner cells on the electrochemical properties of cathode biofilms during methanogenesis the components of the internal resistances were evaluated using eis and fitted with an equivalent circuit consisting of the solution resistance rs the charge transfer resistance rct and the biofilm resistance rbiofilm fig s6 it was found that the total diffusion resistance increased from 86 50 9 25 ω to 159 46 11 06 ω over three generations in the em reactors fig s7 particularly the values of biofilm resistance significantly increased p 0 05 with the development of dead biofilm these results suggested that inactive dead cells near the electrode surface would slow down electron transfer and mass transfer in biofilms and then impair the electrochemical activity of the outer layer in contrast adding nanomagnetite delayed cell death and the cathode biofilm maintained high viability in the emnano reactor the total diffusion resistance and biofilm resistance of cathode biofilms in the emnano reactor were lower than those in the em reactor fig s7 sem images showed that a small number of nanomagnetite particles were left in the biocathode to develop an interior doped biofilm fig s8 which was consistent with that reported by liu et al 2018 the positive effects of interior doped biofilm on electromethanogenesis were speculated to include two aspects first the nanomagnetite in the biofilm acted as the solid conduit for direct electron transfer from the cathode to the planktonic methanogens that extended away from the electrode liu et al 2018 then the accumulated protons at the cathode interface were beneficial for maintaining a suitable ph range for the growth of microorganisms blanchet et al 2014 in addition the movement of nanomagnetite on the cathode surface throughout the running of the reactor promoted the formation of uneven biofilms which reduced the risk of gas accumulation van eerten jansen 2014 such as ch4 at the cathode surface and alleviated its negative effect on the microbial viability the cvs of the cathode biofilms were examined to evaluate the catalytic activity of reversible redox active mediators in biocathodes fig 5 two pairs of distinct redox peaks with midpoint potentials e1 2 of approximately 0 22 and 0 11 v vs sce were observed in the emnano reactor particularly in the third generation the former e1 2 0 22 v was close to the redox potential of membrane cytochrome b 554 e1 2 0 29 v vs sce yu et al 2018 while the latter was close to that of cytochrome c 1 e1 2 0 13 v vs sce meyer et al 2011 these outer multiheme cytochromes enhanced the extracellular electron transfer in the electroactive biofilms the redox peak current height was associated with the amount of redox active species in the biofilms guo et al 2013 baseline subtracted cv analyses showed that the emnano reactor had a higher redox peak current height than the em reactor indicating the accumulation of more redox active components in the cathode biofilms fig 5b and d meanwhile the more rectangular the cv shape the better the capacitive behaviour of samples xing et al 2004 therefore the cathode biofilms in the emnano reactor exhibited better capacitive behaviour than that in the em reactor the calculated areal capacitance also showed that the biocathode in the emnano reactor had higher calculated areal capacitance from 6 77 0 78 to 19 31 2 01 mf cm2 than what was observed in the em reactor from 9 71 0 83 to 27 73 2 57 mf cm2 over three generations table s5 the results were consistent with those reported by peng et al 2013 in which the capacitance of the electrode increased with magnetite modification during electricity production with a microbial fuel cell therefore it was demonstrated that the addition of nanomagnetite effectively improved the transient charge storage capability of the biocathode 3 4 technical economic evaluation of emnano process as discussed above nanomagnetite effectively enhanced the ch4 yield and rate in the emnano reactor by two main processes in the suspension the addition of nanomagnetite promoted the formation of dense planktonic cell co aggregates which probably facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during acetoclastic methanogenesis moreover nanomagnetite triggered the development of an interior doped cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity the good conductive nanomagnetite inside effectively decreased the biofilm resistance and facilitated the electron transfer and mass transfer during the electrochemical pathway of methanogenesis even when the methanogens were not close to the electrode surface fig 6 when the current to ch4 efficiency that is the fraction of the electrons from the electrode utilized for ch4 production was set to as 100 the contribution of electromethanogenesis to the increased ch4 yield in the emnano process reached 20 5 3 1 in the first generation fig s9 the results demonstrated that more than 79 5 3 1 of the increased ch4 yield was produced via acetoclastic methanogenesis because of the alternative electron demanding processes such as biomass growth on the biocathode then the importance of acetoclastic methanogenesis was still enhanced during the long term operation of the emnano process the contribution of which reached 88 7 5 3 in the third generation the economic potential of the emnano process with the reactor volume of 100 m3 for commercial application was also evaluated based on the ch4 price of 0 38 us mol shafiei et al 2011 the economic value of the produced ch4 yield in the first generation of emnano reactor reached 19 76 0 35 meanwhile the cost of the input current in the first generation of emnano reactor was 5 78 0 53 according to the reported price of 0 34 us mol of electrons hirano and matsumoto 2018 when the costs of magnetite graphite plates and neodymium magnet were also considered the net benefit of the emnano process 8 60 0 30 was lower than that of the cm process 11 00 0 33 in the first generation however the recycling of nanomagnetite particles triggered an increase in net benefit in the following two generations particularly compared with the cm process an 82 1 5 0 greater net benefit was obtained in the third generation of the emnano process with the synergetic effect of electric energy and nanomagnetite particles this net benefit is an attractive economic incentive to promote the application of this emnano technology compared to other technologies table s6 4 conclusion this study is the first to demonstrate that high grade biomethane can be recovered from wastewater with the emnano process the maximum ch4 production rate in the emnano reactor was 2 3 0 3 fold higher than that in the cm reactor accompanied by an almost delay free start up this was because the synergistic effects between nanomagnetite and current in emnano process promoted the formation of dense co aggregates and an interior doped cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity which probably facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during the ch4 production and upgrading it should be pointed out that the experiments in this study only lasted three generations which were a proof of concept that the recyclable nanomagnetite effectively improved electromethanogenesis further studies should be focused on the investigation of the long term effect of the emnano process on the improvement of biomethane production particularly under adverse anaerobic digestion environments such as ammonia inhabitation and temperature variation meanwhile some nanomagnetite particles would be released into the digestate which increases the risk of environmental pollution therefore bio based magnetic particles that serve a similar role could be considered in a future study declaration of competing interest

18492,improving the yield and methane content of biogas is of great concern for wastewater treatment by anaerobic digestion herein we developed a nanomagnetite enhanced electromethanogenesis emnano process for the first time the sustainable utilization of which improved the biomethane production rate from dairy wastewater the maximum ch4 production rate in the emnano process is 2 3 0 3 fold higher than it is in the conventional methanogenesis cm process and it is accompanied by an almost delay free start up the technical economic evaluation revealed that an 82 1 5 0 greater net benefit was obtained in the third generation of the emnano process compared with the cm process the improved methanogenesis was attributed to the formation of dense planktonic cell co aggregates that are triggered by nanomagnetite which facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during acetoclastic methanogenesis simultaneously a cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity was also formed in the emnano process that decreased the biofilm resistance and facilitated the electron transfer during electromethanogenesis this study is a worthwhile attempt to combine recyclable conductive materials with an electromethanogenesis process for wastewater treatment and it effectively achieves energy recovery with high stability and cost effectiveness graphical abstract image 1 keywords electromethanogenesis nanomagnetite biogas upgrading interaction network technical economic evaluation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion technology has been widely employed for the treatment of organic waste streams with unique environmental advantages including the production of biogas as renewable energy mao et al 2015 the methane ch4 content and yield in biogas determine the economic feasibility of anaerobic digestion technology and research into these fields has attracted great attention in recent years angelidaki et al 2018 although various methods have been provided to promote ch4 production and upgrading in the conventional methanogenesis cm process agneessens et al 2017 serejo et al 2015 augelletti et al 2017 the high cost and operational complexity has prompted researchers to develop more cost effective alternatives electromethanogenesis em is a promising electrically driven technology that introduces electrodes into the anaerobic digestion environment for high grade ch4 production compared with the cm process the electrical current in the em process can supply sustainable electrons for microbial cell metabolism which effectively drives unbalanced anaerobic digestion that does not require stoichiometric balance with respect to the oxidation states of substrates and products sturm richter et al 2015 meanwhile the additional electron source is also beneficial for overcoming the thermodynamic limits to biochemical reactions which are often caused by the transient accumulation of potentially inhibitory substances that slow down or interrupt the anaerobic digestion process by disrupting the homeostatic equilibrium of microbes labatut et al 2014 however the challenge of constructing a highly conductive network for efficient electron transfer even across long distances from the electrode to the medium is a critical limiting factor of em performance a dead inner layer biofilm that is in close contact with the cathode was often observed due to the accumulation of metabolic end products during the em process ren et al 2018 additionally most electroactive bacteria might be forced away from the electrode surface as the biofilm grows liu et al 2018 these problems affect the electron exchange across the biofilm thickness and limit the ch4 production although genetic tools were employed in recent years to induce more electron transfer protein and molecule production on the biocathode min et al 2017 the process was too complex for industrial applications therefore more efforts should be dedicated to developing a highly conductive network for efficient electron transfer in the em process including the biocathode and suspension magnetite is an abundant mineral that might play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles previous studies confirmed that the addition of nanomagnetite enhanced the interaction between syntrophic microorganisms and accelerated ch4 production from different substrates such as ethanol acetate propionate and butyrate martins et al 2018 for instance cruz viggi et al 2014 demonstrated that the supplementation of magnetite particles triggered the more robust syntrophic pathway of methanogenic propionate degradation and enhanced the ch4 production rate by 33 wang et al 2018 also found that adding 50 mg g total solid magnetite clearly reduced the accumulation of short chain fatty acids and improved the ch4 production rate by 26 6 this has inspired our exploration of the potential of magnetite for the improvement of em performance particularly it is of great interest to know the performance stability of the nanomagnetite supported em process emnano when nanomagnetite is recycled by a magnetic field this recycling was enabled because nanomagnetite or nanomagnetite supported aggregates would migrate quickly in the magnetic field due to the excellent magnetic properties and that process might provide an opportunity for their enrichment and reuse as necessary therefore nanomagnetite was selected as the recyclable conductive material and its effects on ch4 production and upgrading with a multi cycle em process was studied for the first time the temporal spatial changes in the viabilities and electrochemical properties of planktonic cells and cathode biofilms in the emnano process were investigated meanwhile the preliminary technical economic evaluation of the emnano process was evaluated this work is expected to provide new insight into the strategies designed for the improvement of em performance during wastewater treatment 2 materials

anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor in our laboratory the main characteristics of the dairy farm wastewater and inoculum sludge are shown in table s1 the nanomagnetite was synthesized according to kang et al 1996 and the xrd pattern matched the typical cubic spinel magnetite structure jcpds 19 0629 fig s1 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiments single chamber em reactors with a three electrode configuration were constructed in 150 ml anaerobic serum bottles with a graphite plate anode and cathode 15 12 3 mm the electrode assembly was connected to an electrochemical station chi 1000c ch instruments inc shanghai china and maintained at a constant cathode potential of 0 8 v versus sce the feedstock for the em reactors consisted of 1 0 ml of inoculum sludge and 39 0 ml of dairy farm wastewater next based on the results of preliminary experiments fig s2 0 1 g 2 5 g l of nanomagnetite was added to construct the emnano reactor for investigating its effect on methanogenesis the cm reactor was also constructed in 150 ml anaerobic serum bottles as a control all the reactors were incubated at 35 2 c under continuous mixing with magnetic stirrers after being flushed with n2 gas for 30 min the stirring speed was selected as 150 rpm based on the ch4 production yield and thickness of the cathode biofilm fig s3 once the increasing percentage of ch4 yield was statistically insignificant p 0 05 between two consecutive sampling intervals in the emnano reactor the nanomagnetite particles and nanomagnetite supported aggregates in suspension were harvested from the inner wall of the reactor by a neodymium magnet with a magnetic flux density of 0 82 t fig s4 then nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 0 5 l min was input into the reactors through the gas inlet for 10 min which effectively drove the liquid discharge from the outlet under a strict anaerobic environment after that the neodymium magnet was removed and 40 ml of new dairy farm wastewater was added to the reactors simultaneously the feedstocks in the cm and em reactors were replaced and then the new generation was started for a total of three generations 2 3 analytical methods a gas chromatograph gc2014

statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 emnano process boosted high grade methane production as shown in fig 1 a and fig s5 the em reactor had a higher cod to ch4 conversion efficiency 34 3 0 9 than the cm reactor 28 1 0 5 in the first generation adding nanomagnetite further improved the ch4 production in the emnano reactor the modified gompertz equation showed that the maximum ch4 production rate r max increased from 0 35 0 02 to 0 44 0 03 mmol d and the lag phase δ shortened from 3 32 0 12 to 3 05 0 15 d after the addition of nanomagnetite in the first generation table s2 the improvement was continually enhanced by the recycling of nanomagnetite the r max value in the emnano reactor was 2 3 0 3 fold and 1 8 0 3 fold higher than those in the cm and em reactors in the third generation respectively coupled with a 53 5 7 2 and 38 4 1 5 increase in the maximum ch4 yield p the performance was better than what was reported by wang et al 2018 in which magnetite resulted in the increase in the r max value by 26 6 during the anaerobic digestion of high solids sewage sludge meanwhile the lag phase of the emnano reactor in the third generation was only 0 02 0 01 d demonstrating the almost delay free start up of methanogenesis importantly the ch4 percentage in biogas with the emnano process was always higher than the percentage in the biogas from the cm and em processes over three generations the highest value reached 95 2 0 1 in the third generation of the emnano reactor which met the high fuel standard and could be used as biomethane 95 methane content in biogas angelidaki et al 2018 the results demonstrated the superiority of the emnano process in the in situ upgrading of biogas compared with other upgrading processes such as the exogenous addition of h2 with low water solubility mulat et al 2017 it was possible that nanomagnetite in the emnano process served as an effective solid conduit that might substitute the pili associated cytochrome omcs for quick electron transfer between different microbial species which alleviated the energy needed for the production of c type cytochromes liu et al 2015 in addition magnetite contains fe ii and fe iii which might act as batteries to store electrons from electron releasing microorganisms when no other terminal electron acceptors were available then the electrons could be donated when needed shi et al 2016 therefore the interaction between microorganisms and nanomagnetite provided sufficient reducing equivalents h to achieve co2 to ch4 conversion by methanogens 3 2 nanomagnetite promotes acetoclastic methanogenesis via facilitating electron exchange between planktonic cells complex organic matter is broken down into simple soluble organic compounds during the anaerobic digestion process these compounds include polysaccharides proteins and vfas which are the precursors of ch4 production as shown in fig 1b no obvious difference p 0 05 table s3 in the concentration of soluble organic compounds was observed between three different reactors in the first generation this was probably because the inoculum needed time to synthesize the related enzymes and cell constituents to acclimate to a new environment with the nanomagnetite and current although the positive role of these factors on the anaerobic digestion process was demonstrated ye et al 2018b however the reduction percentages of soluble organic compounds in the emnano reactor reached 60 2 5 6 and 63 8 4 9 in the second and third generations at day 6 respectively which were higher than those in the cm 25 1 2 8 and 36 2 3 2 and em reactors 34 2 2 7 and 43 1 3 1 the results illustrate that the integration of nanomagnetite and current effectively accelerated the degradation of soluble organic compounds the dynamics of which were similar to those of ch4 production as shown in fig 1b vfas contributed the most to the decrease in the soluble organic compounds that could be used for methanogenesis acetate propionate and butyrate iso butyrate and n butyrate were the predominant vfas fig 1c propionate dominated the residual vfas even when acetate and butyrate were almost completely degraded this might have been due to its relatively slow syntrophic acetogenesis which was unfavourable in thermodynamics gibbs free energy δg0 0 ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 h 3h2 δg0 76 1 kj therefore the conversion of propionate to acetate did not occur until the h2 partial pressure decreased below an extremely low level 10 4 atm which probably caused the propionate accumulation in the reactor yang et al 2017 in contrast the quicker syntrophic butyrate degradation might be because the butyrate degradation process could be conducted under much higher h2 partial pressure than propionate degradation schmidt and ahring 1993 meanwhile nanomagnetite enhanced the activities of syntrophomonas species that could preferentially utilize butyrate as substrate as shown in microbial community analysis and then the butyrate degradation to acetate might be promoted li et al 2015 similar results were reported by dang et al 2017 in which the butyrate concentration rapidly dropped while the acetate concentration continued to increase during the anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste with granular activated carbon importantly the acetate consumption in the emnano reactor was faster than it was in the cm and em reactors over three generations the acetate concentration in the emnano reactor was only 0 14 0 03 g cod l in the second generation and 0 05 0 01 g cod l in the third generation after 6 d which were lower than those in the cm 1 60 0 03 and 1 34 0 04 g cod l and em reactors 1 11 0 09 and 0 17 0 02 g cod l the results demonstrated that the emnano process effectively accelerated the acetoclastic methanogenesis the fish images showed the architecture of the planktonic microbial consortium in different reactors microorganisms were loosely organized in the cm and em reactors and a large average intercellular distance with curved and slender rod shapes was observed fig 2 a f in contrast adding nanomagnetite to the em reactor triggered the formation of a denser microbial consortium over time fig 2g i particularly obvious aggregates were observed in the third generation of emnano reactor and the dark parts inside were speculated to be filled with nanomagnetite particles the close contact between bacteria green and archaea red in aggregates could efficiently facilitate electron transfer rotaru et al 2014 which accelerated co2 reduction and biogas upgrading from the degradation of organics similar results were observed by zhang and lu 2016 in which conductive fe3o4 nanoparticles were chosen to accelerate syntrophic ch4 production from butyrate oxidation meanwhile as determined with image pro plus 6 0 the relative abundance of archaea methanogens increased from 46 5 5 2 to 61 1 4 2 over three generations in the emnano reactor which was higher than that reported in other study liu et al 2012 this could be attributed to the additional current that drove the organics oxidation which reduced the acidity to create favourable metabolic environment for archaea methanogens villano et al 2010 similar results were reported by zhao et al 2014 in which the relative abundance of methanogens reached 56 3 in an electric biological anaerobic reactor moreover the porous solid surfaces and electrically conductive properties of nanomagnetite particles enabled the rapid attachment and electron acceptance of methanogens which was also beneficial for the enrichment lei et al 2018 from the tem images fig 2j l it was found that the recycling of nanomagnetite particles effectively facilitated the enrichment of microorganisms particularly more cells were observed that were tightly associated with nanomagnetite in the third generation of the emnano reactor microbial communities were analysed using 16s rrna sequencing to compare the community structure diversity and function in different reactors ecological diversity indices of the planktonic microorganisms in suspension the chao 1 and the shannon indices increased in the first two generations of three reactors table s4 particularly the larger numerical values in the emnano reactor suggested an increase in microbial diversity which might contribute to the quicker degradation of organics in the emnano process compared to other processes unexpectedly the chao 1 and shannon indices of planktonic microorganisms decreased from 921 52 to 749 47 and from 7 22 0 29 to 5 48 0 30 in the third generation of the emnano reactor respectively while the values continued to increase in the cm and em reactors a possible reason for this effect was that the highly enriched microorganisms such as methanogens in the emnano reactor had an obvious advantage over other microorganisms in substrate utilization and inhibited their growth in the third generation the phylogeny and abundance of the top 50 otus species for the planktonic microorganisms in the em and emnano reactors over three generations are shown in fig 3 a apart from 4 unclassified otus 19 otus belonged to firmicutes 13 otus were affiliated with bacteroidetes and the rest were attached to euryarchaeota tenericutes proteobacteria and unidentified bacteria as the dominant methanogen for acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 3a the relative abundance number of reads of methanosarcina otu 1 and otu 627 was continuously increased over three generations in the suspension of the em and emnano reactors which reached 59 3 86 6 and 66 3 88 8 of the total methanogens respectively this might be because new dairy farm wastewater was added to reactors at the end of each generation that provided sufficient organics for microorganisms meanwhile the population of methanocorpusculum otu 6 was also enriched in both reactors which could utilize h2 co2 as a substrate for methanogenesis zhou et al 2016 the recycling of nanomagnetite enhanced the activities of hydrolytic acidification bacteria in planktonic microorganisms including syntrophomonas otu 33 and otu 34 clostridium otu 427 and ruminiclostridium otu 30 species resulting in the quicker degradation of organics over three generations in the emnano reactor lei et al 2016 the type iv pili of these species also prompted the extracellular electron transfer to electron acceptors such as nanomagnetite which was beneficial for methanogenesis wang et al 2018 moreover the facultative anaerobe of the acholeplasma genus otu 89 was enriched with the recycling of nanomagnetite particles they could quickly consume oxygen and maintain the strict anaerobic conditions for methanogens that cannot produce anti oxidative enzymes nguyen and khanal 2018 the results suggested that the nanomagnetite supported aggregates recycled and reused in situ by an external magnet shortened the adaptation time and accelerated the growth of microorganisms 3 3 nanomagnetite promotes electromethanogenesis via development of an interior doped cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity the composition and viability of the cathode biofilms are crucial and significantly influence the long distance electron transfer and interspecies interaction similar to the results for planktonic microorganisms the chao1 and shannon indices of the cathode biofilms in the emnano reactor were higher than those in the em reactor in the first two generations whereas the values decreased in the third generation table s4 community structural analysis showed that the cathode biofilms had different microbial communities than those of the planktonic microorganisms in addition to methanocorpusculum otu 6 and methanosarcina otu 1 and otu 627 methanobacterium species otu 186 that consumed hydrogen for ch4 production were also detected among the top 50 otus particularly in the cathode biofilms of the emnano reactor fig 3b meanwhile hydrogenophaga otu 72 has been identified which was proven to use hydrogen and co2 as sources of both energy and carbon park et al 2014 therefore the increasing relative abundances of these otus over three generations suggested possible hydrogen production and utilization on the biocathode some electroactive microorganisms that interacted with the electrodes via extracellular electron transfer were also identified and enriched with the recycling of nanomagnetite including geobacter soli otu 4 which is known to exchange electrons directly with acetolactic methanogens and then improve the methanogenesis martins et al 2018 the higher abundance of these electroactive microorganisms in the emnano reactor illustrated the positive role of nanomagnetite on the growth of electroactive biofilms similar results were reported by liu et al 2018 in which magnetite was found to facilitate the enrichment of electroactive bacteria and improve the electron transfer efficiency of the electroactive biofilm in the microbial fuel cell the interaction networks of the microbial consortium in the em and emnano reactors were further constructed to provide more information about the microbial community structure as shown in fig 3c and d the interaction networks in the em and emnano reactors were linked by 203 and 287 unique interactions respectively the complicated interaction networks were beneficial for the system stability martiny et al 2015 however the different network structures between em and emnano reactors probably indicated the change in potential connections between various metabolic functions of the microbial community after the addition of nanomagnetite particularly increasing connection degrees of bacteroidetes species e g otu 78 otu 49 otu 31 otu 67 otu 53 and firmicutes species e g otu 57 otu 427 otu 19 otu 12 otu 930 were observed in the emnano reactor which might suggest their more important roles during the metabolic process lin et al 2016 meanwhile compared with methanocorpusculum otu 6 in the em reactor a methanobacterium species otu 186 became the key methanogen with the highest connection degree in the emnano reactor the exact reason should be investigated in future research fluorescent live dead staining showed robust biofilms in the em and emnano reactors that were mainly composed of healthy and metabolically active cells green colour in the first generation fig 4 a b although the biofilms were relatively thin compared to other microorganisms growing on the cathodes nevin et al 2010 after this point a dead inner layer red colour gradually developed at the cathode surface in the em reactor to determine the effects of dead inner cells on the electrochemical properties of cathode biofilms during methanogenesis the components of the internal resistances were evaluated using eis and fitted with an equivalent circuit consisting of the solution resistance rs the charge transfer resistance rct and the biofilm resistance rbiofilm fig s6 it was found that the total diffusion resistance increased from 86 50 9 25 ω to 159 46 11 06 ω over three generations in the em reactors fig s7 particularly the values of biofilm resistance significantly increased p 0 05 with the development of dead biofilm these results suggested that inactive dead cells near the electrode surface would slow down electron transfer and mass transfer in biofilms and then impair the electrochemical activity of the outer layer in contrast adding nanomagnetite delayed cell death and the cathode biofilm maintained high viability in the emnano reactor the total diffusion resistance and biofilm resistance of cathode biofilms in the emnano reactor were lower than those in the em reactor fig s7 sem images showed that a small number of nanomagnetite particles were left in the biocathode to develop an interior doped biofilm fig s8 which was consistent with that reported by liu et al 2018 the positive effects of interior doped biofilm on electromethanogenesis were speculated to include two aspects first the nanomagnetite in the biofilm acted as the solid conduit for direct electron transfer from the cathode to the planktonic methanogens that extended away from the electrode liu et al 2018 then the accumulated protons at the cathode interface were beneficial for maintaining a suitable ph range for the growth of microorganisms blanchet et al 2014 in addition the movement of nanomagnetite on the cathode surface throughout the running of the reactor promoted the formation of uneven biofilms which reduced the risk of gas accumulation van eerten jansen 2014 such as ch4 at the cathode surface and alleviated its negative effect on the microbial viability the cvs of the cathode biofilms were examined to evaluate the catalytic activity of reversible redox active mediators in biocathodes fig 5 two pairs of distinct redox peaks with midpoint potentials e1 2 of approximately 0 22 and 0 11 v vs sce were observed in the emnano reactor particularly in the third generation the former e1 2 0 22 v was close to the redox potential of membrane cytochrome b 554 e1 2 0 29 v vs sce yu et al 2018 while the latter was close to that of cytochrome c 1 e1 2 0 13 v vs sce meyer et al 2011 these outer multiheme cytochromes enhanced the extracellular electron transfer in the electroactive biofilms the redox peak current height was associated with the amount of redox active species in the biofilms guo et al 2013 baseline subtracted cv analyses showed that the emnano reactor had a higher redox peak current height than the em reactor indicating the accumulation of more redox active components in the cathode biofilms fig 5b and d meanwhile the more rectangular the cv shape the better the capacitive behaviour of samples xing et al 2004 therefore the cathode biofilms in the emnano reactor exhibited better capacitive behaviour than that in the em reactor the calculated areal capacitance also showed that the biocathode in the emnano reactor had higher calculated areal capacitance from 6 77 0 78 to 19 31 2 01 mf cm2 than what was observed in the em reactor from 9 71 0 83 to 27 73 2 57 mf cm2 over three generations table s5 the results were consistent with those reported by peng et al 2013 in which the capacitance of the electrode increased with magnetite modification during electricity production with a microbial fuel cell therefore it was demonstrated that the addition of nanomagnetite effectively improved the transient charge storage capability of the biocathode 3 4 technical economic evaluation of emnano process as discussed above nanomagnetite effectively enhanced the ch4 yield and rate in the emnano reactor by two main processes in the suspension the addition of nanomagnetite promoted the formation of dense planktonic cell co aggregates which probably facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during acetoclastic methanogenesis moreover nanomagnetite triggered the development of an interior doped cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity the good conductive nanomagnetite inside effectively decreased the biofilm resistance and facilitated the electron transfer and mass transfer during the electrochemical pathway of methanogenesis even when the methanogens were not close to the electrode surface fig 6 when the current to ch4 efficiency that is the fraction of the electrons from the electrode utilized for ch4 production was set to as 100 the contribution of electromethanogenesis to the increased ch4 yield in the emnano process reached 20 5 3 1 in the first generation fig s9 the results demonstrated that more than 79 5 3 1 of the increased ch4 yield was produced via acetoclastic methanogenesis because of the alternative electron demanding processes such as biomass growth on the biocathode then the importance of acetoclastic methanogenesis was still enhanced during the long term operation of the emnano process the contribution of which reached 88 7 5 3 in the third generation the economic potential of the emnano process with the reactor volume of 100 m3 for commercial application was also evaluated based on the ch4 price of 0 38 us mol shafiei et al 2011 the economic value of the produced ch4 yield in the first generation of emnano reactor reached 19 76 0 35 meanwhile the cost of the input current in the first generation of emnano reactor was 5 78 0 53 according to the reported price of 0 34 us mol of electrons hirano and matsumoto 2018 when the costs of magnetite graphite plates and neodymium magnet were also considered the net benefit of the emnano process 8 60 0 30 was lower than that of the cm process 11 00 0 33 in the first generation however the recycling of nanomagnetite particles triggered an increase in net benefit in the following two generations particularly compared with the cm process an 82 1 5 0 greater net benefit was obtained in the third generation of the emnano process with the synergetic effect of electric energy and nanomagnetite particles this net benefit is an attractive economic incentive to promote the application of this emnano technology compared to other technologies table s6 4 conclusion this study is the first to demonstrate that high grade biomethane can be recovered from wastewater with the emnano process the maximum ch4 production rate in the emnano reactor was 2 3 0 3 fold higher than that in the cm reactor accompanied by an almost delay free start up this was because the synergistic effects between nanomagnetite and current in emnano process promoted the formation of dense co aggregates and an interior doped cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity which probably facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during the ch4 production and upgrading it should be pointed out that the experiments in this study only lasted three generations which were a proof of concept that the recyclable nanomagnetite effectively improved electromethanogenesis further studies should be focused on the investigation of the long term effect of the emnano process on the improvement of biomethane production particularly under adverse anaerobic digestion environments such as ammonia inhabitation and temperature variation meanwhile some nanomagnetite particles would be released into the digestate which increases the risk of environmental pollution therefore bio based magnetic particles that serve a similar role could be considered in a future study declaration of competing interest

18493,microplastics mps are a threat to both the environment and human health in the absence of an official method that would allow the analysis of all mps with diameters less than 10 μm it was not possible to estimate the exact exposure to these contaminants yet in the last years few studies are available in literature with the first data concerning the concentrations of mps on bottle mineral waters zuccarello et al 2019 carried out an exposure assessment study where a high value of edi estimated daily intake has been reported this rebuttal letter aims to reply to the comments of oßmann et al 2018 on the article of zuccarello et al 2019 about the new analytical method and both the use and the interpretation of principal component analysis keywords microplastics estimated daily intake mineral water public health mps release principal component analysis this is the rebuttal letter to the comments on our previously published paper on water research zuccarello et al 2019 provided by b oßmann d schymanski n p ivleva d fischer f fischer g dallmann f welle hereafter also referred to as the authors we are grateful for the chance given us and the comments of colleagues are welcome and appreciated because permit us the further improvement of our article and to provide more details to all other readers of journal our patented method applied in the study will be published and available in the patents list in the next september being the updating of the list of public patents fixed in this time frame the code of the submitted request of international patent s extension in several countries of world is pct ib2019 051838 of 7 march 2019 coupled with italian patent number already mentioned in the article the methodology applied to our study is now wholly reported in the supplementary informations of article but it is legally protected by its use the authors said that mineral water contains numerous particles both of inorganic and organic nature other than microplastics containing also carbon therefore our assessed number of microplastic particles would be over estimated however in our opinion this statement is not true because the first step of our extraction method following the sample s aliquotation is the mineralization by addition of nitric acid suprapur this process transforms both the organic and inorganic carbon into carbon dioxide through a thermal oxidative decarboxylation being carbon dioxide a poorly soluble gas at high temperatures it is entirely removed from the extract so the presence of carbon particles in mineral water cannot affects our counting or assessment of microplastics number sosna et al 2003 roch and brinker 2017 the authors refer that sem edx is a new method for the analysis of microplastics and it is not a valid method for microplastics analysis we do not agree with these statements the sem edx methodology is not a relatively new technique because literature is available about this since 2005 endo et al 2005 surely the sem edx analysis cannot be used for the typing of plastics in fact in our article we indicate the total microplastics in which all the extractable plastic particles are counted according to detailed method described in supplementary information moreover the sem technique allows to achieve higher magnifications at least 1500x compared to other techniques in use including that of μ raman spectroscopy maximum 50x this approach permits an efficient detection and count of the fraction of smaller particles therefore our method allows counting the smaller particles lost with other extraction method the authors refer that the control of sample s contamination is crucial in the analysis of microplastics and suggest this critical issue as possible explanation of the great number of mps it is very important to highlight that according our method the use of plastic tools are not permitted to avoid the cross contamination moreover in order to control contamination during extraction three reagents blanks consisting of nitric acid reagent grade water and dichloromethane were processed and analyzed as the samples fig 2 of the article show the number of particles found in reagent blanks the mean value of microplastics found in the three reagents blanks was subtracted from the result of each sample therefore in our study all sources of contamination are tested as noted in the discussion section the strength of our patent is that samples are not filtered and the contribution of mps from the use of reagents could be accurately counted and subtracted to samples after the extraction of the particles our method involves the dispersion of extracts in stubs of aluminum and copper alloy according to a poisson distribution the studies of schymanski et al 2018 and oßmann et al 2018 report the filtration process of samples in polycarbonate filters we highlight that filtration causes the loss of a large quantity of particles plastic and not having smaller diameters than the pores of the filters in particular in the study of schymanski et al 2018 the polycarbonate filters used had a porosity of 3 0 μm therefore all particles of the samples smaller than the indicated porosities were lost in fact schymanski et al 2018 report in their article that five size ranges to be measured were set as 5 10 μm 10 20 μm 20 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 μm oßmann et al 2018 report in their article that the number of the identified particles was classified in four groups depending on their size 1 5 μm 1 5 μm to 5 μm 5 μm to 10 μm and 10 μm as referred by oßmann et al 2018 the number of mps depends on the investigated size over 95 of the plastic particles were smaller than 5 μm and even about 50 were smaller than 1 5 μm oßmann et al 2018 in our study the main diameters of detected mps ranged between 1 28 μm and 4 2 μm with a main value of 2 44 μm sd 0 66 μm moreover the diameter of the smallest found particle was 0 5 μm welle and franz 2018 report in their review data of studies available in literature considering the size related particle numbers related to multi use and single use pet bottles reported in table 1 of the study of oßmann et al 2018 we observed logarithmic relations between the mean value of mps and their size if we build a semi logarithmic curve we obtain a linear function f x 1 9692x 15 868 r 2 0 88 that we can use to predict the number of mps of 0 5 μm of diameter the estimated number of mps is 2 78e6 next to our data therefore in our opinion our data support and complete those reported in studies of the authors and we agree with them that it is necessary to increase the number of the studies on this topic in particular about the contaminations of nanoplastics welle and franz 2018 moreover we processed again our data excluding mps with diameters below 5 μm and only few mps were found in investigated sem fields the authors indicate that the generally accepted technique for mps analysis is the micro raman spectroscopy we inform the authors the actually several techniques of particle s determination are reported in literature including sem raman spectroscopy ftir optical microscope nmr gc pyr etc but none of these is recognized as internationally reference method for determining and counting microplastics our particle counting methodology was fully reported in supplementary information the our counting method originated from the counting methodologies of asbestos fibers as indicated by several official method including niosh method 7400 niosh7404 niosh 7402 osha id 160 osha id 191 epa 600 m4 82 020 1982 iso 14966 eu 83 477 eec german bia and finally the d m 6 9 94 of the ministry of health of the italian republic for the asbestos fiber counting method our laboratory is accredited accredia in accordance with the european standard uni en iso iec 17025 2005 other authors used this methodology for counting plastic microparticles de falco et al 2018 de falco et al 2019 napper and thompson 2016 in addition through sem analysis the size of particles can be accurately measured through software specific function point to point unfortunately the graph in fig 3 of zuccarello et al 2019 reports some errors on the dimensions of the detected particles due to the erroneous acquisition of the raw data in the spss software the software in fact has mistakenly acquired the data without any decimals in the supplementary information of the study of zuccarello et al 2019 we just attached the correct table 1 reporting the raw data about main diameters of mps supporting the correct fig 3 also reported in the same document the authors refer that our study is not the first study that assesses the presence and the quantity of mps with diameters smaller than 10 μm our study isn t the first to analyze the presence of microplastics below 10 μm but it is the first that estimates the daily intake in adults and children associated with the presence of all particles below 10 μm estimated daily intake of a food contaminant is the amount of contaminant ingested by the average consumer of the food in our case the mineral water exposure assessment is the first phase of risk assessment in epidemiology our approach is according to the u s epa s edi assessment epa 2000 copat et al 2018 fallahzadeh et al 2018 ferrante et al 2018 keramati et al 2018 dadar et al 2016 arena et al 2015 the authors refer that we investigated only ten mineral water bottles and in their opinion this is a small size of samples for pca moreover they say that bottles 1 2 and 9 are found along the plastic density vector referring to the distance matrix and that we wrongly associated a strong correlation between mps concentration and ph against a weak correlation with the plastic density therefore the authors concluded that pca is not a suitable tool for statistical analysis of ten investigated bottle samples finally the authors refer that in our article was not defined the meaning of poor quality plastic concerning to pca applicability several authors turchetti et al 2013 tasselli et al 2018 teychene et al 2018 peiris rh et al 2010 applied pca in studies with a smaller number of data pca is a descriptive method for reducing the dimensionality of datasets increasing their interpretability which can be used on numerical data of various types there is not recommendation about the minimum number of observations to perform pca it depends on discipline which it must be applied to in the textbook of jolliffe 2002 it was also reported several examples of appropriate use of pca based on a subset of data with 15 observations given by hansch one of the main exponents of pca jolliffe 2002 jolliffe and cadima 2016 hansch et al 1973 is clearly described in our article that the analysis of the pca was not carried out on 10 bottles but on 10 mineral water brands for each brand the average of the three values obtained from the analysis of three different lots was considered thus the analysis considered a total of 30 samples moreover the important aspect in our study was that the first two pcs account for 81 σpc1 pc2 of the total variation in the dataset so biplots were a reasonably faithful representation of the positions of the 10 observations in 11 dimensional space jolliffe 2002 therefore in our point of view pca was applicable for our study although the dataset was not large concerning the interpretation of pca the fig 4 of zuccarello et al 2019 cited by authors shows the distance matrix that represent the distance between the brands and the investigated parameters therefore it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the difference between distance matrix and correlation matrix the matrix that correlates two or more variables is the correlation matrix shown in fig 5 of zuccarello et al 2019 smaller is the angle between two vectors stronger is the correlation between the two corresponding parameters it is evident in our study how the parameters ca mg hardness conductivity and fixed residue at 180 c are obviously strongly correlated the only vectors with angles less than 90 respect to that of the number of particles mps per liter are those corresponding to the ph the closest and to the density of the plastic thanks to comments of the authors we checked the densities reported in our article for a mistake it was reported that the weight of the bottle section of the sample 9 was 0 074 g and consequentially the calculated density was 2 36 g cm3 instead the real weight of the section was 0 047 g and the real calculated density was 1 49 g cm3 in the supplementary information of zuccarello et al 2019 it is reported the correct table 2 and the correct pcas figs 4 and 5 current pca confirms the past results moreover to better support our considerations we also performed again the pca considering all 30 samples applying the same method described in the article paragraph 2 4 the plot of the new correlation matrix is reported in fig 1 results are much similar that the past analysis the number of mps in bottled mineral waters is correlated to the ph of waters and now strongly to plastic density of bottle otherwise micrograms of mps per liter and the mps diameters are affected by plastic thickness therefore in our opinion the pca s interpretation is correct our study that investigates possible causes does not conclude that the ph and density of plastics are the causes of the release of mps but could influence it in fact in the article we introduce the hypothesis referring to the article s sentence page 369 it seems that hard plastics cause the release biggest fragments but in a minor number instead the more deformable plastics and weakly alkaline ph would increase the number of smallest mps therefore both parameters can be understood as factors of greater presence of mps but not causes of release although our pca isn t too much robust because of the small dataset it provides some interesting considerations on topic that need to be confirm through further studies finally in the article poor quality plastic is defined as with the examined small 0 073 μm characterized by high deformability the sentence must be interpreted as the most contaminated mineral water by mps was the sample 7 characterized by the smallest thickness of plastic bottle among the examined brands 0 073 μm as well as high deformability conclusion we invite the community to increase the number of studies about this emergent issue in order to compare data and improving our knowledge regarding environmental and human health we thank the authors for their comments to our article because they gave us the opportunity to improve the quality of our study and to clear some points of our article for the further readers

possible to estimate the exact exposure to these contaminants yet in the last years few studies are available in literature with the first data concerning the concentrations of mps on bottle mineral

al 2018 on the article of zuccarello et al 2019 about the new analytical method and both the use and the interpretation of principal component analysis keywords microplastics estimated daily intake mineral water public health mps release principal component analysis this is the rebuttal letter to the comments on our previously published paper on water research zuccarello et al 2019 provided by b oßmann d schymanski n p ivleva d fischer f fischer g dallmann f welle hereafter also referred to as the authors we are grateful for the chance given us and the comments of colleagues are welcome and appreciated because permit us the further improvement of our article and to provide more details to all other readers of journal our patented method applied in the study will be published and available in the patents list in the next september being the updating of the list of public patents fixed in this time frame the code of the submitted request of international patent s extension in several countries of world is pct ib2019 051838 of 7 march 2019 coupled with italian patent number already mentioned in the article the methodology applied to our study is now wholly reported in the supplementary informations of article but it is legally protected by its use the authors said that mineral water contains numerous particles both of inorganic and organic nature other than microplastics containing also carbon therefore our assessed number of microplastic particles would be over estimated however in our opinion this statement is not true because the first step of our extraction method following the sample s aliquotation is the mineralization by addition of nitric acid suprapur this process transforms both the organic and inorganic carbon into carbon dioxide through a thermal oxidative decarboxylation being carbon dioxide a poorly soluble gas at high temperatures it is entirely removed from the extract so the presence of carbon particles in mineral water cannot affects our counting or assessment of microplastics number sosna et al 2003 roch and brinker 2017 the authors refer that sem edx is a new method for the analysis of microplastics and it is not a valid method for microplastics analysis we do not agree with these statements the sem edx methodology is not a relatively new technique because literature is available about this since 2005 endo et al 2005 surely the sem edx analysis cannot be used for the typing of plastics in fact in our article we indicate the total microplastics in which all the extractable plastic particles are counted according to detailed method described in supplementary information moreover the sem technique allows to achieve higher magnifications at least 1500x compared to other techniques in use including that of μ raman spectroscopy maximum 50x this approach permits an efficient detection and count of the fraction of smaller particles therefore our method allows counting the smaller particles lost with other extraction method the authors refer that the control of sample s contamination is crucial in the analysis of microplastics and suggest this critical issue as possible explanation of the great number of mps it is very important to highlight that according our method the use of plastic tools are not permitted to avoid the cross contamination moreover in order to control contamination during extraction three reagents blanks consisting of nitric acid reagent grade water and dichloromethane were processed and analyzed as the samples fig 2 of the article show the number of particles found in reagent blanks the mean value of microplastics found in the three reagents blanks was subtracted from the result of each sample therefore in our study all sources of contamination are tested as noted in the discussion section the strength of our patent is that samples are not filtered and the contribution of mps from the use of reagents could be accurately counted and subtracted to samples after the extraction of the particles our method involves the dispersion of extracts in stubs of aluminum and copper alloy according to a poisson distribution the studies of schymanski et al 2018 and oßmann et al 2018 report the filtration process of samples in polycarbonate filters we highlight that filtration causes the loss of a large quantity of particles plastic and not having smaller diameters than the pores of the filters in particular in the study of schymanski et al 2018 the polycarbonate filters used had a porosity of 3 0 μm therefore all particles of the samples smaller than the indicated porosities were lost in fact schymanski et al 2018 report in their article that five size ranges to be measured were set as 5 10 μm 10 20 μm 20 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 μm oßmann et al 2018 report in their article that the number of the identified particles was classified in four groups depending on their size 1 5 μm 1 5 μm to 5 μm 5 μm to 10 μm and 10 μm as referred by oßmann et al 2018 the number of mps depends on the investigated size over 95 of the plastic particles were smaller than 5 μm and even about 50 were smaller than 1 5 μm oßmann et al 2018 in our study the main diameters of detected mps ranged between 1 28 μm and 4 2 μm with a main value of 2 44 μm sd 0 66 μm moreover the diameter of the smallest found particle was 0 5 μm welle and franz 2018 report in their review data of studies available in literature considering the size related particle numbers related to multi use and single use pet bottles reported in table 1 of the study of oßmann et al 2018 we observed logarithmic relations between the mean value of mps and their size if we build a semi logarithmic curve we obtain a linear function f x 1 9692x 15 868 r 2 0 88 that we can use to predict the number of mps of 0 5 μm of diameter the estimated number of mps is 2 78e6 next to our data therefore in our opinion our data support and complete those reported in studies of the authors and we agree with them that it is necessary to increase the number of the studies on this topic in particular about the contaminations of nanoplastics welle and franz 2018 moreover we processed again our data excluding mps with diameters below 5 μm and only few mps were found in investigated sem fields the authors indicate that the generally accepted technique for mps analysis is the micro raman spectroscopy we inform the authors the actually several techniques of particle s determination are reported in literature including sem raman spectroscopy ftir optical microscope nmr gc pyr etc but none of these is recognized as internationally reference method for determining and counting microplastics our particle counting methodology was fully reported in supplementary information the our counting method originated from the counting methodologies of asbestos fibers as indicated by several official method including niosh method 7400 niosh7404 niosh 7402 osha id 160 osha id 191 epa 600 m4 82 020 1982 iso 14966 eu 83 477 eec german bia and finally the d m 6 9 94 of the ministry of health of the italian republic for the asbestos fiber counting method our laboratory is accredited accredia in accordance with the european standard uni en iso iec 17025 2005 other authors used this methodology for counting plastic microparticles de falco et al 2018 de falco et al 2019 napper and thompson 2016 in addition through sem analysis the size of particles can be accurately measured through software specific function point to point unfortunately the graph in fig 3 of zuccarello et al 2019 reports some errors on the dimensions of the detected particles due to the erroneous acquisition of the raw data in the spss software the software in fact has mistakenly acquired the data without any decimals in the supplementary information of the study of zuccarello et al 2019 we just attached the correct table 1 reporting the raw data about main diameters of mps supporting the correct fig 3 also reported in the same document the authors refer that our study is not the first study that assesses the presence and the quantity of mps with diameters smaller than 10 μm our study isn t the first to analyze the presence of microplastics below 10 μm but it is the first that estimates the daily intake in adults and children associated with the presence of all particles below 10 μm estimated daily intake of a food contaminant is the amount of contaminant ingested by the average consumer of the food in our case the mineral water exposure assessment is the first phase of risk assessment in epidemiology our approach is according to the u s epa s edi assessment epa 2000 copat et al 2018 fallahzadeh et al 2018 ferrante et al 2018 keramati et al 2018 dadar et al 2016 arena et al 2015 the authors refer that we investigated only ten mineral water bottles and in their opinion this is a small size of samples for pca moreover they say that bottles 1 2 and 9 are found along the plastic density vector referring to the distance matrix and that we wrongly associated a strong correlation between mps concentration and ph against a weak correlation with the plastic density therefore the authors concluded that pca is not a suitable tool for statistical analysis of ten investigated bottle samples finally the authors refer that in our article was not defined the meaning of poor quality plastic concerning to pca applicability several authors turchetti et al 2013 tasselli et al 2018 teychene et al 2018 peiris rh et al 2010 applied pca in studies with a smaller number of data pca is a descriptive method for reducing the dimensionality of datasets increasing their interpretability which can be used on numerical data of various types there is not recommendation about the minimum number of observations to perform pca it depends on discipline which it must be applied to in the textbook of jolliffe 2002 it was also reported several examples of appropriate use of pca based on a subset of data with 15 observations given by hansch one of the main exponents of pca jolliffe 2002 jolliffe and cadima 2016 hansch et al 1973 is clearly described in our article that the analysis of the pca was not carried out on 10 bottles but on 10 mineral water brands for each brand the average of the three values obtained from the analysis of three different lots was considered thus the analysis considered a total of 30 samples moreover the important aspect in our study was that the first two pcs account for 81 σpc1 pc2 of the total variation in the dataset so biplots were a reasonably faithful representation of the positions of the 10 observations in 11 dimensional space jolliffe 2002 therefore in our point of view pca was applicable for our study although the dataset was not large concerning the interpretation of pca the fig 4 of zuccarello et al 2019 cited by authors shows the distance matrix that represent the distance between the brands and the investigated parameters therefore it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the difference between distance matrix and correlation matrix the matrix that correlates two or more variables is the correlation matrix shown in fig 5 of zuccarello et al 2019 smaller is the angle between two vectors stronger is the correlation between the two corresponding parameters it is evident in our study how the parameters ca mg hardness conductivity and fixed residue at 180 c are obviously strongly correlated the only vectors with angles less than 90 respect to that of the number of particles mps per liter are those corresponding to the ph the closest and to the density of the plastic thanks to comments of the authors we checked the densities reported in our article for a mistake it was reported that the weight of the bottle section of the sample 9 was 0 074 g and consequentially the calculated density was 2 36 g cm3 instead the real weight of the section was 0 047 g and the real calculated density was 1 49 g cm3 in the supplementary information of zuccarello et al 2019 it is reported the correct table 2 and the correct pcas figs 4 and 5 current pca confirms the past results moreover to better support our considerations we also performed again the pca considering all 30 samples applying the same method described in the article paragraph 2 4 the plot of the new correlation matrix is reported in fig 1 results are much similar that the past analysis the number of mps in bottled mineral waters is correlated to the ph of waters and now strongly to plastic density of bottle otherwise micrograms of mps per liter and the mps diameters are affected by plastic thickness therefore in our opinion the pca s interpretation is correct our study that investigates possible causes does not conclude that the ph and density of plastics are the causes of the release of mps but could influence it in fact in the article we introduce the hypothesis referring to the article s sentence page 369 it seems that hard plastics cause the release biggest fragments but in a minor number instead the more deformable plastics and weakly alkaline ph would increase the number of smallest mps therefore both parameters can be understood as factors of greater presence of mps but not causes of release although our pca isn t too much robust because of the small dataset it provides some interesting considerations on topic that need to be confirm through further studies finally in the article poor quality plastic is defined as with the examined small 0 073 μm characterized by high deformability the sentence must be interpreted as the most contaminated mineral water by mps was the sample 7 characterized by the smallest thickness of plastic bottle among the examined brands 0 073 μm as well as high deformability conclusion we invite the community to increase the number of studies about this emergent issue in order to compare data and improving our knowledge regarding environmental and human health we thank the authors for their comments to our article because they gave us the opportunity to improve the quality of our study and to clear some points of our article for the further readers

18494,intensive agriculture and urbanization have led to the excessive and repeated input of nitrogen n into soil and further increased the amount of nitrate no3 leaching into groundwater which has become an environmental problem of widespread concern this review critically examines both the recent advances and remaining knowledge gaps with respect to the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system the key aspects regarding the n distribution transformation and budget in this system are summarized three major missing n pieces n in dissolved organic form n in the deep vadose zone and n in the nonagricultural system which are crucial for closing the n cycle yet has been previously assumed to be insignificant are put forward and discussed more work is anticipated to obtain accurate information on the chemical composition transformation mechanism and leaching flux of these missing n pieces in the vadose zone groundwater system these are essential to support the assessment of global n stocks and management of n contamination risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen vadose zone groundwater dissolved organic nitrogen nitrate leaching nonagricultural source 1 introduction the vadose zone is the earth s terrestrial subsurface that extends from the surface to the regional groundwater table holden and fierer 2005 the vadose zone groundwater profile is a connected and integrated system fig 1 through which water and solute vertically percolate as one of the most important circulation processes in the vadose zone groundwater system the nitrogen n cycle which is the transformation and flow of n has received increasing attention in recent years these natural processes have been enhanced by anthropogenic drivers such as intensive agriculture e g excessive use of fertilizers and animal manure and urbanization wu et al 2018a b the excessive and repeated input of n into the vadose zone further increases the amount of nitrate no3 leaching and thus groundwater no3 pollution has become an environmental problem of widespread concern zhang et al 2018a b c d among all n input sources n fertilization which is a common agricultural practice used to improve the crop growth and productivity is the most important anthropogenic activity that increases the n availability in the pedosphere ouyang et al 2018 over the past 100 years a large amount of n fertilizer has been inputted into agricultural land due to extensive agricultural intensification based on this trend the n concentration is projected to reach 135 teragrams tg n in 2050 wang et al 2019a b in addition other nonagricultural n input sources are mainly related to the wastewater disposal leaky sewers and onsite systems and solid waste disposal landfills and waste tips wakida and lerner 2005 however to date there only a limited number of studies have addressed issues related to nonagricultural sources mienis and arye 2018 most published work reported the n cycle and budget in agricultural systems kapelewska et al 2019 the vadose zone comprises soil partially weathered and unweathered parent material and a transiently inundated capillary fringe holden and fierer 2005 traditionally the n cycle has been assumed to mainly occur as a result of biological activity in the rooting zone of the soil which generally extends to a depth of 1 m the n leaching merely refers to the downward transport of n out of the rooting zone by percolating water libutti and monteleone 2017 therefore an extensive research on the n cycle in soil has been conducted based on detailed examinations of the surface soil and shallow vadose zone covering the rooting zone he et al 2018 however the results of previous studies highlighted that n is not only an essential soil nutrient for plants but also a major groundwater pollutant castaldelli et al 2019 wang et al 2019a b therefore the deep vadose zone has recently come under scrutiny as the link between soil and groundwater due to its distance to the surface the difficulty in the characterization and monitoring is another key reason for the big knowledge gap with respect to the deep vadose zone however the important role of the deep vadose zone in influencing the global n cycle has been highlighted the deep vadose zone is an important storage location for n and an efficient filter for dissolved n because of biogeochemical processes that occur during vertical transfer voisin et al 2018 the vadose zone may be very shallow 1 m or very deep extending over hundreds of meters or more depending on the depth to the water table the thickness of the vadose zone has been demonstrated to be the most significant factor affecting the no3 concentrations in groundwater juntakut et al 2019 in addition szymczycha et al 2017 further confirmed that the vadose zone controls the n transformation in aquifer they showed for the first time that the dissolved oxygen concentration and redox potential in groundwater are related to the thickness of the vadose zone therefore filling the knowledge gap with respect to the n behavior in the deep vadose zone could efficiently improve the understanding of the global n cycle and guide soil pollution source control and groundwater contamination risk management the n consists of inorganic and organic fractions nie et al 2018 in soil most organic n in the form of polymers is firstly degraded into small dissolved organic nitrogen don and further mineralized into dissolved inorganic n no3 nh4 etc nie et al 2018 because the dissolved inorganic n din in soil is the most easily available n fraction that can either be taken up by the crop or lost to the environment fu et al 2019 din has been the research focus in previous studies nguyen et al 2017 while the importance of don in the vadose zone groundwater system has been discussed only recently recent evidence suggested that 1 don represents the dominant n fraction in many soils and failure to consider it might lead to significant underestimation of the n stock wu et al 2019 and 2 don constitutes a major loss pathway from the vadose zone via leaching to groundwater van kessel et al 2009 and don leaching might have uncertain ecological consequences gu et al 2011 therefore the measurement of bulk don concentrations and exploration of the chemical components of don are essential to elucidate the role of don in the vadose zone groundwater system several review papers have been published with regard to the n cycle in stormwater control gold et al 2019 wastewater treatment vymazal 2013 and forest ecosystem zhu et al 2015 however no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive review on the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system in this review we summarized the distribution transformation and budget of n in the vadose zone groundwater system based on previous and current studies the outline of this review is as follows the first section is dedicated to the sources of n this is followed by a discussion of the distribution of n in soil and groundwater after understanding the sources and obtaining quantitative information on the n distribution the n transformation and leaching processes governing the n distribution are overviewed finally we identify the n pieces missing in n cycle analysis and recommend future research prospects to better understand the environmental footprint of n in the whole vadose zone groundwater system 2 n sources soil is the main reservoir of n the loss of n from the soil impacts the agricultural production and negatively affects the groundwater pollution on a global scale xu et al 2017 a variety of n inputs can be classified into three groups fig 1 atmospheric deposition agricultural sources and nonagricultural sources the atmospheric n deposition which represents an important source of reactive n in soil ecosystems zhao et al 2017 has rapidly increased and influences terrestrial ecosystem processes on a global scale cheng et al 2019 global hotspots of n deposition fluxes include western europe and south and east asia with average annual deposition fluxes of 24 1 25 3 and 29 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively song et al 2017 agricultural sources as the biggest n contributors include the overuse of n fertilizer smith et al 2018 and release of animal excretions li et al 2012 from many cropland dairy farm and grazed livestock systems in addition to agricultural sources there are nonagricultural sources especially in urban areas major nonagricultural sources are related to the wastewater disposal leaky sewers and onsite systems minnig et al 2018 and solid waste disposal landfills and waste tips wakida and lerner 2005 leakage from wastewater disposal networks is considered to recharge a significant amount of polluted water to aquifers globally because many aged sanitary sewer systems are defective wakida and lerner 2005 guérineau et al 2014 lee et al 2015 sewage derived pollutants have been detected at depths of 60 m below the ground level powell et al 2003 rutsch et al 2008 in addition to sewer exfiltration on site septic tanks and soil aquifer treatment sat are important wastewater disposal related sources zhu et al 2016 mienis and arye 2018 the n input due to solid waste disposal has also been a concern in many developed countries approximately 75 of the 55 000 landfills in the usa have polluted the water resources near them han et al 2016 detailed information about the n leaching potential of different sources is discussed in section 4 3 n distribution in the vadose zone groundwater system 3 1 analysis of the n concentration and chemical composition the total n tn contributes to soil fertility and biogeochemical processes in the vadose zone the quantification of the tn is essential for understanding how much n will be released from the vadose zone as n sources and how much n can be stored in the vadose zone acting as n sink the tn is analyzed by dry combustion using an elemental analyzer the concentration levels and chemical composition of tn in soils have been considered in several studies yet the deeper profile has been examined in few studies the tn includes both inorganic and organic fractions with organic n being the dominant n pool in soil xu et al 2013 reported that a lower percentage of mineral forms compared with organic nitrogen and that the percentages of organic n range from 96 69 to 91 51 in soil at a depth of 0 60 cm the organic n can be grouped into light fractions lfon and heavy fractions hfon based on density fractionation zhong et al 2015 separated the lfon and hfon using the density of 1 7 g cm 3 and reported that hfon as the dominant fraction exhibits a lower percentage in the surface soil layer 0 20 cm than in the deeper layer 20 200 cm while the lfon shows the opposite trend nitrogen in the dissolved form tdn is an essential part of the terrestrial n pool it includes dissolved inorganic n din no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dissolved organic n don the don is defined as the small organic n released by enzymes which is soluble in water and can pass through a 0 45 μm membrane nie et al 2018 the recovery of tdn from the soil significantly depends on the extraction method factors such as the sample storage sample preparation sieving and drying shaking time extraction temperature and soil extractant volume ratio significantly affect the amount of tdn extracted from soil jones and willett 2006 the don can be calculated as the difference between the tdn and din therefore to guarantee that the collected data are comparable table 1 summarizes the amount of don extracted by milli q water and don in soil solution collected through centrifugation or suction cups nie et al 2018 with respect to tdn the key role of don in the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system has only been unveiled in recent years although a research consensus on the important role of mineral n no3 nh4 has been achieved decades ago the don is a class of complex n containing organic compounds free amino acid faa is a widely identified don component in soil table 1 summarizes the faa concentration in soil solution in different samples ranging from not detected n d to 6 46 mg n l 1 accounting for 0 36 of the don in soil and representing only a minor proportion of the total don in terms of the profile distribution the don concentration is lower in the deeper soil layer whereas the faa n concentration shows the opposite trend along the soil profile nie et al 2018 in addition to faa peptides and proteins are the main contributors to don in soil yu et al 2002 however 75 don with high molecular weight remains unidentified jones and kielland 2012 recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been utilized to elucidate the molecular composition of don in wet deposition feng et al 2016 urban stream lusk and toor 2016a urban stormwater runoff lusk and toor 2016b agricultural runoff water li et al 2018 and groundwater arnold et al 2014 lusk et al 2018 has identified qualitative shifts in the soil don molecular characteristics under different fertilizer regimes and indicated that don compounds such as lipid protein carbohydrate and lignin like molecules are more sensitive to leaching from grassland this technique should be further employed to characterize the don distribution trends in time or space in the vadose zone groundwater system and elucidate the governing mechanisms 3 2 total n in the vadose zone information about the tn in more than 4000 soil samples worldwide asia australia europe and america is given in table s1 the main results of selected papers are reported below in general the minimum and maximum tn values are in the range of 0 01 7 1 g n kg 1 and 0 412 21 7 g n kg 1 respectively in terms of the mean values the tn of 3908 among all collected records varies from 0 23 to 2 84 g n kg 1 which demonstrates that the tn concentration in soil is relatively stable however there are some special cases in which the values are greatly beyond this range for example mean tn values as high as 16 7 g n kg 1 and 23 0 g n kg 1 were reported for a forest site in canada marty et al 2017 and a grassland site in the uk farrell et al 2011 respectively the tn concentration shows spatial heterogeneity in the vertical profile the tn decreases with increasing profile depth this trend is likely caused by the decrease in the plant and animal debris as well as the decrease in the microbiological decomposition activity with increasing soil depth liu et al 2013a b pingguoyang et al 2016 wang et al 2017a b c xu et al 2017 meena et al 2018 because most studies focused on the effect of n as nutrient on the plant growth and agricultural activities spatial tn patterns mainly consider only the soil covering the rooting zone leading to incomplete information more efforts should be made to capture the profile variations of the tn through the whole vadose zone especially in the deep vadose zone profile 1 m qiao et al 2018 investigated the vertical distributions of tn in a deep profile 0 200 m in the loess plateau china and found that the tn initially declines at most sampling sites and then fluctuates with increasing depth researchers agree that land use plays a crucial role in determining the tn distribution however its effect reportedly varies based on different studies the results of most studies demonstrated that natural ecosystems e g forestland and grassland without much artificial disturbance exhibit a higher tn concentration compared with cultivated land xu et al 2013 kassa et al 2017 meena et al 2018 because the harvesting of biomass from cultivated land dramatically lowers the n input to soil meena et al 2018 for instance wang et al 2016 a b indicated that the land use change from cropland to forestland enhances the tn concentrations and stocks zhao and xia 2012 found that soils under natural vegetation in urban areas contain relatively higher levels of n however the opposite trends were discovered in other studies they indicated that cropland usually displays higher tn levels than natural ecosystems liu et al 2013 a b found higher mean tn values in cropland compared with forestland and grassland and attributed this to the application of n containing fertilizers yang et al 2015 a b reported a significant positive effect of fertilization on the tn concentration in cropland soil based on a 33 year experiment in addition zhang et al 2016 reported that the tn significantly increases during extensive agricultural reclamation of coastal tidal flats the tn levels of cropland vary depending on the plant type yan et al 2012 reported a significant increase in the tn level in shunyi from 0 8 to 1 4 g n kg 1 and shouguang from 0 8 to 1 6 g n kg 1 following the land use conversion from cereal fields to vegetable production in addition to land use other factors also introduce a large variability in the tn concentration such as the soil properties e g soil type texture xu et al 2017 topography wang et al 2017a b c precipitation temperature liu et al 2013a b wang et al 2017a b c qiao et al 2018 by affecting the n input into the soil and n uptake by plants furthermore water conservation measures such as the construction of check dams and terraces and the grain for green project facilitate local soil n accumulation xu et al 2017 3 3 dissolved organic nitrogen don in vadose zone data from different samples table 1 show that there is a great deal of spatial variability in the don tdn ratio distribution due to distinct land use the don tdn ratio widely varies 15 29 99 the don tdn ratio in forestland is much higher followed by grassland and cropland the no3 and nh4 concentrations in soil solution are greatly enhanced at agricultural sites because of the wide application of chemical fertilizers accounting for a relatively low don tdn ratio the don concentration ranges from 0 41 to 168 5 mg n l 1 the highest value was discovered at a coniferous forest site jones and willett 2006 similar to the tn profile distribution the don profile distribution was also investigated mostly within the soil layer nie et al 2018 compared the don concentrations at three different soil depths 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm and indicated that the don concentration decreases with increasing soil depth however wu et al 2019 recently reported that the don 0 2 3 5 mg n l 1 is still detectable at depths of 9 m in the vadose zone therefore the don presence in the deep vadose zone should be considered when attempting to quantify the dissolved n flux to the groundwater nie et al 2018 proposed that the organic matter tn and electrical conductivity are positively correlated with the don concentration in soil while the soil ph displays a negative correlation additionally the capillary porosity bulk density and particle density also govern the don dynamics in soil nie et al 2018 xing et al 2019 reported that organic matter significantly contributes to the don concentration directly as a primary don source and indirectly by increasing the soil protease activity and bacterial biomass clay exerts a direct or indirect influence on the don distribution by adsorbing don and affecting organic matter accumulation as well as enzyme activity xing et al 2019 in terms of amendments chemical fertilizer application was found to decrease the don content after long term incubation while organic fertilizer addition increases the don content wang et al 2018a b c 3 4 total dissolved n tdn in groundwater in this section a first glimpse is given on the mineral n fractions which are already included in groundwater quality standards as identified pollutants subsequently a more specific discussion of the improved understanding of the don occurrence as an emerging potential pollutant is carried out the most frequently detected mineral n fractions in groundwater are no3 and nh4 no3 is not easily adsorbed by clay minerals in soil because of its negative charge therefore it is more easily leached into the groundwater the nitrite no2 concentration is usually very low in the groundwater because it is unstable and easily transforms into no3 once it is formed in addition to these mineral ions in the liquid phase n2 and n2o are sometimes dissolved in the groundwater the species of mineral n present in the groundwater greatly depends on the aquifer redox conditions burow et al 2010 for example no3 concentrations were significantly p 0 001 larger in water samples containing o2 0 5 mg l 1 than in samples containing o2 0 5 mg l 1 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 likewise high concentrations of no3 are only found under oxic conditions with fe2 concentrations below 1 mg l 1 whereas higher nh4 concentrations appear under suboxic to anoxic conditions with fe2 concentrations above 1 mg l 1 lamontagne et al 2005 the texture of porous media affects the inorganic n fraction by influencing the redox conditions because reducing conditions in groundwater are created when the organic matter in clay is oxidized groundwater with intercepting clay layers results in relatively high nh4 concentrations up to 1 8 mg l 1 biddau et al 2019a the organic component has been overlooked in previous studies on the n species in groundwater recently the don which is a potential precursor of disinfection byproducts and mineral n fractions has been regarded as a new emerging contaminant table 2 summarizes the reported concentrations of both organic and inorganic n species in groundwater data on don in the groundwater were only available in limited publications with the mean values of don ranging from 0 126 to 21 4 mg n l 1 the highest concentration was measured in shallow groundwater 2 2 m below ground level beneath a dairy production farm 50 28 mg l 1 necpalova et al 2012 the don tdn ratios range from 0 1 to 98 5 with mean values of 10 54 60 the large variations in the don tdn ratio indicate that the n distribution in groundwater is site specific and might be partially related to many complex factors wang et al 2016 a b reported that don is significantly affected by the thickness of the vadose zone while kroeger et al 2006 proposed that the don tdn ratio is more closely related to the path length through the aquifer than to the path length through the vadose zone therefore further efforts are needed to address the don distribution in groundwater and governing mechanisms 4 n transformation processes in the vadose zone groundwater system 4 1 research methodology the methodologies for the qualitative and quantitative identification of n transformation processes are presented in a simplified diagram in fig 2 different methodologies were employed depending on the study objectives 4 1 1 lab based method the lab based incubation method is the most common disruptive method used to quantify the transformation rate by collecting soil aquifer materials and incubating them under controlled laboratory condition lab based methods can be classified into two categories non stable isotope 15n tracing and stable isotope 15n tracing without the input of the 15n stable isotope the transformation rate of a specific process is usually quantified by determining the concentration changes of the reactant or product compared with the original concentration level different transformation processes are investigated using the following different reactant or product for instance to determine the denitrification rate the acetylene block incubation method is usually used to inhibit further transformation of n2o to n2 retaining n2o as the final product wang et al 2018a b c xiong et al 2015 by quantifying the accumulated n2o within a specific time period the denitrification rate can then be calculated it is easy to carry out this method but it also has several flaws 1 if the concentration of a specific n species is controlled by more than one process the contribution of each process cannot be separated and 2 if other n containing amendments are added to the soil the transformation rates of the n components in the amendment and natural soil cannot be discriminated despite the convenience and cost effectiveness of the non 15n tracing incubation method the soil slurry based 15n tracing incubation method is more widely used because it can be used to more accurately follow the transformation path of the labeled n species gao et al 2017 therefore difficulties with respect to distinguishing the contributions of different processes due to the variation of a specific n species can be overcome for instance the direct determination of denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox rates in soils is almost impossible because of the high atmospheric background of n2 and complex relationships but their potential rates and respective contributions to total n reduction can be determined by using the slurry based 15n tracing technique combined with membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims shan et al 2016 rahman et al 2018 in addition this method can be used to assess both the natural transformation capacity of soil aquifer materials and the transformation potential while implementing other n containing amendments clague et al 2015a although measurements with 15n tracers are efficient ways to study n transformation processes they do not distinguish the contribution of coupled dnra anammox codenitrification to the n2 production from denitrification nie et al 2019 4 1 2 field based methods because the lab based techniques usually suffer from uncertainty due to sampling disturbance kaur et al 2010 nonintrusive field based methods are gradually adopted as efficient alternatives the field based approaches can be grouped into three categories based on the employed stable isotope technology non stable isotope tracing injected stable isotope tracing and natural stable isotope analysis many field based approaches without 15n tracers have been proposed such as in situ core incubation and closed buried bags clivot et al 2017 for instance in situ n2 quantification with mims was used to quantify denitrification at low cost however similar to the non stable isotope tracing method in the laboratory this method cannot be used to separate the contributions of n2 production between denitrification and other processes zhou et al 2017 to compensate for this flaw injection based isotopic techniques are employed in natural soil uncapped polyvinyl chloride cores are installed into the soil injected with 15n tracers and incubated in situ prior to being sampled after tracers addition silver et al 2005 the corresponding approach used in groundwater is named push pull method jahangir et al 2017 in addition to 15n tracer injection the natural 15n abundance can be used to predict n transformation processes because the isotopic enrichment factor of n species is considerably influenced by various microbiological processes the tendency to discriminate 15n 14n and 18o 16o provides evidence to support the qualitative and quantitative determination for a specific transformation process nikolenko et al 2018 for instance denitrification is indicated by a slope ranging from 1 3 to 2 1 based on plotting 15n and 18o clague et al 2015b biddau et al 2019b compared with quantitative analysis a more detailed and accurate cycling process n sources and flow paths and isotope fractionation factor should be used to quantify the transformation rates by using the natural 15n abundance houlton and bai 2009 clague et al 2015b fang et al 2015 therefore a constant and accurately determined isotope fractionation factor is the necessary prerequisite for calculation of the n transformation rate clague et al 2015b wang et al 2018a b c 4 2 key transformation processes and influencing factors the key transformation processes are reviewed in the following subsections and the reported activity and influencing factor are presented and discussed see fig 3 approximately 70 publications were collected for the data analysis containing a total of 1521 soil samples more than 90 of the studies have been published since 2010 the n transformation processes in soil have been greatly illuminated over decades of research nonetheless the n cycle in the deep vadose zone and groundwater is still debated 4 2 1 mineralization nitrogen mineralization is the key process that converts organic n into inorganic n by soil microorganisms jia et al 2017 the net n mineralization nnm resulting from the balance between the gross n mineralization and n immobilization by soil microorganisms is commonly assessed by measuring the rate of inorganic n accumulation in soil non 15n tracing incubation tests clivot et al 2017 based on the reviewed publications table s2 the net mineralization activity in soils greatly varies depending on different soil types and properties the net n mineralization activities range from 5 58 to 2 88 0 12 to 7 38 1 55 to 3 36 and 0 23 2 46 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland grassland forest and flooded paddy wetland soils respectively to separate the process of mineralization and immobilization the gross n nitrification rates were directly quantified in a small number of recent studies using the 15n tracing method the gross n mineralization activities range from 0 34 to 5 26 0 23 to 7 88 0 41 to 13 45 and 0 01 to 5 60 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland grassland forest and flooded paddy wetland soils respectively the maximum values are generally higher than the net mineralization rates the mineralization has previously been studied based on measurements of soil cores taken at shallow depths as summarized above because organic n is believed to exist mainly in soil rather than in the relatively anoxic deep vadose zone and groundwater however because of the increasing evidence indicating the occurrence of don in groundwater table 2 the mineralization potential in the deep profile should be further investigated soil mineralization is a biochemical process that involves the depolymerization of complex organic substrates deaminization of amino acids and nitrification of ammonium nh4 cline et al 2018 therefore the soil properties and environmental factors mainly influence the n mineralization by mediating the activities and communities of microorganisms clivot et al 2017 as the most critical influencing factor the soil carbon simultaneously influences the gross mineralization and immobilization the balance of their relative importance determines its effect on the net mineralization on one hand some studies suggested that the gross mineralization can be inhibited with high soil c n ratios or with labile c addition because microbes must immobilize rather than mineralize n to maintain the stoichiometric ratio of c n in their biomass or heterotrophs may have outcompeted autotrophic nitrifiers for nh4 teklay et al 2010 yang et al 2017 on the other hand the results of some other studies support a higher gross n mineralization favored by fresh organic matter e g greenhouse manure and biochar due to the positive priming effect of the availability of soluble carbon fontaine et al 2003 montaño et al 2007 chu and grogan 2010 ameloot et al 2015 xu et al 2016 therefore conflicting findings about the effect of soil carbon on the net mineralization were reported for different ecosystems in addition the soil mineral n concentration st luce et al 2016 soil ph cheng et al 2013 and soil temperature and moisture wang et al 2006 guntiñas et al 2012 are also crucial proximal factors directly controlling the soil microbial activity while different flooding periods seasonal pattern variations and land use types are distal factors that affect the n mineralization by influencing the proximal factors guntiñas et al 2012 schrama et al 2013 hu et al 2015 tete et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the implementation of several practices has been suggested to improve the n mineralization such as prescribed burning zhang et al 2018a b c d inorganic phosphate addition chen et al 2016a b and b amyloliquefaciens dt amendment hui et al 2018 which modifies the above mentioned influencing factors in different ways 4 2 2 nitrification nitrification is the biological oxidation of nh4 via hydroxylamine nh2oh to no2 and further to no3 medinets et al 2015 it represents a middle step involved in the mineralization in general the nitrification activity is usually indicated by the net and gross nitrification rates according to different measurement methods the net nitrification activity in surface soil assessed by measuring the rate of no3 accumulation in the soil ranges from 0 03 48 μg n g 1 d 1 to date the gross n nitrification rates have been directly investigated in few studies it ranges from 0 00 to 26 6 μg n g 1 d 1 based on the comparison of both the gross and net activities of nitrification and mineralization the nitrification rates are much higher than the reported range of mineralization rates reflecting depolymerizing organic substrates rather than nitrification is a bottleneck nitrification can occur in two ways that is via mutualistic symbiosis between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob or directly by recently discovered comammox bacteria i e complete aob environmental factors affect the nitrification process by primarily influencing the nitrifier reactivity the substrate availability teklay et al 2010 gao et al 2016 yang et al 2017 soil physicochemical properties ph hanan et al 2016 and temperature and moisture szukics et al 2010 are known to be the critical factors affecting the n nitrification in addition to affecting the microbial activity the relative abundance of aob versus that of aoa also responds to the variation of the environmental factors the nh4 concentration soil ph values and soil depth are key factors in determining the relative contribution of aoa and aob to nitrification the aoa tend to dominate the nitrification at low nh4 concentrations ouyang et al 2017 in acidic soils hu et al 2014 and in the lower soil depth ouyang et al 2017 compared with soil little is known about nitrification in the deep vadose zone and groundwater zhu et al 2018 reported that the nitrification rates decrease with increasing soil depth until the nitrification is undetectable in deeper subsurface soils 140 160 cm and deep soils 280 300 cm in several previous studies miller et al 2018 it has been speculated that the conversion of nh4 to no3 by nitrification does not occur in groundwater because the nitrification remains arrested facilitating nh4 accumulation when the average do concentration is below 1 0 mg l 1 however the possibility of nitrification occurrence was confirmed in other studies by observing the concurrent occurrence of nh4 concentration decrease and no3 concentration increase during in situ monitoring zuo et al 2018 li et al further 2015 proposed that nitrification is promoted by an increasing water table which elevates the groundwater do and eh thereby stimulating the nitrifier activity otherwise the nitrification would be inhibited smith et al 2006 measured the nitrification rate within a sand and gravel aquifer on cape cod ma using a series of single well injection tests the nitrification rates were found to be 0 02 0 28 mmol l aquifer 1 h 1 under in situ redox conditions and up to 0 81 mmol l aquifer 1 h 1 with non limiting substrate concentrations thus the nitrification depends on the redox conditions more quantitative information is required to provide further environmental evidence 4 2 3 denitrification denitrification is the stepwise reduction of no3 to no2 nitric oxide nitrous oxide and dinitrogen gas medinets et al 2015 the denitrification rates range from 0 04 27 34 μg n g 1 d 1 table s4 the denitrification activities range from 0 013 to 3 95 0 105 to 9 9 0 112 to 3 05 and 0 04 to 27 34 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland grassland forest and flooded paddy wetland soils respectively the highest value 27 34 μg n g 1 d 1 was detected in a paddy soil in guangxi china yang et al 2015a b because denitrification is mostly performed by particular groups of heterotrophic bacteria during anaerobic respiration the supplies of carbon hayakawa et al 2012 no3 palta et al 2014 and oxygen zhang et al 2009 are inevitably the principal proximal factors controlling the denitrification rates they also control the ratio of n2o n2 in the products the soil moisture hayakawa et al 2012 and soil texture deng et al 2011 correlate with the denitrification potential by influencing the redox conditions other distal controls e g land use and topography indirectly affect the soil denitrification by affecting the proximal factors xiong et al 2015 previous research on soil denitrification focused on natural factors but recent evidence suggested that human activity such as pesticides su et al 2019 nano particles liu et al 2018 and emerging contaminant chen et al 2016a b accumulations in soil also affect the denitrification rates although the occurrence of denitrification has been verified in soil of different land use types it is still debated if denitrification accounts for significant no3 loss in the deep vadose zone conflicting results have been reported by different investigators zhang et al 2013 and jia et al 2018 assessed the denitrification potential in 30 m and 50 200 m thick vadose zones respectively by investigating the natural abundance and distribution of n isotopic compositions they proposed that most of the leachable no3 from the soil zone is hardly subjected to denitrification based attenuation in the deep vadose zone based on the following three observations 1 the profile of the borehole showed little variations with respect to δ15n values with depth 2 an insignificant negative correlation was observed between δ15n and the no3 content and 3 the δ15n and δ18o values did not strongly follow the denitrification slope nevertheless zhou et al 2017 observed considerable n2 concentrations at 0 6 0 8 m zhu et al 2018 recorded a denitrification activity of 0 06 nmol n g 1 h 1 in deep soil 280 300 cm in the summer these results provide evidences to support that denitrification likely occurs even beneath the surface soil the controversial understanding of the occurrence of denitrification in the deep vadose zone might be accounted for by different conditions soil depth redox condition organic carbon content etc in different studies compared with the limited information of the denitrification in the deep vadose zone more information is available for the analysis of denitrification in groundwater qualitatively and quantitatively hinkle and tesoriero 2014 suggested that active ongoing denitrification is related to the substantial co occurrence of no3 and n2 recently jahangir s group took the initiative to quantitatively determine in situ groundwater denitrification rates beneath agricultural land jahangir et al 2013 and integrated constructed wetland jahangir et al 2017 the measured denitrification rates were in the range of 0 0013 0 470 μg n g 1 d 1 and 0 123 1 063 μg n g 1 d 1 respectively they also demonstrated the positive effect of introducing a cover crop mustard to agricultural management practices on the groundwater denitrification rates enhancement jahangir et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 reported high denitrification activity in groundwater accounting for 65 83 no3 removal due to strong reducing conditions 4 2 4 dnra the dnra is the conversion of no3 to nh4 via no2 medinets et al 2015 which is probably the least studied n transformation process in the soil system in recent years dnra has been increasingly investigated in n cycle studies to explore its importance for the n cycle although dnra has been found in many soils including upland soil forest grassland and cropland soils and flooded soil paddy wetland and flood plain soils the dnra activity is not always consistent for a range of spatial scales sites to regions presumably due to unique conditions the dnra rates in soils display a wide range between 0 00 and 33 34 μg n g 1 d 1 contributing to 3 to 99 of the soil no3 removal production table s5 the highest value 33 34 μg n g 1 was detected in a grassland soil with loam texture under a soil moisture level of 80 water filled pore space wfps friedl et al 2018 the conditions and influencing factors favoring the occurrence of either denitrification or dnra are still under debate the most important proximal influential factors for the dnra process are redox conditions related factors although the dnra is traditionally assumed to occur under highly reduced conditions there are many recent indications that the dnra is less sensitive to o2 than denitrification and might be important in relatively oxidized environments chen et al 2015a b the dnra is assumed to occur under no3 electron acceptor limited conditions and high carbon electron donor availability where the dnra is favored over denitrification at a c no3 ratio above 12 friedl et al 2018 putz et al 2018 in most studies the application of a labile c source e g livestock waste reducing agent and or land rewetting was required to induce detectable dnra rates in agricultural soils by driving heterotrophic soil respiration and reducing the soil redox potential friedl et al 2018 in addition several studies showed that additional electron donors fe2 also stimulate the dnra process robertson and thamdrup 2017 while additional electron acceptor free sulfide inhibit the dnra lu et al 2013 the dnra is also affected by several distal factors such as the wfps mean annual precipitation clay content chen et al 2015a b land use putz et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 soil depth sgouridis et al 2011 gao et al 2017 and invasion of wetland plant gao et al 2017 which are closely related to anaerobic conditions and the c no3 ratio in addition the dnra tends to be facilitated under higher temperatures chen et al 2015a b and high soil ph values zhang et al 2015 which stimulate the microbial activity in comparison with research on the dnra in soil few publications have disclosed the dnra process in the deep vadose zone and groundwater zhu et al 2018 investigated the dnra activity in deep profiles 300 cm depth the dnra in surface soil at a rate of at 0 08 0 10 nmol n g 1 h 1 was found to play a limited role 4 9 3 5 in the no3 removal compared with denitrification while the dnra dominated 54 8 79 7 the no3 reduction with an activity of 0 05 0 08 nmol n g 1 h 1 in the deeper subsurface profile 140 160 cm although the occurrence of dnra in groundwater has been previously assumed based on the concurrent increase of nh4 n as well as a simultaneous sharp decrease in the no3 n concentration ki et al 2015 only recently jahangir et al 2017 firstly quantified the contribution of denitrification and dnra to no3 n consumption in groundwater 14 16 and 40 63 respectively 4 2 5 anammox anammox is a n2 formation process with nh4 and no2 as electron donor and acceptor respectively medinets et al 2015 similar to dnra anammox has also rarely been studied we have retrieved 17 articles about anammox in the surface soil system since 2000 12 of which were already summarized in the review of nie et al 2019 most of the anammox related research was carried out on paddy soil 70 followed by studies on cropland soil 23 the anammox activity ranged from 0 0034 to 15 59 μg n g 1 d 1 contributing to 0 4 77 9 of the total n loss nie et al 2019 summarized the influencing factors in their review the anammox activity gradually decreases with increasing soil depth zhu et al 2018 reported that the anammox rates in surface 0 60 cm subsurface 60 80 cm and deeper subsurface soils 140 160 cm are in the range of 0 01 0 46 0 12 0 18 and 0 01 0 03 nmol n g 1 h 1 respectively despite the declining rate anammox is always the dominant pathway 51 4 89 5 of n loss in deep layers the contribution of anammox to n loss in groundwater was first observed in massachusetts usa using isotope tracers böhlke et al 2006 clark et al 2008 robertson et al 2012 and smits et al 2009 inferred that anammox is the likely process based on the distributions of din constituents nh4 no3 n2 progressive enrichment of δ15n nh4 and the occurrence of biomarkers however they did not directly measured its presence recently smith et al 2015 made the first attempt to quantify the anammox rate and its contribution to the n2 production in a n contaminated aquifer with the values as 10 nmol n2 n l 1 day 1 and 39 90 wang et al 2017 a b c also highlighted that anammox in the groundwater plays a critical role in the n loss they determined anammox rates and contributions to the n2 production ranging from 0 002 to 0 249 μg n g 1 d 1 and 37 5 67 6 respectively 5 n budget in the vadose zone and potential n leaching into groundwater 5 1 n budget in the surface soil system 5 1 1 process based models application and uncertainties in the past few decades various simulation approaches integrating process based knowledge of the n cycle have been developed to explore the soil n dynamics and quantify n fluxes negm et al 2014 examples of these models include the water and nitrogen management model wnmm li et al 2007 root zone water quality model rzwqm cameira et al 2014 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat yakoub et al 2017 agricultural production systems simulator apsim vogeler et al 2019 denitrification decomposition dndc zhang et al 2018a b c d toughreact n maggie et al 2008 and daycent álvaro fuentes et al 2017 ten specific n processes were considered in these models nitrification denitrification volatilization leaching symbiotic fixation assimilation mineralization immobilization plant uptake and clay fixation brill et al 2017 assessed nine widely used n models and found that all above mentioned processes could be simulated i e 70 by the models however none of these process based models have taken the dnra and anammox processes into consideration because few coefficients are available due to limited literatures as shown in section 3 2 which would lead to overestimation of the n loss from leaching into groundwater brilli et al 2017 proposed that a major weakness of these process based models is their scalability over time and space in terms of the temporal scale the models often fail to show ideal simulation performances with respect to n transformation both at short time and long time scales because the different models have their own particular strengths at different time scales vogeler et al 2013 for example the daycent model is of advantage when simulating n2o emissions on a seasonal scale compared with a daily scale dalal et al 2003 in terms of the space scale process based models have great advantages in modeling small scales site and watershed scales over large scales country and global scales li et al 2017 for example dndc model has been widely adopted to estimate greenhouse gas emissions taft et al 2019 ammonia volatilization li et al 2019 and n leaching li et al 2014 at site and watershed scales under different cropland management and n leaching mitigation scenarios however its application to estimate the stocks and flows of n at the national or global scales were much challenging the major limitation in applying this model at the national scale is the requirement of adequate data to initialize and run the model qiu et al 2011 recently yu et al 2019 made a breakthrough by using the dndc and other nitrogen balance models to estimate spatial patterns of nitrogen discharge into water bodies across china from 1955 to 2014 5 1 2 mass balance models application and uncertainties compared with process based models mass balance models with a lower complexity are more suitable for the description of soil n dynamics at higher spatial and temporal scales a basic n mass balance framework or model is established to quantify the n budget based on the difference between the n input and n output of a specific system gu et al 2013 he et al 2018 in such an approach positive n budget values represent the accumulation of soil n and negative values indicate the depletion of soil n the data related to the n input and output can be obtained in different ways the agriculture related data e g fertilizer application crop yield fertilization rate for artificial grassland n excreta rate for animals and fertilization rate for urban lawns can be collected from statistical materials e g agriculture statistical report national bureau of statistics agricultural products cost benefit compilation of information and government statistical yearbooks and bulletines gu et al 2013 he et al 2018 the n deposition related data can be obtained from references and the deposition monitoring network liu et al 2013a b in addition to quantify the n loss by using transformation processes nh3 volatilization denitrification runoff and leaching the reaction parameters n loss rates and coefficients of the n loss rate of nh3 n2 n2o no and no3 leaching and runoff should be collected from publications he et al 2018 the model parameters used for the evaluation of the soil n balance have large uncertainties he et al 2018 the n input data including the chemical fertilizer manure seed n deposition and irrigation had a high confidence level because they were reported for different time periods or regions in published work in contrast most n output parameters including nh3 n2 n2o no and no3 leaching and runoff have a low confidence level because these outputs can be significantly affected by the crop species soil types fertilizer source and climate conditions the lack of n loss coefficients for different regions contributes to uncertainties in the regional estimation of the n budget therefore on one hand the database of transformation rates should be enriched on the other hand efforts should be made to correlate the n loss parameters and regional soil environmental properties such that the detailed parameterization of the n balance for a more refined scale and to better represent global emission patterns with lower uncertainty becomes easier shcherbak et al 2014 5 1 3 n budget at the national and global scales nitrogen budget analysis is mostly conducted in the agricultural ecosystem because the crop production is the single largest cause of human alteration of the global n cycle liu et al 2010 presented a comprehensive assessment of the n flows in cropland on a global scale and discovered significant spatial variations in the input and output rates countries with major food production areas e g china western europe and the midwest in the united states usually displayed a high n input from mineral fertilizer use and high n output based on harvested crops regions with both high precipitation and high fertilizer inputs such as south china and several countries in western europe usually suffer from high n leaching the soil n balance in the agricultural system was calculated at the national scale for several countries using a multi year trend although the crop yield remains the prominent n output contributor over long time periods the evolution of the major n input contributor in agricultural systems was observed in the uk from 1800 to 2010 muhammed et al 2018 from 1800 to 1950 the major part of the estimated n input originated from soil organic matter mineralization while the major contributor was converted to fertilizer in the current period 1970 2010 similar to the uk he et al 2018 indicated that the dominant n input and output in china s croplands were chemical fertilizer and crop removal respectively from 1984 to 2014 compared with studies focusing on the agricultural systems the n budget analysis for nonagricultural systems is very limited due to the difficulties and uncertainties with respect to the collection of data for the n input from sewer exfiltration septic tank infiltration soil aquifer treatment and landfill leaching gu et al 2013 conducted a n balance calculation in coupled human and natural systems in china and discovered an increasing contribution of nonagricultural sources to the total n leakage to groundwater during the past three decades the contribution of cropland decreased from 50 in the 1980s to 40 in the 2000s 5 2 n leaching from the soil to the deep vadose zone the nitrogen leaching rate or coefficient is a quite important parameter for the n budget evaluation and groundwater contamination risk assessment most of the studies aiming to obtain the n leaching rate or coefficient are based on in situ field tests as shown in section 3 1 2 the data from in situ experiments are also used to calibrate water and solute transport models such as hydrus which helps to simplify the optimization of land management strategies matteau et al 2019 5 2 1 n leaching potential in agricultural systems the n leaching can be quantified as annual n loss kg n ha 1 y 1 or total n loss within the growing season kg n ha 1 table 3 summarizes the leaching data in agricultural systems expressed as mentioned above expressed as annual n loss the total n leaching values range from 2 03 to 139 855 kg n ha 1 y 1 a wide range of total n leaching values 7 1 351 8 kg n ha 1 was also observed when the total n loss within the growing season used as the indicator many factors affect the soil n loss including the rainfall intensity slope gradient soil properties land use types and agricultural measures wu et al 2018a b in addition in the grazing pasture system different animal species also affect the n leaching hoogendoorn et al 2011 nowadays different methods and management patterns are adopted to alleviate the n leaching such as the catch crop guo et al 2018 controlled release n fertilizers ke et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a b c d nitrification inhibitors li 2008 decrease of the irrigation levels chen et al 2018a b addition of amendments e g biochar peat and hydrogel barley straw separated effluent solids chen et al 2018a b borchard et al 2019 malcolm et al 2019 martin del campo et al 2019 and lateral spread of n from urine patches cichota et al 2018 the data in table 3 show that the don tdn ratio widely varies from 1 21 to 91 24 although it has been reported in some studies that the don loss accounting for a small portion is less crucial compared with the din loss walmsley et al 2018 several other studies indicate that the don loss might be a big contributor chen et al 2018a b lusk et al 2018 reported that high don percentages in tdn 88 94 were detected in leachate regardless if chemical fertilizer was implemented or not a higher ratio of don leaching is usually observed under the following conditions in natural ecosystems compared with fertilized cropland hoogendoorn et al 2011 in older land with rising temperature in winter chen et al 2018a b after application of organic amendments wang et al 2018b and inclusion of a continuous grass cover crop l multiflorum salazar et al 2019 considering the distinct n fractions dominating the leachate corresponding management methods should be selected for different site conditions for instance planting sweet corn as catch crop can reduce n losses by 12 6 mostly via the reduction of don leaching 22 2 compared with din leaching guo et al 2018 while the implementation of non inversion tillage and cover crops leads to a net retention of n at the field scale mainly due to the significant reduction in din leaching compared with don leaching walmsley et al 2018 5 2 2 n leaching potential in nonagricultural systems in contrast to obtaining the fertilization capacity in agricultural systems the determination of the exact amount of sewer exfiltration water and landfill leachate which are produced out of control is very difficult kapelewska et al 2019 therefore it is widely believed that wastewater and solid waste disposal systems are significant sources of n in groundwater however few published studies have quantified the recharge and pollutant load of the groundwater iverson et al 2018 xu et al 2018 mienis and arye 2018 conducted the first research on the long term behavior of tn and its components in a sat system in israel they reported that up to 60 of the tn could be removed in the upper vadose zone 63 m and up to 20 was continuously removed in the deeper zone 63 103 m with 17 51 of tn further leaching even under the protection of a thick vadose zone the possibility of n leaching in the sat system reaching the groundwater was high although there is evidence of high concentrations of tn and nh4 in the deep vadose zone and groundwater beneath landfill sites confirming the negative influence of waste landfills despite of their construction and insulation aharoni et al 2017 the n flux into the groundwater from landfill leachate has not been quantified 5 3 n accumulation in the deep vadose zone traditional studies on the n cycle in terrestrial ecosystems tend to only examine the soil rooting zone which is believed to be the most biologically active area however walvoord et al 2003 reported that 14 71 of the n inventory in the vadose zone for desert regions is missed if the subsoil 1 m reservoir is not taken into consideration recently large accumulations of residual no3 in the deep vadose zone at different depths were reported for croplands 90 200 cm zhao et al 2006 90 180 cm ju et al 2006 4 20 m zhou et al 2016 1 11 m min et al 2018 the distribution patterns of no3 n accumulation in the soil profile in different agricultural land use types differ ju et al 2006 min et al 2018 sebilo et al 2013 has conducted a long term tracer study and found that 12 15 of the fertilizer derived n was still residing in the soil organic matter three decades after application of isotopically labeled fertilizer n to agricultural soils these evidences indicate that the n from chemical fertilization is not immediately transported into the aquifer but temporarily remains stored in the deep vadose zone although soluble solutes are carried downward along the irrigation water flux wang et al 2013 firstly defined the nitrate time bomb because they found that it can take decades for leached no3 from the soil to discharge into groundwater due to the store of no3 and its potentially long time travel time in the vadose zones despite the growing evidence of large accumulations of residual din at different depths in the vadose zone wu et al 2019 firstly quantified the don accumulation in a profile deeper than the rooting zone 1 m and determined the 3 m zone to be the main inventory accounting for 64 of the don in addition to site scale evidence ascott et al 2017 estimated the no3 storage in the vadose zone at the global scale to be 605 1814 tg and reported that the no3 storage per unit area is positively correlated with the thickness of the vadose zones based on this the deep vadose zone serves as an important temporary or permanent n pool the n cycle in the deep vadose zone should be supported by additional studies to quantify the n fluxes into groundwater and improve groundwater contamination risk management 6 summary of the missing n pieces and research needs 6 1 n in dissolved organic form don in terms of soluble n attention is always paid to mineral fractions however a growing body of evidence supports that the don could be an overlooked pathway for n leaching into groundwater yet has been previously assumed to be insignificant the collected distribution data show that the don is ubiquitous in soil solution table 1 and has wide access to groundwater accounting for a high don tdn ratio up to 98 5 at some specific sites table 2 in addition to soil within the rooting zone don was also detected in the deeper profile wu et al 2019 furthermore except for the observation of don occurrence throughout the vadose zone groundwater profile don leaching out of the rooting zone has been quantified in many agricultural ecosystems table 3 with a don ratio in the total leached n ranging from 1 21 to 91 24 although these data can be used to provide insights into the profile distribution and leaching potential of don the research on the don in the vadose zone groundwater is still in its infancy the literature is insufficient to draw a conclusion on the effect of don on the n cycle it can be hypothesized that don may play dual roles in simultaneously promoting and inhibiting the no3 accumulation in groundwater by being involved in further mineralization and stimulating denitrification as labile carbon source respectively which role prevails depends on the chemical composition of the don however little is known about the molecular composition of the don which is partially due to technical difficulties hampering the identification of key components jones and kielland 2012 understanding the don related n transformation process in groundwater has important implications for solving the large scale no3 contamination problem based on the stimulated natural attenuation therefore to answer the questions above further research is needed to 1 collect more data originating from different geographical areas and site conditions 2 develop an optimal methodology for the analysis of the molecular don composition 3 quantify all factors driving the distribution of don in the vadose zone groundwater system and 4 clearly discriminate and quantify don involved transformation processes 6 2 n in the deep vadose zone from the perspective of depth profiling the knowledge of the n transformation in surface soil is adequate while there is a large knowledge gap with respect to the deep vadose zone all key n transformation processes mineralization nitrification denitrification dnra and anammox are observed in the surface soil under different land uses site specific transformation rates based on 70 publications and 1521 samples were summarized to provide parameters for budget models tables s2 s6 regarding n transformation in the deep vadose zone different studies are inconsistent the results of some studies indicated that the deep vadose zone is an important storage location for n rather than a biological active zone zhang et al 2013 and jia et al 2018 excluded the possibility of denitrification occurrence in thick vadose zones based on natural n isotopic composition analysis nevertheless zhou et al 2017 and zhu et al 2018 observed considerable concentrations of excess n2 and recorded denitrification rates at depths of 60 80 cm and 280 300 cm respectively illustrating that the n loss through denitrification in the deep vadose zone should not be neglected in addition to denitrification the occurrence of nitrification dnra and anammox in the deep vadose zone are also qualitatively supported by n speciation and biomarkers evolution trends suggesting that the deep vadose zone is not only a n stock but also an efficient filter for dissolved n because of biogeochemical processes that occur during vertical transfer therefore the scarcity of measured n transformation data in the deep vadose zone dramatically limits the n stock estimation in regions with thick vadose zones and further hampers the global n stock assessment n reservoirs in the deep vadose zone have implications for long term groundwater quality degradation because the n could accumulate in the deep vadose zone for a long term even if we stop the overuse of n fertilizer immediately these cumulative n deposits would still exist for decades changes in climate extreme rainfall events and vegetation could then mobilize n reservoirs in the deep vadose zone driving the accumulated n eventually go deeper with water to shallow groundwater with local to regional effects therefore future terrestrial n budgets at the national scale and at time scales of 10 years should consider incorporation of these nutrient stores for effective management of n in the environment 6 3 n in nonagricultural systems because wastewater and solid waste derived pollutants have been frequently detected at depths below the ground level powell et al 2003 rutsch et al 2008 wastewater and solid waste disposal sites have been included as n sources but their importance tends to be over shadowed by the largest source that is the overuse of fertilizer although nonagricultural sources have been identified for decades very little is known about their contribution to n releases recently gu et al 2013 reported that the contribution of landfill leakage has increased rapidly in the past three decades in china and has become the second largest source for groundwater after cropland with a contribution ratio of 34 in 2008 compared with agricultural source the nonagricultural sources of n may lead to the much higher accumulation of groundwater n in urban regions especially in industrial regions in addition the nonagricultural sources are very variable between urban areas because the pollution extent and nature will depend on many urban and natural attributes of the city therefore the estimates of the total load of n from the nonagricultural sources are greatly needed for closing the nutrient cycle and estimating the global n balance detailed information about the n transformation at nonagricultural sites provides a basis for the quantification of regional n budgets in contrast to croplands high concentrations of co existing pollutants e g biodegradable or recalcitrant organic matter heavy metals in leachates individually or in combination affect the n transformation in complex ways costa et al 2019 due to vast water composition variations in different leachates the n transformation in different nonagricultural ecosystems should be more widely investigated however compared with agricultural sites the in situ experimental sites for n transformation and leaching assessment in nonagricultural ecosystems are limited mienis and arye 2018 conducted the first sat system related field scale research on the long term behavior of n in the vadose zone they found that 17 51 of the tn is at the risk of being further leached into groundwater although a significant amount of tn is removed by the thick vadose zone up to 103 m therefore the fate and transport of n through the vadose zone groundwater profile in nonagricultural systems should be better characterized and the mass of n in the nonagricultural systems should be included in future terrestrial n budgets at national and global scales which might help to reduce the n budget uncertainty and improve environmental management 7 conclusions the advances with respect to n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system are reviewed in this article by focusing on the n distribution transformation and budget by reviewing the n distribution studies the author aimed to determine the new emerging n species to be included in the n budget by reviewing n transformation studies the author established a transformation database based on the collection of site specific rates from 70 publications for the budget modeling major knowledge gaps exist regarding the don occurrence and chemical composition n transformation mechanisms and kinetics in the deep vadose zone and n budget in nonagricultural systems these gaps represent the greatest needs with respect to future research of the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system additionally based on a precisely quantification of groundwater environmental carrying capacity and a clear understanding of n cycle through the pathway vadose zone n norms defining maximum amount of n input into soil would be determined for more efficient n regulation which may give new impetus to n management strategy reform even industry adjustment declaration

18494,intensive agriculture and urbanization have led to the excessive and repeated input of nitrogen n into soil and further increased the amount of nitrate no3 leaching into groundwater which has become an environmental problem of widespread concern this review critically examines both the recent advances and remaining knowledge gaps with respect to the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system the key aspects regarding the n distribution transformation and budget in this system are summarized three major missing n pieces n in dissolved organic form n in the deep vadose zone and n in the nonagricultural system which are crucial for closing the n cycle yet has been previously assumed to be insignificant are put forward and discussed more work is anticipated to obtain accurate information on the chemical composition transformation mechanism and leaching flux of these missing n pieces in the vadose zone groundwater system these are essential to support the assessment of global n stocks and management of n contamination risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen vadose zone groundwater dissolved organic nitrogen nitrate leaching nonagricultural source 1 introduction the vadose zone is the earth s terrestrial subsurface that extends from the surface to the regional groundwater table holden and fierer 2005 the vadose zone groundwater profile is a connected and integrated system fig 1 through which water and solute vertically percolate as one of the most important circulation processes in the vadose zone groundwater system the nitrogen n cycle which is the transformation and flow of n has received increasing attention in recent years these natural processes have been enhanced by anthropogenic drivers such as intensive agriculture e g excessive use of fertilizers and animal manure and urbanization wu et al 2018a b the excessive and repeated input of n into the vadose zone further increases the amount of nitrate no3 leaching and thus groundwater no3 pollution has become an environmental problem of widespread concern zhang et al 2018a b c d among all n input sources n fertilization which is a common agricultural practice used to improve the crop growth and productivity is the most important anthropogenic activity that increases the n availability in the pedosphere ouyang et al 2018 over the past 100 years a large amount of n fertilizer has been inputted into agricultural land due to extensive agricultural intensification based on this trend the n concentration is projected to reach 135 teragrams tg n in 2050 wang et al 2019a b in addition other nonagricultural n input sources are mainly related to the wastewater disposal leaky sewers and onsite systems and solid waste disposal landfills and waste tips wakida and lerner 2005 however to date there only a limited number of studies have addressed issues related to nonagricultural sources mienis and arye 2018 most published work reported the n cycle and budget in agricultural systems kapelewska et al 2019 the vadose zone comprises soil partially weathered and unweathered parent material and a transiently inundated capillary fringe holden and fierer 2005 traditionally the n cycle has been assumed to mainly occur as a result of biological activity in the rooting zone of the soil which generally extends to a depth of 1 m the n leaching merely refers to the downward transport of n out of the rooting zone by percolating water libutti and monteleone 2017 therefore an extensive research on the n cycle in soil has been conducted based on detailed examinations of the surface soil and shallow vadose zone covering the rooting zone he et al 2018 however the results of previous studies highlighted that n is not only an essential soil nutrient for plants but also a major groundwater pollutant castaldelli et al 2019 wang et al 2019a b therefore the deep vadose zone has recently come under scrutiny as the link between soil and groundwater due to its distance to the surface the difficulty in the characterization and monitoring is another key reason for the big knowledge gap with respect to the deep vadose zone however the important role of the deep vadose zone in influencing the global n cycle has been highlighted the deep vadose zone is an important storage location for n and an efficient filter for dissolved n because of biogeochemical processes that occur during vertical transfer voisin et al 2018 the vadose zone may be very shallow 1 m or very deep extending over hundreds of meters or more depending on the depth to the water table the thickness of the vadose zone has been demonstrated to be the most significant factor affecting the no3 concentrations in groundwater juntakut et al 2019 in addition szymczycha et al 2017 further confirmed that the vadose zone controls the n transformation in aquifer they showed for the first time that the dissolved oxygen concentration and redox potential in groundwater are related to the thickness of the vadose zone therefore filling the knowledge gap with respect to the n behavior in the deep vadose zone could efficiently improve the understanding of the global n cycle and guide soil pollution source control and groundwater contamination risk management the n consists of inorganic and organic fractions nie et al 2018 in soil most organic n in the form of polymers is firstly degraded into small dissolved organic nitrogen don and further mineralized into dissolved inorganic n no3 nh4 etc nie et al 2018 because the dissolved inorganic n din in soil is the most easily available n fraction that can either be taken up by the crop or lost to the environment fu et al 2019 din has been the research focus in previous studies nguyen et al 2017 while the importance of don in the vadose zone groundwater system has been discussed only recently recent evidence suggested that 1 don represents the dominant n fraction in many soils and failure to consider it might lead to significant underestimation of the n stock wu et al 2019 and 2 don constitutes a major loss pathway from the vadose zone via leaching to groundwater van kessel et al 2009 and don leaching might have uncertain ecological consequences gu et al 2011 therefore the measurement of bulk don concentrations and exploration of the chemical components of don are essential to elucidate the role of don in the vadose zone groundwater system several review papers have been published with regard to the n cycle in stormwater control gold et al 2019 wastewater treatment vymazal 2013 and forest ecosystem zhu et al 2015 however no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive review on the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system in this review we summarized the distribution transformation and budget of n in the vadose zone groundwater system based on previous and current studies the outline of this review is as follows the first section is dedicated to the sources of n this is followed by a discussion of the distribution of n in soil and groundwater after understanding the sources and obtaining quantitative information on the n distribution the n transformation and leaching processes governing the n distribution are overviewed finally we identify the n pieces missing in n cycle analysis and recommend future research prospects to better understand the environmental footprint of n in the whole vadose zone groundwater system 2 n sources soil is the main reservoir of n the loss of n from the soil impacts the agricultural production and negatively affects the groundwater pollution on a global scale xu et al 2017 a variety of n inputs can be classified into three groups fig 1 atmospheric deposition agricultural sources and nonagricultural sources the atmospheric n deposition which represents an important source of reactive n in soil ecosystems zhao et al 2017 has rapidly increased and influences terrestrial ecosystem processes on a global scale cheng et al 2019 global hotspots of n deposition fluxes include western europe and south and east asia with average annual deposition fluxes of 24 1 25 3 and 29 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively song et al 2017 agricultural sources as the biggest n contributors include the overuse of n fertilizer smith et al 2018 and release of animal excretions li et al 2012 from many cropland dairy farm and grazed livestock systems in addition to agricultural sources there are nonagricultural sources especially in urban areas major nonagricultural sources are related to the wastewater disposal leaky sewers and onsite systems minnig et al 2018 and solid waste disposal landfills and waste tips wakida and lerner 2005 leakage from wastewater disposal networks is considered to recharge a significant amount of polluted water to aquifers globally because many aged sanitary sewer systems are defective wakida and lerner 2005 guérineau et al 2014 lee et al 2015 sewage derived pollutants have been detected at depths of 60 m below the ground level powell et al 2003 rutsch et al 2008 in addition to sewer exfiltration on site septic tanks and soil aquifer treatment sat are important wastewater disposal related sources zhu et al 2016 mienis and arye 2018 the n input due to solid waste disposal has also been a concern in many developed countries approximately 75 of the 55 000 landfills in the usa have polluted the water resources near them han et al 2016 detailed information about the n leaching potential of different sources is discussed in section 4 3 n distribution in the vadose zone groundwater system 3 1 analysis of the n concentration and chemical composition the total n tn contributes to soil fertility and biogeochemical processes in the vadose zone the quantification of the tn is essential for understanding how much n will be released from the vadose zone as n sources and how much n can be stored in the vadose zone acting as n sink the tn is analyzed by dry combustion using an elemental analyzer the concentration levels and chemical composition of tn in soils have been considered in several studies yet the deeper profile has been examined in few studies the tn includes both inorganic and organic fractions with organic n being the dominant n pool in soil xu et al 2013 reported that a lower percentage of mineral forms compared with organic nitrogen and that the percentages of organic n range from 96 69 to 91 51 in soil at a depth of 0 60 cm the organic n can be grouped into light fractions lfon and heavy fractions hfon based on density fractionation zhong et al 2015 separated the lfon and hfon using the density of 1 7 g cm 3 and reported that hfon as the dominant fraction exhibits a lower percentage in the surface soil layer 0 20 cm than in the deeper layer 20 200 cm while the lfon shows the opposite trend nitrogen in the dissolved form tdn is an essential part of the terrestrial n pool it includes dissolved inorganic n din no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dissolved organic n don the don is defined as the small organic n released by enzymes which is soluble in water and can pass through a 0 45 μm membrane nie et al 2018 the recovery of tdn from the soil significantly depends on the extraction method factors such as the sample storage sample preparation sieving and drying shaking time extraction temperature and soil extractant volume ratio significantly affect the amount of tdn extracted from soil jones and willett 2006 the don can be calculated as the difference between the tdn and din therefore to guarantee that the collected data are comparable table 1 summarizes the amount of don extracted by milli q water and don in soil solution collected through centrifugation or suction cups nie et al 2018 with respect to tdn the key role of don in the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system has only been unveiled in recent years although a research consensus on the important role of mineral n no3 nh4 has been achieved decades ago the don is a class of complex n containing organic compounds free amino acid faa is a widely identified don component in soil table 1 summarizes the faa concentration in soil solution in different samples ranging from not detected n d to 6 46 mg n l 1 accounting for 0 36 of the don in soil and representing only a minor proportion of the total don in terms of the profile distribution the don concentration is lower in the deeper soil layer whereas the faa n concentration shows the opposite trend along the soil profile nie et al 2018 in addition to faa peptides and proteins are the main contributors to don in soil yu et al 2002 however 75 don with high molecular weight remains unidentified jones and kielland 2012 recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been utilized to elucidate the molecular composition of don in wet deposition feng et al 2016 urban stream lusk and toor 2016a urban stormwater runoff lusk and toor 2016b agricultural runoff water li et al 2018 and groundwater arnold et al 2014 lusk et al 2018 has identified qualitative shifts in the soil don molecular characteristics under different fertilizer regimes and indicated that don compounds such as lipid protein carbohydrate and lignin like molecules are more sensitive to leaching from grassland this technique should be further employed to characterize the don distribution trends in time or space in the vadose zone groundwater system and elucidate the governing mechanisms 3 2 total n in the vadose zone information about the tn in more than 4000 soil samples worldwide asia australia europe and america is given in table s1 the main results of selected papers are reported below in general the minimum and maximum tn values are in the range of 0 01 7 1 g n kg 1 and 0 412 21 7 g n kg 1 respectively in terms of the mean values the tn of 3908 among all collected records varies from 0 23 to 2 84 g n kg 1 which demonstrates that the tn concentration in soil is relatively stable however there are some special cases in which the values are greatly beyond this range for example mean tn values as high as 16 7 g n kg 1 and 23 0 g n kg 1 were reported for a forest site in canada marty et al 2017 and a grassland site in the uk farrell et al 2011 respectively the tn concentration shows spatial heterogeneity in the vertical profile the tn decreases with increasing profile depth this trend is likely caused by the decrease in the plant and animal debris as well as the decrease in the microbiological decomposition activity with increasing soil depth liu et al 2013a b pingguoyang et al 2016 wang et al 2017a b c xu et al 2017 meena et al 2018 because most studies focused on the effect of n as nutrient on the plant growth and agricultural activities spatial tn patterns mainly consider only the soil covering the rooting zone leading to incomplete information more efforts should be made to capture the profile variations of the tn through the whole vadose zone especially in the deep vadose zone profile 1 m qiao et al 2018 investigated the vertical distributions of tn in a deep profile 0 200 m in the loess plateau china and found that the tn initially declines at most sampling sites and then fluctuates with increasing depth researchers agree that land use plays a crucial role in determining the tn distribution however its effect reportedly varies based on different studies the results of most studies demonstrated that natural ecosystems e g forestland and grassland without much artificial disturbance exhibit a higher tn concentration compared with cultivated land xu et al 2013 kassa et al 2017 meena et al 2018 because the harvesting of biomass from cultivated land dramatically lowers the n input to soil meena et al 2018 for instance wang et al 2016 a b indicated that the land use change from cropland to forestland enhances the tn concentrations and stocks zhao and xia 2012 found that soils under natural vegetation in urban areas contain relatively higher levels of n however the opposite trends were discovered in other studies they indicated that cropland usually displays higher tn levels than natural ecosystems liu et al 2013 a b found higher mean tn values in cropland compared with forestland and grassland and attributed this to the application of n containing fertilizers yang et al 2015 a b reported a significant positive effect of fertilization on the tn concentration in cropland soil based on a 33 year experiment in addition zhang et al 2016 reported that the tn significantly increases during extensive agricultural reclamation of coastal tidal flats the tn levels of cropland vary depending on the plant type yan et al 2012 reported a significant increase in the tn level in shunyi from 0 8 to 1 4 g n kg 1 and shouguang from 0 8 to 1 6 g n kg 1 following the land use conversion from cereal fields to vegetable production in addition to land use other factors also introduce a large variability in the tn concentration such as the soil properties e g soil type texture xu et al 2017 topography wang et al 2017a b c precipitation temperature liu et al 2013a b wang et al 2017a b c qiao et al 2018 by affecting the n input into the soil and n uptake by plants furthermore water conservation measures such as the construction of check dams and terraces and the grain for green project facilitate local soil n accumulation xu et al 2017 3 3 dissolved organic nitrogen don in vadose zone data from different samples table 1 show that there is a great deal of spatial variability in the don tdn ratio distribution due to distinct land use the don tdn ratio widely varies 15 29 99 the don tdn ratio in forestland is much higher followed by grassland and cropland the no3 and nh4 concentrations in soil solution are greatly enhanced at agricultural sites because of the wide application of chemical fertilizers accounting for a relatively low don tdn ratio the don concentration ranges from 0 41 to 168 5 mg n l 1 the highest value was discovered at a coniferous forest site jones and willett 2006 similar to the tn profile distribution the don profile distribution was also investigated mostly within the soil layer nie et al 2018 compared the don concentrations at three different soil depths 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm and indicated that the don concentration decreases with increasing soil depth however wu et al 2019 recently reported that the don 0 2 3 5 mg n l 1 is still detectable at depths of 9 m in the vadose zone therefore the don presence in the deep vadose zone should be considered when attempting to quantify the dissolved n flux to the groundwater nie et al 2018 proposed that the organic matter tn and electrical conductivity are positively correlated with the don concentration in soil while the soil ph displays a negative correlation additionally the capillary porosity bulk density and particle density also govern the don dynamics in soil nie et al 2018 xing et al 2019 reported that organic matter significantly contributes to the don concentration directly as a primary don source and indirectly by increasing the soil protease activity and bacterial biomass clay exerts a direct or indirect influence on the don distribution by adsorbing don and affecting organic matter accumulation as well as enzyme activity xing et al 2019 in terms of amendments chemical fertilizer application was found to decrease the don content after long term incubation while organic fertilizer addition increases the don content wang et al 2018a b c 3 4 total dissolved n tdn in groundwater in this section a first glimpse is given on the mineral n fractions which are already included in groundwater quality standards as identified pollutants subsequently a more specific discussion of the improved understanding of the don occurrence as an emerging potential pollutant is carried out the most frequently detected mineral n fractions in groundwater are no3 and nh4 no3 is not easily adsorbed by clay minerals in soil because of its negative charge therefore it is more easily leached into the groundwater the nitrite no2 concentration is usually very low in the groundwater because it is unstable and easily transforms into no3 once it is formed in addition to these mineral ions in the liquid phase n2 and n2o are sometimes dissolved in the groundwater the species of mineral n present in the groundwater greatly depends on the aquifer redox conditions burow et al 2010 for example no3 concentrations were significantly p 0 001 larger in water samples containing o2 0 5 mg l 1 than in samples containing o2 0 5 mg l 1 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 likewise high concentrations of no3 are only found under oxic conditions with fe2 concentrations below 1 mg l 1 whereas higher nh4 concentrations appear under suboxic to anoxic conditions with fe2 concentrations above 1 mg l 1 lamontagne et al 2005 the texture of porous media affects the inorganic n fraction by influencing the redox conditions because reducing conditions in groundwater are created when the organic matter in clay is oxidized groundwater with intercepting clay layers results in relatively high nh4 concentrations up to 1 8 mg l 1 biddau et al 2019a the organic component has been overlooked in previous studies on the n species in groundwater recently the don which is a potential precursor of disinfection byproducts and mineral n fractions has been regarded as a new emerging contaminant table 2 summarizes the reported concentrations of both organic and inorganic n species in groundwater data on don in the groundwater were only available in limited publications with the mean values of don ranging from 0 126 to 21 4 mg n l 1 the highest concentration was measured in shallow groundwater 2 2 m below ground level beneath a dairy production farm 50 28 mg l 1 necpalova et al 2012 the don tdn ratios range from 0 1 to 98 5 with mean values of 10 54 60 the large variations in the don tdn ratio indicate that the n distribution in groundwater is site specific and might be partially related to many complex factors wang et al 2016 a b reported that don is significantly affected by the thickness of the vadose zone while kroeger et al 2006 proposed that the don tdn ratio is more closely related to the path length through the aquifer than to the path length through the vadose zone therefore further efforts are needed to address the don distribution in groundwater and governing mechanisms 4 n transformation processes in the vadose zone groundwater system 4 1 research methodology the methodologies for the qualitative and quantitative identification of n transformation processes are presented in a simplified diagram in fig 2 different methodologies were employed depending on the study objectives 4 1 1 lab based method the lab based incubation method is the most common disruptive method used to quantify the transformation rate by collecting soil aquifer materials and incubating them under controlled laboratory condition lab based methods can be classified into two categories non stable isotope 15n tracing and stable isotope 15n tracing without the input of the 15n stable isotope the transformation rate of a specific process is usually quantified by determining the concentration changes of the reactant or product compared with the original concentration level different transformation processes are investigated using the following different reactant or product for instance to determine the denitrification rate the acetylene block incubation method is usually used to inhibit further transformation of n2o to n2 retaining n2o as the final product wang et al 2018a b c xiong et al 2015 by quantifying the accumulated n2o within a specific time period the denitrification rate can then be calculated it is easy to carry out this method but it also has several flaws 1 if the concentration of a specific n species is controlled by more than one process the contribution of each process cannot be separated and 2 if other n containing amendments are added to the soil the transformation rates of the n components in the amendment and natural soil cannot be discriminated despite the convenience and cost effectiveness of the non 15n tracing incubation method the soil slurry based 15n tracing incubation method is more widely used because it can be used to more accurately follow the transformation path of the labeled n species gao et al 2017 therefore difficulties with respect to distinguishing the contributions of different processes due to the variation of a specific n species can be overcome for instance the direct determination of denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox rates in soils is almost impossible because of the high atmospheric background of n2 and complex relationships but their potential rates and respective contributions to total n reduction can be determined by using the slurry based 15n tracing technique combined with membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims shan et al 2016 rahman et al 2018 in addition this method can be used to assess both the natural transformation capacity of soil aquifer materials and the transformation potential while implementing other n containing amendments clague et al 2015a although measurements with 15n tracers are efficient ways to study n transformation processes they do not distinguish the contribution of coupled dnra anammox codenitrification to the n2 production from denitrification nie et al 2019 4 1 2 field based methods because the lab based techniques usually suffer from uncertainty due to sampling disturbance kaur et al 2010 nonintrusive field based methods are gradually adopted as efficient alternatives the field based approaches can be grouped into three categories based on the employed stable isotope technology non stable isotope tracing injected stable isotope tracing and natural stable isotope analysis many field based approaches without 15n tracers have been proposed such as in situ core incubation and closed buried bags clivot et al 2017 for instance in situ n2 quantification with mims was used to quantify denitrification at low cost however similar to the non stable isotope tracing method in the laboratory this method cannot be used to separate the contributions of n2 production between denitrification and other processes zhou et al 2017 to compensate for this flaw injection based isotopic techniques are employed in natural soil uncapped polyvinyl chloride cores are installed into the soil injected with 15n tracers and incubated in situ prior to being sampled after tracers addition silver et al 2005 the corresponding approach used in groundwater is named push pull method jahangir et al 2017 in addition to 15n tracer injection the natural 15n abundance can be used to predict n transformation processes because the isotopic enrichment factor of n species is considerably influenced by various microbiological processes the tendency to discriminate 15n 14n and 18o 16o provides evidence to support the qualitative and quantitative determination for a specific transformation process nikolenko et al 2018 for instance denitrification is indicated by a slope ranging from 1 3 to 2 1 based on plotting 15n and 18o clague et al 2015b biddau et al 2019b compared with quantitative analysis a more detailed and accurate cycling process n sources and flow paths and isotope fractionation factor should be used to quantify the transformation rates by using the natural 15n abundance houlton and bai 2009 clague et al 2015b fang et al 2015 therefore a constant and accurately determined isotope fractionation factor is the necessary prerequisite for calculation of the n transformation rate clague et al 2015b wang et al 2018a b c 4 2 key transformation processes and influencing factors the key transformation processes are reviewed in the following subsections and the reported activity and influencing factor are presented and discussed see fig 3 approximately 70 publications were collected for the data analysis containing a total of 1521 soil samples more than 90 of the studies have been published since 2010 the n transformation processes in soil have been greatly illuminated over decades of research nonetheless the n cycle in the deep vadose zone and groundwater is still debated 4 2 1 mineralization nitrogen mineralization is the key process that converts organic n into inorganic n by soil microorganisms jia et al 2017 the net n mineralization nnm resulting from the balance between the gross n mineralization and n immobilization by soil microorganisms is commonly assessed by measuring the rate of inorganic n accumulation in soil non 15n tracing incubation tests clivot et al 2017 based on the reviewed publications table s2 the net mineralization activity in soils greatly varies depending on different soil types and properties the net n mineralization activities range from 5 58 to 2 88 0 12 to 7 38 1 55 to 3 36 and 0 23 2 46 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland grassland forest and flooded paddy wetland soils respectively to separate the process of mineralization and immobilization the gross n nitrification rates were directly quantified in a small number of recent studies using the 15n tracing method the gross n mineralization activities range from 0 34 to 5 26 0 23 to 7 88 0 41 to 13 45 and 0 01 to 5 60 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland grassland forest and flooded paddy wetland soils respectively the maximum values are generally higher than the net mineralization rates the mineralization has previously been studied based on measurements of soil cores taken at shallow depths as summarized above because organic n is believed to exist mainly in soil rather than in the relatively anoxic deep vadose zone and groundwater however because of the increasing evidence indicating the occurrence of don in groundwater table 2 the mineralization potential in the deep profile should be further investigated soil mineralization is a biochemical process that involves the depolymerization of complex organic substrates deaminization of amino acids and nitrification of ammonium nh4 cline et al 2018 therefore the soil properties and environmental factors mainly influence the n mineralization by mediating the activities and communities of microorganisms clivot et al 2017 as the most critical influencing factor the soil carbon simultaneously influences the gross mineralization and immobilization the balance of their relative importance determines its effect on the net mineralization on one hand some studies suggested that the gross mineralization can be inhibited with high soil c n ratios or with labile c addition because microbes must immobilize rather than mineralize n to maintain the stoichiometric ratio of c n in their biomass or heterotrophs may have outcompeted autotrophic nitrifiers for nh4 teklay et al 2010 yang et al 2017 on the other hand the results of some other studies support a higher gross n mineralization favored by fresh organic matter e g greenhouse manure and biochar due to the positive priming effect of the availability of soluble carbon fontaine et al 2003 montaño et al 2007 chu and grogan 2010 ameloot et al 2015 xu et al 2016 therefore conflicting findings about the effect of soil carbon on the net mineralization were reported for different ecosystems in addition the soil mineral n concentration st luce et al 2016 soil ph cheng et al 2013 and soil temperature and moisture wang et al 2006 guntiñas et al 2012 are also crucial proximal factors directly controlling the soil microbial activity while different flooding periods seasonal pattern variations and land use types are distal factors that affect the n mineralization by influencing the proximal factors guntiñas et al 2012 schrama et al 2013 hu et al 2015 tete et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the implementation of several practices has been suggested to improve the n mineralization such as prescribed burning zhang et al 2018a b c d inorganic phosphate addition chen et al 2016a b and b amyloliquefaciens dt amendment hui et al 2018 which modifies the above mentioned influencing factors in different ways 4 2 2 nitrification nitrification is the biological oxidation of nh4 via hydroxylamine nh2oh to no2 and further to no3 medinets et al 2015 it represents a middle step involved in the mineralization in general the nitrification activity is usually indicated by the net and gross nitrification rates according to different measurement methods the net nitrification activity in surface soil assessed by measuring the rate of no3 accumulation in the soil ranges from 0 03 48 μg n g 1 d 1 to date the gross n nitrification rates have been directly investigated in few studies it ranges from 0 00 to 26 6 μg n g 1 d 1 based on the comparison of both the gross and net activities of nitrification and mineralization the nitrification rates are much higher than the reported range of mineralization rates reflecting depolymerizing organic substrates rather than nitrification is a bottleneck nitrification can occur in two ways that is via mutualistic symbiosis between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob or directly by recently discovered comammox bacteria i e complete aob environmental factors affect the nitrification process by primarily influencing the nitrifier reactivity the substrate availability teklay et al 2010 gao et al 2016 yang et al 2017 soil physicochemical properties ph hanan et al 2016 and temperature and moisture szukics et al 2010 are known to be the critical factors affecting the n nitrification in addition to affecting the microbial activity the relative abundance of aob versus that of aoa also responds to the variation of the environmental factors the nh4 concentration soil ph values and soil depth are key factors in determining the relative contribution of aoa and aob to nitrification the aoa tend to dominate the nitrification at low nh4 concentrations ouyang et al 2017 in acidic soils hu et al 2014 and in the lower soil depth ouyang et al 2017 compared with soil little is known about nitrification in the deep vadose zone and groundwater zhu et al 2018 reported that the nitrification rates decrease with increasing soil depth until the nitrification is undetectable in deeper subsurface soils 140 160 cm and deep soils 280 300 cm in several previous studies miller et al 2018 it has been speculated that the conversion of nh4 to no3 by nitrification does not occur in groundwater because the nitrification remains arrested facilitating nh4 accumulation when the average do concentration is below 1 0 mg l 1 however the possibility of nitrification occurrence was confirmed in other studies by observing the concurrent occurrence of nh4 concentration decrease and no3 concentration increase during in situ monitoring zuo et al 2018 li et al further 2015 proposed that nitrification is promoted by an increasing water table which elevates the groundwater do and eh thereby stimulating the nitrifier activity otherwise the nitrification would be inhibited smith et al 2006 measured the nitrification rate within a sand and gravel aquifer on cape cod ma using a series of single well injection tests the nitrification rates were found to be 0 02 0 28 mmol l aquifer 1 h 1 under in situ redox conditions and up to 0 81 mmol l aquifer 1 h 1 with non limiting substrate concentrations thus the nitrification depends on the redox conditions more quantitative information is required to provide further environmental evidence 4 2 3 denitrification denitrification is the stepwise reduction of no3 to no2 nitric oxide nitrous oxide and dinitrogen gas medinets et al 2015 the denitrification rates range from 0 04 27 34 μg n g 1 d 1 table s4 the denitrification activities range from 0 013 to 3 95 0 105 to 9 9 0 112 to 3 05 and 0 04 to 27 34 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland grassland forest and flooded paddy wetland soils respectively the highest value 27 34 μg n g 1 d 1 was detected in a paddy soil in guangxi china yang et al 2015a b because denitrification is mostly performed by particular groups of heterotrophic bacteria during anaerobic respiration the supplies of carbon hayakawa et al 2012 no3 palta et al 2014 and oxygen zhang et al 2009 are inevitably the principal proximal factors controlling the denitrification rates they also control the ratio of n2o n2 in the products the soil moisture hayakawa et al 2012 and soil texture deng et al 2011 correlate with the denitrification potential by influencing the redox conditions other distal controls e g land use and topography indirectly affect the soil denitrification by affecting the proximal factors xiong et al 2015 previous research on soil denitrification focused on natural factors but recent evidence suggested that human activity such as pesticides su et al 2019 nano particles liu et al 2018 and emerging contaminant chen et al 2016a b accumulations in soil also affect the denitrification rates although the occurrence of denitrification has been verified in soil of different land use types it is still debated if denitrification accounts for significant no3 loss in the deep vadose zone conflicting results have been reported by different investigators zhang et al 2013 and jia et al 2018 assessed the denitrification potential in 30 m and 50 200 m thick vadose zones respectively by investigating the natural abundance and distribution of n isotopic compositions they proposed that most of the leachable no3 from the soil zone is hardly subjected to denitrification based attenuation in the deep vadose zone based on the following three observations 1 the profile of the borehole showed little variations with respect to δ15n values with depth 2 an insignificant negative correlation was observed between δ15n and the no3 content and 3 the δ15n and δ18o values did not strongly follow the denitrification slope nevertheless zhou et al 2017 observed considerable n2 concentrations at 0 6 0 8 m zhu et al 2018 recorded a denitrification activity of 0 06 nmol n g 1 h 1 in deep soil 280 300 cm in the summer these results provide evidences to support that denitrification likely occurs even beneath the surface soil the controversial understanding of the occurrence of denitrification in the deep vadose zone might be accounted for by different conditions soil depth redox condition organic carbon content etc in different studies compared with the limited information of the denitrification in the deep vadose zone more information is available for the analysis of denitrification in groundwater qualitatively and quantitatively hinkle and tesoriero 2014 suggested that active ongoing denitrification is related to the substantial co occurrence of no3 and n2 recently jahangir s group took the initiative to quantitatively determine in situ groundwater denitrification rates beneath agricultural land jahangir et al 2013 and integrated constructed wetland jahangir et al 2017 the measured denitrification rates were in the range of 0 0013 0 470 μg n g 1 d 1 and 0 123 1 063 μg n g 1 d 1 respectively they also demonstrated the positive effect of introducing a cover crop mustard to agricultural management practices on the groundwater denitrification rates enhancement jahangir et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 reported high denitrification activity in groundwater accounting for 65 83 no3 removal due to strong reducing conditions 4 2 4 dnra the dnra is the conversion of no3 to nh4 via no2 medinets et al 2015 which is probably the least studied n transformation process in the soil system in recent years dnra has been increasingly investigated in n cycle studies to explore its importance for the n cycle although dnra has been found in many soils including upland soil forest grassland and cropland soils and flooded soil paddy wetland and flood plain soils the dnra activity is not always consistent for a range of spatial scales sites to regions presumably due to unique conditions the dnra rates in soils display a wide range between 0 00 and 33 34 μg n g 1 d 1 contributing to 3 to 99 of the soil no3 removal production table s5 the highest value 33 34 μg n g 1 was detected in a grassland soil with loam texture under a soil moisture level of 80 water filled pore space wfps friedl et al 2018 the conditions and influencing factors favoring the occurrence of either denitrification or dnra are still under debate the most important proximal influential factors for the dnra process are redox conditions related factors although the dnra is traditionally assumed to occur under highly reduced conditions there are many recent indications that the dnra is less sensitive to o2 than denitrification and might be important in relatively oxidized environments chen et al 2015a b the dnra is assumed to occur under no3 electron acceptor limited conditions and high carbon electron donor availability where the dnra is favored over denitrification at a c no3 ratio above 12 friedl et al 2018 putz et al 2018 in most studies the application of a labile c source e g livestock waste reducing agent and or land rewetting was required to induce detectable dnra rates in agricultural soils by driving heterotrophic soil respiration and reducing the soil redox potential friedl et al 2018 in addition several studies showed that additional electron donors fe2 also stimulate the dnra process robertson and thamdrup 2017 while additional electron acceptor free sulfide inhibit the dnra lu et al 2013 the dnra is also affected by several distal factors such as the wfps mean annual precipitation clay content chen et al 2015a b land use putz et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 soil depth sgouridis et al 2011 gao et al 2017 and invasion of wetland plant gao et al 2017 which are closely related to anaerobic conditions and the c no3 ratio in addition the dnra tends to be facilitated under higher temperatures chen et al 2015a b and high soil ph values zhang et al 2015 which stimulate the microbial activity in comparison with research on the dnra in soil few publications have disclosed the dnra process in the deep vadose zone and groundwater zhu et al 2018 investigated the dnra activity in deep profiles 300 cm depth the dnra in surface soil at a rate of at 0 08 0 10 nmol n g 1 h 1 was found to play a limited role 4 9 3 5 in the no3 removal compared with denitrification while the dnra dominated 54 8 79 7 the no3 reduction with an activity of 0 05 0 08 nmol n g 1 h 1 in the deeper subsurface profile 140 160 cm although the occurrence of dnra in groundwater has been previously assumed based on the concurrent increase of nh4 n as well as a simultaneous sharp decrease in the no3 n concentration ki et al 2015 only recently jahangir et al 2017 firstly quantified the contribution of denitrification and dnra to no3 n consumption in groundwater 14 16 and 40 63 respectively 4 2 5 anammox anammox is a n2 formation process with nh4 and no2 as electron donor and acceptor respectively medinets et al 2015 similar to dnra anammox has also rarely been studied we have retrieved 17 articles about anammox in the surface soil system since 2000 12 of which were already summarized in the review of nie et al 2019 most of the anammox related research was carried out on paddy soil 70 followed by studies on cropland soil 23 the anammox activity ranged from 0 0034 to 15 59 μg n g 1 d 1 contributing to 0 4 77 9 of the total n loss nie et al 2019 summarized the influencing factors in their review the anammox activity gradually decreases with increasing soil depth zhu et al 2018 reported that the anammox rates in surface 0 60 cm subsurface 60 80 cm and deeper subsurface soils 140 160 cm are in the range of 0 01 0 46 0 12 0 18 and 0 01 0 03 nmol n g 1 h 1 respectively despite the declining rate anammox is always the dominant pathway 51 4 89 5 of n loss in deep layers the contribution of anammox to n loss in groundwater was first observed in massachusetts usa using isotope tracers böhlke et al 2006 clark et al 2008 robertson et al 2012 and smits et al 2009 inferred that anammox is the likely process based on the distributions of din constituents nh4 no3 n2 progressive enrichment of δ15n nh4 and the occurrence of biomarkers however they did not directly measured its presence recently smith et al 2015 made the first attempt to quantify the anammox rate and its contribution to the n2 production in a n contaminated aquifer with the values as 10 nmol n2 n l 1 day 1 and 39 90 wang et al 2017 a b c also highlighted that anammox in the groundwater plays a critical role in the n loss they determined anammox rates and contributions to the n2 production ranging from 0 002 to 0 249 μg n g 1 d 1 and 37 5 67 6 respectively 5 n budget in the vadose zone and potential n leaching into groundwater 5 1 n budget in the surface soil system 5 1 1 process based models application and uncertainties in the past few decades various simulation approaches integrating process based knowledge of the n cycle have been developed to explore the soil n dynamics and quantify n fluxes negm et al 2014 examples of these models include the water and nitrogen management model wnmm li et al 2007 root zone water quality model rzwqm cameira et al 2014 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat yakoub et al 2017 agricultural production systems simulator apsim vogeler et al 2019 denitrification decomposition dndc zhang et al 2018a b c d toughreact n maggie et al 2008 and daycent álvaro fuentes et al 2017 ten specific n processes were considered in these models nitrification denitrification volatilization leaching symbiotic fixation assimilation mineralization immobilization plant uptake and clay fixation brill et al 2017 assessed nine widely used n models and found that all above mentioned processes could be simulated i e 70 by the models however none of these process based models have taken the dnra and anammox processes into consideration because few coefficients are available due to limited literatures as shown in section 3 2 which would lead to overestimation of the n loss from leaching into groundwater brilli et al 2017 proposed that a major weakness of these process based models is their scalability over time and space in terms of the temporal scale the models often fail to show ideal simulation performances with respect to n transformation both at short time and long time scales because the different models have their own particular strengths at different time scales vogeler et al 2013 for example the daycent model is of advantage when simulating n2o emissions on a seasonal scale compared with a daily scale dalal et al 2003 in terms of the space scale process based models have great advantages in modeling small scales site and watershed scales over large scales country and global scales li et al 2017 for example dndc model has been widely adopted to estimate greenhouse gas emissions taft et al 2019 ammonia volatilization li et al 2019 and n leaching li et al 2014 at site and watershed scales under different cropland management and n leaching mitigation scenarios however its application to estimate the stocks and flows of n at the national or global scales were much challenging the major limitation in applying this model at the national scale is the requirement of adequate data to initialize and run the model qiu et al 2011 recently yu et al 2019 made a breakthrough by using the dndc and other nitrogen balance models to estimate spatial patterns of nitrogen discharge into water bodies across china from 1955 to 2014 5 1 2 mass balance models application and uncertainties compared with process based models mass balance models with a lower complexity are more suitable for the description of soil n dynamics at higher spatial and temporal scales a basic n mass balance framework or model is established to quantify the n budget based on the difference between the n input and n output of a specific system gu et al 2013 he et al 2018 in such an approach positive n budget values represent the accumulation of soil n and negative values indicate the depletion of soil n the data related to the n input and output can be obtained in different ways the agriculture related data e g fertilizer application crop yield fertilization rate for artificial grassland n excreta rate for animals and fertilization rate for urban lawns can be collected from statistical materials e g agriculture statistical report national bureau of statistics agricultural products cost benefit compilation of information and government statistical yearbooks and bulletines gu et al 2013 he et al 2018 the n deposition related data can be obtained from references and the deposition monitoring network liu et al 2013a b in addition to quantify the n loss by using transformation processes nh3 volatilization denitrification runoff and leaching the reaction parameters n loss rates and coefficients of the n loss rate of nh3 n2 n2o no and no3 leaching and runoff should be collected from publications he et al 2018 the model parameters used for the evaluation of the soil n balance have large uncertainties he et al 2018 the n input data including the chemical fertilizer manure seed n deposition and irrigation had a high confidence level because they were reported for different time periods or regions in published work in contrast most n output parameters including nh3 n2 n2o no and no3 leaching and runoff have a low confidence level because these outputs can be significantly affected by the crop species soil types fertilizer source and climate conditions the lack of n loss coefficients for different regions contributes to uncertainties in the regional estimation of the n budget therefore on one hand the database of transformation rates should be enriched on the other hand efforts should be made to correlate the n loss parameters and regional soil environmental properties such that the detailed parameterization of the n balance for a more refined scale and to better represent global emission patterns with lower uncertainty becomes easier shcherbak et al 2014 5 1 3 n budget at the national and global scales nitrogen budget analysis is mostly conducted in the agricultural ecosystem because the crop production is the single largest cause of human alteration of the global n cycle liu et al 2010 presented a comprehensive assessment of the n flows in cropland on a global scale and discovered significant spatial variations in the input and output rates countries with major food production areas e g china western europe and the midwest in the united states usually displayed a high n input from mineral fertilizer use and high n output based on harvested crops regions with both high precipitation and high fertilizer inputs such as south china and several countries in western europe usually suffer from high n leaching the soil n balance in the agricultural system was calculated at the national scale for several countries using a multi year trend although the crop yield remains the prominent n output contributor over long time periods the evolution of the major n input contributor in agricultural systems was observed in the uk from 1800 to 2010 muhammed et al 2018 from 1800 to 1950 the major part of the estimated n input originated from soil organic matter mineralization while the major contributor was converted to fertilizer in the current period 1970 2010 similar to the uk he et al 2018 indicated that the dominant n input and output in china s croplands were chemical fertilizer and crop removal respectively from 1984 to 2014 compared with studies focusing on the agricultural systems the n budget analysis for nonagricultural systems is very limited due to the difficulties and uncertainties with respect to the collection of data for the n input from sewer exfiltration septic tank infiltration soil aquifer treatment and landfill leaching gu et al 2013 conducted a n balance calculation in coupled human and natural systems in china and discovered an increasing contribution of nonagricultural sources to the total n leakage to groundwater during the past three decades the contribution of cropland decreased from 50 in the 1980s to 40 in the 2000s 5 2 n leaching from the soil to the deep vadose zone the nitrogen leaching rate or coefficient is a quite important parameter for the n budget evaluation and groundwater contamination risk assessment most of the studies aiming to obtain the n leaching rate or coefficient are based on in situ field tests as shown in section 3 1 2 the data from in situ experiments are also used to calibrate water and solute transport models such as hydrus which helps to simplify the optimization of land management strategies matteau et al 2019 5 2 1 n leaching potential in agricultural systems the n leaching can be quantified as annual n loss kg n ha 1 y 1 or total n loss within the growing season kg n ha 1 table 3 summarizes the leaching data in agricultural systems expressed as mentioned above expressed as annual n loss the total n leaching values range from 2 03 to 139 855 kg n ha 1 y 1 a wide range of total n leaching values 7 1 351 8 kg n ha 1 was also observed when the total n loss within the growing season used as the indicator many factors affect the soil n loss including the rainfall intensity slope gradient soil properties land use types and agricultural measures wu et al 2018a b in addition in the grazing pasture system different animal species also affect the n leaching hoogendoorn et al 2011 nowadays different methods and management patterns are adopted to alleviate the n leaching such as the catch crop guo et al 2018 controlled release n fertilizers ke et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a b c d nitrification inhibitors li 2008 decrease of the irrigation levels chen et al 2018a b addition of amendments e g biochar peat and hydrogel barley straw separated effluent solids chen et al 2018a b borchard et al 2019 malcolm et al 2019 martin del campo et al 2019 and lateral spread of n from urine patches cichota et al 2018 the data in table 3 show that the don tdn ratio widely varies from 1 21 to 91 24 although it has been reported in some studies that the don loss accounting for a small portion is less crucial compared with the din loss walmsley et al 2018 several other studies indicate that the don loss might be a big contributor chen et al 2018a b lusk et al 2018 reported that high don percentages in tdn 88 94 were detected in leachate regardless if chemical fertilizer was implemented or not a higher ratio of don leaching is usually observed under the following conditions in natural ecosystems compared with fertilized cropland hoogendoorn et al 2011 in older land with rising temperature in winter chen et al 2018a b after application of organic amendments wang et al 2018b and inclusion of a continuous grass cover crop l multiflorum salazar et al 2019 considering the distinct n fractions dominating the leachate corresponding management methods should be selected for different site conditions for instance planting sweet corn as catch crop can reduce n losses by 12 6 mostly via the reduction of don leaching 22 2 compared with din leaching guo et al 2018 while the implementation of non inversion tillage and cover crops leads to a net retention of n at the field scale mainly due to the significant reduction in din leaching compared with don leaching walmsley et al 2018 5 2 2 n leaching potential in nonagricultural systems in contrast to obtaining the fertilization capacity in agricultural systems the determination of the exact amount of sewer exfiltration water and landfill leachate which are produced out of control is very difficult kapelewska et al 2019 therefore it is widely believed that wastewater and solid waste disposal systems are significant sources of n in groundwater however few published studies have quantified the recharge and pollutant load of the groundwater iverson et al 2018 xu et al 2018 mienis and arye 2018 conducted the first research on the long term behavior of tn and its components in a sat system in israel they reported that up to 60 of the tn could be removed in the upper vadose zone 63 m and up to 20 was continuously removed in the deeper zone 63 103 m with 17 51 of tn further leaching even under the protection of a thick vadose zone the possibility of n leaching in the sat system reaching the groundwater was high although there is evidence of high concentrations of tn and nh4 in the deep vadose zone and groundwater beneath landfill sites confirming the negative influence of waste landfills despite of their construction and insulation aharoni et al 2017 the n flux into the groundwater from landfill leachate has not been quantified 5 3 n accumulation in the deep vadose zone traditional studies on the n cycle in terrestrial ecosystems tend to only examine the soil rooting zone which is believed to be the most biologically active area however walvoord et al 2003 reported that 14 71 of the n inventory in the vadose zone for desert regions is missed if the subsoil 1 m reservoir is not taken into consideration recently large accumulations of residual no3 in the deep vadose zone at different depths were reported for croplands 90 200 cm zhao et al 2006 90 180 cm ju et al 2006 4 20 m zhou et al 2016 1 11 m min et al 2018 the distribution patterns of no3 n accumulation in the soil profile in different agricultural land use types differ ju et al 2006 min et al 2018 sebilo et al 2013 has conducted a long term tracer study and found that 12 15 of the fertilizer derived n was still residing in the soil organic matter three decades after application of isotopically labeled fertilizer n to agricultural soils these evidences indicate that the n from chemical fertilization is not immediately transported into the aquifer but temporarily remains stored in the deep vadose zone although soluble solutes are carried downward along the irrigation water flux wang et al 2013 firstly defined the nitrate time bomb because they found that it can take decades for leached no3 from the soil to discharge into groundwater due to the store of no3 and its potentially long time travel time in the vadose zones despite the growing evidence of large accumulations of residual din at different depths in the vadose zone wu et al 2019 firstly quantified the don accumulation in a profile deeper than the rooting zone 1 m and determined the 3 m zone to be the main inventory accounting for 64 of the don in addition to site scale evidence ascott et al 2017 estimated the no3 storage in the vadose zone at the global scale to be 605 1814 tg and reported that the no3 storage per unit area is positively correlated with the thickness of the vadose zones based on this the deep vadose zone serves as an important temporary or permanent n pool the n cycle in the deep vadose zone should be supported by additional studies to quantify the n fluxes into groundwater and improve groundwater contamination risk management 6 summary of the missing n pieces and research needs 6 1 n in dissolved organic form don in terms of soluble n attention is always paid to mineral fractions however a growing body of evidence supports that the don could be an overlooked pathway for n leaching into groundwater yet has been previously assumed to be insignificant the collected distribution data show that the don is ubiquitous in soil solution table 1 and has wide access to groundwater accounting for a high don tdn ratio up to 98 5 at some specific sites table 2 in addition to soil within the rooting zone don was also detected in the deeper profile wu et al 2019 furthermore except for the observation of don occurrence throughout the vadose zone groundwater profile don leaching out of the rooting zone has been quantified in many agricultural ecosystems table 3 with a don ratio in the total leached n ranging from 1 21 to 91 24 although these data can be used to provide insights into the profile distribution and leaching potential of don the research on the don in the vadose zone groundwater is still in its infancy the literature is insufficient to draw a conclusion on the effect of don on the n cycle it can be hypothesized that don may play dual roles in simultaneously promoting and inhibiting the no3 accumulation in groundwater by being involved in further mineralization and stimulating denitrification as labile carbon source respectively which role prevails depends on the chemical composition of the don however little is known about the molecular composition of the don which is partially due to technical difficulties hampering the identification of key components jones and kielland 2012 understanding the don related n transformation process in groundwater has important implications for solving the large scale no3 contamination problem based on the stimulated natural attenuation therefore to answer the questions above further research is needed to 1 collect more data originating from different geographical areas and site conditions 2 develop an optimal methodology for the analysis of the molecular don composition 3 quantify all factors driving the distribution of don in the vadose zone groundwater system and 4 clearly discriminate and quantify don involved transformation processes 6 2 n in the deep vadose zone from the perspective of depth profiling the knowledge of the n transformation in surface soil is adequate while there is a large knowledge gap with respect to the deep vadose zone all key n transformation processes mineralization nitrification denitrification dnra and anammox are observed in the surface soil under different land uses site specific transformation rates based on 70 publications and 1521 samples were summarized to provide parameters for budget models tables s2 s6 regarding n transformation in the deep vadose zone different studies are inconsistent the results of some studies indicated that the deep vadose zone is an important storage location for n rather than a biological active zone zhang et al 2013 and jia et al 2018 excluded the possibility of denitrification occurrence in thick vadose zones based on natural n isotopic composition analysis nevertheless zhou et al 2017 and zhu et al 2018 observed considerable concentrations of excess n2 and recorded denitrification rates at depths of 60 80 cm and 280 300 cm respectively illustrating that the n loss through denitrification in the deep vadose zone should not be neglected in addition to denitrification the occurrence of nitrification dnra and anammox in the deep vadose zone are also qualitatively supported by n speciation and biomarkers evolution trends suggesting that the deep vadose zone is not only a n stock but also an efficient filter for dissolved n because of biogeochemical processes that occur during vertical transfer therefore the scarcity of measured n transformation data in the deep vadose zone dramatically limits the n stock estimation in regions with thick vadose zones and further hampers the global n stock assessment n reservoirs in the deep vadose zone have implications for long term groundwater quality degradation because the n could accumulate in the deep vadose zone for a long term even if we stop the overuse of n fertilizer immediately these cumulative n deposits would still exist for decades changes in climate extreme rainfall events and vegetation could then mobilize n reservoirs in the deep vadose zone driving the accumulated n eventually go deeper with water to shallow groundwater with local to regional effects therefore future terrestrial n budgets at the national scale and at time scales of 10 years should consider incorporation of these nutrient stores for effective management of n in the environment 6 3 n in nonagricultural systems because wastewater and solid waste derived pollutants have been frequently detected at depths below the ground level powell et al 2003 rutsch et al 2008 wastewater and solid waste disposal sites have been included as n sources but their importance tends to be over shadowed by the largest source that is the overuse of fertilizer although nonagricultural sources have been identified for decades very little is known about their contribution to n releases recently gu et al 2013 reported that the contribution of landfill leakage has increased rapidly in the past three decades in china and has become the second largest source for groundwater after cropland with a contribution ratio of 34 in 2008 compared with agricultural source the nonagricultural sources of n may lead to the much higher accumulation of groundwater n in urban regions especially in industrial regions in addition the nonagricultural sources are very variable between urban areas because the pollution extent and nature will depend on many urban and natural attributes of the city therefore the estimates of the total load of n from the nonagricultural sources are greatly needed for closing the nutrient cycle and estimating the global n balance detailed information about the n transformation at nonagricultural sites provides a basis for the quantification of regional n budgets in contrast to croplands high concentrations of co existing pollutants e g biodegradable or recalcitrant organic matter heavy metals in leachates individually or in combination affect the n transformation in complex ways costa et al 2019 due to vast water composition variations in different leachates the n transformation in different nonagricultural ecosystems should be more widely investigated however compared with agricultural sites the in situ experimental sites for n transformation and leaching assessment in nonagricultural ecosystems are limited mienis and arye 2018 conducted the first sat system related field scale research on the long term behavior of n in the vadose zone they found that 17 51 of the tn is at the risk of being further leached into groundwater although a significant amount of tn is removed by the thick vadose zone up to 103 m therefore the fate and transport of n through the vadose zone groundwater profile in nonagricultural systems should be better characterized and the mass of n in the nonagricultural systems should be included in future terrestrial n budgets at national and global scales which might help to reduce the n budget uncertainty and improve environmental management 7 conclusions the advances with respect to n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system are reviewed in this article by focusing on the n distribution transformation and budget by reviewing the n distribution studies the author aimed to determine the new emerging n species to be included in the n budget by reviewing n transformation studies the author established a transformation database based on the collection of site specific rates from 70 publications for the budget modeling major knowledge gaps exist regarding the don occurrence and chemical composition n transformation mechanisms and kinetics in the deep vadose zone and n budget in nonagricultural systems these gaps represent the greatest needs with respect to future research of the n cycle in the vadose zone groundwater system additionally based on a precisely quantification of groundwater environmental carrying capacity and a clear understanding of n cycle through the pathway vadose zone n norms defining maximum amount of n input into soil would be determined for more efficient n regulation which may give new impetus to n management strategy reform even industry adjustment declaration
