12385,this study aimed to evaluate the potential of handpump tubewell platform color as a low cost quick and convenient screening tool for as and mn in drinking water tubewells for this study groundwater samples and corresponding tubewell platform pictures were collected from 272 shallow tubewells in matlab upazila of south eastern bangladesh the result shows that arsenic concentration within the surveyed n 272 tubewells 99 n 269 exceeded the world health organization who guideline value of 10µg l and 98 n 267 exceeded the bangladesh drinking water standards bdws of 50µg l in relation to the platform color concept within 233 total 272 red colored platform tubewells 230 99 exceeded the who guideline value of 10µg l and 229 98 tubewells exceeded bdws of 50µg l this result shows a strong correlation between the development of red color stain on tubewell platform and as concentrations in the corresponding tubewell water this study suggests that red colored platform can be used for primary identification of tubewells with an elevated level of as and thus could prioritize sustainable as mitigation management in developing countries where water comes from reductive shallow aquifers this study did not confirm the potential for mn screening as red discoloration by fe oxides was found to mask the black discoloration of mn oxides it is recommended to further

results of the kit during a screening of as concentration in the tubewells on the contrary there are a limited number of field test kits for the determination of mn concentration in tubewell water hach field test kit model mn 5 is one of the mn concentration measurement kits whose consistency has not been proven yet research is still ongoing to develop rapid methods that would facilitate the screening of as and mn in a in short time in a convenient way overall it is difficult to identify the contaminated aquifers by testing a small number of tubewells through conventional field kits and laboratory analysis tonmoy et al 2016 in this context a quick screening of the tubewells based on visible features may aid to identify the respective tubewells and thereby to delineate the contaminated domains within a given area studies by mcarthur et al 2011 and biswas et al 2012a indicated that color stain developed on tubewells platforms could function as a screening tool for as and mn in drinking water wells in a major part of bangladesh and india tubewell platforms are often characterized either by red stains due to the precipitation of fe oxides or black stains due to the precipitation of mn oxides which have implications on water quality in generic terms mcarthur et al 2011 biswas et al 2012a these stains indicate the presence of high concentrations of dissolved fe which associated with as 10µg l developing red stains and elevated mn due to precipitation of mn oxides in water which is as safe 10µg l this particular color formation on tubewells platform and relation with fe mn and as concentration in groundwater is governed by different biogeochemical interactions bhattacharya et al 2002 2009 biswas et al 2012a 2012b biogeochemical interactions follow the sequence of terminal electron accepting processes teaps where the redox conditions primarily governed by microbial oxidation of organic matter this oxidation followed by reduction of mn oxyhydroxides before fe oxyhydroxides since mn is a stronger electron acceptor than fe reduction of mn oxyhydroxides releases both mn and as in groundwater and the released as is readily reabsorbed to fe oxy hydroxides in the less reduced aquifer sediments stuben et al 2003 von brömssen et al 2008 and water become mn enriched during extraction of this mn enriched water by pumping this soluble mn ii is microbially mediated oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to mn oxides which produces black coloration on tubewell platform and indicates that the well is as safe when the redox status reaches the fe reduction stage fe as well as absorbed as is being released to groundwater resulting in fe and as enriched aquifer and water extraction from this aquifer upon extraction fe is rapidly oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to fe oxides producing a red coloration on tubewell platform please note that mn is more soluble than fe in water at normal ph and fe oxidation kinetics are faster than for mn hence fe precipitates before mn and vice versa for higher mn fe ratio gingborn and wåhlén 2012 thus the color stain developed on tubewell platform may be used as screening tool for mn and as in groundwater in this study we have assessed the tubewell platform color as an as and mn screening tool in bangladesh tubewells water for wide application in as and mn affected areas for as the tool is evaluated

41819 23 48980 n to 90 59529 90 63375 e in the northwestern part of matlab north upazila in chandpur district southeastern bangladesh the study area includes satnal kalakanda sengarchar and part of sadullahpur unions demarcated by the confluence of ganges padma brahmaputra jamuna and meghna rivers the river dhanagoda separates the study area from matlab south upazila fig 1 the local weather is hot and humid with temperature ranges from 11 c in winter december to february to 35 c during summer june to october the average annual rainfall is 2000mm mozumder 2011 there is no long term groundwater fluctuation in the study area however due to seasonal variation in rainfall periodic groundwater fluctuation is visible the groundwater elevation reaches its peak after the rainy season in september and minimum april may at the beginning of the rainy season the peak was 7 12m and the minimum was 0 74m respectively from msl table 1 according to national water management plan nwmp 2000 the matlab area is a part of the southeastern hydrologic region of bangladesh this area is situated in the lower meghna flood plain lmfp and characterized by meander channels natural levees and scrolls and back swamps prepared by river scheme mozumder 2011 the redox characteristics of matlab subsurface geology divided into oxidizing and reducing aquifers and distinguished by sediment color and water chemistry hossain et al 2015 compared to oxidized aquifers reduced aquifers produce as enriched water than oxidized aquifers jonsson and lundell 2004 von brömssen et al 2007 biven and haller 2007 robinson et al 2011 several studies also revealed that brown or orange yellow sediments in the aquifer system mainly contain iron oxy hydroxides and the pore water in this sediment contains low dissolved arsenic and the porewater of grey sand sediments contains high dissolved arsenic van geen et al 2003 mcarthur et al 2004 hossain et al 2014 2015 according to a hydrogeological investigation from different organizations there are four different major groundwater bearing zones in 1986 master plan organization mpo bangladesh divided the country aquifer system into upper and lower aquifer sequences based on hydrogeology according to this classification upper aquifer system consists of sands silts and clays recharged through precipitation flood water while the deeper confined aquifers are recharged through the regional groundwater flow systems from the tripura hills von brömssen et al 2014 a 3 d aquifer model was conceptualized for matlab study area based on a series of vertical electric soundings ves and sediment characterization of the lithologs prepared during the installaton of the piezometer nests hossain et al 2010 mozumder 2011 von brömssen et al 2014 the region is characterized by five distinct hydrostratigraphic units and represented by three predominantly fine to medium sand aquifer units of variable thickness denoted as aquifer 1 aquifer 2 and aquifer 3 with two dominantly silty clayey aquitards aquitard 1 and aquitard 2 separating the aquifers 1 and 2 and aquifers 2 and 3 respectively fig 2 aquifer 1 has a general thickness of 25 60 m and comprises predominantly fine to medium sand of predominant black color formed as a part of meghna floodplain deposits most of the shallow tubewells installed in this aquifer are enriched with as in groundwater aquitard 1 act as a hydraullic barrier between aquifers 1 and 2 is dominated by intercalations of silty and sandy clay units with thickness varying between between 3 and 59 m von brömssen et al 2014 the underlying hydrostratigraphic unit designated as aquifer 2 generally occurring between depths of 40 100 m formed as a part of the chandina deltaic floodplain deposits is dominated by medium to fine sand the thickness of this aquifer unit ranges between 25 and 60 m and characterized by red and off white color encountered in the upper part of this unit especially in the southern part of the matlab region the tubewells installed in this aquifer is generally arsenic safe water this unit is separated from the underlying thick sequence of grey colored fine medium to coarse sand forming the aquifer 3 by aquitard 2 comprising silty clayey sediments with variable thickness at depths of around 100 m 2 2 hydraulic head measurements by piezometer nests fifteen piezometers nests each with a set of six wells p1 p6 were installed at different depth levels from 20 m to 235 m with an objective to study the hydraulic head characteristics within the arsenic hot spot area around matlab fig 3 for shallow wells hand percussion used for drilling and for deeper wells done by rotary reverse circulation drilling which is also known as donkey drilling groundwater levels were measured in each piezometer well during the period 2009 pre monsoon through 2013 post monsoon for monitoring the groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater samples were collected from the wells twice a year during the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods 2 3 groundwater sampling groundwater sampling from shallow 70m tubewells was carried out from a total of 272 drinking water wells in september and october 2011 during sampling each tubewell were adequately purged for few minutes depending on the depth prior to the collection of water samples from the wells sampling to get the screening level water sample for the analysis of as fe and mn in the laboratory the samples were filtered through 0 45µm sartorius membrane filter and 10ml sample water collected in 15ml pre washed high density polyethylene vials and the sampling bottle prepared by 1 5 acidification 14m hno3 to prevent the risk of acid handling in the field the geographical coordinates collected for each tubewell by global positioning system gps garmin gps60 besides this the major coloration on the platform examined carefully and recorded the owner and surveyors opinion on coloration a picture captured for each tubewells platform by a digital camera sony cyber shot w220 12mp 4x optical zoom the tubewells depths and installation year for both tubewells and platform also recorded from the owner the platform color re examined in the laboratory by an unbiased operator for cross verification of the identified colors the reciprocal agreement on platform color was more than 74 n 202 all disagreements n 70 was due to the separation of mixed color from red and black colored platform water samples shipped to the water chemistry laboratory at kth royal institute of technology stockholm sweden for trace element analysis the water samples analyzed for as fe and mn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap 6000 equipped with autosampler at the department of geological sciences stockholm university sweden 2 4 statistical analysis the effectiveness of platform color stain as as screening tool was evaluated by statistical analysis package based on bayesian statistics at the same time sensitivity specificity efficiency and predictive values were determined concerning who drinking water guideline value of 10µg l and bdws of 50µg l for both as and mn to validate the platform color as a screening tool 3 results and discussions 3 1 hydraulic head arsenic and redox characteristics the hydraulic head measurements from piezometer nests reveal that shallow aquifers are hydraulically separated from intermediate and deep aquifers fig 4 shallow depth groundwater level measurements from p1 and p2 clearly indicates that they are from a same hydrostratigraphic unit called aquifer 1 however shallow piezometers p3 and p4 provides hydraulic head data from aquifer 2 and finally intermediate p5 and deep p6 piezometers reveals similar pattern with some overlaps and belongs to same aquifer aquifer 3 system the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater samples from three different hydrostratigraphic unit showed distinct variations for shallow intermediate and deep aquifer system groundwater samples abstracted from shallow black colored sands which are dominated by ca mg hco3 to na cl hco3 type in off white and red sediments these variations depict the generic variations in the color of the aquifer sediments however the water samples collected from intermediate deep and deep aquifers are rather na ca mg cl hco3 to na cl hco3 type the groundwater in the shallow aquifers aquifer 1 are characterized by high as concentrations with median values of 71 646µg l derived from the black sand of the aquifer 1 these groundwaters also characterized by elevated doc hco3 fe nh4 n and po4 p with relatively low mn and so4 concentration and justified as release in groundwater system due to reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides bhattacharya et al 2002 von brömssen et al 2007 according to a previous study hossain et al 2015 the tubewell screen which is installed in the aquifer that consists of grey sands are generally in reducing condition and facilitate to produces fe and as rich water during further installation of shallow tubewells the local drillers can choose reddish brown sediments instead of grey sediments to avoid as rich water reddish brown sediments are produced due to oxidation of iron and sorbed as to produces comparatively low as water compared to grey sand aquifer 50µg l 3 2 tubewell classification according to screening depth to visualize the distribution pattern of as fe and mn related to depth the concentration level of as fe and mn observed per depth interval up to 52m such as 12 15 15 18 18 21 21 25 25 30 and 30 52m are presented in the following table table 2 almost 90 n 244 of tubewells installed at a depth of 12 25m were characterized by a very high concentration of as fe and mn with the increase in depth as concentration indicated high with some minor variation but for fe and mn the concentrations are slightly decreasing overall the tubewells within this shallow depth range are unsafe for drinking by considering both as and mn table 2 3 3 tubewell classification according to platform color based on the platform color the tubewells classified into three different color group namely red black and non identified ni fig 5 within 272 tubewells 237 tubewell platforms 87 were classified into a particular color group where 233 86 tubewell platforms identified as red 4 1 as black and rest 35 13 as ni due to undeveloped platform color undeveloped color may be the reasons for regular cleaning of the platform biofilm formation or algal growth on the platform the age of the platform also has an effect on color formation on the platform because newly built platforms are less exposed to develop coloration on the platform regardless of excessive mn or fe in tubewells water some tubewells platform have complex color neither red nor black which may be due to overlapping redox transition of fe and mn in the aquifer 3 4 assessment as an as screening tool amongst the surveyed n 272 tubewells 99 n 269 exceeded the who guideline value of as 10µg l and 98 n 267 exceeded bdws 50µg l considering the platform color among 233 red colored platform tubewells 99 n 230 exceeded the who guideline value of 10µg l and 98 n 229 tubewells exceeded bdws 50µg l tubewells with black colored platform n 4 were also found to contain as at levels exceeding the bdws value of 50µg l however the tubewells with platforms without any identifiable color ni color group ni color were 97 n 33 and these also exceeded bdws of 50µg l considering the who guideline value of 10µg l all the tubewells exceeded this level of concentration which assigned as ni n 35 alternatively if it was considered by as safe tubewells without considering platform color it was shown that only 1 n 5 within the cohort of 272 tubewells were safe considering bdws 50µg l and only three tubewells were safe considering who guideline value 10µg l when categorized in accordance to the platform color it was found that among all red colored platform tubewells only three and four were safe n 233 when comparing with the who drinking water guideline and bdws respectively among all ni colored tubewell platforms n 35 only one was found arsenic safe according to bdws but none of the black colored platform tubewells were safe for both who and bdws thus it was clear that ni color tubewells can be consider as as enriched and thereby unsafe for drinking purposes 3 5 usefulness as as screening tool the effectiveness of platform color as a screening tool for predicting the presence of as in tubewells depends on the high probability of true positive and negative values and correspondingly on the low probability of false positive and negative values relating to specific drinking water standards who and bdws fig 6 shows the relationship of the relevant true positive and negative false positive and negative values for who and bdws values table 3 summarizes the sensitivity specificity efficiency and positive and negative predictive values which also used as the indicators of effectiveness for screening capacity at who guideline value for as 10µg l the positive predictive value ppv of red colored platform tubewells was 98 7 while negative predictive value npv was zero the corresponding efficiency specificity and sensitivity of the tool were 97 0 and 98 3 accordingly wherein specificity and sencitivity means the test correctly identified those without and with as rich in red colored platform tubewells this result showed that platform color could use as an initial as screening tool in drinking water tubewells that installed in shallow aquifers 70m according to the bdws 50µg l the ppv was 95 4 and npv was zero due to the deficiency of of black colored platform tubewells the corresponding efficiency specificity and sensitivity of the tool were 96 6 0 no black colored tubewells with 50µg l and 98 3 the result also specified at bdws that the red color platform could use as as screening tool to identify as unsafe tubewells but black colored platform tubewells cannot be used as a screening tool to identify as safe tubewells it is also worth mentioning that there was a low coverage of arsenic tubewells 50ug l resulting in a low number of non discoloured tubewells therefore it is recommended to further investigate this screening tool in areas with higher well to well variability of as concentrations 3 6 assessment and usefulness as mn screening tool the mn distribution over the surveyed tubewells n 272 without considering platform color showed that almost all n 271 exceeded 100µg l of mn according to the platform color distribution within 233 red colored platform tubewells 99 6 n 232 exceeded bangladesh standard 100µg l this result displayed that red colored platform tubewells cannot be used as a screening tool to identify mn safe tubewells at bdws of 100mg l and this result was distinctly opposite as shown by biswas et al 2012a on the other hand all the tubewells with black n 4 and ni n 35 colored platform tubewells exceeded 100µg l bdws these results reveal that the co occurrence of high fe concentrations in the groundwater mask potential black discoloration by mn oxides due to the stronger staining of reddish fe oxides it should also be noted that the number of identified black colored platform wells 4 out of 272 is too limited to evaluate the concept that black colored platform tubewells produce as safe water 3 7 predictive value and prevalence of as and mn screening tool the relation between prevalence and predictive values also indicate the effectiveness of platform color as screening capacity of as and mn in handpump tubewells to extract drinking water from shallow groundwater aquifer since the black colored tubewells were hardly encountered in this study area only 4 the prevalence and predictive values could not be calculated for mn screening however this calculation was conducted for red colored platform tubewells to evaluate the screening capacity for as the bayesian model was used at a different cutoff level to evaluate the effect of prevalence and predictive values results on the tool the results shows that the ppv varies linearly with prevalence for both drinking water standard as who 10µg l and bdws 50µg l due to very few black colored platform tubewells n 4 compared to red colored n 233 this result also specified that highly as contaminated shallow depth tubewells should have a high level of fe which produces red coloration on the tubewell platform thus the performance of the color tool to identify a tubewell as as unsafe increases if the concentration of fe in that tubewell raise up and vice versa 4 applications from this study it can be concluded that tubewell platform color can be used as a rapid screening tool for as red color occurrence in reduced aquifers this study did not confirm the potential for mn screening as red discoloration by fe oxides was found to mask the black discoloration of mn oxides so it is clear that red color platform can be introduced at the policy level to tackle the problem associated with as safe drinking water supply as well as a primary guide to screen as enriched tubewells this indicator may save time and cost of testing tubewells significantly the great advantage of platform color tool is its simplicity in operation the villagers can use to identify the tubewells whether it is as safe or unsafe who have not access to conventional test kits and which also leads to reduces as exposure acknowledgements this work financed by swedish

and water chemistry hossain et al 2015 compared to oxidized aquifers reduced aquifers produce as enriched water than oxidized aquifers jonsson and lundell 2004 von brömssen et al 2007 biven and haller 2007 robinson et al 2011 several studies also revealed that brown or orange yellow sediments in the aquifer system mainly contain iron oxy hydroxides and the pore water in this sediment contains low dissolved arsenic and the porewater of grey sand sediments contains high dissolved arsenic van geen et al 2003 mcarthur et al 2004 hossain et al 2014 2015 according to a hydrogeological investigation from different organizations there are four different major groundwater bearing zones in 1986 master plan organization mpo bangladesh divided the country aquifer system into upper and lower aquifer sequences based on hydrogeology according to this classification upper aquifer system consists of sands silts and clays recharged through precipitation flood water while the deeper confined aquifers are recharged through the regional groundwater flow systems from the tripura hills von brömssen et al 2014 a 3 d aquifer model was conceptualized for matlab study area based on a series of vertical electric soundings ves and sediment characterization of the lithologs prepared during the installaton of the piezometer nests hossain et al 2010 mozumder 2011 von brömssen et al 2014 the region is characterized by five distinct hydrostratigraphic units and represented by three predominantly fine to medium sand aquifer units of variable thickness denoted as aquifer 1 aquifer 2 and aquifer 3 with two dominantly silty clayey aquitards aquitard 1 and aquitard 2 separating the aquifers 1 and 2 and aquifers 2 and 3 respectively fig 2 aquifer 1 has a general thickness of 25 60 m and comprises predominantly fine to medium sand of predominant black color formed as a part of meghna floodplain deposits most of the shallow tubewells installed in this aquifer are enriched with as in groundwater aquitard 1 act as a hydraullic barrier between aquifers 1 and 2 is dominated by intercalations of silty and sandy clay units with thickness varying between between 3 and 59 m von brömssen et al 2014 the underlying hydrostratigraphic unit designated as aquifer 2 generally occurring between depths of 40 100 m formed as a part of the chandina deltaic floodplain deposits is dominated by medium to fine sand the thickness of this aquifer unit ranges between 25 and 60 m and characterized by red and off white color encountered in the upper part of this unit especially in the southern part of the matlab region the tubewells installed in this aquifer is generally arsenic safe water this unit is separated from the underlying thick sequence of grey colored fine medium to coarse sand forming the aquifer 3 by aquitard 2 comprising silty clayey sediments with variable thickness at depths of around 100 m 2 2 hydraulic head measurements by piezometer nests fifteen piezometers nests each with a set of six wells p1 p6 were installed at different depth levels from 20 m to 235 m with an objective to study the hydraulic head characteristics within the arsenic hot spot area around matlab fig 3 for shallow wells hand percussion used for drilling and for deeper wells done by rotary reverse circulation drilling which is also known as donkey drilling groundwater levels were measured in each piezometer well during the period 2009 pre monsoon through 2013 post monsoon for monitoring the groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater samples were collected from the wells twice a year during the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods 2 3 groundwater sampling groundwater sampling from shallow 70m tubewells was carried out from a total of 272 drinking water wells in september and october 2011 during sampling each tubewell were adequately purged for few minutes depending on the depth prior to the collection of water samples from the wells sampling to get the screening level water sample for the analysis of as fe and mn in the laboratory the samples were filtered through 0 45µm sartorius membrane filter and 10ml sample water collected in 15ml pre washed high density polyethylene vials and the sampling bottle prepared by 1 5 acidification 14m hno3 to prevent the risk of acid handling in the field the geographical coordinates collected for each tubewell by global positioning system gps garmin gps60 besides this the major coloration on the platform examined carefully and recorded the owner and surveyors opinion on coloration a picture captured for each tubewells platform by a digital camera sony cyber shot w220 12mp 4x optical zoom the tubewells depths and installation year for both tubewells and platform also recorded from the owner the platform color re examined in the laboratory by an unbiased operator for cross verification of the identified colors the reciprocal agreement on platform color was more than 74 n 202 all disagreements n 70 was due to the separation of mixed color from red and black colored platform water samples shipped to the water chemistry laboratory at kth royal institute of technology stockholm sweden for trace element analysis the water samples analyzed for as fe and mn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap 6000 equipped with autosampler at the department of geological sciences stockholm university sweden 2 4 statistical analysis the effectiveness of platform color stain as as screening tool was evaluated by statistical analysis package based on bayesian statistics at the same time sensitivity specificity efficiency and predictive values were determined concerning who drinking water guideline value of 10µg l and bdws of 50µg l for both as and mn to validate the platform color as a screening tool 3 results and discussions 3 1 hydraulic head arsenic and redox characteristics the hydraulic head measurements from piezometer nests reveal that shallow aquifers are hydraulically separated from intermediate and deep aquifers fig 4 shallow depth groundwater level measurements from p1 and p2 clearly indicates that they are from a same hydrostratigraphic unit called aquifer 1 however shallow piezometers p3 and p4 provides hydraulic head data from aquifer 2 and finally intermediate p5 and deep p6 piezometers reveals similar pattern with some overlaps and belongs to same aquifer aquifer 3 system the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater samples from three different hydrostratigraphic unit showed distinct variations for shallow intermediate and deep aquifer system groundwater samples abstracted from shallow black colored sands which are dominated by ca mg hco3 to na cl hco3 type in off white and red sediments these variations depict the generic variations in the color of the aquifer sediments however the water samples collected from intermediate deep and deep aquifers are rather na ca mg cl hco3 to na cl hco3 type the groundwater in the shallow aquifers aquifer 1 are characterized by high as concentrations with median values of 71 646µg l derived from the black sand of the aquifer 1 these groundwaters also characterized by elevated doc hco3 fe nh4 n and po4 p with relatively low mn and so4 concentration and justified as release in groundwater system due to reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides bhattacharya et al 2002 von brömssen et al 2007 according to a previous study hossain et al 2015 the tubewell screen which is installed in the aquifer that consists of grey sands are generally in reducing condition and facilitate to produces fe and as rich water during further installation of shallow tubewells the local drillers can choose reddish brown sediments instead of grey sediments to avoid as rich water reddish brown sediments are produced due to oxidation of iron and sorbed as to produces comparatively low as water compared to grey sand aquifer 50µg l 3 2 tubewell classification according to screening depth to visualize the distribution pattern of as fe and mn related to depth the concentration level of as fe and mn observed per depth interval up to 52m such as 12 15 15 18 18 21 21 25 25 30 and 30 52m are presented in the following table table 2 almost 90 n 244 of tubewells installed at a depth of 12 25m were characterized by a very high concentration of as fe and mn with the increase in depth as concentration indicated high with some minor variation but for fe and mn the concentrations are slightly decreasing overall the tubewells within this shallow depth range are unsafe for drinking by considering both as and mn table 2 3 3 tubewell classification according to platform color based on the platform color the tubewells classified into three different color group namely red black and non identified ni fig 5 within 272 tubewells 237 tubewell platforms 87 were classified into a particular color group where 233 86 tubewell platforms identified as red 4 1 as black and rest 35 13 as ni due to undeveloped platform color undeveloped color may be the reasons for regular cleaning of the platform biofilm formation or algal growth on the platform the age of the platform also has an effect on color formation on the platform because newly built platforms are less exposed to develop coloration on the platform regardless of excessive mn or fe in tubewells water some tubewells platform have complex color neither red nor black which may be due to overlapping redox transition of fe and mn in the aquifer 3 4 assessment as an as screening tool amongst the surveyed n 272 tubewells 99 n 269 exceeded the who guideline value of as 10µg l and 98 n 267 exceeded bdws 50µg l considering the platform color among 233 red colored platform tubewells 99 n 230 exceeded the who guideline value of 10µg l and 98 n 229 tubewells exceeded bdws 50µg l tubewells with black colored platform n 4 were also found to contain as at levels exceeding the bdws value of 50µg l however the tubewells with platforms without any identifiable color ni color group ni color were 97 n 33 and these also exceeded bdws of 50µg l considering the who guideline value of 10µg l all the tubewells exceeded this level of concentration which assigned as ni n 35 alternatively if it was considered by as safe tubewells without considering platform color it was shown that only 1 n 5 within the cohort of 272 tubewells were safe considering bdws 50µg l and only three tubewells were safe considering who guideline value 10µg l when categorized in accordance to the platform color it was found that among all red colored platform tubewells only three and four were safe n 233 when comparing with the who drinking water guideline and bdws respectively among all ni colored tubewell platforms n 35 only one was found arsenic safe according to bdws but none of the black colored platform tubewells were safe for both who and bdws thus it was clear that ni color tubewells can be consider as as enriched and thereby unsafe for drinking purposes 3 5 usefulness as as screening tool the effectiveness of platform color as a screening tool for predicting the presence of as in tubewells depends on the high probability of true positive and negative values and correspondingly on the low probability of false positive and negative values relating to specific drinking water standards who and bdws fig 6 shows the relationship of the relevant true positive and negative false positive and negative values for who and bdws values table 3 summarizes the sensitivity specificity efficiency and positive and negative predictive values which also used as the indicators of effectiveness for screening capacity at who guideline value for as 10µg l the positive predictive value ppv of red colored platform tubewells was 98 7 while negative predictive value npv was zero the corresponding efficiency specificity and sensitivity of the tool were 97 0 and 98 3 accordingly wherein specificity and sencitivity means the test correctly identified those without and with as rich in red colored platform tubewells this result showed that platform color could use as an initial as screening tool in drinking water tubewells that installed in shallow aquifers 70m according to the bdws 50µg l the ppv was 95 4 and npv was zero due to the deficiency of of black colored platform tubewells the corresponding efficiency specificity and sensitivity of the tool were 96 6 0 no black colored tubewells with 50µg l and 98 3 the result also specified at bdws that the red color platform could use as as screening tool to identify as unsafe tubewells but black colored platform tubewells cannot be used as a screening tool to identify as safe tubewells it is also worth mentioning that there was a low coverage of arsenic tubewells 50ug l resulting in a low number of non discoloured tubewells therefore it is recommended to further investigate this screening tool in areas with higher well to well variability of as concentrations 3 6 assessment and usefulness as mn screening tool the mn distribution over the surveyed tubewells n 272 without considering platform color showed that almost all n 271 exceeded 100µg l of mn according to the platform color distribution within 233 red colored platform tubewells 99 6 n 232 exceeded bangladesh standard 100µg l this result displayed that red colored platform tubewells cannot be used as a screening tool to identify mn safe tubewells at bdws of 100mg l and this result was distinctly opposite as shown by biswas et al 2012a on the other hand all the tubewells with black n 4 and ni n 35 colored platform tubewells exceeded 100µg l bdws these results reveal that the co occurrence of high fe concentrations in the groundwater mask potential black discoloration by mn oxides due to the stronger staining of reddish fe oxides it should also be noted that the number of identified black colored platform wells 4 out of 272 is too limited to evaluate the concept that black colored platform tubewells produce as safe water 3 7 predictive value and prevalence of as and mn screening tool the relation between prevalence and predictive values also indicate the effectiveness of platform color as screening capacity of as and mn in handpump tubewells to extract drinking water from shallow groundwater aquifer since the black colored tubewells were hardly encountered in this study area only 4 the prevalence and predictive values could not be calculated for mn screening however this calculation was conducted for red colored platform tubewells to evaluate the screening capacity for as the bayesian model was used at a different cutoff level to evaluate the effect of prevalence and predictive values results on the tool the results shows that the ppv varies linearly with prevalence for both drinking water standard as who 10µg l and bdws 50µg l due to very few black colored platform tubewells n 4 compared to red colored n 233 this result also specified that highly as contaminated shallow depth tubewells should have a high level of fe which produces red coloration on the tubewell platform thus the performance of the color tool to identify a tubewell as as unsafe increases if the concentration of fe in that tubewell raise up and vice versa 4 applications from this study it can be concluded that tubewell platform color can be used as a rapid screening tool for as red color occurrence in reduced aquifers this study did not confirm the potential for mn screening as red discoloration by fe oxides was found to mask the black discoloration of mn oxides so it is clear that red color platform can be introduced at the policy level to tackle the problem associated with as safe drinking water supply as well as a primary guide to screen as enriched tubewells this indicator may save time and cost of testing tubewells significantly the great advantage of platform color tool is its simplicity in operation the villagers can use to identify the tubewells whether it is as safe or unsafe who have not access to conventional test kits and which also leads to reduces as exposure acknowledgements this work financed by swedish

12386,contamination and associated risks posed by cadmium cd and chromium cr were characterized in the soils being continuously exposed by paper mill waste discharge in assam india soil samples from 20 s 1 to s 20 sites surrounding a paper mill were analyzed by sequential extraction technique for cd and cr to assess the potential mobility and bioavailability of these heavy metals in the soils cadmium was mostly found in its carbonate fraction 37 14 whereas cr was mostly available in fe mn oxide bound fraction 34 72 relatively low amounts of cd and cr were associated with the water soluble fractions the pollution load index pi values of cd exceeded the maximum permissible limit i e 1 in all the sites but for cr it exceeded in all sites but s 7 s 13 and s 16 the mobility factor values ranged from 47 4 to 87 1 for cd and 12 8 67 2 for cr high mobility factor values represent relatively higher biological availability in the soil samples and thus could pose environmental threats in the area surrounding the paper mill the high values of other contamination factors viz individual and global contamination factors potential ecological risk factor ecological risk index and geo accumulation index indicated that the studied area was widely polluted by cd and cr as a result of the effluents discharged from the paper mill graphical abstract fx1 keywords contamination factors heavy metals mobility factor paper mill waste pollution load index sequential extraction 1 introduction potential toxicity of heavy metals hms in the soil largely depends on their total concentration in the soil soil solution and various chemical forms coupled with human activities which together provides the basis for understanding a wide range of problems in plants animals and human health karak et al 2015 in general hms are significant natural components of all soils which acts as the ultimate sink as well as reservoir of all the hms due to its ability to bind various soil matrixes jayadev and puttaih 2012 furthermore hms gets bound with various soil components in different ways with varying bonding strength which determine their mobility and availability towards ecosystem ahumada et al 1999 violante et al 2010 osakwe 2013 li et al 2015 soil organic matter som is one of those and hms becomes significantly associated with soil organic fraction violante et al 2010 heavy metals are also involved in a series of complex chemical and biological interactions and the soil texture ph som and fe mn oxides have been found to be the most important soil properties and components influencing the ability and biological uptake of hms zeng et al 2011 a systematic and regular monitoring of the hm concentration in the soil is of paramount importance as it provides the vital information regarding their sources distribution pattern and degree of pollution odefemi et al 2007 but only the knowledge of total hms concentration in soil is not sufficient to monitor its impact hence the speciation or chemical fractionation of hms in polluted soils using sequential extraction technique is found to be useful to understand the formation of various complexes and metal s affinity to soil components narwal and singh 1998 thus one can infer the potential mobility and bioavailability lability of hms in soils iwegbue et al 2009 several sequential extraction techniques have been described in the literatures for evaluating the mobility and bioavailability in soils to understand the ecological risk posed by hms tessier et al 1979 borah et al 2017 contamination of hms in the environment is of major concern because of their toxicity and the threat to various life forms long persistence of hms is increasing threat to degrade the quality of the atmosphere water bodies and food crops they also threaten the health and well being of animals and human due to their bio accumulation potential through the food chain nabulo et al 2010 dong et al 2011 li et al 2014 till date twelve hms have been classified as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa of which cadmium cd and chromium cr are known as highly toxic hms with regard to their potentially toxic effects in environment and ecosystem protano et al 2014 chronic exposure to cd can have adverse effects such as lung cancer pulmonary adenocarcinomas prostatic proliferative lesions bone fractures kidney dysfunction and hypertension żukowska and biziuk 2008 li et al 2014 point sources of cd pollution in soils are associated with the addition of phosphatic fertilizers containing 2

released into the soil through various manners wastewater and sludge from dyeing and leather tanning industries are the major sources of cr pollution to the environment sherene 2010 it occurs in soil as chromic cr3 or chromate cr6 ions chromium vi remains stable for several months in the soil without changing its oxidation state oxidative behaviour of cr in soils is of ecological significance since cr vi is more toxic to plants and animals than cr iii chromium is accumulated by plants and its accumulation is biomagnified at different tropic levels through food chain and cause health hazards around 625 pulp and paper industries in india produce approximately 1800 2400m3 sludge per ton of paper production annually chandra et al 2017 in addition to this around 150 200m3 sludge is being generated during the course of per ton paper production pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 both sludge and paper mill wastes reported to have high content of different hms depending upon the type of the pulping process pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 therefore disposal of paper mill sludge and effluent due to high water usage between 20 000 and 60 000 gallons per ton of product without treatment may accumulate hms in surrounding soil assam a state of north east india and this state has 8213km2 under bamboo cultivation the annual production of bamboo in india is about 4 6 million tonnes of which assam itself produces 6 56 106 metric tonnes which may influence general economic development considerably through paper industry in this state das and jain 2001 studies have been reported on the impact of hms and the effluent discharge on soil quality in and around paper mills adhikari and bhattacharyya 2015 kamali and khodaparast 2015 but detailed information on cd and cr speciation or fractionation are limited this becomes a constraint for site and metal specific measures for efficient cd and cr remediation from any system e g soil or water therefore the objective of the present study was to determine the status of cd and cr pollution in the soils around a paper mill in assam through detailed investigation heavy metal speciation various associated contamination and environmental risk factors were analyzed geographic information system gis and various statistical analyses were carried out to interpret the experimental results in a meaningful manner 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies at latitude 26 7 n and longitude 92 14 e its topography is basically plain the study area is located near the pulp and paper mill jagiroad situated at a distance of 70km from guwahati also known as gate way of north east india on the guwahati nagaon road national highway no 37 located in the morigaon district of assam the mill was established in 1970 with a target to produce 100 000 mt per annum of writing and printing paper but commercial production started in 1985 a total of 602acres was acquired for it out of which only about 205acres was kept for the main project and rest 397acres were allocated for residential and other purposes the area is surrounded by agricultural field mostly used for rice cultivation and liable to frequent flooding and drainage congestion hence heavy rains result in floods in some pockets and submerge the surrounding areas during the monsoon season the area is also covered with forest trees eg tectona grandis shorea robusta gmelina arborea cassia fistula mangifera indica artocarpus integrifolia tamarindus indica and commercial plantation such as the horticulture crops 2 2 sampling altogether 20 soil sampling points were selected over a large area of 503acres 2 04km2 around the paper mill a stratified random sampling technique was applied and samples were taken from different landuse with unique geo referenced locations it was used to identify different areas and to avoid missing out an important area within the main body of the sampling area the entire sampling area was divided into six habitat clusters effluent discharge unit roadside residential area bamboo storage place lime waste dumping site and garden and subsequently exact sampling points within each of the clusters were determined randomly tóth et al 2016 fig 1 represents sampling points for the present experiment and the description of the sampling points have been provided at the footnote of table 1 top soils 0 15cm were collected from 20 different sites as in case of ecologically relevant studies sampling of soils up to this depth is appropriate where most of the microbes habitats exist saha et al 2017 the distance between the sampling sites was kept approximately 200m apart from each other as it allowed to cover relatively larger area which could reflect the most dominant landuse types in the studied area cambra et al 1999 all the samples were air dried and ground to pass through a 0 2mm sieve and kept in acid washed container for future use following the procedure described by rubio and ure 1993 2 3 estimation of physical and chemical properties of soils and quality control soil ph was measured with 1 2 mixture of dry soil and deionised water the electrical conductivity ec was measured using a soil water suspension of 1 5 soil organic carbon soc was determined using the chromic acid titration method walkley and black 1934 the available nitrogen n phosphorous p and potassium k were estimated following standard procedures page et al 1982 bulk density bd was measured by the clod method blake 1965 the total concentrations as well as the various fractions of cd and cr were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model aa240 agilent malaysia quality assurance and quality control were assessed using repeat analysis of samples method blanks and standard reference materials srm 2709 san joaquin soil from the national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md and srm 1645 river sediment from the national bureau of standards washington d c 2 4 sequential fractionation of hms the sequential extraction metal speciation procedure was used to partition the hms cd and cr into six geochemical fractions f1 to f6 tessier et al 1979 one gram of the soil was taken and subjected to the following extraction processes f1 water soluble fraction soil extracted with 40ml of deionised water for 1h f2 exchangeable fraction soil residue from f1 extracted with 40ml of 1moll 1 mgcl2 ph 7 for 1h f3 carbonate bound fraction soil residue from f2 extracted with 40ml 1moll 1 nh4oac ph 5 for 5h f4 fe mn oxide bound fraction soil residue from f3 extracted with

cooling 5ml of 3 2moll 1 nh4oac in 20 hno3 was added and shaken for 30min before final dilution to 40ml with deionised water and f6 residual fraction soil residue from f5 digested using a hno3 digestion procedure 2 5 assessment of heavy metal pollution in soils 2 5 1 mobility of cd and cr in soils the mobility and biological availability of hms in soils can be assessed by the mobility factor mf narwal and singh 1998 lei et al 2010 osakwe 2013 if the mf values are lower it indicates high stability of hm in the soil but if it is higher then the lability and bioavailability of the hm in soils is relatively higher ma and rao 1997 olajire et al 2003 mf value was estimated by eq 1 1 mf f 1 f 2 f 3 f t o t a l 100 where f1 f2 and f3 are the mean concentrations of the water soluble fraction exchangeable and carbonate fraction of each hm mg kg 1 respectively and ftotal is the summation of all the fractions of each hm mg kg 1 2 5 2 individual contamination factor icf and global contamination factor gcf the icf was calculated by dividing the sum of the non residual fractions by the residual fraction for each site eq 2 naji and sohrabi 2015 2 icf i a d c fi c fe where cfi denoted the concentration of each non residual fraction and cfe is the concentration of the residual fraction the gcf for each investigated site was computed through the summation of the icf for the selected hms for each site using eq 3 ikem et al 2003 3 gcf m 1 n icf m where icfm is the individual contamination factor of metal n icf and gcf can be classified as icf 0 and gcf 6 as low 1 icf 3 and 6 gcf 12 as moderate 3 icf 6 and 12 gcf 24 as considerable icf 6 and gcf 24 as high contamination 2 5 3 pollution load index pi and integrated pollution load index ip i of cd and cr to evaluate environmental quality of the soils dumped with the paper mill wastes the pollution load index method pi was employed as it gives information regarding soil quality and its suitability for agricultural purpose the pollution load index was estimated using the following formula eq 4 banerjee et al 2016 4 p i c i s i where pi is the pollution load index for hm i ci is hm concentration in a soil sample mg kg 1 and si is the permitted standard of the same metal mg kg 1 lei et al 2010 if pi 1 the soil sample is classified as polluted while if pi 1 it indicates unpolluted soil ip i is the measure of the integrated risk loads of all studied elements and used to evaluate the overall level of soil hm pollution also each sample site has an ip i value of its own liu et al 2016 it was calculated by the eq 5 5 i p i p imax 2 p iave 2 2 where pimax is the maximum value of pi and piave is the average value of the sum of all pi of the two hms or of the twenty sites ipi value helps to understand the distribution of metal contamination ipi 1 low level of pollution 1 ipi 2 moderate level of pollution 2 ipi 5 high level of pollution and ipi 5 extremely high pollution wei and yang 2010 krishna and mohan 2016 2 5 4 geoaccumulation index igeo geoaccumulation index igeo acts as the indicator to assess the presence and intensity of contaminant deposition by various anthropogenic activities on surface soil müller 1969 abuduwaili et al 2015 barbieri 2016 mathematically igeo can be calculated by eq 6 6 i geo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn is the measured concentration of a given element in the top soil while bn is the concentration of a particular element in the upper continental crust or geochemical background value germ reservoir database taylor and mclennan 1995 the factor 1 5 allows us to analyze natural fluctuations in the content of a given substance in the environment müller 1969 banerjee et al 2016 seven different classes of pollution has been defined on the basis of geoaccumulation index i e class 0 igeo 0 to class 6 igeo 5 müller 1969 suthar et al 2009 2 5 5 ecological hazard index to quantify the effects of multiple trace elements in a particular environment soil and sediments the ecological hazard index as potential ecological risk factor peri or ei r and the risk index ri were used hakanson 1980 ding et al 2016 the potential ecological risk factor ei r was calculated by eq 7 7 e r i t r i c r i where ti r is the toxic response factor of trace elements and ci r is the reference value or the municipally set objective concentration of hm according to national standards the standardized toxic response factor for hm toxicity as described by hakanson 1980 was adopted for the evaluation cd 30 and cr 2 based on the values ei r can be classified into five levels of ecological risk factors zhou et al 2016 the ecological risk index ri can be divided into four levels wang et al 2012 krishna and mohan 2016 and it was calculated by eq 8 8 r i i 1 n e r i 2 6 statistical and spatial data analysis statistical analysis was performed by spss for windows statistical software ibm spss version 21 and post hoc tests were performed by using duncan multiple range test mean values of three replications were considered for various comparisons one way anova was used to find out the significant differences between physicochemical parameters and metal contents in the studied area pearson correlation coefficients were estimated to determine the relationship of soil ph ec oc available p available n available k and bd with the total concentration of cd and cr and their mf values all data presented here are the mean of three observations spatial distributions of metal concentrations are illustrated through the inverse distance weighted idw method using the software arcgis version 10 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physico chemical properties physico chemical properties of the soils around the paper mill and the hms cd and cr contents are given in table 1 the ph values ranged from 5 83 to 9 37 with an average of 7 70 indicating that the soils were moderately acidic to strongly alkaline in nature alkaline ph could be attributed to the presence of calcareous minerals rodriguez et al 2009 and this might be due to the presence of solid wastes viz lime sludge containing caco3 cao and naoh coming out from the paper mill the major component of lime mud is calcium carbonate caco3 and it is estimated that about 0 47m3 of lime mud is generated to produce 1t of pulp wirojanagud et al 2004 also lime mud can neutralize soil acidity and add calcium and magnesium to the soil gaskin and morris 2004 as a result increases the soil ph of the studied area soil electrical conductivity ec ranged from 0 09 to1 44 µs cm 1 with an average of 0 38 µs cm 1 site s 5 and s 11 showed comparatively higher ec values and this might be due to the leaching of effluents from the effluent discharge unit and from lime sludge which have considerable amount of soluble salts and total dissolved solids tds the amount of soc depends on various factors as soil texture climate vegetation and land use pattern carbon which is a major part of som holds a great proportion of nutrients and trace elements contributed to the overall soil health in this study soc content ranged from 5 50 to 25 40gkg 1 with an average of 15 21gkg 1 high amount of soc found in the soils could be attributed to the presence of paper dust in effluents and bamboo wastes main constituents are hemicelluloses and lignin which were subsequently discharged in the nearby areas the available n p as p2o5 and k as k2o ranged from 0 17 to 5 14gkg 1 average 1 22gkg 1 0 60 4 89kgha 1 average 1 48kgha 1 and 55 18 8045 60kgha 1 average 859 49kgha 1 respectively highest concentration of available n was found in site s 3 which is located near the effluent discharge unit this site and the surrounding areas were having high possibility of n enrichment through leaching of n containing compounds used as bleaching chemicals site s 19 had the highest available p content and this might be due to slightly alkaline ph 8 1 of this site comparatively higher range of available k was found to be associated with these soils despite of its high solubility in water the presence of such higher amounts of major nutrients viz n p and k indicate the nature of wastes generated out of the raw materials used for pulping bulk density of the soil ranged from 0 60 to 1 54gcm 3 with an average of 1 02gcm 3 this variation in bd could be attributed to the nature and amount of wastes present in that particular site statistical analysis of the soil properties table 2 showed significant and positive correlation among available k ph r 0 46 p 0 05 and ec r 0 56 p 0 05 and negative correlation with available n r 0 46 p 0 05 soil ph greatly influenced the availability of soil nutrients significantly low ph and considerable amount of available n in s 3 and s 4 might be due to the presence of urea in the soil as these two sites were very near to the agricultural fields it might also be due to the microbial oxidation of ammonium ions nh4 from som or from the fertilizers used in the fields to nitrate ions no3 which produce h ions agpro 2017 increase in soil ph increases k availability as excess of hydrogen h aluminium al iron fe and other cation elements in acidic soil can compete and exchange with k ions as held in humus and clay colloids also in alkaline ph ca is the dominant positive ion which will displace the k from the clay lattice and make it more available in solution for the plant overall no significant correlations were found between the soil properties and the hms cd and cr 3 2 heavy metal concentrations and distributions the mean total concentrations of cd and cr indicate that both the metals table 1 were significantly higher in the soils than the maximum permissible limit as recommended by the canadian council of the ministers of environment ccme 2007 soil quality guidelines in all the sites concentrations of cd were higher than the ccme maximum permissible limit in case of cr all sites but s 7 s 13 and s 16 were having concentrations above the ccme maximum permissible limit the concentrations of hms significantly depend on the natural parent material richness however a slight addition of hms through anthropogenic activities can deteriorate the soil quality total cd and cr content varied from 10 68 to 31 33mgkg 1 average 17 31mgkg 1 and from 41 20 to 127 47mgkg 1 average 86 93mgkg 1 respectively cadmium showed highest concentrations at site s 19 30mgkg 1 this site was near the dumping site for bamboo wastes and lime sludge various aqueous solvents such as cadmium ethylenediamine cadoxen were used to dissolve cellulose and lignin content sjöström and alen 2013 which are the main constituents of bamboo wastes this might be one of the reasons for high cd content in this site site s 15 near roadside showed very high concentration 123 39 4 08mgkg 1 of cr in soil it is our assumption that application of cr as catalyst pigments wood preservatives and corrosion inhibitors in paper mills might have led to this cr enrichment at s 15 site goel 1996 the total concentrations of both the hms were significantly higher than the geochemical background values of cd 0 098mgkg 1 and cr 35mgkg 1 taylor and mclennan 1995 the background values are the values of cd and cr in the upper continental crust which were listed in the germ reservoir database earthref org it can be inferred from this that the anthropogenic contributions of cd and cr in the experimental soils were much more significant than the natural ones nriagu and pacyna 1988 this finding is corroborated by the spatial distribution of concentration profiles of cd and cr fig 2a and b both the metals cd and cr showed the highest concentrations near the effluent discharge unit lime and bamboo wastes and near roadside area 3 3 speciation of cd and cr in contaminated soils 3 3 1 cd speciation the extraction percentage of each of the fraction of cd is given in fig 3 cadmium was found to be mostly associated with the f3 fraction ranged from 11 06 to 70 20 with an average of 37 14 the higher percentage of cd in this fraction suggests that cd is potentially bio available in these soils almost one third of cd is partitioned in the f2 fraction with an extraction percentage of 5 31 65 07 and average of 37 07 portions of metals bound to the f2 fraction are weakly absorbed and become readily bio available to plants this indicated that cd formed a weak complex and is easily removed at the initial stages of the extraction earlier similar results were reported in the work of pueyo et al 2003 where cd was found to be in the mobile fractions appreciable amount of cd found to be associated with the f6 fraction whose percentage ranged from 8 51 to 30 48 and average of 17 63 the f5 fraction having the percentage ranging from below detectable limit bdl to 40 83 with an average of 5 11 but in most of the sites it is found to be bdl this low affinity of cd for the organic phase has also been described by giacalone et al 2005 relatively less amount of the metal was found in the f1 fraction average 1 70 and in the f4 fraction average 1 35 similar results of low cd concentration in f4 fraction was reported by tessier et al 1979 for cd the distribution pattern of various fractions in the experimental soils were found to be in the order f3 f2 f5 f6 f4 f1 the f1 f2 and f3 fractions were the weakly absorbed fractions and were readily bio available to plants and thus have a potential to enter the food chain 3 3 2 cr speciation fig 3 reflected that cr was mainly bound in the f4 fraction in this fraction the amount ranged from 9 45 to 52 70 with an average of 34 72 which corroborates the findings of osakwe and okolie 2015 thus cr showed strong affinity for fe mn oxides in the experimental soils shaheen et al 2014 and more than 30 of the total cr was found to be absorbed by this fraction relatively high amount of cr was also found to be associated with carbonate bound bdl to 57 92 and average of 28 48 followed by f2 fraction bdl to 49 83 and average 13 56 low levels of cr in f2 fraction might be due to the formation of hydroxo complexes by cr iii or oxyanions such as cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 by cr iv which are poorly soluble and less absorbed to negatively charged soil particles sherene 2010 appreciable amount of cr in f5 fraction bdl to 33 45 with average of 16 91 might be due to the high affinity of humic acids for cr3 and thus under soluble conditions cr3 was immediately bound to the organic matter fraction in the f6 fraction cr ranged from 1 29 to 18 70 with an average of 6 33 but for all the sites cr was undetectable in the f1 fraction which implies low solubility of cr in water similar to the reports of birch et al 2001 in cox sediments in the experimental soils significant part of cr was found to be associated with the f2 and f3 fractions and thus indicate that these forms of cr could easily be removed at the initial stages of the extraction the distribution pattern of cr was found to be as f3 f2 f4 f5 f6 f1 if each fraction of cd and cr are compared fig 3 then it can be concluded that in f1 fraction cd was found in appreciable amount with the highest percentage in site s 5 which is the agricultural field it might be due to the leaching of metals from the waste water effluent discharge unit which is just at a distance of around 450 500m from the field however cr was undetectable in f1 fraction in f2 fraction both cd and cr showed highest extraction percentage with the highest in site s 2 which is also might be due to the untreated effluent discharge from the paper mill but the percentage was more in case of cd site s 12 showed the highest percentage of cd in f3 fraction but cr was highest in site s 10 in f4 fraction the extraction percentage of cr is more than cd with most of the sites where cd is undetectable thus this indicates that cr has high affinity for fe mn oxide with the highest percentage in s 16 in f5 fraction the percentage of cr was more than cd with the highest in s 13 but in some of the sites s 2 s 10 and s 14 both cd and cr were undetectable highest percentage of cd 30 47 in s 6 was found in f6 residual fraction also a considerable amount of cr was found to be associated with this fraction having highest in s 7 18 70 3 4 contamination assessment 3 4 1 mobility factors of cd and cr in the soils the magnitude of mf determines the relative mobility and biological availability of the metal in the soil as suggested by osakwe 2013 the results fig 4 showed that cd had the highest mf values with 87 07 at site s 11 whereas cr had the highest mf value 67 16 at site s 18 these suggest that the mobility of cd was more than cr this also indicated that cd formed a weak complex and was easily removed at the initial stages of the extraction however the values show that both cd and cr have relatively high mobility and biological availability in the soil samples also the mf for cr was found to be positively correlated with the total cr content in the soil r 0 52 p 0 05 which indicates that the mobility of cr increases with the increase in the concentration of cr in the soil 3 4 2 individual and global contamination factor icf and gcf are generally used for speciation or fractionation index approach for metal contamination icf and gcf for cd and cr for twenty soils samples from various sites are depicted in fig 4 the highest level of icf for cd was found in site s 19 10 75 and lowest in s 6 2 28 for cr highest level of icf was computed at site s 11 76 51 and lowest in s 7 4 35 the gcfs which were estimated utilizing icf values showed that site s 11 was highly affected by metal pollution which might be due to the presence of huge amount of lime wastes in this site the icf and gcf values for both cd and cr were in the high category icf and gcf reflects the degree of contamination by pollutants and retention time associated with the hms nemati et al 2009 benson et al 2016 thus high values of contamination factors of the metals and their low retention times indicate high degree of risk to the environment saleem et al 2015 3 4 3 pollution load index and ipi the calculated pi values of cd and cr are presented in fig 5 and it shows that the pi values of cd exceeded the maximum permissible limit i e 1 in all the sites but for cr it exceeded in all sites but s 7 s 13 and s 16 the highest pi value 22 15 for cd was reached at site s 19 however the pi values of cr ranged between 0 67 and 1 93 thus it can be implied major part of the soils around the paper mill were contaminated with both cd and cr the ip i values of the twenty sites varied from 6 37 to 17 70 fig 5 all 20 soil samples had ip i 5 classified as extremely high pollution among which eight soil samples had ip i 10 the results showed that cd had a relatively higher ip i value 17 94 for the tested soils and could be classified as extremely polluted the ip i of cr was 1 67 which indicated moderate pollution 3 5 environmental risk assessment 3 5 1 geoaccumulation index igeo in order to evaluate which elements show relatively higher risks and to estimate the extent of hm pollution in the studied soil geoaccumulation index can be used as a reference hou et al 2013 the geoaccumulation index igeo values ranged from 0 51 to 1 07 for cd however it was ranged between 8 96 and 12 64 for cr table 3 based on the classification as described by müller 1981 results of this study suggested low to moderate contamination of cd and extremely high contamination of cr in all the sites table 3 site s 19 and s 15 showed the highest igeo values for cd and cr respectively indicating severe pollution due to the wastes discharge from the mill and various anthropogenic activities and thus cr appeared as the major pollutant 3 5 2 risk factor and risk index the ecological risk index as described by hakanson 1980 was estimated for cd and cr which provides a fast and single quantitative value on the potential ecological risk and contamination situation in the studied area the estimated individual ei r and ri are shown in table 3 the results of present study indicated low to extremely high potential ecological risk for cr and cd respectively table 3 all the values of ri in the studied soils were higher than 150 sites s 17 and s 19 showed very high ecological risk while s 3 s 5 s 6 s 12 and s 13 showed moderate ecological risk the rest of the sites showed considerable ecological risk thus it reflects that there is an overall high ecological risk posed by cd and cr in the study area cd showed higher potential ecological risk than cr as shown in table 3 and fig 1 the potential ecological risk increases as we go closer to the areas which receive huge amount of bamboo and other wastes from the paper mill and also near the roadside areas indicating the contribution of various wastes and raw materials used for the paper mill 3 6 cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was carried out to identify clusters or which observations are clustered together with multiple levels of clusters it was used to elucidate the latent relationships between metals in soils and the degree of association between the sites here hca method was used to divide geochemical group of sampling sites before hca the variables were standardized by means of z scores and euclidean distances for similarities were calculated the ward s method was applied to the standardized data set to conduct the hierarchical clustering ding et al 2016 all the sampling sites were divided into three major clusters fig 6 cluster 1 included the sites that were near the point source of pollution i e the paper mill and near effluent discharge unit s 1 s 2 s 4 s 5 s 7 s 8 and s 12 while cluster 2 contained the s 3 s 6 s 9 s 11 near lime mountain s 16 nakhula grant s 17 area bamboo storage place s 19 and s 20 near residential area showing serious anthropogenic activities cluster 3 consisted of the sites s 10 s 13 s 14 s 15 and s 18 which receive the wastes coming out of the mill solid wastes and lime sludge and the roadside area of the national highway 37 thus it can be interpreted as a mixed source from both the paper mill wastes and wastes coming out of the transport vehicles there is an urgent need of proper disposal and management of these wastes by adopting certain remediation measures such as vermicomposting and phyto remediation etc vermicomposting can be an effective way for the reduction of both total and bioavailable metal contents which leads to immobilization of mobile metal fractions the enzymatic activities in earthworm gut and cast tend to reduce the mobility of metals and convert the wastes into nutrients rich organic manure goswami et al 2013 sahariah et al 2014 singh et al 2017 although after co composting of wastes using vermitechnology the sludge can be used in agronomic applications but sometimes only partial degradation occurs due to hms bioavailability beyond the permissible limit lim et al 2016 phytoremediation may also be a potential strategy to remove the pollutants from the habitat through absorption filtration and tissue accumulation process chandra et al 2017 4 conclusion a detailed study on physico chemical properties heavy metal speciation contamination and environmental risk assessment in soils around a paper mill in assam india was carried out almost at all the sites the concentrations of cd and cr exceeded the maximum permissible limits as recommended by ccme particularly those sites which received wastes from the mill and near the roadside the total metal concentrations were much higher than the maximum permissible limits metal speciation of cd showed that they were mainly present in the carbonate and exchangeable fractions whereas cr fractions were mostly available in carbonate and fe mn oxide fractions various indices were employed to assess the mobility of hms in soil and potential contamination and environmental risks posed by these metals the contamination statuses of these selected sites were classified in to various categories on the basis of the values of these indices the present study indicated that cd and cr could pose significant environmental risk in the sites near the paper mill due to their relatively high mf values which extended up to 0 94km from the paper mill the spatial maps of cd and cr showed significant variations in their distribution among the sites this provides clues for potential site specific mitigation measures for containing the future environmental risks acknowledgements the

12386,contamination and associated risks posed by cadmium cd and chromium cr were characterized in the soils being continuously exposed by paper mill waste discharge in assam india soil samples from 20 s 1 to s 20 sites surrounding a paper mill were analyzed by sequential extraction technique for cd and cr to assess the potential mobility and bioavailability of these heavy metals in the soils cadmium was mostly found in its carbonate fraction 37 14 whereas cr was mostly available in fe mn oxide bound fraction 34 72 relatively low amounts of cd and cr were associated with the water soluble fractions the pollution load index pi values of cd exceeded the maximum permissible limit i e 1 in all the sites but for cr it exceeded in all sites but s 7 s 13 and s 16 the mobility factor values ranged from 47 4 to 87 1 for cd and 12 8 67 2 for cr high mobility factor values represent relatively higher biological availability in the soil samples and thus could pose environmental threats in the area surrounding the paper mill the high values of other contamination factors viz individual and global contamination factors potential ecological risk factor ecological risk index and geo accumulation index indicated that the studied area was widely polluted by cd and cr as a result of the effluents discharged from the paper mill graphical abstract fx1 keywords contamination factors heavy metals mobility factor paper mill waste pollution load index sequential extraction 1 introduction potential toxicity of heavy metals hms in the soil largely depends on their total concentration in the soil soil solution and various chemical forms coupled with human activities which together provides the basis for understanding a wide range of problems in plants animals and human health karak et al 2015 in general hms are significant natural components of all soils which acts as the ultimate sink as well as reservoir of all the hms due to its ability to bind various soil matrixes jayadev and puttaih 2012 furthermore hms gets bound with various soil components in different ways with varying bonding strength which determine their mobility and availability towards ecosystem ahumada et al 1999 violante et al 2010 osakwe 2013 li et al 2015 soil organic matter som is one of those and hms becomes significantly associated with soil organic fraction violante et al 2010 heavy metals are also involved in a series of complex chemical and biological interactions and the soil texture ph som and fe mn oxides have been found to be the most important soil properties and components influencing the ability and biological uptake of hms zeng et al 2011 a systematic and regular monitoring of the hm concentration in the soil is of paramount importance as it provides the vital information regarding their sources distribution pattern and degree of pollution odefemi et al 2007 but only the knowledge of total hms concentration in soil is not sufficient to monitor its impact hence the speciation or chemical fractionation of hms in polluted soils using sequential extraction technique is found to be useful to understand the formation of various complexes and metal s affinity to soil components narwal and singh 1998 thus one can infer the potential mobility and bioavailability lability of hms in soils iwegbue et al 2009 several sequential extraction techniques have been described in the literatures for evaluating the mobility and bioavailability in soils to understand the ecological risk posed by hms tessier et al 1979 borah et al 2017 contamination of hms in the environment is of major concern because of their toxicity and the threat to various life forms long persistence of hms is increasing threat to degrade the quality of the atmosphere water bodies and food crops they also threaten the health and well being of animals and human due to their bio accumulation potential through the food chain nabulo et al 2010 dong et al 2011 li et al 2014 till date twelve hms have been classified as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa of which cadmium cd and chromium cr are known as highly toxic hms with regard to their potentially toxic effects in environment and ecosystem protano et al 2014 chronic exposure to cd can have adverse effects such as lung cancer pulmonary adenocarcinomas prostatic proliferative lesions bone fractures kidney dysfunction and hypertension żukowska and biziuk 2008 li et al 2014 point sources of cd pollution in soils are associated with the addition of phosphatic fertilizers containing 2 200mgcdkg 1 of phosphatic fertilizers domestic and sewage sludge including pulp and paper mill waste printing industry cement production wear of automobile tyres lubricants and mining and metallurgical activities kabata pendias and mukherjee 2007 pöykiö et al 2007 on the other hand cr is found in all phases of the environment including air water and soil concentration of cr in naturally occurring soil ranges from 10 to 50mgkg 1 depending on the parental material and in ultramafic soils serpentine it can reach up to 125gkg 1 adriano 1986 chromium is carcinogenic and often released into the soil through various manners wastewater and sludge from dyeing and leather tanning industries are the major sources of cr pollution to the environment sherene 2010 it occurs in soil as chromic cr3 or chromate cr6 ions chromium vi remains stable for several months in the soil without changing its oxidation state oxidative behaviour of cr in soils is of ecological significance since cr vi is more toxic to plants and animals than cr iii chromium is accumulated by plants and its accumulation is biomagnified at different tropic levels through food chain and cause health hazards around 625 pulp and paper industries in india produce approximately 1800 2400m3 sludge per ton of paper production annually chandra et al 2017 in addition to this around 150 200m3 sludge is being generated during the course of per ton paper production pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 both sludge and paper mill wastes reported to have high content of different hms depending upon the type of the pulping process pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 therefore disposal of paper mill sludge and effluent due to high water usage between 20 000 and 60 000 gallons per ton of product without treatment may accumulate hms in surrounding soil assam a state of north east india and this state has 8213km2 under bamboo cultivation the annual production of bamboo in india is about 4 6 million tonnes of which assam itself produces 6 56 106 metric tonnes which may influence general economic development considerably through paper industry in this state das and jain 2001 studies have been reported on the impact of hms and the effluent discharge on soil quality in and around paper mills adhikari and bhattacharyya 2015 kamali and khodaparast 2015 but detailed information on cd and cr speciation or fractionation are limited this becomes a constraint for site and metal specific measures for efficient cd and cr remediation from any system e g soil or water therefore the objective of the present study was to determine the status of cd and cr pollution in the soils around a paper mill in assam through detailed investigation heavy metal speciation various associated contamination and environmental risk factors were analyzed geographic information system gis and various statistical analyses were carried out to interpret the experimental results in a meaningful manner 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies at latitude 26 7 n and longitude 92 14 e its topography is basically plain the study area is located near the pulp and paper mill jagiroad situated at a distance of 70km from guwahati also known as gate way of north east india on the guwahati nagaon road national highway no 37 located in the morigaon district of assam the mill was established in 1970 with a target to produce 100 000 mt per annum of writing and printing paper but commercial production started in 1985 a total of 602acres was acquired for it out of which only about 205acres was kept for the main project and rest 397acres were allocated for residential and other purposes the area is surrounded by agricultural field mostly used for rice cultivation and liable to frequent flooding and drainage congestion hence heavy rains result in floods in some pockets and submerge the surrounding areas during the monsoon season the area is also covered with forest trees eg tectona grandis shorea robusta gmelina arborea cassia fistula mangifera indica artocarpus integrifolia tamarindus indica and commercial plantation such as the horticulture crops 2 2 sampling altogether 20 soil sampling points were selected over a large area of 503acres 2 04km2 around the paper mill a stratified random sampling technique was applied and samples were taken from different landuse with unique geo referenced locations it was used to identify different areas and to avoid missing out an important area within the main body of the sampling area the entire sampling area was divided into six habitat clusters effluent discharge unit roadside residential area bamboo storage place lime waste dumping site and garden and subsequently exact sampling points within each of the clusters were determined randomly tóth et al 2016 fig 1 represents sampling points for the present experiment and the description of the sampling points have been provided at the footnote of table 1 top soils 0 15cm were collected from 20 different sites as in case of ecologically relevant studies sampling of soils up to this depth is appropriate where most of the microbes habitats exist saha et al 2017 the distance between the sampling sites was kept approximately 200m apart from each other as it allowed to cover relatively larger area which could reflect the most dominant landuse types in the studied area cambra et al 1999 all the samples were air dried and ground to pass through a 0 2mm sieve and kept in acid washed container for future use following the procedure described by rubio and ure 1993 2 3 estimation of physical and chemical properties of soils and quality control soil ph was measured with 1 2 mixture of dry soil and deionised water the electrical conductivity ec was measured using a soil water suspension of 1 5 soil organic carbon soc was determined using the chromic acid titration method walkley and black 1934 the available nitrogen n phosphorous p and potassium k were estimated following standard procedures page et al 1982 bulk density bd was measured by the clod method blake 1965 the total concentrations as well as the various fractions of cd and cr were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model aa240 agilent malaysia quality assurance and quality control were assessed using repeat analysis of samples method blanks and standard reference materials srm 2709 san joaquin soil from the national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md and srm 1645 river sediment from the national bureau of standards washington d c 2 4 sequential fractionation of hms the sequential extraction metal speciation procedure was used to partition the hms cd and cr into six geochemical fractions f1 to f6 tessier et al 1979 one gram of the soil was taken and subjected to the following extraction processes f1 water soluble fraction soil extracted with 40ml of deionised water for 1h f2 exchangeable fraction soil residue from f1 extracted with 40ml of 1moll 1 mgcl2 ph 7 for 1h f3 carbonate bound fraction soil residue from f2 extracted with 40ml 1moll 1 nh4oac ph 5 for 5h f4 fe mn oxide bound fraction soil residue from f3 extracted with 40ml 0 04moll 1 nh2oh hcl in 25 v v hoac at 96 c with occasional agitation f5 organic bound fraction f4 soil residue extracted with 25ml 30 h2o2 at ph 2 adjusted with hno3 for 5h water bath 85 c after cooling 5ml of 3 2moll 1 nh4oac in 20 hno3 was added and shaken for 30min before final dilution to 40ml with deionised water and f6 residual fraction soil residue from f5 digested using a hno3 digestion procedure 2 5 assessment of heavy metal pollution in soils 2 5 1 mobility of cd and cr in soils the mobility and biological availability of hms in soils can be assessed by the mobility factor mf narwal and singh 1998 lei et al 2010 osakwe 2013 if the mf values are lower it indicates high stability of hm in the soil but if it is higher then the lability and bioavailability of the hm in soils is relatively higher ma and rao 1997 olajire et al 2003 mf value was estimated by eq 1 1 mf f 1 f 2 f 3 f t o t a l 100 where f1 f2 and f3 are the mean concentrations of the water soluble fraction exchangeable and carbonate fraction of each hm mg kg 1 respectively and ftotal is the summation of all the fractions of each hm mg kg 1 2 5 2 individual contamination factor icf and global contamination factor gcf the icf was calculated by dividing the sum of the non residual fractions by the residual fraction for each site eq 2 naji and sohrabi 2015 2 icf i a d c fi c fe where cfi denoted the concentration of each non residual fraction and cfe is the concentration of the residual fraction the gcf for each investigated site was computed through the summation of the icf for the selected hms for each site using eq 3 ikem et al 2003 3 gcf m 1 n icf m where icfm is the individual contamination factor of metal n icf and gcf can be classified as icf 0 and gcf 6 as low 1 icf 3 and 6 gcf 12 as moderate 3 icf 6 and 12 gcf 24 as considerable icf 6 and gcf 24 as high contamination 2 5 3 pollution load index pi and integrated pollution load index ip i of cd and cr to evaluate environmental quality of the soils dumped with the paper mill wastes the pollution load index method pi was employed as it gives information regarding soil quality and its suitability for agricultural purpose the pollution load index was estimated using the following formula eq 4 banerjee et al 2016 4 p i c i s i where pi is the pollution load index for hm i ci is hm concentration in a soil sample mg kg 1 and si is the permitted standard of the same metal mg kg 1 lei et al 2010 if pi 1 the soil sample is classified as polluted while if pi 1 it indicates unpolluted soil ip i is the measure of the integrated risk loads of all studied elements and used to evaluate the overall level of soil hm pollution also each sample site has an ip i value of its own liu et al 2016 it was calculated by the eq 5 5 i p i p imax 2 p iave 2 2 where pimax is the maximum value of pi and piave is the average value of the sum of all pi of the two hms or of the twenty sites ipi value helps to understand the distribution of metal contamination ipi 1 low level of pollution 1 ipi 2 moderate level of pollution 2 ipi 5 high level of pollution and ipi 5 extremely high pollution wei and yang 2010 krishna and mohan 2016 2 5 4 geoaccumulation index igeo geoaccumulation index igeo acts as the indicator to assess the presence and intensity of contaminant deposition by various anthropogenic activities on surface soil müller 1969 abuduwaili et al 2015 barbieri 2016 mathematically igeo can be calculated by eq 6 6 i geo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn is the measured concentration of a given element in the top soil while bn is the concentration of a particular element in the upper continental crust or geochemical background value germ reservoir database taylor and mclennan 1995 the factor 1 5 allows us to analyze natural fluctuations in the content of a given substance in the environment müller 1969 banerjee et al 2016 seven different classes of pollution has been defined on the basis of geoaccumulation index i e class 0 igeo 0 to class 6 igeo 5 müller 1969 suthar et al 2009 2 5 5 ecological hazard index to quantify the effects of multiple trace elements in a particular environment soil and sediments the ecological hazard index as potential ecological risk factor peri or ei r and the risk index ri were used hakanson 1980 ding et al 2016 the potential ecological risk factor ei r was calculated by eq 7 7 e r i t r i c r i where ti r is the toxic response factor of trace elements and ci r is the reference value or the municipally set objective concentration of hm according to national standards the standardized toxic response factor for hm toxicity as described by hakanson 1980 was adopted for the evaluation cd 30 and cr 2 based on the values ei r can be classified into five levels of ecological risk factors zhou et al 2016 the ecological risk index ri can be divided into four levels wang et al 2012 krishna and mohan 2016 and it was calculated by eq 8 8 r i i 1 n e r i 2 6 statistical and spatial data analysis statistical analysis was performed by spss for windows statistical software ibm spss version 21 and post hoc tests were performed by using duncan multiple range test mean values of three replications were considered for various comparisons one way anova was used to find out the significant differences between physicochemical parameters and metal contents in the studied area pearson correlation coefficients were estimated to determine the relationship of soil ph ec oc available p available n available k and bd with the total concentration of cd and cr and their mf values all data presented here are the mean of three observations spatial distributions of metal concentrations are illustrated through the inverse distance weighted idw method using the software arcgis version 10 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physico chemical properties physico chemical properties of the soils around the paper mill and the hms cd and cr contents are given in table 1 the ph values ranged from 5 83 to 9 37 with an average of 7 70 indicating that the soils were moderately acidic to strongly alkaline in nature alkaline ph could be attributed to the presence of calcareous minerals rodriguez et al 2009 and this might be due to the presence of solid wastes viz lime sludge containing caco3 cao and naoh coming out from the paper mill the major component of lime mud is calcium carbonate caco3 and it is estimated that about 0 47m3 of lime mud is generated to produce 1t of pulp wirojanagud et al 2004 also lime mud can neutralize soil acidity and add calcium and magnesium to the soil gaskin and morris 2004 as a result increases the soil ph of the studied area soil electrical conductivity ec ranged from 0 09 to1 44 µs cm 1 with an average of 0 38 µs cm 1 site s 5 and s 11 showed comparatively higher ec values and this might be due to the leaching of effluents from the effluent discharge unit and from lime sludge which have considerable amount of soluble salts and total dissolved solids tds the amount of soc depends on various factors as soil texture climate vegetation and land use pattern carbon which is a major part of som holds a great proportion of nutrients and trace elements contributed to the overall soil health in this study soc content ranged from 5 50 to 25 40gkg 1 with an average of 15 21gkg 1 high amount of soc found in the soils could be attributed to the presence of paper dust in effluents and bamboo wastes main constituents are hemicelluloses and lignin which were subsequently discharged in the nearby areas the available n p as p2o5 and k as k2o ranged from 0 17 to 5 14gkg 1 average 1 22gkg 1 0 60 4 89kgha 1 average 1 48kgha 1 and 55 18 8045 60kgha 1 average 859 49kgha 1 respectively highest concentration of available n was found in site s 3 which is located near the effluent discharge unit this site and the surrounding areas were having high possibility of n enrichment through leaching of n containing compounds used as bleaching chemicals site s 19 had the highest available p content and this might be due to slightly alkaline ph 8 1 of this site comparatively higher range of available k was found to be associated with these soils despite of its high solubility in water the presence of such higher amounts of major nutrients viz n p and k indicate the nature of wastes generated out of the raw materials used for pulping bulk density of the soil ranged from 0 60 to 1 54gcm 3 with an average of 1 02gcm 3 this variation in bd could be attributed to the nature and amount of wastes present in that particular site statistical analysis of the soil properties table 2 showed significant and positive correlation among available k ph r 0 46 p 0 05 and ec r 0 56 p 0 05 and negative correlation with available n r 0 46 p 0 05 soil ph greatly influenced the availability of soil nutrients significantly low ph and considerable amount of available n in s 3 and s 4 might be due to the presence of urea in the soil as these two sites were very near to the agricultural fields it might also be due to the microbial oxidation of ammonium ions nh4 from som or from the fertilizers used in the fields to nitrate ions no3 which produce h ions agpro 2017 increase in soil ph increases k availability as excess of hydrogen h aluminium al iron fe and other cation elements in acidic soil can compete and exchange with k ions as held in humus and clay colloids also in alkaline ph ca is the dominant positive ion which will displace the k from the clay lattice and make it more available in solution for the plant overall no significant correlations were found between the soil properties and the hms cd and cr 3 2 heavy metal concentrations and distributions the mean total concentrations of cd and cr indicate that both the metals table 1 were significantly higher in the soils than the maximum permissible limit as recommended by the canadian council of the ministers of environment ccme 2007 soil quality guidelines in all the sites concentrations of cd were higher than the ccme maximum permissible limit in case of cr all sites but s 7 s 13 and s 16 were having concentrations above the ccme maximum permissible limit the concentrations of hms significantly depend on the natural parent material richness however a slight addition of hms through anthropogenic activities can deteriorate the soil quality total cd and cr content varied from 10 68 to 31 33mgkg 1 average 17 31mgkg 1 and from 41 20 to 127 47mgkg 1 average 86 93mgkg 1 respectively cadmium showed highest concentrations at site s 19 30mgkg 1 this site was near the dumping site for bamboo wastes and lime sludge various aqueous solvents such as cadmium ethylenediamine cadoxen were used to dissolve cellulose and lignin content sjöström and alen 2013 which are the main constituents of bamboo wastes this might be one of the reasons for high cd content in this site site s 15 near roadside showed very high concentration 123 39 4 08mgkg 1 of cr in soil it is our assumption that application of cr as catalyst pigments wood preservatives and corrosion inhibitors in paper mills might have led to this cr enrichment at s 15 site goel 1996 the total concentrations of both the hms were significantly higher than the geochemical background values of cd 0 098mgkg 1 and cr 35mgkg 1 taylor and mclennan 1995 the background values are the values of cd and cr in the upper continental crust which were listed in the germ reservoir database earthref org it can be inferred from this that the anthropogenic contributions of cd and cr in the experimental soils were much more significant than the natural ones nriagu and pacyna 1988 this finding is corroborated by the spatial distribution of concentration profiles of cd and cr fig 2a and b both the metals cd and cr showed the highest concentrations near the effluent discharge unit lime and bamboo wastes and near roadside area 3 3 speciation of cd and cr in contaminated soils 3 3 1 cd speciation the extraction percentage of each of the fraction of cd is given in fig 3 cadmium was found to be mostly associated with the f3 fraction ranged from 11 06 to 70 20 with an average of 37 14 the higher percentage of cd in this fraction suggests that cd is potentially bio available in these soils almost one third of cd is partitioned in the f2 fraction with an extraction percentage of 5 31 65 07 and average of 37 07 portions of metals bound to the f2 fraction are weakly absorbed and become readily bio available to plants this indicated that cd formed a weak complex and is easily removed at the initial stages of the extraction earlier similar results were reported in the work of pueyo et al 2003 where cd was found to be in the mobile fractions appreciable amount of cd found to be associated with the f6 fraction whose percentage ranged from 8 51 to 30 48 and average of 17 63 the f5 fraction having the percentage ranging from below detectable limit bdl to 40 83 with an average of 5 11 but in most of the sites it is found to be bdl this low affinity of cd for the organic phase has also been described by giacalone et al 2005 relatively less amount of the metal was found in the f1 fraction average 1 70 and in the f4 fraction average 1 35 similar results of low cd concentration in f4 fraction was reported by tessier et al 1979 for cd the distribution pattern of various fractions in the experimental soils were found to be in the order f3 f2 f5 f6 f4 f1 the f1 f2 and f3 fractions were the weakly absorbed fractions and were readily bio available to plants and thus have a potential to enter the food chain 3 3 2 cr speciation fig 3 reflected that cr was mainly bound in the f4 fraction in this fraction the amount ranged from 9 45 to 52 70 with an average of 34 72 which corroborates the findings of osakwe and okolie 2015 thus cr showed strong affinity for fe mn oxides in the experimental soils shaheen et al 2014 and more than 30 of the total cr was found to be absorbed by this fraction relatively high amount of cr was also found to be associated with carbonate bound bdl to 57 92 and average of 28 48 followed by f2 fraction bdl to 49 83 and average 13 56 low levels of cr in f2 fraction might be due to the formation of hydroxo complexes by cr iii or oxyanions such as cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 by cr iv which are poorly soluble and less absorbed to negatively charged soil particles sherene 2010 appreciable amount of cr in f5 fraction bdl to 33 45 with average of 16 91 might be due to the high affinity of humic acids for cr3 and thus under soluble conditions cr3 was immediately bound to the organic matter fraction in the f6 fraction cr ranged from 1 29 to 18 70 with an average of 6 33 but for all the sites cr was undetectable in the f1 fraction which implies low solubility of cr in water similar to the reports of birch et al 2001 in cox sediments in the experimental soils significant part of cr was found to be associated with the f2 and f3 fractions and thus indicate that these forms of cr could easily be removed at the initial stages of the extraction the distribution pattern of cr was found to be as f3 f2 f4 f5 f6 f1 if each fraction of cd and cr are compared fig 3 then it can be concluded that in f1 fraction cd was found in appreciable amount with the highest percentage in site s 5 which is the agricultural field it might be due to the leaching of metals from the waste water effluent discharge unit which is just at a distance of around 450 500m from the field however cr was undetectable in f1 fraction in f2 fraction both cd and cr showed highest extraction percentage with the highest in site s 2 which is also might be due to the untreated effluent discharge from the paper mill but the percentage was more in case of cd site s 12 showed the highest percentage of cd in f3 fraction but cr was highest in site s 10 in f4 fraction the extraction percentage of cr is more than cd with most of the sites where cd is undetectable thus this indicates that cr has high affinity for fe mn oxide with the highest percentage in s 16 in f5 fraction the percentage of cr was more than cd with the highest in s 13 but in some of the sites s 2 s 10 and s 14 both cd and cr were undetectable highest percentage of cd 30 47 in s 6 was found in f6 residual fraction also a considerable amount of cr was found to be associated with this fraction having highest in s 7 18 70 3 4 contamination assessment 3 4 1 mobility factors of cd and cr in the soils the magnitude of mf determines the relative mobility and biological availability of the metal in the soil as suggested by osakwe 2013 the results fig 4 showed that cd had the highest mf values with 87 07 at site s 11 whereas cr had the highest mf value 67 16 at site s 18 these suggest that the mobility of cd was more than cr this also indicated that cd formed a weak complex and was easily removed at the initial stages of the extraction however the values show that both cd and cr have relatively high mobility and biological availability in the soil samples also the mf for cr was found to be positively correlated with the total cr content in the soil r 0 52 p 0 05 which indicates that the mobility of cr increases with the increase in the concentration of cr in the soil 3 4 2 individual and global contamination factor icf and gcf are generally used for speciation or fractionation index approach for metal contamination icf and gcf for cd and cr for twenty soils samples from various sites are depicted in fig 4 the highest level of icf for cd was found in site s 19 10 75 and lowest in s 6 2 28 for cr highest level of icf was computed at site s 11 76 51 and lowest in s 7 4 35 the gcfs which were estimated utilizing icf values showed that site s 11 was highly affected by metal pollution which might be due to the presence of huge amount of lime wastes in this site the icf and gcf values for both cd and cr were in the high category icf and gcf reflects the degree of contamination by pollutants and retention time associated with the hms nemati et al 2009 benson et al 2016 thus high values of contamination factors of the metals and their low retention times indicate high degree of risk to the environment saleem et al 2015 3 4 3 pollution load index and ipi the calculated pi values of cd and cr are presented in fig 5 and it shows that the pi values of cd exceeded the maximum permissible limit i e 1 in all the sites but for cr it exceeded in all sites but s 7 s 13 and s 16 the highest pi value 22 15 for cd was reached at site s 19 however the pi values of cr ranged between 0 67 and 1 93 thus it can be implied major part of the soils around the paper mill were contaminated with both cd and cr the ip i values of the twenty sites varied from 6 37 to 17 70 fig 5 all 20 soil samples had ip i 5 classified as extremely high pollution among which eight soil samples had ip i 10 the results showed that cd had a relatively higher ip i value 17 94 for the tested soils and could be classified as extremely polluted the ip i of cr was 1 67 which indicated moderate pollution 3 5 environmental risk assessment 3 5 1 geoaccumulation index igeo in order to evaluate which elements show relatively higher risks and to estimate the extent of hm pollution in the studied soil geoaccumulation index can be used as a reference hou et al 2013 the geoaccumulation index igeo values ranged from 0 51 to 1 07 for cd however it was ranged between 8 96 and 12 64 for cr table 3 based on the classification as described by müller 1981 results of this study suggested low to moderate contamination of cd and extremely high contamination of cr in all the sites table 3 site s 19 and s 15 showed the highest igeo values for cd and cr respectively indicating severe pollution due to the wastes discharge from the mill and various anthropogenic activities and thus cr appeared as the major pollutant 3 5 2 risk factor and risk index the ecological risk index as described by hakanson 1980 was estimated for cd and cr which provides a fast and single quantitative value on the potential ecological risk and contamination situation in the studied area the estimated individual ei r and ri are shown in table 3 the results of present study indicated low to extremely high potential ecological risk for cr and cd respectively table 3 all the values of ri in the studied soils were higher than 150 sites s 17 and s 19 showed very high ecological risk while s 3 s 5 s 6 s 12 and s 13 showed moderate ecological risk the rest of the sites showed considerable ecological risk thus it reflects that there is an overall high ecological risk posed by cd and cr in the study area cd showed higher potential ecological risk than cr as shown in table 3 and fig 1 the potential ecological risk increases as we go closer to the areas which receive huge amount of bamboo and other wastes from the paper mill and also near the roadside areas indicating the contribution of various wastes and raw materials used for the paper mill 3 6 cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was carried out to identify clusters or which observations are clustered together with multiple levels of clusters it was used to elucidate the latent relationships between metals in soils and the degree of association between the sites here hca method was used to divide geochemical group of sampling sites before hca the variables were standardized by means of z scores and euclidean distances for similarities were calculated the ward s method was applied to the standardized data set to conduct the hierarchical clustering ding et al 2016 all the sampling sites were divided into three major clusters fig 6 cluster 1 included the sites that were near the point source of pollution i e the paper mill and near effluent discharge unit s 1 s 2 s 4 s 5 s 7 s 8 and s 12 while cluster 2 contained the s 3 s 6 s 9 s 11 near lime mountain s 16 nakhula grant s 17 area bamboo storage place s 19 and s 20 near residential area showing serious anthropogenic activities cluster 3 consisted of the sites s 10 s 13 s 14 s 15 and s 18 which receive the wastes coming out of the mill solid wastes and lime sludge and the roadside area of the national highway 37 thus it can be interpreted as a mixed source from both the paper mill wastes and wastes coming out of the transport vehicles there is an urgent need of proper disposal and management of these wastes by adopting certain remediation measures such as vermicomposting and phyto remediation etc vermicomposting can be an effective way for the reduction of both total and bioavailable metal contents which leads to immobilization of mobile metal fractions the enzymatic activities in earthworm gut and cast tend to reduce the mobility of metals and convert the wastes into nutrients rich organic manure goswami et al 2013 sahariah et al 2014 singh et al 2017 although after co composting of wastes using vermitechnology the sludge can be used in agronomic applications but sometimes only partial degradation occurs due to hms bioavailability beyond the permissible limit lim et al 2016 phytoremediation may also be a potential strategy to remove the pollutants from the habitat through absorption filtration and tissue accumulation process chandra et al 2017 4 conclusion a detailed study on physico chemical properties heavy metal speciation contamination and environmental risk assessment in soils around a paper mill in assam india was carried out almost at all the sites the concentrations of cd and cr exceeded the maximum permissible limits as recommended by ccme particularly those sites which received wastes from the mill and near the roadside the total metal concentrations were much higher than the maximum permissible limits metal speciation of cd showed that they were mainly present in the carbonate and exchangeable fractions whereas cr fractions were mostly available in carbonate and fe mn oxide fractions various indices were employed to assess the mobility of hms in soil and potential contamination and environmental risks posed by these metals the contamination statuses of these selected sites were classified in to various categories on the basis of the values of these indices the present study indicated that cd and cr could pose significant environmental risk in the sites near the paper mill due to their relatively high mf values which extended up to 0 94km from the paper mill the spatial maps of cd and cr showed significant variations in their distribution among the sites this provides clues for potential site specific mitigation measures for containing the future environmental risks acknowledgements the

12387,hydrogeochemical investigation was carried out in the western doon valley to understand the geochemistry of the groundwater and to assess the overall physic chemical characteristics to attempt this goal 50 groundwater samples of dug well and tube well were collected using pre cleaned polyethylene containers from the different geological formations of the study area the physical and chemical parameters of the analytical results of groundwater samples were compared with the standard guideline values recommended by the world health organization for drinking and public health standards thematic layers pertaining to ca2 mg2 no3 and total hardness th were generated using gis platform the hydrochemistry of groundwater quality for drinking purpose was evaluated by plotting the cations anions in the piper s trilinear diagram which indicates the alkaline and weak acids dominance and carbonate hardness exceeds 50 expanded durov diagram implies ca2 hco3 dominance indicating recharging of water in sandstone aquifer based on the hydrogeochemical analysis for irrigation quality certain parameters like carbonate hardness sodium adsorption ratio sodium percent salinity hazard residual sodium carbonate kelley s ratio index of base exchange and permeability index were calculated besides this a comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water quality standards shows that most of the groundwater samples are good for drinking as well as irrigation purposes and controlled by lithology apart from other local environmental conditions as the concentration of the cations and anion increases in the post monsoon season the results of hydrogeochemical are helpful to generate the baseline information and roadmap for future research on groundwater resources to assess the water quality in relation to agricultural and domestic uses in the western doon valley graphical abstract fx1 keywords hydrogeochemical parameters gis groundwater quality western doon valley uttarakhand india 1 introduction groundwater is one of the nation s most important natural resources groundwater systems are dynamic and can adjust continually to short and long term changes in climate groundwater withdrawal and land use the balance between charging and discharging of aquifers controls the groundwater level without a well functioning water supply it is difficult to imagine a productive human activity be it agriculture or livestock the quality of water is of almost the same importance to quantity in any water supply planning natural and anthropogenic effects including local climate geology and irrigation practices influence water quality the chemical character of any groundwater determines its quality and utilization the quality is a function of the physical chemical and biological parameters and could be subjective since it depends on a particular intended use further it is important to understand the change in quality due to rock water interaction or any type of anthropogenic influence anbazhagan and nair 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 ramkumar et al 2013 verma et al 2015 water quality analysis is one of the more important issues in groundwater studies groundwater chemical composition intended for the irrigation presents one of the major problems in the alpine himalayan zone considering its effect on deterioration of water quality and lowering of the agricultural output this problem is often related to the nature of geological formations and climatic factors several studies were carried out on this topic around the world hem 1991 bhattacharya et al 1997 subha rao 2002 jasrotia and singh 2007 bouchaou et al 2008 abdelkader et al 2012 omonona et al 2014 verma et al 2015 the variety and extent of groundwater chemical composition could also be influenced by natural processes such as evaporation cation exchange dissociation of minerals mixing of water rock weathering and human activities appelo and postma 1999 kumar et al 2011 the coastal aquifer in india and various parts of the world are also reportedly badly affected by the over exploitation due to high population growth and large scale industrialization in the coastal zones which threatens the coastal freshwater resources globally rendering groundwater non drinkable sappa et al 2012 2015 sarathprasanth et al 2012 besides this the presence of arsenic in surface water and groundwater resources in many countries has also caused adverse effects on human health guo et al 2003 chauhan et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 ergul et al 2013 the geochemistry of soil zuane 1990 and the geological history of rocks walton 1970 have a significant impact on the chemical contamination of groundwater therefore any groundwater suitability assessment for agriculture should include their chemical composition alexakis 2011 over the years the need of groundwater quality assessment before the implementation of the land development programme in order to overcome water borne diseases to the people who depend upon groundwater for their consumption has also been changed to a larger extent and well documented by the numerous researchers niranjan babu et al 1997 nickson et al 2005 kumar et al 2007 djabri et al 2008 kvitsand et al 2010 nas and berktay 2010 champidi et al 2011 murphy et al 2014 saba et al 2015 groundwater consists of major cations and anions such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulphate so4 2 and bicarbonate hco3 which directly influence the water quality the effective management of groundwater resources can be promoted by the detailed knowledge of the water quality the detail hydrochemistry and groundwater quality in various parts of india have been studied by numbers of researchers to evaluate the major ion chemistry geochemical processes controlling water composition and suitability of water for domestic industrial and irrigation uses singh et al 2008 afroza et al 2009 dar et al 2011a gamvroula et al 2013 hossain

abroad anbazhagan and nair 2004 shankar et al 2010 dar 2011b jasrotia and kumar 2014 cortes et al 2016 besides this integrated groundwater potential zones and groundwater quality zones using remote sensing and gis techniques have been also well documented rao and jugran 2003 jasrotia et al 2013 dhar et al 2015 groundwater is the most reliable water resource especially in the hilly terrain of western doon valley purohit et al 1993 rawat et al 2011 agriculture is a dominant activity on the yamuna plains in the southwest of the study area asan and bindal river plains which covers 65 agricultural land of the study thousands wells have been constructed by the inhabitants to supply groundwater for domestic and irrigation uses in these agricultural plains which might affect the groundwater quality as studied by the numerous researchers around the world purohit et al 1993 rawat et al 2011 dudeja et al 2011 bartarya and bahukhandi 2012 the objective of the research is to understand the groundwater quality through detail hydrochemistry in the study area to determine the various classifications of groundwater prepare the spatial distribution map of the various physical chemical parameters using the gis and delineation of groundwater quality zones in the study area 2 description of the study area the study area situated in the lesser himalayan region of uttarakhand covers 680km2 area bounded by latitude n30 15 to n30 30 and longitudes e 77 45 to e78 00 a synclinal valley fig 1a c the climate varies with altitude and it is characterized as sub humid to subtropical the summers are hot with temperatures rising to about 40 c while winters are cool with maximum temperature 20 c the mean monthly evaporation ranges from 32mm to 307mm the average annual rainfall is about 2000mm out of which 1600mm is summer monsoon rainfall physiographically the study area is bounded by lesser himalayas in the north siwalik in the south and the yamuna river drains through the western side in the northeast to southwest direction asan flows in the west to east direction the major drainage pattern present in the area is braided dendritic sub dendritic parallel to subparallel and trellis the asan river follows the axis of the doon syncline and main tributaries of the tons river asan river in the north are sitla rao and surna which are in semi perennial nature the southern side of the tributaries of asan river is starting from the upper region of siwalik belt which is passing through more dissected zones active deep gorges and controlled by lithology 3 regional tectonics and geological setting 3 1 regional tectonics the 2000km long himalayan orogenic system was formed due to continent continent collision between the indian and eurasian plates which started in the eocene yin and harrison 2000 leech et al 2005 guillot et al 2008 and continues till today fig 1a this has caused the accumulation of stress which is periodically released and results in structurally controlled hydrology nakata 1989 mailloux et al 1999 at the himalayan front there are anticlinial ridges which commonly border on the north by broad plains known as duns the largest dun among them is the western doon valley this longitudinal synclinal valley falls between the siwalik range and the lesser himalaya and forms a part of the sub himalayan foothill zone the western doon valley in the east of the yamuna river exposes mainly the middle and upper siwalik sediments belonging to upper tertiary age and the quaternary alluvium gansser 1964 karunakaran and rao 1979 the western doon valley was formed as an intermontane valley within the siwalik group rocks in foreland ward propagating fold thrust system of garhwal himalaya in western dun asan river flows from se to nw direction joining yamuna river tons nun nimmi and darer rivers initially flowing n s curve around to sw as tributaries and join the nw flowing asan river in southern dun all the consequent streams originating from the siwalik water divide flow ne over the dip slope and meet the asan river nossin 1971 thakur and pandey 2004 the study area is an asymmetrical longitudinal synclinal valley which is filled by post siwalik fluvial and debris flow deposits in late quaternary holocene period the geology table 1 of the siwalik group of dun and adjoining frontal siwalik is also well described with stratigraphic succession of the study area karunakaran and rao 1979 3 2 geological setting geologically western doon valley is an asymmetrically longitudinal structurally synclinal valley formed of siwalik rocks of sedimentary origin having the trend of nw se of upper tertiary age fig 1c later it has been filled up by doon gravels derived from the two mountain hill ranges lesser himalayas in the north and siwalik in the south consists of loose unconsolidated material of sub recent age the siwalik groups represent the upper tertiary fresh water molasses rapidly deposited on the marginal bases in front of the rising himalayas during later pleistocene the siwalik were folded at least locally and are still in the process of folding when fan material deposited over it the pre tertiary group of rocks is exposed in the study area as lesser himalayas these rocks are mainly of pre cambrian age and consist of meta sedimentary rocks the middle siwalik representing a multistory sandstone complex exhibit vertical facies variation from sandstone mudstone to sandstone mudstone conglomerate the upper siwalik is made of predominantly conglomerate with subordinate sandstone and mudstone facies the older doon fan gravel comprises of boulders pebbles embedded in reddish clay matrix and these boulders are of quartzite schist gneiss and broken fragments of quartzite the younger doon fan gravel is the middle portion of the fan covering major part of the area belonging to early holocene age and lithologically these boulders are sub rounded to sub angular in the river section the lowest part of the study area which is fluvial deposition in nature and covered with erosion formation of the recent age alluvium consists of boulders pebbles gravels with sand silt and clay tables 2 and 3 3 3 hydrogeology the hydrogeology of the western doon valley is mainly controlled by the geology and geomorphology a wide variation in the geology and landforms in the area gives rise to different hydrogeological conditions broadly the western doon valley is classified into five hydrogeological units fig 2 3 3 1 river alluvium primarily composed of unconsolidated river borne sediments such as pebbles cobbles sand silt and clay and formed by the active flood plain of the rivers flowing through the study area river alluvium and terrace alluvium are consider the most potential groundwater prospect zone the alluvial deposits of fluvial and colluvial origin in the lower reaches of streams rivers in the form of fans and terraces are highly porous and permeable and hold promising areas for groundwater exploration the shallow water table condition flat area characterized by high discharge and low drawdown and level to very gentle slope the general flow of the groundwater is east to west 3 3 2 river terraces the geomorphic river terraces have been formed by deposition and down cutting by the major streams due to changes in long physical climatic and tectonic conditions developed in different terrace levels are quite prominent in the study area repeated deposition and erosion left remnants of alluvial deposits at higher elevations as the streams progressively lowered their beds and are quite prominent along the river beds considered to be highly porous and permeable with high yielding capacity 3 3 3 doonfan gravel the intermontane valley portion of the western doon valley is underlain by alluvial fan deposits the sediments descend from the lesser himalayan front as well as well as the north facing siwalik hill slopes these fan deposits are called as doon gravels and characterized by boulders and pebbles embedded in sandy and silty matrix the clasts are mainly composed of quartzite sandstone and phyllite which are mainly derived from the krol belt of the himalayas doon fan gravels are highly porous permeable and groundwater occurs under unconfined to semi confined conditions the saturated granular zones occur in a depth range between 35 and 138m below ground level mbgl the piezometric head ranges from 20 to 125 mbgl 3 3 4 siwalik zone groundwater occurs under confined and unconfined conditions in this unit the siwaliks zone is characterized by low yielding capacity with water table conditions in spite of the boulder conglomerate bed of upper siwalik formation being highly porous and permeable most of the water act as run off due to steep slopes and the sediments forming piedmont fans dipping into the intermontane valley during the field study about 70 gravitational type springs have been reported which have a varying discharge 1 113l s the fresh water bearing zones are present in the upper siwaliks due to the presence of pebble gravel conglomerate boulder beds and act as good groundwater reservoirs exploration has revealed that the pebble boulder gravel and sand beds of siwalik are capable of yielding copious quantities of water the groundwater flow tends to flow southeast direction from the northern side whereas northward from the south hillslope follow the assan river which flows eastern direction as a tributary of the yamuna river 3 3 5 himalayan mountain belt groundwater in this unit occurs as disconnected local bodies both under confined and unconfined conditions quartzite schist shale slate phyllite compact sandstone limestone and dolomite are the main rock types the rock formations are characterized by fissures fractures veins and joints which provide the secondary porosity the secondary porosity and permeability help forming the local bodies of groundwater the weathered veneers found on hilltops ridges spurs etc give rise to large groundwater repositories under perched conditions the alluvial deposits of fluvial and colluvial origin in the lower reaches of streams rivers in the form of fans and terraces are highly porous and permeable and hold promising areas for groundwater exploration the springs and seepages are the main source for hilly areas 3 4 water level fluctuation during the pre monsoon period the depth to water table ranges from 1m in the hilly area and 5 29m in the river alluvium and doon gravels belt having high infiltration and medium drawdown in the post monsoon period it ranges from 0 7m in the hilly area and 4 25m in river alluvium and doon gravels the pre monsoon and post monsoon water table data have been taken for computing the water table fluctuation the fluctuation varies from site to site in the study area and it ranges from about 1 7 5 8m particularly central eastern portion along the asan river the fluctuation is very high i e 5 5m covers and very low fluctuation recorded in the i e 1 5 to 0 5m in the western side of the study the water level fluctuation also influence the cations and anion concentration in the study area during the post monsoon the concentration of ph ec th tds and major cations and anions showing the increasing trends which indicate that the groundwater quality is generally dominated by the lithology rather than human intervention 4 methodology geospatial technology have been used to investigate the geomorphic setting using satellite imagery landsat 8 30m collected from the usgs earth explorer and digital elevation model dem srtm 30m after pre processing techniques various image processing techniques such as image correction rectification enhancement including standard color composites intensity hue saturation ihs transformation and decorrelation stretch ds were applied to map rock types in order to assess the groundwater pollution 50 groundwater samples were collected using the random sampling techniques nelson and ward 1981 the samples were collected during the month of april may for the pre monsoon season and october november for the post monsoon season by using the one liter narrow mouthed pre washed polyethylene bottles although the groundwater locations were selected to cover the entire study area that have been extensively used for drinking and other domestic purposes and attention was given to the area where contamination is expected environment sensitive index such as ph hydrogen ion concentration electrical conductance ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field at the time of sample collection for the field measurement of ph a portable ph meter waterproof ph scan 2 tester was used ec value of the samples were measured by the ec meter water proof ec scan 3 tester whereas tds was measured with tds meter water proof tds scan1tester the techniques and methods for collection and analysis of water samples followed in this study were those after the american public health association apha 1992 and manual of pollution control board new delhi mpcb 1997 the identification of major ions concentrations were carried out at the hydrochemical laboratory department of geology university of jammu jammu the analytical accuracy of these methods ranges from 3 to 5 the dissolved oxygen do analysed in the laboratory by the winkler titrimetric azide modification iodometric method and total alkalinity by the color indicator method the total hardness th and calcium were estimated by the ethylene diamine triacetic acid edta titrimetric method and magnesium was estimated by their difference sodium and potassium were analysed using the instrument flame photometer bicarbonate was measured by titration with 0 1 nhcl using color turning method with methyl orange the chloride concentration was analysed by titrimetric argentometric method fluoride ion concentration was estimated by fluoride ion selective electrode coupled to ion analyze atomic absorption photometer the sulphate nitrate and silica ion concentration were estimated by the gravimetric method using the instrument flame photometer all the concentrations are expressed in mg l except ph and ec in µs cm meanwhile the location of each well was taken into the gis environment using arc gis 10 software and the results of each parameter analysed were added to the concerned wells the spatial analysis was carried out for drinking and irrigation water quality mapping in the study area 5 results and discussions 5 1 hydrochemistry of groundwater the graphical representations the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is evaluated by plotting the cation and anions in percent of total meq l in piper s trilinear diagram piper 1953 back facies diagram back 1966 gibb s diagram gibbs 1970 and expanded durov diagram domenico and schwartz 1990 5 1 1 piper s trilinear diagram piper s trilinear diagram plot of the study area fig 3 suggest that groundwater of study area of the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fall in the field 1 and 3 persuasive of a credible that alkaline earth exceeds alkalies weak acids exceeds strong acids respectively whereas carbonate hardness secondary alkalinity exceeds 50 the plot deduce that alkaline and weak acids dominance over the study area and secondary salinity exceeds 50 5 1 2 expanded durov diagram expanded durov diagram fig 4 groundwater samples of the study area fall mostly in the field 1 this provides a distinct classification of the combination of dominant cations and anions it implies ca2 hco3 dominance indicating recharging water in sandstone aquifer rest of samples fall in the field 2 which implies that groundwater is either mg2 dominant or ca2 and mg2 dominant indicating water often associated with dolomite where ca2 and na are important partial ion exchange lloyd and heathcoat 1985 this may be the reason for ca2 and na hydrochemical facies in the groundwater during the pre monsoon period 5 1 3 back facies diagram back facies diagram back 1966 reveals that the majority of groundwater samples of the cations during pre monsoon period fall in the field calcium sodium facies fig 5a whereas the cation facies of post monsoon period are slightly changed from calcium sodium to calcium magnesium facies the anion facies of pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fall in the field of bicarbonate chloride sulphate facies fig 5b 5 1 4 gibb s diagram gibb s diagram gibbs 1970 shows the relationship of the chemical components of waters from their respective aquifer lithologies in relation to three mechanisms i e evaporation dominance rock dominance and precipitation dominance controlling water chemistry the gibb s ratio cl cl hco3 for anion fig 6a and ratio na k na k ca2 for cation fig 6b plotted separately against respective values of tds the pre monsoon and post monsoon samples are fall in the rock dominance area the chemical composition of the ground water is mainly governed by rock dominance which suggest that there by the interaction between the chemistry of the aquifer rocks and groundwater 5 1 5 index of base exchange the ion exchange between the groundwater and its local environment during residence or travel can be inferred from chloro alkaline indices cai the cais have been determined by adopting the following formula proposed by scholler 1965 cai i cl na k cl and cai ii cl na k so4 2 hco3 co3 no3 the cai scan be either positive or negative depending on whether exchange of sodium and potassium is from water with magnesium and calcium in rock about 70 of the samples show the negative index and 30 shows the positive index indicating that there is an exchange between na and k in groundwater with mg2 or ca2 in the rock or soil 5 2 drinking water quality the hydrochemical results were evaluated for the suitability of groundwater for drinking and public health purposes these hydrochemical parameters of groundwater of the study area compared with who 1984 and isi 1991 specifications table 4 the ph values range between 6 5 and 7 9 indicates the water is acidic to slightly alkaline in nature the total dissolved solids tds ranges between 90 and 400mg l within the highest desirable limit indicate the water is suitable for livestock the ca2 and th ca2 plus mg2 10 89mg l and 40 300mg l as compared with who 1984 and isi 1991 more than the highest desirable limit indicating moderately hard to hard water in some area which is permanent nature caused by the dominance of strong acids ta th according to sawyer and mc carthy 1967 classification the groundwater samples of study area falls under soft to hard category table 5 excess concentration of th has no adverse effect however some evidence indicates its role in heart disease and is unsuitable for domestic use interestingly the hardness cannot be removed easily by the boiling of water the chloride sulphate fluoride and nitrate expect one case also within the highest desirable limit the groundwater is suitable for drinking purposes and public health because the th within the maximum permissible limit and other cations and anions within the highest desirable limit 5 2 1 spatial analysis of drinking water quality gis has proven ability of handling large volumes of geospatial data that can be correlated spatially and retrieved for the statistical analysis to produce the desirable output these samples were plotted in the respective samples locations and contours were generated using the interpolation techniques the spatial maps of all the major anion and cation were prepared to known about the spatial distribution of the various elements in the study area the spatial analysis reveals fig 7 that the majority of the study area is within desirable limit whereas a few pockets in some of the elements are above the permissible limit 5 3 irrigation water quality large amount of salts and dissolved ions affect the plant health and reduce the crop productivity it is the quantity of certain ions such as sodium and boron rather than the total salt concentration that affects plant development sahinci 1991 excessive salinity in plants reduces the osmotic activity and thus interferes with the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil saleh et al 1999 in the present study surface water facilities for irrigation is available only some villages along the streams rivers otherwise the groundwater is the main source of irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is affected by the total content of soluble salts and relative proportion of bicarbonate to calcium and magnesium and relative proportion of sodium to calcium the ec and na concentration are important in classifying irrigation water the important characteristic properties of groundwater are used to determine its suitability for irrigation in the present study are 5 3 1 electrical conductivity ec and sodium percentage na the concentration of sodium and ec considerably affect the quality of irrigation water the salts found in the ground water not only affect the growth of plants but also affect soil structure permeability and aeration according to the classification of groundwater for irrigation richards 1954 recognized four groups for the classification of irrigation as a low salinity hazard ec 250μs cm medium salinity hazard 250 750μs cm high salinity hazard 750 2250μs cm and very high salinity hazard 2250 5000μs cm the distribution of ec in the groundwater range from 120 to 670μs cm so the groundwater of the study area is of excellent to good table 7 the sodium percentage doneen 1962 was calculated by using the formula na na k ca 2 mg 2 na k 100 the concentrations of cations are in meq l the sodium percent in water is an important parameter computed to evaluate the suitability for irrigation the excess of sodium combining with carbonate always leads to the formation of alkaline soils whereas the chloride supports the formation of saline soils although either of the soils will not support the growth of crops the groundwater samples of the pre monsoon and post monsoon period plot fig 8 over the wilcox diagram fall in the excellent to good category indicate that groundwater of the study area is excellent quality a gis based salinity hazard map was also prepared interpolation in the gis the salinity hazard map shows regions with low medium and high salinity hazards the majority of the area is covered by groundwater with decent quality fig 9 although a few pockets was found in the northeastern parts of the study area in the sedimentary beds of siwalik group of rocks 5 3 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sodium or alkali hazard in the water use of irrigation purposes expressed by sodium absorption ratio karanth 1987 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 the concentrations are expressed in meq l the calculated values of sar in the study area are very between 0 144 and 0 815 low sodium water s1 can be used for irrigation in almost all soil types as both pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater samples fall in the low sodium s1 category table 6 and indicating no hazard of alkalinity richards 1954 5 3 3 salinity hazard the electrical conductivity ec values of groundwater samples will give the salinity hazard groundwater samples pre monsoon period near about equal fall in the low and medium salinity hazard however the majority of the samples of post monsoon period fall in the medium salinity hazard and a few are falling in the low salinity hazard groundwater samples that fall in the low salinity hazard c1 can be used for irrigation of most crops and the majority of soils groundwater samples that fall in the medium salinity hazard c2 can be used if moderate amount of leaching occurs the salinity hazard table 7 shows that groundwater quality is excellent to good for irrigation purposes the integrated effect of ec and sar values plotted on the united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagram fig 10 in which ec was taken as salinity hazard and sar as sodium or alkali hazard indicates that groundwater samples of pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fall in c1s1 and c2s1 which depicts that the water is low alkali and low to moderate salinity hazard 5 3 4 kelley s ratio the level of sodium measure against calcium and magnesium is known as kelley s ratio based on which irrigation waters are rated according to kelley 1946 and later by paliwal 1967 in the study area kelley s ratio is 1 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods i e na ca2 mg2 1 which indicate that the water is suitable for irrigation purposes 5 3 5 residual sodium carbonate rsc when the sum of carbonate and bicarbonate is in excess over the alkaline earths chiefly calcium and magnesium in excess of permissible limits affects irrigation adversely according to eaton 1950 and richards 1954 rsc co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 meq l based on the rsc value of groundwater samples of the study is within the permissible limit table 8 hence the groundwater of study area is excellent for irrigation purposes 5 3 6 permeability index pi the permeability index was used to classify the quality of the irrigation water based on the formula doneen 1962 pi n a h c o 3 ca 2 mg 2 na 100 the concentrations of cations and anions are in meq l according to the doneen 1962 diagram water can be classified class i class ii and class iii the class i and class ii water are categorized as good for irrigation with 75 or more permeability whereas class iii water categorized as unsuitable with 25 of maximum permeability the majority of groundwater samples of the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fig 11 fall into the class i and class ii indicate that quality of groundwater is good for irrigation purposes although the few samples of the pre monsoon season falls in the class iii falls in the unsuitable category 6 conclusion the water quality is the precarious factor that influences the social industrial and agricultural development of any region moreover the assessment of groundwater water quality is an important aspect of evaluating groundwater pollution due to natural or anthropogenic inputs groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation and domestic purposes were evaluated by various physicochemical and water quality parameters during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons by comparing the results with different water standards groundwater in the western doon valley is acidic to alkaline in nature and shows marginal seasonal changes the results of ground water indicates that the alkaline earths ca2 and mg2 exceeds the alkalies na and k weak acid hco3 exceed the strong acids cl so4 2 no3 and secondary salinity exceeds 50 which is dominated by alkaline earth and weak acid hence the groundwater of the study area shows dominance of calcium magnesium bicarbonate indicating the recharging of water from carbonate present as cementing materials in the sandstone aquifer the ca2 and th ca2 mg2 more than the highest desirable limit indicating moderately hard to very hard water in some areas the gibbs ratio for the anions and cations of the water samples plotted against the relative values of the total dissolved solids point towards rock dominance of the chemistry of groundwater in the region which reflects the influence of the chemistry of aquifer lithology vis a vis groundwater the groundwater is classified as fresh water normal chloride normal sulphate normal carbonate water and moderately hard to hard based on the rsc value of groundwater samples of the study is within the safe limit the classification of irrigation water in relationship to salinity and sodium hazard shows the low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard which indicate that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation purposes the permeability index shows that majority of groundwater samples fall in the class i and class ii and a few samples fall in class iii indicates that the groundwater quality is good for irrigation purpose hence the overall quality of groundwater is suitable for the drinking as well as irrigation purposes although it is also imperative for the sustainable groundwater quality and quantity that special attention should be paid to minimize the excessive withdrawal for water management efficient water quality monitoring program incorporating measurements

12387,hydrogeochemical investigation was carried out in the western doon valley to understand the geochemistry of the groundwater and to assess the overall physic chemical characteristics to attempt this goal 50 groundwater samples of dug well and tube well were collected using pre cleaned polyethylene containers from the different geological formations of the study area the physical and chemical parameters of the analytical results of groundwater samples were compared with the standard guideline values recommended by the world health organization for drinking and public health standards thematic layers pertaining to ca2 mg2 no3 and total hardness th were generated using gis platform the hydrochemistry of groundwater quality for drinking purpose was evaluated by plotting the cations anions in the piper s trilinear diagram which indicates the alkaline and weak acids dominance and carbonate hardness exceeds 50 expanded durov diagram implies ca2 hco3 dominance indicating recharging of water in sandstone aquifer based on the hydrogeochemical analysis for irrigation quality certain parameters like carbonate hardness sodium adsorption ratio sodium percent salinity hazard residual sodium carbonate kelley s ratio index of base exchange and permeability index were calculated besides this a comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water quality standards shows that most of the groundwater samples are good for drinking as well as irrigation purposes and controlled by lithology apart from other local environmental conditions as the concentration of the cations and anion increases in the post monsoon season the results of hydrogeochemical are helpful to generate the baseline information and roadmap for future research on groundwater resources to assess the water quality in relation to agricultural and domestic uses in the western doon valley graphical abstract fx1 keywords hydrogeochemical parameters gis groundwater quality western doon valley uttarakhand india 1 introduction groundwater is one of the nation s most important natural resources groundwater systems are dynamic and can adjust continually to short and long term changes in climate groundwater withdrawal and land use the balance between charging and discharging of aquifers controls the groundwater level without a well functioning water supply it is difficult to imagine a productive human activity be it agriculture or livestock the quality of water is of almost the same importance to quantity in any water supply planning natural and anthropogenic effects including local climate geology and irrigation practices influence water quality the chemical character of any groundwater determines its quality and utilization the quality is a function of the physical chemical and biological parameters and could be subjective since it depends on a particular intended use further it is important to understand the change in quality due to rock water interaction or any type of anthropogenic influence anbazhagan and nair 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 ramkumar et al 2013 verma et al 2015 water quality analysis is one of the more important issues in groundwater studies groundwater chemical composition intended for the irrigation presents one of the major problems in the alpine himalayan zone considering its effect on deterioration of water quality and lowering of the agricultural output this problem is often related to the nature of geological formations and climatic factors several studies were carried out on this topic around the world hem 1991 bhattacharya et al 1997 subha rao 2002 jasrotia and singh 2007 bouchaou et al 2008 abdelkader et al 2012 omonona et al 2014 verma et al 2015 the variety and extent of groundwater chemical composition could also be influenced by natural processes such as evaporation cation exchange dissociation of minerals mixing of water rock weathering and human activities appelo and postma 1999 kumar et al 2011 the coastal aquifer in india and various parts of the world are also reportedly badly affected by the over exploitation due to high population growth and large scale industrialization in the coastal zones which threatens the coastal freshwater resources globally rendering groundwater non drinkable sappa et al 2012 2015 sarathprasanth et al 2012 besides this the presence of arsenic in surface water and groundwater resources in many countries has also caused adverse effects on human health guo et al 2003 chauhan et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 ergul et al 2013 the geochemistry of soil zuane 1990 and the geological history of rocks walton 1970 have a significant impact on the chemical contamination of groundwater therefore any groundwater suitability assessment for agriculture should include their chemical composition alexakis 2011 over the years the need of groundwater quality assessment before the implementation of the land development programme in order to overcome water borne diseases to the people who depend upon groundwater for their consumption has also been changed to a larger extent and well documented by the numerous researchers niranjan babu et al 1997 nickson et al 2005 kumar et al 2007 djabri et al 2008 kvitsand et al 2010 nas and berktay 2010 champidi et al 2011 murphy et al 2014 saba et al 2015 groundwater consists of major cations and anions such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulphate so4 2 and bicarbonate hco3 which directly influence the water quality the effective management of groundwater resources can be promoted by the detailed knowledge of the water quality the detail hydrochemistry and groundwater quality in various parts of india have been studied by numbers of researchers to evaluate the major ion chemistry

abroad anbazhagan and nair 2004 shankar et al 2010 dar 2011b jasrotia and kumar 2014 cortes et al 2016 besides this integrated groundwater potential zones and groundwater quality zones using remote sensing and gis techniques have been also well documented rao and jugran 2003 jasrotia et al 2013 dhar et al 2015 groundwater is the most reliable water resource especially in the hilly terrain of western doon valley purohit et al 1993 rawat et al 2011 agriculture is a dominant activity on the yamuna plains in the southwest of the study area asan and bindal river plains which covers 65 agricultural land of the study thousands wells have been constructed by the inhabitants to supply groundwater for domestic and irrigation uses in these agricultural plains which might affect the groundwater quality as studied by the numerous researchers around the world purohit et al 1993 rawat et al 2011 dudeja et al 2011 bartarya and bahukhandi 2012 the objective of the research is to understand the groundwater quality through detail hydrochemistry in the study area to determine the various classifications of groundwater prepare the spatial distribution map of the various physical chemical parameters using the gis and delineation of groundwater quality zones in the study area 2 description of the study area the study area situated in the lesser himalayan region of uttarakhand covers 680km2 area bounded by latitude n30 15 to n30 30 and longitudes e 77 45 to e78 00 a synclinal valley fig 1a c the climate varies with altitude and it is characterized as sub humid to subtropical the summers are hot with temperatures rising to about 40 c while winters are cool with maximum temperature 20 c the mean monthly evaporation ranges from 32mm to 307mm the average annual rainfall is about 2000mm out of which 1600mm is summer monsoon rainfall physiographically the study area is bounded by lesser himalayas in the north siwalik in the south and the yamuna river drains through the western side in the northeast to southwest direction asan flows in the west to east direction the major drainage pattern present in the area is braided dendritic sub dendritic parallel to subparallel and trellis the asan river follows the axis of the doon syncline and main tributaries of the tons river asan river in the north are sitla rao and surna which are in semi perennial nature the southern side of the tributaries of asan river is starting from the upper region of siwalik belt which is passing through more dissected zones active deep gorges and controlled by lithology 3 regional tectonics and geological setting 3 1 regional tectonics the 2000km long himalayan orogenic system was formed due to continent continent collision between the indian and eurasian plates which started in the eocene yin and harrison 2000 leech et al 2005 guillot et al 2008 and continues till today fig 1a this has caused the accumulation of stress which is periodically released and results in structurally controlled hydrology nakata 1989 mailloux et al 1999 at the himalayan front there are anticlinial ridges which commonly border on the north by broad plains known as duns the largest dun among them is the western doon valley this longitudinal synclinal valley falls between the siwalik range and the lesser himalaya and forms a part of the sub himalayan foothill zone the western doon valley in the east of the yamuna river exposes mainly the middle and upper siwalik sediments belonging to upper tertiary age and the quaternary alluvium gansser 1964 karunakaran and rao 1979 the western doon valley was formed as an intermontane valley within the siwalik group rocks in foreland ward propagating fold thrust system of garhwal himalaya in western dun asan river flows from se to nw direction joining yamuna river tons nun nimmi and darer rivers initially flowing n s curve around to sw as tributaries and join the nw flowing asan river in southern dun all the consequent streams originating from the siwalik water divide flow ne over the dip slope and meet the asan river nossin 1971 thakur and pandey 2004 the study area is an asymmetrical longitudinal synclinal valley which is filled by post siwalik fluvial and debris flow deposits in late quaternary holocene period the geology table 1 of the siwalik group of dun and adjoining frontal siwalik is also well described with stratigraphic succession of the study area karunakaran and rao 1979 3 2 geological setting geologically western doon valley is an asymmetrically longitudinal structurally synclinal valley formed of siwalik rocks of sedimentary origin having the trend of nw se of upper tertiary age fig 1c later it has been filled up by doon gravels derived from the two mountain hill ranges lesser himalayas in the north and siwalik in the south consists of loose unconsolidated material of sub recent age the siwalik groups represent the upper tertiary fresh water molasses rapidly deposited on the marginal bases in front of the rising himalayas during later pleistocene the siwalik were folded at least locally and are still in the process of folding when fan material deposited over it the pre tertiary group of rocks is exposed in the study area as lesser himalayas these rocks are mainly of pre cambrian age and consist of meta sedimentary rocks the middle siwalik representing a multistory sandstone complex exhibit vertical facies variation from sandstone mudstone to sandstone mudstone conglomerate the upper siwalik is made of predominantly conglomerate with subordinate sandstone and mudstone facies the older doon fan gravel comprises of boulders pebbles embedded in reddish clay matrix and these boulders are of quartzite schist gneiss and broken fragments of quartzite the younger doon fan gravel is the middle portion of the fan covering major part of the area belonging to early holocene age and lithologically these boulders are sub rounded to sub angular in the river section the lowest part of the study area which is fluvial deposition in nature and covered with erosion formation of the recent age alluvium consists of boulders pebbles gravels with sand silt and clay tables 2 and 3 3 3 hydrogeology the hydrogeology of the western doon valley is mainly controlled by the geology and geomorphology a wide variation in the geology and landforms in the area gives rise to different hydrogeological conditions broadly the western doon valley is classified into five hydrogeological units fig 2 3 3 1 river alluvium primarily composed of unconsolidated river borne sediments such as pebbles cobbles sand silt and clay and formed by the active flood plain of the rivers flowing through the study area river alluvium and terrace alluvium are consider the most potential groundwater prospect zone the alluvial deposits of fluvial and colluvial origin in the lower reaches of streams rivers in the form of fans and terraces are highly porous and permeable and hold promising areas for groundwater exploration the shallow water table condition flat area characterized by high discharge and low drawdown and level to very gentle slope the general flow of the groundwater is east to west 3 3 2 river terraces the geomorphic river terraces have been formed by deposition and down cutting by the major streams due to changes in long physical climatic and tectonic conditions developed in different terrace levels are quite prominent in the study area repeated deposition and erosion left remnants of alluvial deposits at higher elevations as the streams progressively lowered their beds and are quite prominent along the river beds considered to be highly porous and permeable with high yielding capacity 3 3 3 doonfan gravel the intermontane valley portion of the western doon valley is underlain by alluvial fan deposits the sediments descend from the lesser himalayan front as well as well as the north facing siwalik hill slopes these fan deposits are called as doon gravels and characterized by boulders and pebbles embedded in sandy and silty matrix the clasts are mainly composed of quartzite sandstone and phyllite which are mainly derived from the krol belt of the himalayas doon fan gravels are highly porous permeable and groundwater occurs under unconfined to semi confined conditions the saturated granular zones occur in a depth range between 35 and 138m below ground level mbgl the piezometric head ranges from 20 to 125 mbgl 3 3 4 siwalik zone groundwater occurs under confined and unconfined conditions in this unit the siwaliks zone is characterized by low yielding capacity with water table conditions in spite of the boulder conglomerate bed of upper siwalik formation being highly porous and permeable most of the water act as run off due to steep slopes and the sediments forming piedmont fans dipping into the intermontane valley during the field study about 70 gravitational type springs have been reported which have a varying discharge 1 113l s the fresh water bearing zones are present in the upper siwaliks due to the presence of pebble gravel conglomerate boulder beds and act as good groundwater reservoirs exploration has revealed that the pebble boulder gravel and sand beds of siwalik are capable of yielding copious quantities of water the groundwater flow tends to flow southeast direction from the northern side whereas northward from the south hillslope follow the assan river which flows eastern direction as a tributary of the yamuna river 3 3 5 himalayan mountain belt groundwater in this unit occurs as disconnected local bodies both under confined and unconfined conditions quartzite schist shale slate phyllite compact sandstone limestone and dolomite are the main rock types the rock formations are characterized by fissures fractures veins and joints which provide the secondary porosity the secondary porosity and permeability help forming the local bodies of groundwater the weathered veneers found on hilltops ridges spurs etc give rise to large groundwater repositories under perched conditions the alluvial deposits of fluvial and colluvial origin in the lower reaches of streams rivers in the form of fans and terraces are highly porous and permeable and hold promising areas for groundwater exploration the springs and seepages are the main source for hilly areas 3 4 water level fluctuation during the pre monsoon period the depth to water table ranges from 1m in the hilly area and 5 29m in the river alluvium and doon gravels belt having high infiltration and medium drawdown in the post monsoon period it ranges from 0 7m in the hilly area and 4 25m in river alluvium and doon gravels the pre monsoon and post monsoon water table data have been taken for computing the water table fluctuation the fluctuation varies from site to site in the study area and it ranges from about 1 7 5 8m particularly central eastern portion along the asan river the fluctuation is very high i e 5 5m covers and very low fluctuation recorded in the i e 1 5 to 0 5m in the western side of the study the water level fluctuation also influence the cations and anion concentration in the study area during the post monsoon the concentration of ph ec th tds and major cations and anions showing the increasing trends which indicate that the groundwater quality is generally dominated by the lithology rather than human intervention 4 methodology geospatial technology have been used to investigate the geomorphic setting using satellite imagery landsat 8 30m collected from the usgs earth explorer and digital elevation model dem srtm 30m after pre processing techniques various image processing techniques such as image correction rectification enhancement including standard color composites intensity hue saturation ihs transformation and decorrelation stretch ds were applied to map rock types in order to assess the groundwater pollution 50 groundwater samples were collected using the random sampling techniques nelson and ward 1981 the samples were collected during the month of april may for the pre monsoon season and october november for the post monsoon season by using the one liter narrow mouthed pre washed polyethylene bottles although the groundwater locations were selected to cover the entire study area that have been extensively used for drinking and other domestic purposes and attention was given to the area where contamination is expected environment sensitive index such as ph hydrogen ion concentration electrical conductance ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field at the time of sample collection for the field measurement of ph a portable ph meter waterproof ph scan 2 tester was used ec value of the samples were measured by the ec meter water proof ec scan 3 tester whereas tds was measured with tds meter water proof tds scan1tester the techniques and methods for collection and analysis of water samples followed in this study were those after the american public health association apha 1992 and manual of pollution control board new delhi mpcb 1997 the identification of major ions concentrations were carried out at the hydrochemical laboratory department of geology university of jammu jammu the analytical accuracy of these methods ranges from 3 to 5 the dissolved oxygen do analysed in the laboratory by the winkler titrimetric azide modification iodometric method and total alkalinity by the color indicator method the total hardness th and calcium were estimated by the ethylene diamine triacetic acid edta titrimetric method and magnesium was estimated by their difference sodium and potassium were analysed using the instrument flame photometer bicarbonate was measured by titration with 0 1 nhcl using color turning method with methyl orange the chloride concentration was analysed by titrimetric argentometric method fluoride ion concentration was estimated by fluoride ion selective electrode coupled to ion analyze atomic absorption photometer the sulphate nitrate and silica ion concentration were estimated by the gravimetric method using the instrument flame photometer all the concentrations are expressed in mg l except ph and ec in µs cm meanwhile the location of each well was taken into the gis environment using arc gis 10 software and the results of each parameter analysed were added to the concerned wells the spatial analysis was carried out for drinking and irrigation water quality mapping in the study area 5 results and discussions 5 1 hydrochemistry of groundwater the graphical representations the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is evaluated by plotting the cation and anions in percent of total meq l in piper s trilinear diagram piper 1953 back facies diagram back 1966 gibb s diagram gibbs 1970 and expanded durov diagram domenico and schwartz 1990 5 1 1 piper s trilinear diagram piper s trilinear diagram plot of the study area fig 3 suggest that groundwater of study area of the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fall in the field 1 and 3 persuasive of a credible that alkaline earth exceeds alkalies weak acids exceeds strong acids respectively whereas carbonate hardness secondary alkalinity exceeds 50 the plot deduce that alkaline and weak acids dominance over the study area and secondary salinity exceeds 50 5 1 2 expanded durov diagram expanded durov diagram fig 4 groundwater samples of the study area fall mostly in the field 1 this provides a distinct classification of the combination of dominant cations and anions it implies ca2 hco3 dominance indicating recharging water in sandstone aquifer rest of samples fall in the field 2 which implies that groundwater is either mg2 dominant or ca2 and mg2 dominant indicating water often associated with dolomite where ca2 and na are important partial ion exchange lloyd and heathcoat 1985 this may be the reason for ca2 and na hydrochemical facies in the groundwater during the pre monsoon period 5 1 3 back facies diagram back facies diagram back 1966 reveals that the majority of groundwater samples of the cations during pre monsoon period fall in the field calcium sodium facies fig 5a whereas the cation facies of post monsoon period are slightly changed from calcium sodium to calcium magnesium facies the anion facies of pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fall in the field of bicarbonate chloride sulphate facies fig 5b 5 1 4 gibb s diagram gibb s diagram gibbs 1970 shows the relationship of the chemical components of waters from their respective aquifer lithologies in relation to three mechanisms i e evaporation dominance rock dominance and precipitation dominance controlling water chemistry the gibb s ratio cl cl hco3 for anion fig 6a and ratio na k na k ca2 for cation fig 6b plotted separately against respective values of tds the pre monsoon and post monsoon samples are fall in the rock dominance area the chemical composition of the ground water is mainly governed by rock dominance which suggest that there by the interaction between the chemistry of the aquifer rocks and groundwater 5 1 5 index of base exchange the ion exchange between the groundwater and its local environment during residence or travel can be inferred from chloro alkaline indices cai the cais have been determined by adopting the following formula proposed by scholler 1965 cai i cl na k cl and cai ii cl na k so4 2 hco3 co3 no3 the cai scan be either positive or negative depending on whether exchange of sodium and potassium is from water with magnesium and calcium in rock about 70 of the samples show the negative index and 30 shows the positive index indicating that there is an exchange between na and k in groundwater with mg2 or ca2 in the rock or soil 5 2 drinking water quality the hydrochemical results were evaluated for the suitability of groundwater for drinking and public health purposes these hydrochemical parameters of groundwater of the study area compared with who 1984 and isi 1991 specifications table 4 the ph values range between 6 5 and 7 9 indicates the water is acidic to slightly alkaline in nature the total dissolved solids tds ranges between 90 and 400mg l within the highest desirable limit indicate the water is suitable for livestock the ca2 and th ca2 plus mg2 10 89mg l and 40 300mg l as compared with who 1984 and isi 1991 more than the highest desirable limit indicating moderately hard to hard water in some area which is permanent nature caused by the dominance of strong acids ta th according to sawyer and mc carthy 1967 classification the groundwater samples of study area falls under soft to hard category table 5 excess concentration of th has no adverse effect however some evidence indicates its role in heart disease and is unsuitable for domestic use interestingly the hardness cannot be removed easily by the boiling of water the chloride sulphate fluoride and nitrate expect one case also within the highest desirable limit the groundwater is suitable for drinking purposes and public health because the th within the maximum permissible limit and other cations and anions within the highest desirable limit 5 2 1 spatial analysis of drinking water quality gis has proven ability of handling large volumes of geospatial data that can be correlated spatially and retrieved for the statistical analysis to produce the desirable output these samples were plotted in the respective samples locations and contours were generated using the interpolation techniques the spatial maps of all the major anion and cation were prepared to known about the spatial distribution of the various elements in the study area the spatial analysis reveals fig 7 that the majority of the study area is within desirable limit whereas a few pockets in some of the elements are above the permissible limit 5 3 irrigation water quality large amount of salts and dissolved ions affect the plant health and reduce the crop productivity it is the quantity of certain ions such as sodium and boron rather than the total salt concentration that affects plant development sahinci 1991 excessive salinity in plants reduces the osmotic activity and thus interferes with the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil saleh et al 1999 in the present study surface water facilities for irrigation is available only some villages along the streams rivers otherwise the groundwater is the main source of irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is affected by the total content of soluble salts and relative proportion of bicarbonate to calcium and magnesium and relative proportion of sodium to calcium the ec and na concentration are important in classifying irrigation water the important characteristic properties of groundwater are used to determine its suitability for irrigation in the present study are 5 3 1 electrical conductivity ec and sodium percentage na the concentration of sodium and ec considerably affect the quality of irrigation water the salts found in the ground water not only affect the growth of plants but also affect soil structure permeability and aeration according to the classification of groundwater for irrigation richards 1954 recognized four groups for the classification of irrigation as a low salinity hazard ec 250μs cm medium salinity hazard 250 750μs cm high salinity hazard 750 2250μs cm and very high salinity hazard 2250 5000μs cm the distribution of ec in the groundwater range from 120 to 670μs cm so the groundwater of the study area is of excellent to good table 7 the sodium percentage doneen 1962 was calculated by using the formula na na k ca 2 mg 2 na k 100 the concentrations of cations are in meq l the sodium percent in water is an important parameter computed to evaluate the suitability for irrigation the excess of sodium combining with carbonate always leads to the formation of alkaline soils whereas the chloride supports the formation of saline soils although either of the soils will not support the growth of crops the groundwater samples of the pre monsoon and post monsoon period plot fig 8 over the wilcox diagram fall in the excellent to good category indicate that groundwater of the study area is excellent quality a gis based salinity hazard map was also prepared interpolation in the gis the salinity hazard map shows regions with low medium and high salinity hazards the majority of the area is covered by groundwater with decent quality fig 9 although a few pockets was found in the northeastern parts of the study area in the sedimentary beds of siwalik group of rocks 5 3 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sodium or alkali hazard in the water use of irrigation purposes expressed by sodium absorption ratio karanth 1987 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 the concentrations are expressed in meq l the calculated values of sar in the study area are very between 0 144 and 0 815 low sodium water s1 can be used for irrigation in almost all soil types as both pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater samples fall in the low sodium s1 category table 6 and indicating no hazard of alkalinity richards 1954 5 3 3 salinity hazard the electrical conductivity ec values of groundwater samples will give the salinity hazard groundwater samples pre monsoon period near about equal fall in the low and medium salinity hazard however the majority of the samples of post monsoon period fall in the medium salinity hazard and a few are falling in the low salinity hazard groundwater samples that fall in the low salinity hazard c1 can be used for irrigation of most crops and the majority of soils groundwater samples that fall in the medium salinity hazard c2 can be used if moderate amount of leaching occurs the salinity hazard table 7 shows that groundwater quality is excellent to good for irrigation purposes the integrated effect of ec and sar values plotted on the united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagram fig 10 in which ec was taken as salinity hazard and sar as sodium or alkali hazard indicates that groundwater samples of pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fall in c1s1 and c2s1 which depicts that the water is low alkali and low to moderate salinity hazard 5 3 4 kelley s ratio the level of sodium measure against calcium and magnesium is known as kelley s ratio based on which irrigation waters are rated according to kelley 1946 and later by paliwal 1967 in the study area kelley s ratio is 1 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods i e na ca2 mg2 1 which indicate that the water is suitable for irrigation purposes 5 3 5 residual sodium carbonate rsc when the sum of carbonate and bicarbonate is in excess over the alkaline earths chiefly calcium and magnesium in excess of permissible limits affects irrigation adversely according to eaton 1950 and richards 1954 rsc co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 meq l based on the rsc value of groundwater samples of the study is within the permissible limit table 8 hence the groundwater of study area is excellent for irrigation purposes 5 3 6 permeability index pi the permeability index was used to classify the quality of the irrigation water based on the formula doneen 1962 pi n a h c o 3 ca 2 mg 2 na 100 the concentrations of cations and anions are in meq l according to the doneen 1962 diagram water can be classified class i class ii and class iii the class i and class ii water are categorized as good for irrigation with 75 or more permeability whereas class iii water categorized as unsuitable with 25 of maximum permeability the majority of groundwater samples of the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fig 11 fall into the class i and class ii indicate that quality of groundwater is good for irrigation purposes although the few samples of the pre monsoon season falls in the class iii falls in the unsuitable category 6 conclusion the water quality is the precarious factor that influences the social industrial and agricultural development of any region moreover the assessment of groundwater water quality is an important aspect of evaluating groundwater pollution due to natural or anthropogenic inputs groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation and domestic purposes were evaluated by various physicochemical and water quality parameters during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons by comparing the results with different water standards groundwater in the western doon valley is acidic to alkaline in nature and shows marginal seasonal changes the results of ground water indicates that the alkaline earths ca2 and mg2 exceeds the alkalies na and k weak acid hco3 exceed the strong acids cl so4 2 no3 and secondary salinity exceeds 50 which is dominated by alkaline earth and weak acid hence the groundwater of the study area shows dominance of calcium magnesium bicarbonate indicating the recharging of water from carbonate present as cementing materials in the sandstone aquifer the ca2 and th ca2 mg2 more than the highest desirable limit indicating moderately hard to very hard water in some areas the gibbs ratio for the anions and cations of the water samples plotted against the relative values of the total dissolved solids point towards rock dominance of the chemistry of groundwater in the region which reflects the influence of the chemistry of aquifer lithology vis a vis groundwater the groundwater is classified as fresh water normal chloride normal sulphate normal carbonate water and moderately hard to hard based on the rsc value of groundwater samples of the study is within the safe limit the classification of irrigation water in relationship to salinity and sodium hazard shows the low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard which indicate that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation purposes the permeability index shows that majority of groundwater samples fall in the class i and class ii and a few samples fall in class iii indicates that the groundwater quality is good for irrigation purpose hence the overall quality of groundwater is suitable for the drinking as well as irrigation purposes although it is also imperative for the sustainable groundwater quality and quantity that special attention should be paid to minimize the excessive withdrawal for water management efficient water quality monitoring program incorporating measurements

12388,considering the finite volume of fresh water resources managing its quality and quantity sustainably is one of the greatest challenges because of complex global changes this work strives to predict the combined effect of urbanization and climate change on water quality in pasig marikina river considering its criticalities to develop proactive plan by policy makers working in water sectors pasig marikina river is an important source of water for different usage viz domestic industrial agriculture and recreation in the national capital region ncr in philippines however stationarity of this river basin is compromised by global changes and human disturbances viz climate change rapid urbanization and weak non structured government policies results in severe pollution makes long section of the river unsuitable for any use in recent past therefore presenting a comprehensive spatio temporal status of river water quality using transdisciplinary framework will be valuable to guide and implement better management policies within governance structure in this study status of water quality of the pasig marikina river was analysed for current and future timescale using population growth land use change wastewater production and treatment scenarios water evaluation and planning weap model was used to model river pollution scenarios using three indicators for aquatic ecosystem health viz biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrate no3 comparison of simulated water quality parameters for the year 2015 and 2030 with 2011 base year clearly indicates that the water quality at 2030 will rapidly deteriorate and will be not suitable for any aquatic life in terms of major of water quality parameters also even current existing master plan for wastewater treatment plants and policies are not sufficient enough for sustainable water resource management within ncr philippines and hence call for immediate and inclusive action graphical

2014 assaf and saadeh 2008 mishra et al 2017 manila capital of the philippines is the top contributor to the national economy metro manila s population is one of the largest in the asia pacific region and in the world according to a world bank study world bank 2015 metro manila is the 3rd largest urban agglomerations in terms of population in east asia excluding china with very high gdp growth at an average rate of 7 and uncoordinated rapid urban expansion inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and the fragile institutional capability of the concerned agencies a huge amount of wastewater is generated causing deterioration of surface water resources the other problem is the rapid change of land development from vegetation into built up areas around the pasig marikina river basin area during the last three decades resulting in exaggeration in water quality deterioration and frequency of extreme weathers so far very few studies have addressed the status of water resources and their management strategies for the near future considering the facts stated above this work intends to assess the current situation and simulated future outlook with regard to pollution in the pasig marikina river basin area and ultimately aims to help formulate sustainable water resource management options for the area 2 study area the metropolitan manila metro manila otherwise known as the national capital region ncr is located at 14 40 n and 121 3 e it is bounded by the manila bay in the west the laguna de bay in the south east the sierra madre mountain range in the east and the fertile plains of central luzon in the north fig 1a located at the mouth of the pasig river metro manila is generally flat with average elevation of about 10 m on its western part five river systems which traverse metro manila are marikina river san juan river parañaque river pasig river and navotas malabon tullahan tenejeros nmtt river pasig river ncr s principal river extends from the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia which is laguna lake laguna de bay located in the south eastern part of metro manila it drains at manila bay in the west virtually bisecting the metropolis horizontally it has a total length of 25 km and ends ina tidal estuary both the marikina and san juan rivers are major tributaries of the pasig river fig 1b metro manila has a total land area of 63 600 ha approximately 0 21 of the country s land area of 30 million hectares based on the 2015 census of population metro manila registered a population of 12 877 253 accounts for about 15 of the national population ncr remains to be the most densely populated region in the country with 186 persons per hectare ncr is more than 60 times denser than at the national level population density changes during ten years between 2000 and 2010 is shown in fig 1c and d metro manila features a tropical wet and dry climate that borders on a tropical monsoon climate like the rest of the philippines it lies entirely within the tropics the average temperature during the cold months of december to february is 26 1 c while that of during the hot months of march to may is 28 8 c it has a distinct though relatively short dry season from january through april and relatively lengthy wet season from may through december with an annual average precipitation 2670 mm pagasa 2011 3 method 3 1 basic information about model and data requirements the weap model is used to simulate future total water demand and water quality variables in 2030 which will be useful for assessing alternative management

for the period spanning 1980 2016 and used for model set up daily average stream flow data from 1984 to 2016 measured at five stations namely napindan bambang bridge nagtahan bridge jones bridge and manila bay at pasig river was utilized to calibrate and validate the weap hydrology module simulation data of important water quality indicators bod no3 and e coli were also collected at seven different locations along the pasig river used for water quality modeling weap model application was developed for the pasig marikina san juan river basin having seven command areas with inter basin transfers hydrologic modeling requires the entire study area to be split into smaller catchments with consideration for confluence points physiographic and climatic characteristics the weap hydrology module computes catchment surface pollutants generated over time by multiplying runoff volume and concentration or intensity of different types of land use during simulation land use information was broadly categorized into three categories viz agricultural forested and built up areas soil data parameters were identified using previous secondary data and literature clemente et al 2001 regarding

used for current and future 2030 climatic condition respectively under the weap hydrology module the soil moisture method is used to estimate the different hydrological parameters for this study this method can simulate different components of the hydrologic cycle including evapotranspiration et surface runoff interflow base flow and deep percolation sieber and purkey 2011 here each catchment is divided into two soil layers an upper soil layer and a lower soil layer which represent shallow water and deep water capacities respectively the upper soil layer is targeted for spatial variation in different types of land use and soil types whereas the lower soil layer is considered to represent groundwater recharge and baseflow processes and its parameters remain the same for the entire catchment different hydrological components are estimated with z 1 and z 2 as the initial relative storage for the upper root zone and lower deep water capacity respectively eqs 1 5 1 et potential

basins to consider influent locations of major tributaries other major considerations are fourteen demand sites and one wastewater treatment plant to accurately represent the current situation of the study area here demand sites denote domestic population and industrial centres defined with their attributes explaining water consumption and wastewater discharge in pasig marikina river wwtp are pollution handling facilities with design specifications including total capacity and removal efficiencies of pollutants in this case an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor usab type of wastewater treatment plant with its pollutant removal efficiency is considered in the modeling because of non availability of precise data the daily volume of domestic wastewater generation is based on an estimated 130 litres of average daily consumption per capita scenario analysis is carried out by defining a time horizon for which alternative wastewater generation and management options are explored which is 2030 in this case the business as usual condition is represented by a reference scenario with selection of all the existing elements as currently active consequently the new upgraded wwtps information taken from local master plan are modeled as scenarios representing deviations from the current conditions reference scenario the baseline year under the current reference scenario in this study is 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation before doing future scenario analysis performance of the weap simulation is justified with significant association between observed and simulated values of hydrological and water quality parameters hydrology module parameters mainly effective precipitation and runoff infiltration were adjusted during simulation in order to reproduce the observed monthly stream flows for the period of year of 2011 2014 in case of hydrology module validation table 1 fig 3 a compares monthly simulated and observed stream flows at jones bridge showing that they largely match for most months with an average error of 7 whereas water quality simulation part is validated by comparing simulated and observed bod concentration at jones bridge location selection of this location and time i e year 2011 was made on the basis of consistent availability of observed water quality data results show a strong relation between these two fig 3b with error of 8 confirming suitability of the model performance in this problem domain 4 2 scenario analyses future simulation for both water quality of selected parameters and total water demand was done for the years 2015 and 2030 while utilising scenarios considering business as usual and involving possible countermeasures to solve water scarcity in future course of time the results for total water demand are shown in fig 4 depicts that yearly water demand for the year 2030 will be around 1 34 billion cubic meters which is roughly 2 5 times greater than that of the year 2000 i e 0 55 billion cubic meters sharp deviation of this increasing trend between year 2007 and 2010 might be explained by rapid migration to metro manila and relatively more construction activities overall this swift growth in water demand encourage different stakeholders to take suitable measures on immediate basis to provide sustainable water management options for future generations for water quality simulation is done using three possible scenarios as shown in table 2 simulation was done for the years 2015 and 2030 using 2011 as reference year with consideration for population increase land use change wastewater generation and its treatment at waste water treatment facilities first business as usual denoted hereafter from s1 where effect of population growth and climate change using miroc5 rcp 8 5 on water quality is observed keeping the capacity of all the existing wastewater treatment plants 65 mld constant by year 2030 second scenario denoted hereafter from s2 here effect of population growth and climate change using miroc5 rcp 8 5 on water quality is observed once existing master plan for increasing wastewater treatment plants 625 mld is implemented along with sewerage collection rate of 85 it means 15 of the sewerage is getting lost as non revenue water because of leakage or other technical issues while for final and third scenario denoted hereafter from s3 all conditions were kept same as second scenario except wastewater collection rate increased to 100 considering ideal situation results for simulated water quality using three parameters namely no3 bod and cod is shown in fig 5 based on the water quality parameters a general trend found here is that water quality deteriorates from upstream to downstream because of the cumulative addition of anthropogenic output also when comparing the current water quality situation of pasig river with desirable water quality standard given by department of environment and natural resources denr for class c i e fishable class i e bod 7 mg l no3 7 mg l it is found that most of the sampling location are not suitable for the use in many sectors more precisely most water samples were safe for aquatic systems in terms of no3 except those taken from the manila bay and jones bridge location the value for bod varies from 30 to 146 mg l clearly indicating that all of the water samples are moderately to extremely polluted with reference bod required value to safe aquatic system i e 7 mg l world health organization 2002 the cod value a commonly used indicator of both organic and inorganic nutrients in water samples increases with the course of time in scenario 1 concentration of water quality got even worse compared to current condition this may be attributed to extreme weather condition coupled with additional amount of wastewater being generated by increasing population and rapid urbanization result from scenario 2 and 3 intends to show the water quality status quo of the river system when current existing master plan for wastewater treatment will be implemented with different collection rate result clearly indicates that after implementing master plan for enhancing the capacity of wastewater treatment facility by 625 mld water quality will improve by many folds which is an encouraging sign average removal achieved after this implementation for bod no3 and cod are 83 7 80 and 91 4 respectively however looking into water quality guidelines by denr many of the location especially along the downstream will not comply with guidelines for class c fishable higher concentration of nitrate indicates the influence from high usage of fertilizers in agricultural activities microbial colonies from faecal matters untreated sewerage input and animal waste however with business as usual water quality will be deteriorating at other locations as well this suggests that current management policies are not enough to keep the pollution level in check within a desirable limit and calls for transdisciplinary research for sustainable water resource management 5 conclusions this research work briefly sketches the trend of water quality and quantity of pasig marikina river system in metro manila strong association between observed and simulated hydrological parameters clearly indicates suitability of weap model for the study area projection for increased water demand encourages different actors involved in water resources management for switching towards different viable options viz water reuse water recycling technical advancement in supply system for minimizing non revenue water loss etc from water quality simulation it is observed that pasig marikina river is polluted with certain degree throughout the stretch of the river and condition getting worse in future course of time with business as usual scenario with enhancing wastewater management infrastructure as represented by scenario 2 3 water quality will improve at most of the segment of the river except at downstream site which mean existing water management plan is not sufficient and is a matter of concern therefore improved regulation of wastewater treatment and sectoral water usage practice

12388,considering the finite volume of fresh water resources managing its quality and quantity sustainably is one of the greatest challenges because of complex global changes this work strives to predict the combined effect of urbanization and climate change on water quality in pasig marikina river considering its criticalities to develop proactive plan by policy makers working in water sectors pasig marikina river is an important source of water for different usage viz domestic industrial agriculture and recreation in the national capital region ncr in philippines however stationarity of this river basin is compromised by global changes and human disturbances viz climate change rapid urbanization and weak non structured government policies results in severe pollution makes long section of the river unsuitable for any use in recent past therefore presenting a comprehensive spatio temporal status of river water quality using transdisciplinary framework will be valuable to guide and implement better management policies within governance structure in this study status of water quality of the pasig marikina river was analysed for current and future timescale using population growth land use change wastewater production and treatment scenarios water evaluation and planning weap model was used to model river pollution scenarios using three indicators for aquatic ecosystem health viz biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrate no3 comparison of simulated water quality parameters for the year 2015 and 2030 with 2011 base year clearly indicates that the water quality at 2030 will rapidly deteriorate and will be not suitable for any aquatic life in terms of major of water quality parameters also even current existing master plan for wastewater treatment plants and policies are not sufficient enough for sustainable water resource management within ncr philippines and hence call for immediate and inclusive action graphical

future for many countries like nepal bangladesh gareth et al 2014 the expected impacts of climate change will further exacerbate the challenges facing planners and providers of such services delivery of sustainable water supply and sanitation services in growing towns and cities remains an issue considering the water stress and scarcity united nations and its associated members unanimously called

2014 assaf and saadeh 2008 mishra et al 2017 manila capital of the philippines is the top contributor to the national economy metro manila s population is one of the largest in the asia pacific region and in the world according to a world bank study world bank 2015 metro manila is the 3rd largest urban agglomerations in terms of population in east asia excluding china with very high gdp growth at an average rate of 7 and uncoordinated rapid urban expansion inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and the fragile institutional capability of the concerned agencies a huge amount of wastewater is generated causing deterioration of surface water resources the other problem is the rapid change of land development from vegetation into built up areas around the pasig marikina river basin area during the last three decades resulting in exaggeration in water quality deterioration and frequency of extreme weathers so far very few studies have addressed the status of water resources and their management strategies for the near future considering the facts stated above this work intends to assess the current situation and simulated future outlook with regard to pollution in the pasig marikina river basin area and ultimately aims to help formulate sustainable water resource management options for the area 2 study area the metropolitan manila metro manila otherwise known as the national capital region ncr is located at 14 40 n and 121 3 e it is bounded by the manila bay in the west the laguna de bay in the south east the sierra madre mountain range in the east and the fertile plains of central luzon in the north fig 1a located at the mouth of the pasig river metro manila is generally flat with average elevation of about 10 m on its western part five river systems which traverse metro manila are marikina river san juan river parañaque river pasig river and navotas malabon tullahan tenejeros nmtt river pasig river ncr s principal river extends from the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia which is laguna lake laguna de bay located in the south eastern part of metro manila it drains at manila bay in the west virtually bisecting the metropolis horizontally it has a total length of 25 km and ends ina tidal estuary both the marikina and san juan rivers are major tributaries of the pasig river fig 1b metro manila has a total land area of 63 600 ha approximately 0 21 of the country s land area of 30 million hectares based on the 2015 census of population metro manila registered a population of 12 877 253 accounts for about 15 of the national population ncr remains to be the most densely populated region in the country with 186 persons per hectare ncr is more than 60 times denser than at the national level population density changes during ten years between 2000 and 2010 is shown in fig 1c and d metro manila features a tropical wet and dry climate that borders on a tropical monsoon climate like the rest of the philippines it lies entirely within the tropics the average temperature during the cold months of december to february is 26 1 c while that of during the hot months of march to may is 28 8 c it has a distinct

information about model and data requirements the weap model is used to simulate future total water demand and water quality variables in 2030 which will be useful for assessing alternative management policies in the pasig marikina river basin water quality modeling requires a wide range of input data including point and non point pollution sources past spatio temporal water quality detail

for the period spanning 1980 2016 and used for model set up daily average stream flow data from 1984 to 2016 measured at five stations namely napindan bambang bridge nagtahan bridge jones bridge and manila bay at pasig river was utilized to calibrate and validate the weap hydrology module simulation data of important water quality indicators bod no3 and e coli were also collected at seven different locations along the pasig river used for water quality modeling weap model application was developed for the pasig marikina san juan river basin having seven command areas with inter basin transfers hydrologic modeling requires the entire study area to be split into smaller catchments with consideration for confluence points physiographic and climatic characteristics the weap hydrology module computes catchment surface pollutants generated over time by multiplying runoff volume and concentration or intensity of different types of land use during simulation land use information was broadly categorized into three categories viz agricultural forested and built up areas soil data parameters were identified using previous secondary data and literature clemente et al 2001 regarding future climatic variables rainfall frequency and intensity statistically downscaled and bias corrected using quantile method general circulation model gcm output at the local level is used for

used for current and future 2030 climatic condition respectively under the weap hydrology module the soil moisture method is used to estimate the different hydrological parameters for this study this method can simulate different components of the hydrologic cycle including evapotranspiration et surface runoff interflow base flow and deep percolation sieber and purkey 2011 here each catchment is divided into two soil layers an upper soil layer and a lower soil layer which represent shallow water and deep water capacities respectively the upper soil layer is targeted for spatial variation in different types of land use and soil types whereas the lower soil layer is considered to represent groundwater recharge and baseflow processes and its parameters remain the same for the entire catchment different hydrological components are estimated with z 1 and z 2 as the initial relative storage for the upper root zone and lower deep water capacity respectively eqs 1 5 1 et potential

basins to consider influent locations of major tributaries other major considerations are fourteen demand sites and one wastewater treatment plant to accurately represent the current situation of the study area here demand sites denote domestic population and industrial centres defined with their attributes explaining water consumption and wastewater discharge in pasig marikina river wwtp are pollution handling facilities with design specifications including total capacity and removal efficiencies of pollutants in this case an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor usab type of wastewater treatment plant with its pollutant removal efficiency is considered in the modeling because of non availability of precise data the daily volume of domestic wastewater generation is based on an estimated 130 litres of average daily consumption per capita scenario analysis is carried out by defining a time horizon for which alternative wastewater generation and management options are explored which is 2030 in this case the business as usual condition is represented by a reference scenario with selection of all the existing elements as currently active consequently the new upgraded wwtps information taken from local master plan are modeled as scenarios representing deviations from the current conditions reference scenario the baseline year under the current reference scenario in this study is 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation before doing future scenario analysis performance of the weap simulation is justified with significant association between observed and simulated values of hydrological and water quality parameters hydrology module parameters mainly effective precipitation and runoff infiltration were adjusted during simulation in order to reproduce the observed monthly stream flows for the period of year of 2011 2014 in case of hydrology module validation table 1 fig 3 a compares monthly simulated and observed stream flows at jones bridge showing that they largely match for most months with an average error of 7 whereas water quality simulation part is validated by comparing simulated and observed bod concentration at jones bridge location selection of this location and time i e year 2011 was made on the basis of consistent availability of observed water quality data results show a strong relation between these two fig 3b with error of 8 confirming suitability of the model performance in this problem domain 4 2 scenario analyses future simulation for both water quality of selected parameters and total water demand was done for the years 2015 and 2030 while utilising scenarios considering business as usual and involving possible countermeasures to solve water scarcity in future course of time the results for total water demand are shown in fig 4 depicts that yearly water demand for the year 2030 will be around 1 34 billion cubic meters which is roughly 2 5 times greater than that of the year 2000 i e 0 55 billion cubic meters sharp deviation of this increasing trend between year 2007 and 2010 might be explained by rapid migration to metro manila and relatively more construction activities overall this swift growth in water demand encourage different stakeholders to take suitable measures on immediate basis to provide sustainable water management options for future generations for water quality simulation is done using three possible scenarios as shown in table 2 simulation was done for the years 2015 and 2030 using 2011 as reference year with consideration for population increase land use change wastewater generation and its treatment at waste water treatment facilities first business as usual denoted hereafter from s1 where effect of population growth and climate change using miroc5 rcp 8 5 on water quality is observed keeping the capacity of all the existing wastewater treatment plants 65 mld constant by year 2030 second scenario denoted hereafter from s2 here effect of population growth and climate change using miroc5 rcp 8 5 on water quality is observed once existing master plan for increasing wastewater treatment plants 625 mld is implemented along with sewerage collection rate of 85 it means 15 of the sewerage is getting lost as non revenue water because of leakage or other technical issues while for final and third scenario denoted hereafter from s3 all conditions were kept same as second scenario except wastewater collection rate increased to 100 considering ideal situation results for simulated water quality using three parameters namely no3 bod and cod is shown in fig 5 based on the water quality parameters a general trend found here is that water quality deteriorates from upstream to downstream because of the cumulative addition of anthropogenic output also when comparing the current water quality situation of pasig river with desirable water quality standard given by department of environment and natural resources denr for class c i e fishable class i e bod 7 mg l no3 7 mg l it is found that most of the sampling location are not suitable for the use in many sectors more precisely most water samples were safe for aquatic systems in terms of no3 except those taken from the manila bay and jones bridge location the value for bod varies from 30 to 146 mg l clearly indicating that all of the water samples are moderately to extremely polluted with reference bod required value to safe aquatic system i e 7 mg l world health organization 2002 the cod value a commonly used indicator of both organic and inorganic nutrients in water samples increases with the course of time in scenario 1 concentration of water quality got even worse compared to current condition this may be attributed to extreme weather condition coupled with additional amount of wastewater being generated by increasing population and rapid urbanization result from scenario 2 and 3 intends to show the water quality status quo of the river system when current existing master plan for wastewater treatment will be implemented with different collection rate result clearly indicates that after implementing master plan for enhancing the capacity of wastewater treatment facility by 625 mld water quality will improve by many folds which is an encouraging sign average removal achieved after this implementation for bod no3 and cod are 83 7 80 and 91 4 respectively however looking into water quality guidelines by denr many of the location especially along the downstream will not comply with guidelines for class c fishable higher concentration of nitrate indicates the influence from high usage of fertilizers in agricultural activities microbial colonies from faecal matters untreated sewerage input and animal waste however with business as usual water quality will be deteriorating at other locations as well this suggests that current management policies are not enough to keep the pollution level in check within a desirable limit and calls for transdisciplinary research for sustainable water resource management 5 conclusions this research work briefly sketches the trend of water quality and quantity of pasig marikina river system in metro manila strong association between observed and simulated hydrological parameters clearly indicates suitability of weap model for the study area projection for increased water demand encourages different actors involved in water resources management for switching towards different viable options viz water reuse water recycling technical advancement in supply system for minimizing non revenue water loss etc from water quality simulation it is observed that pasig marikina river is polluted with certain degree throughout the stretch of the river and condition getting worse in future course of time with business as usual scenario with enhancing wastewater management infrastructure as represented by scenario 2 3 water quality will improve at most of the segment of the river except at downstream site which mean existing water management plan is not sufficient and is a matter of concern therefore improved regulation of wastewater treatment and sectoral water usage practice based on water quality should be put in place to preserve precious water resources the national integrated sewerage and septage management program shall be implemented on priority basis considering various factors like population density and growth global changes for both short and long term measures policy advocacy with regulators to enforce pre treatment for non resident wastewater sources regular monitoring for progress of implementation of master plan is highly recommended proper roadmap for operation and maintenance for infrastructure built up during 2030 will be highly recommended

12389,the aim of this research is to propose a surface water quality index using fuzzy inference system three stations and ten parameters ph tds ca mg na k cl so4 so4 and hco3 are selected from oued el hai basin of algeria to develop the approach the results show that calcium and sulfate are the dominate ions in the three stations tds is strongly and positively correlated with so4 and hco3 from anova test there are no significant differences for all parameters except ca and k in terms of their temporal variation water rock interactions and anthropogenic process are the main factors that are controlling the surface water quality the water quality index is assessed with the fwqi index and the results show that the values of wqi and fwqi have similar characteristics regarding the water

wang 2010 mohemmad et al 2011 tyagi et al 2013 tiri et al 2014 the water quality index wqi is one of the most effective tools by which water quality data are summarized and well presented but the parameters of the water quality index are to be calculated in order to prepare the surface water has drinking water use the gap between wqi parameters and the uncertainty in the quality criteria used and common khan et al 2003 soroush et al 2011 tirkey et al 2016 the limitations of wqis demonstrate the need to develop techniques and more advanced assessment methods which enable the analyst to include and interpret qualitative and quantitative information the methods based on fuzzy inference system fis can combine the advantages of the traditional methods with the advantages provided by the fis in classification schemes fuzziness makes the use of sharp boundaries hard to justify a small increase decrease in pollutant data near its boundary value will change its class many researchers demonstrated that the fuzzy logic method was mainly used to solve problems related to water resources araghinejad 2014 in modeling complex of environmental problems researchers often fail to make precise statements about inputs and outcomes of parameters but fuzzy logic could help to overcome these logical uncertainties fuzzy logic can be considered as a language that allows one to translate sophisticated statements from natural language into a mathematical formalism fuzzy logic can deal with highly variable linguistic vague and uncertain data or knowledge and therefore has the ability to allow a logical reliable and transparent information stream from data collection to data usage in environmental application system fuzzy logic provides a powerful and convenient formalism for classifying environmental conditions and for describing both natural and anthropogenic changes also fuzzy logic can be used to classify and quantify environmental effects of a subjective nature and it even provides a formalism for dealing with missing data lermontov et al 2009 developed a fuzzy wqi fwqi to assess the quality status the results on water quality obtained using the index developed on the basis of fuzzy set theory were found to be more useful than those derived from the water quality index method that is currently used in this study a fuzzy logic system is developed to assess the surface water quality of oued el hai basin at previously selected three stations 2 study area the oued el hai basin is located in the eastern part of northern algeria and lies between northern latitude of 35 7 35 22 and eastern longitudes of 5 33 5 57 fig 1 the study area with an area of approximately 605 km2 is surrounded on the north by the deba mountains and ain touta plain and on the south by the setha mountains haouidja and hachachina and on the west by the metlili mountains and on the east by the ras el kerouch mountains and tououennt the study area extends over the southern slopes of the aures which is characterized by a decreasing rainfall from top to bottom piedmont sahara the precipitation ranged from 34 03 mm september to 5 59 mm july with an annual average of 16 50

the period ranges from january to may 2015 the first station s1 represents the water of oued tilatou and fedhala and covers by marls and limestones of coniacian and santonian the second station s2 represents the mixture between the water of the first station and the water rejected from el kantara city and characterizes by alluvial formation quaternary the third station s3 represents the water of manbaa el ghozlane dam and situates between coniacian santonian miocene and quaternary in this study ten parameters ph total dissolved solid tds calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 were analyzed using standard procedures apha 2005 the water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm pore diameter filters and were preserved using nitric acid the samples were stored in cooling boxes at temperatures below 5 c digital portable water analysis kit model ck 70 century was used for measuring ph and tds volumetric titration was used for analyzing ca mg cl and hco3 the concentrations of ca and mg were estimated by titration using 0 05 medta and those of the bicarbonate and chloride by h2so4 and agno3 titration respectively the concentrations of na and k were measured using a flame photometer sytronics flame photometer 128 while so4 was determined by the turbidimetric method the concentration of no3 was analyzed by colorimetry with a uv visible spectrophotometer using the spectroscan 60 dv model 3 2 water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi for the area was calculated to assess the suitability of surface water for drinking purposes avvannavar and shrihari 2008 hamzaoui azaza et al 2013 saeedi et al 2010 vincy et al 2015 the details of the wqi calculation and its results have been shown in the proceeding sections sahu and sikdar 2008 3 3 fuzzy inference system fis the fuzzy logic formalism has been used to access surface water quality by developing a water quality index based on fuzzy reasoning fuzzy inference is defined as the process of mapping a set of input data sets into a set of output data using an approach based on fuzzy logic and falls into the category of black box models decisions can be made on bases of mapping or patterns discerned the values of hydrochemical parameters of surface water were used in the fuzzy inference system to develop a model for the evaluation of surface water quality the model was evaluated with water quality data set based on mamdani fuzzy inference system mamdani fuzzy model is based on the collections of if then rules with both fuzzy antecedent and consequent parameters and it can be built by using linguistic relationships and observed data mahapatra et al 2011 moreover this model uses excessive number of rules for system modeling in this methodology membership functions of the quality determinants and fuzzy rule bases were defined and then the fuzzy logic toolbox of matlab r2015a package was used 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics of surface water the statistical summaries of hydrochemical parameters for surface water in the three stations are listed in table 1 the ph value ranged from 7 76 to 8 29 with a mean of 8 12 which indicates that the surface water samples are alkaline the mean value of the total dissolved solids tds in the three stations is 1287 1295 and 1220 mg l respectively the coefficient variation of tds is the least in all samples the ionic dominance is in the order of ca mg na k among major cations and so4 hco3 cl no3 among major anions in the three stations respectively fig 2 this indicates that alkaline earth ca mg dominate over alkali na k calcium and sulfate are relatively high in abundance compared with the other major elements in the three stations this may be responsible for the high tds in the surface water samples the concentrations of ca and so4 in the three stations ranged from 70 4 to 283 2 mg l and 288 864 mg l respectively the calcium and magnesium ions present in the surface water are possibly derived from leaching of calcium and magnesium bearing rock forming carbonates gypsum and anhydrides the majority of surface water shows the concentration of calcium and magnesium above the who 2004 who 2008 suggested a maximum permissible limit the high concentration of sulfate may be attributed to contamination of untreated industrial and domestic waste and their effluents baruah et al 2008 jeevanandam et al 2012 belkhiri et al 2012 tiri et al 2014 however the concentration of sulfate is probably derived from the gypsum dissolution process the analysis of variance anova method was performed in order to compare the differences between the three stations for each parameter the results show clearly that there are no significant differences p 0 05 for all parameters in the three stations with the exception of calcium and potassium which presented p 0 05 values table 2 which indicating that the most parameters don t have variation in terms of their temporal variation in the study area the concentration of ca increased from the first station to the third station which means from the upstream to the downstream however the concentration of k decreased from the first to the last station fig 2 4 2 relationships between major ions in order to understand the possible origin of each major element involved in surface water chemical interaction and geochemical process which controls the chemistry of surface water some relationships between different parameters are presented in this study a taylor diagram taylor 2001 provides a concise statistical summary of how parameters in the surface water match each other in terms of their correlation based on the nine parameters ph ca mg na k cl so4 hco3 and no3 and total dissolved solids tds a taylor diagram is constructed and is shown in fig 3 tds is strongly and positively correlated with sulfate and bicarbonate sulfate is the dominant anion followed by bicarbonate in the three stations the sources of these ions are may be derived from the lithological sources and likely to form from agricultural and anthropogenic activities the relationship between ca and hco3 are plotted in order to identify the source of ca and hco3 in the surface water fig 4a calcium originates from the weathering of carbonates silicates and evaporites while bicarbonate from carbonates and silicates if the weathering is by carbonic acid hco3 ca ratio should above 1 1 1 line for calcite weathering and below 2 2 1 line for dolomite weathering most of the samples in the three stations are plotted along the 1 1 line indicating the calcite weathering is dominant process in the study area however the other samples are plotted between the 1 1 line and 2 1 line indicating both calcite and dolomite contribute the hydrogeochemical evolution in surface water fig 4a further it is evident from the relationship between ca mg and hco3 fig 4b that the carbonate weathering is more important than the silicate weathering in controlling the surface water quality panigrahy and raymahashay 2005 gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 is used to illustrate the natural mechanism controlling surface water chemistry including the rainfall dominance rock weathering dominance and evaporation and participation dominance gibbs ratio is calculated using the following equations eqs 1 2 1 g i b b s ratio i for anion c l c l h c o 3 2 g i b b s ratio ii for cation n a k n a k c a 2 based on the gibbs diagram the chemistry of all the samples belonging to station 2 and around 80 and 60 of samples from station 3 and station 1 respectively were controlled by the evaporationprecipitation dominance field fig 5 it seems that evaporation was the secondary factor that mostly control the surface water chemistry especially in the downstream where the stations 2 and 1 were situated 4 3 water quality index wqi computation the water quality index wqi was calculated for evaluating the influence of natural and anthropogenic activities based on several key parameters on surface water chemistry to calculate the wqi the weight was assigned to the physicochemical parameters according to the parameters relative importance in the overall quality of water for drinking water purposes a multi level computational process is needed for wqi evaluation in the first step the parameters were weighted from a human consumption point of view the weights according to the world health organization standards who 2004 are presented in table 3 later the relative weight w i of each parameter was computed as follows 3 w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters the next stage was quality rating scale q i calculated as follows 4 q i c i s i 100

however all water samples in the last station represent poor water quality the samples of the third station exhibit poor water for drinking purposes in greater percentage 100 when compared with the first and second station 60 this may be due to effective leaching of ions over exploitation of surface water direct discharge of effluents and agricultural impact 4 4 fuzzy inference system fis in order to construct the fuzzy inference model ten hydrochemical parameters ph tds ca mg na k cl so4 hco3 and no3 were used as the input parameters and four fuzzy models fiss were used fig 7 the first fuzzy model fis1 has two input parameters ph and tds 15 rules and one output fwqi1 the second model fis2 has four input parameters ca mg na and k whereas the third model fis3 has also four input

forth model called fuzzy water quality index fwqi and consists of 125 rules in this application centroid method is used to defuzzify outputs fuzzy membership functions constructed for all inputs and outputs are either triangular or trapezoidal the minimum values for all parameters are considered as zero except ph in the same way the maximum value is selected for each parameter on the basis of permissible limits by word health organization who 2004 tables 3 4 the water quality in the study area was with the fwqi index the results of the four models fis1 fis2 fis3 and fwqi are summarized in 3d plots as shown in figs 8 12 fig 8 shows clearly that as tds increases the fis1 also increases fig 9 shows that when the concentrations of ca or mg increases the fis2 values also in sources the results of the third model fis3 are summarized in the fig 10 and showed clearly that the concentrations of major anions especially the concentrations of sulfate increase the values of fis3 also increase these three models demonstrated clearly the influence of some elements on the surface water quality especially ca mg and so4 fig 11 shows clearly when the values of fis1 fis2 and fis3 increase the values of the fuzzy water quality index fwqi also increase in this case the highest values of fwq index indicate poor water quality in the study area and vice versa 4 5 model validation the results of comparison between the fwqi and the actual wqi index for each station of the oued el hai basin are illustrated in fig 12 as can be seen in fig 12 both indices showed some similarities regarding to water pollution the fwqi and wqi have a correlation coefficient of 0 99 0 88 and 0 91 in the three stations table 5 respectively demonstrating the sound applicability of the index to investigate whether there is a significant difference between the mean from the values of wqi and fwqi in three stations a z test for the means are employed in the analysis table 5 introduces basic statistical properties of wqi and fwqi in the three stations since calculated z values zcal related to means are between z critical table values 1 96 for two tailed at a 5 significance level the zcal values indicate that there is no significant difference between the mean values of wqi and fwqi in three stations therefore the results indicate that the fwqi values preserve the basic statistical properties of the wqi values 5 conclusion a fuzzy inference system is developed to assess the surface water quality the data collected for oued el hai of batna is utilized to develop the approach calcium and sulfate are relatively high in abundance compared with the other ions in the three stations taylor diagram shows that tds is strongly and positively correlated with sulfate and bicarbonate the results of anova test show clearly that there are no significant differences p level 0 05 for all parameters except ca and k water rock interactions and anthropogenic process are the main factors that are controlling the surface water quality in the study area the calculation of wqi shows that 60 of surface samples in the first and the second station and 100 water samples in the last station

water is an essential factor for the whole life and the human survival and having an important role for both drinking as well economic sectors therefore protecting this source against any pollution has become necessary witek and jarosiewicz 2009 reza and singh 2010 sojobi 2016 in the last century the availability and quality of surface or ground waters have been changing mainly due to urbanization industrialization etc the water quality can be assessed using physico chemical parameters the harmful limits of those for human health being established at international or national scale who 2004 the best way to express the quality of water resources for consumption is the water quality index wqi using the water quality data being useful for the modification of the policies yang and wang 2010 mohemmad et al 2011 tyagi et al 2013 tiri et al 2014 the water quality index wqi is one of the most effective tools by which water quality data are summarized and well presented but the parameters of the water quality index are to be calculated in order to prepare the surface water has drinking water use the gap between wqi parameters and the uncertainty in the quality criteria used and common khan et al 2003 soroush et al 2011 tirkey et al 2016 the limitations of wqis demonstrate the need to develop techniques and more advanced assessment methods which enable the analyst to include and interpret qualitative and quantitative information the methods based on fuzzy inference system fis can combine the advantages of the traditional methods with the advantages provided by the fis in classification schemes fuzziness makes the use of sharp boundaries hard to justify a small increase decrease in pollutant data near its boundary value will change its class many researchers demonstrated that the fuzzy logic method was mainly used to solve problems related to water resources araghinejad 2014 in modeling complex of environmental problems researchers often fail to make precise statements about inputs and outcomes of parameters but fuzzy logic could help to overcome these logical uncertainties fuzzy logic can be considered as a language that allows one to translate sophisticated statements from natural language into a mathematical formalism fuzzy logic can deal with highly variable linguistic vague and uncertain data or knowledge and therefore has the ability to allow a logical reliable and transparent information stream from data collection to data usage in environmental application system fuzzy logic provides a powerful and convenient formalism for classifying environmental conditions and for describing both natural and anthropogenic changes also fuzzy logic can be used to classify and quantify environmental effects of a subjective nature and it even provides a formalism for dealing with missing data lermontov et al 2009 developed a fuzzy wqi fwqi to assess the quality status the results on water quality obtained using the index developed on the basis of fuzzy set theory were found to be more useful than those derived from the water quality index method that is currently used in this study a fuzzy logic system is developed to assess the surface water quality of oued el hai basin at previously selected three stations 2 study area the oued el hai basin is located in the eastern part of northern algeria and lies between northern latitude of 35 7 35 22 and eastern longitudes of 5 33 5 57 fig 1 the study area with an area of approximately 605 km2 is surrounded on the north by the deba mountains and ain touta plain and on the south by the setha mountains haouidja and hachachina and on the west by the metlili mountains and on the east by the ras el kerouch mountains and tououennt the study area extends over the southern slopes of the aures which is characterized by a decreasing rainfall from top to bottom piedmont sahara the precipitation ranged from 34 03 mm september to 5 59 mm july with an annual average of 16 50 mm the fall season is the wettest 32 11 the percentages of rainfall during the autumn and spring are close to 32 with an average percentage of 25 37 in winter finally the summer is characterized by a remarkable drought 10 54 august and july are the hottest months and january is the coldest the thermal amplitude between the extreme temperatures can reach 10 c and even more on a daily scale four periods are observed in the study area including cretaceous paleogene neogene and quaternary lafïte 1939 the first period is defined by cenomanian turonian and coniacian santonian and characterized by the dolomites limestones marl limestones and marls the second period is occupied by paleocene londinian and lutetian and constructed by the white marls massive limestones limestones with gypsum and marls the third period is represented by miocene and constructed by the limestones marls sandstones and sands the last period is represented by the detrital formations such as conglomerates sands gravels silt pebbles alluvium and dunes 3 methodology 3 1 sampling analysis in the current study three stations are selected in order to evaluate the surface water quality of oued el hai basin during the period ranges from january to may 2015 the first station s1 represents the water of oued tilatou and fedhala and covers by marls and limestones of coniacian and santonian the second station s2 represents the mixture between the water of the first station and the water rejected from el kantara city and characterizes by alluvial formation quaternary the third station s3 represents the water of manbaa el ghozlane dam and situates between coniacian santonian miocene and quaternary in this study ten parameters ph total dissolved solid tds calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 were analyzed using standard procedures apha 2005 the water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm pore diameter filters and were preserved using nitric acid the samples were stored in cooling boxes at temperatures below 5 c digital portable water analysis kit model ck 70 century was used for measuring ph and tds volumetric titration was used for analyzing ca mg cl and hco3 the concentrations of ca and mg were estimated by titration using 0 05 medta and those of the bicarbonate and chloride by h2so4 and agno3 titration respectively the concentrations of na and k were measured using a flame photometer sytronics flame photometer 128 while so4 was determined by the turbidimetric method the concentration of no3 was analyzed by colorimetry with a uv visible spectrophotometer using the spectroscan 60 dv model 3 2 water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi for the area was calculated to assess the suitability of surface water for drinking purposes avvannavar and shrihari 2008 hamzaoui azaza et al 2013 saeedi et al 2010 vincy et al 2015 the details of the wqi calculation and its results have been shown in the proceeding sections sahu and sikdar 2008 3 3 fuzzy inference system fis the fuzzy logic formalism has been used to access surface water quality by developing a water quality index based on fuzzy reasoning fuzzy inference is defined as the process of mapping a set of input data sets into a set of output data using an approach based on fuzzy logic and falls into the category of black box models decisions can be made on bases of mapping or patterns discerned the values of hydrochemical parameters of surface water were used in the fuzzy inference system to develop a model for the evaluation of surface water quality the model was evaluated with water quality data set based on mamdani fuzzy inference system mamdani fuzzy model is based on the collections of if then rules with both fuzzy antecedent and consequent parameters and it can be built by using linguistic relationships and observed data mahapatra et al 2011 moreover this model uses excessive number of rules for system modeling in this methodology membership functions of the quality determinants and fuzzy rule bases were defined and then the fuzzy logic toolbox of matlab r2015a package was used 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics of surface water the statistical summaries of hydrochemical parameters for surface water in the three stations are listed in table 1 the ph value ranged from 7 76 to 8 29 with a mean of 8 12 which indicates that the surface water samples are alkaline the mean value of the total dissolved solids tds in the three stations is 1287 1295 and 1220 mg l respectively the coefficient variation of tds is the least in all samples the ionic dominance is in the order of ca mg na k among major cations and so4 hco3 cl no3 among major anions in the three stations respectively fig 2 this indicates that alkaline earth ca mg dominate over alkali na k calcium and sulfate are relatively high in abundance compared with the other major elements in the three stations this may be responsible for the high tds in the surface water samples the concentrations of ca and so4 in the three stations ranged from 70 4 to 283 2 mg l and 288 864 mg l respectively the calcium and magnesium ions present in the surface water are possibly derived from leaching of calcium and magnesium bearing rock forming carbonates gypsum and anhydrides the majority of surface water shows the concentration of calcium and magnesium above the who 2004 who 2008 suggested a maximum permissible limit the high concentration of sulfate may be attributed to contamination of untreated industrial and domestic waste and their effluents baruah et al 2008 jeevanandam et al 2012 belkhiri et al 2012 tiri et al 2014 however the concentration of sulfate is probably derived from the gypsum dissolution process the analysis of variance anova method was performed in order to compare the differences between the three stations for each parameter the results show clearly that there are no significant differences p 0 05 for all parameters in the three stations with the exception of calcium and potassium which presented p 0 05 values table 2 which indicating that the most parameters don t have variation in terms of their temporal variation in the study area the concentration of ca increased from the first station to the third station which means from the upstream to the downstream however the concentration of k decreased from the first to the last station fig 2 4 2 relationships between major ions in order to understand the possible origin of each major element involved in surface water chemical interaction and geochemical process which controls the chemistry of surface water some relationships between different parameters are presented in this study a taylor diagram taylor 2001 provides a concise statistical summary of how parameters in the surface water match each other in terms of their correlation based on the nine parameters ph ca mg na k cl so4 hco3 and no3 and total dissolved solids tds a taylor diagram is constructed and is shown in fig 3 tds is strongly and positively correlated with sulfate and bicarbonate sulfate is the dominant anion followed by bicarbonate in the three stations the sources of these ions are may be derived from the lithological sources and likely to form from agricultural and anthropogenic activities the relationship between ca and hco3 are plotted in order to identify the source of ca and hco3 in the surface water fig 4a calcium originates from the weathering of carbonates silicates and evaporites while bicarbonate from carbonates and silicates if the weathering is by carbonic acid hco3 ca ratio should above 1 1 1 line for calcite weathering and below 2 2 1 line for dolomite weathering most of the samples in the three stations are plotted along the 1 1 line indicating the calcite weathering is dominant process in the study area however the other samples are plotted between the 1 1 line and 2 1 line indicating both calcite and dolomite contribute the hydrogeochemical evolution in surface water fig 4a further it is evident from the relationship between ca mg and hco3 fig 4b that the carbonate weathering is more important than the silicate weathering in controlling the surface water quality panigrahy and raymahashay 2005 gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 is used to illustrate the natural mechanism controlling surface water chemistry including the rainfall dominance rock weathering dominance and evaporation and participation dominance gibbs ratio is calculated using the following equations eqs 1 2 1 g i b b s ratio i for anion c l c l h c o 3 2 g i b b s ratio ii for cation n a k n a k c a 2 based on the gibbs diagram the chemistry of all the samples belonging to station 2 and around 80 and 60 of samples from station 3 and station 1 respectively were controlled by the evaporationprecipitation dominance field fig 5 it seems that evaporation was the secondary factor that mostly control the surface water chemistry especially in the downstream where the stations 2 and 1 were situated 4 3 water quality index wqi computation the water quality index wqi was calculated for evaluating the influence of natural and anthropogenic activities based on several key parameters on surface water chemistry to calculate the wqi the weight was assigned to the physicochemical parameters according to the parameters relative importance in the overall quality of water for drinking water purposes a multi level computational process is needed for wqi evaluation in the first step the parameters were weighted from a human consumption point of view the weights according to the world health organization standards who 2004 are presented in table 3 later the relative weight w i of each parameter was computed as follows 3 w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters the next stage was quality rating scale q i calculated as follows 4 q i c i s i 100 where c i is the concentration of each chemical parameter in each water sample in milligrammes per litre and s i is the who standard for each chemical parameter finally wqi was evaluated according to eq 5 as follows 5 w q i i 1 n w i q i wqi classifies the water samples within five classes table 4 calculation of wqi for individual samples is represented in fig 6 the computed wqi values range from 73 to 150 91 142 and 116 140 for station 1 station 2 and station 3 respectively in the first and second station 60 of surface samples represent poor water quality and 40 shows good water quality however all water samples in the last station represent poor water quality the samples of the third station exhibit poor water for drinking purposes in greater percentage 100 when compared with the first and second station 60 this may be due to effective leaching of ions over exploitation of surface water direct discharge of effluents and agricultural impact 4 4 fuzzy inference system fis in
