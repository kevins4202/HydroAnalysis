21615,with the increasing activities in waters the maritime management departments have a strong demand on improving traffic service to enhance the safety of water transportation therefore the quantitative expression of marine traffic situation mts has attracted numerous attention from numerous scholars at present there is no macro index to indicate the complexity of mts this work proposed the marine traffic complexity inspired by the theories of complex network and network dynamics the ship was regarded as the vertex the relationship between the ships is seen as the edge and then the marine traffic situation complex network mtscn was established moreover the topological characteristics such as degree vertex strength clustering coefficient and network structure entropy were used to statistically characterize the evolution of marine traffic system the scenario analysis based on real traffic data was introduced to reveal the variation of mts where the scale free characteristics and inhomogeneity of the mtscn were found the results show that the complex network can provide an intuitionistic and accessible metric to reflect the essence of marine traffic flow which plays an important role in understanding the marine traffic system managing and controlling the marine traffic safety in the future keywords marine traffic management marine traffic situation complex network topological characteristic scale free homogeneity 1 introduction mts is composed of static dynamic informative and organizational elements such as human ship and navigation environment the mts consists of the macro and micro traffic behaviors and their evolution of the marine traffic objects ships in the system under the constraints of traffic environment and traffic management rules reflecting the operation state and development trend of marine traffic system the quantitative expression of situation provides an effective method for intelligent analysis to understand the complexity and operation characteristics of marine traffic system from 2004 all vessels over 299 gt are required to install automatic identification system ais transponder on board based on the regulations from international maritime organization imo subsequently the ais has been widely used in ship navigation collision avoidance and so on mou et al 2010 zissis et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 with the increasing number of ships equipped with ais it emerges a new research focus that using ais data for the research of marine traffic flow recently the navigation environment is becoming more and more complex with the increasing volume of marine traffic this also increases the requirements and challenges for traffic operators and ship operators under a low complexity situation the ship operators have enough time to resolve conflicts and can minimize the disturbance under the premise of navigation safety on the contrary under a high complexity situation ship operators might ignore or underestimate some potential conflicts therefore it is urgent to understand the essence of marine traffic when two or more ships are approaching each other traffic operations and ship operators can take the corresponding solutions immediately hence it is important to descript the relation and the difficulties brought by marine traffic flow complexity to controllers and ship operators wen et al 2015 the characterization of marine traffic based on traffic flow complexity is the core of situation awareness sa more ships and closer distance between them cause greater pressure for ship operators so the traffic density is the most intuitionistic indicator reflecting marine traffic complexity liu et al 2020a b besides the traffic density the other traffic flow characteristics include ship speed course and the proportion of ship trajectory hou et al 2014 kang et al 2018 li et al 2018 with the installation of equipment such as radar ais etc it is easier to obtain the traffic flow information however the massive data of traffic flow are not enough to help controllers or seaman understand the current traffic situation in some cases data redundancy leads to the wrong decisions made by maritime controllers or seamen thus some researchers focus on finding the relationship between the traffic flow characteristics and mts by traffic statistics the average speed quantity of traffic flow traffic distribution types of ship etc are treated as the basic features of the traffic system wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2019 altan and otay 2017 huang et al 2019a some researchers focus on the relationship between statistical parameters of traffic flow and traffic situation showing the long term traffic situation balmat et al 2009 weng et al 2012 yang et al 2017 some other scholars build the simulation models based on historical data to study traffic situation goerlandt and kujala 2011 goerlandt et al 2012 huang et al 2013 recently some researchers use the machine learning for situational awareness bomberger et al 2007 rhodes et al 2007 riveiro et al 2008 simsir and ertugrul 2009 xiao et al 2017 yigit and emre 2018 liu et al 2020a b they do not pay attention to the real time traffic status therefore the complexity of mts should be studied from the perspective of complex systems with the developed mathematical description of traffic system the factors of traffic density and traffic conflict are used to describe the relationship between two ships wen et al 2015 however in the complex traffic systems along with the increase ships and the decreasing ship distance the complexity of multi ship is increasing with non linear relationship it is unreasonable to superimpose the complexities of all ships in addition among many studies on collision avoidance of ships the core issue is still the perception and understanding of the current situation a framework for maritime risk informed cas collision alert system was presented in 2015 and the researchers described collision avoidance of ships from the perspective of risk goerlandt and montewka 2015 szlapczynski 2011 suggested a new approach to collision avoidance by evolutionary algorithms he tried to find optimal sets of safe trajectories in multi ship encounter situations hornauer 2013 and hornauer et al 2015 proposed a decentralized trajectory optimization algorithm to avoid collision between ships that are partly cooperating with each other huang et al 2019b and huang and van gelder 2020 proposed time varying risk tcr measurement and the approach can be used as an intuitively understandable tool for collision avoidance in encounter situations estimating the intention of the give way ship also helps collision alert by improve stand on ship s situational awareness du et al 2020 the above research studies the complexity of mts from different perspectives traffic flow characteristics simulation and machine learning these studies in the field of mts have achieved remarkable results however most researchers ignored the between ship proximity from the perspective of structure and most of the related studies failed to obtain the global index in multi vessel situation in fact the structure of marine traffic provides a lot of information among two or more ships at different moments the marine traffic system shows different structures so we hope to use complex network to solve this problem in this paper proposed a network method which able to describe the mts not only between two vessels but also among multi vessel previously the complex network method was seldom used in the study of mts but a lot of research has been done in air traffic situation from the perspective of complex network include multi layered network network evolution and network robustness and so on du et al 2016 lordan et al 2015 liu et al 2012 xia et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 in order to research the structure of marine traffic the complex network theory was introduced to describe the marine traffic complexity establishing the weighted network models corresponding to traffic status at different points in time from a systematic perspective the structural properties of marine traffic were investigated based on ais data the contributions of the work are as follows first the proposed concept of mts structure provides a new approach to describe the marine traffic complexity from the cognitive perspective secondly the marine traffic is extracted into a complex network to analyze the topological characteristics based on the complex network the dynamic changes of complex network reflect the complexity of mts and its evolution process and the scale free characteristics and homogeneity are discovered in mtscn the rest of the work is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the research methodology include complex network theory and weighted the complex network model of mts section 3 calibrates the analysis of topological characteristics in the weighted mtscn moreover we analyze the mtscn from vertex strength connection rate and network structure entropy in section 4 the conclusions are addressed 2 research methodology the logic framework for the mts analyses is depicted in fig 1 it consists of the three components ais data preparation construction of complex network and mts complexity analysis 2 1 data preparation ais data is received as a series of messages following a nonstandard pattern of irregular time intervals and there are many bad data in ais data so the pre processing is to clean the data and remove errors sang et al 2015 during collection transmission and reception ais data are not immune to errors occurring thus ais data must be processed to eliminate the possible noises furthermore ais data are sent at the different times randomly and ais data should be interpolated firstly the algorithm proposed by sang et al 2015 is used to cleanse the ais data the data of ship position abnormality speed abnormality and course abnormality in experimental data set were removed then the ais data in research area were interpolated per second by linear interpolation method as shown in table 1 a small portion of ais data in database includes mmsi time latitude longitude speed and course 2 2 construction of complex network 2 2 1 the node of mtscn complex networks can describe the complex problems in natural science social science management science and engineering technology it takes the mathematics statistical physics computer science and other sciences as analysis tools and the complex systems as research objectives complex network is a method for extraction and description of complex systems which highlights the topological characteristics of system structures ducruet and zaidi 2012 zanin 2014 yan et al 2017 in real life complex systems can be described by the complex networks such as communication networks social networks and transport networks generally any complex system containing abundant component units can be regarded as a complex network when the component units are interrelated complex network is a research object based on graph theories a graph g is the ordered pair v g e g consisting of a node set v g and edge set e g disjoint from v g of edges together with an incidence function ψ g that associates with each edge of g an unordered pair of not necessarily distinct vertices of g if e is an edge u and v are vertices such that ψ g e u v then e joins u and v and the vertices u and v are the ends of e we denote the numbers of vertices and edges in g by v g and e g which are called the order and size of g respectively essentially a marine traffic system is a complex system from the perspective of complex networks with ships regarded as nodes the work expressed the relationship between ships as undirected edge and then established a corresponding complex network describing marine traffic with the movement of ships the mtscn constantly changed therefore the dynamic change of network parameters reflects the change of mts complexity in an area 2 2 2 the edge of mtscn as a complex system the structure of marine traffic as well as the complex relationship within the system has always been the focus in many cases traffic controllers need to perceive the traffic situation in an area therefore it is necessary to express the macro situation of marine traffic in an area from the supervision perspective the macro situation of marine traffic describes the operation state of marine traffic system at macro level reflecting the overall condition and evolution trend of the behavior characteristics and interaction of elements in marine traffic system the convergence divergence relationship between ships is judged by calculating the approaching rate when the complex network of mts is constructed it is to determine whether the two ships are connected or not the approaching rate reflects the approaching effect of ships from time dimension the degrees of convergence and divergence of ships are defined as the approaching rates between ships which is expressed by the projection of the relative velocities of two ships at relative distances 1 r i j d i j v i j d i j v i j cos d i j v i j in eq 1 d i j v i j are the relative distance and speed of a pair of ship respectively fig 2 shows the construction process of mtscn if the approaching rate is greater than or equal to 0 it means that the two ships are sailing in parallel or in a divergence trend in such cases the relationship between the two ships is not considered and there is no connection between the two ships if the approaching rate is less than 0 it indicates that there is a convergence trend between ships at this time the complexity between two ships is calculated as the weight of the edges in the mtscn 2 2 3 the weight of mtscn in our previous studies on the complexity of marine traffic flow velocity course and position of ships are important parameters affecting the marine traffic complexity and the complexity between ships can be calculated by them in the complexity model ship is the basic unit and the traffic density factor and traffic conflict factor are selected to calculate the complexity between two ships in this study the method of calculating the complexity of marine traffic flow in our previous study was used to calculate the complexity between two ships wen et al 2015 the complexity between a pair of ship is set as the edge weight the calculation formula of complexity is as follows 2 c o m p l e x i t y i j d i j v i j θ i j d e n i j d i j c o n f i j d i j v i j θ i j in eq 2 d i j is the relative distance of a pair wise ships v i j is the relative speed of a pair of ship θ i j is the track crossing angle between a pair of ship fig 3 shows three mts with different structures the red in the web version node represents ship edge the relationship between ships w is the edge weight in fig 3 a three ships under the situation shows a disperse trend so they do not influence each other in fig 3 b three ships show a converge trend all ships influence each other at this time the situation is more complex as shown in fig 3 c there are only two ships in a converge trend to which controllers should pay more attention the between ship complexity in fig 3 c is relatively low although there is the same distance between ships and the same density in the three traffic situations in fig 3 the complexity for controller and mariner differs in the current study the analysis of structure in traffic situation is highly deficient 2 3 complexity of mts in this study we use the topological characteristics of complex network to reflect the complexity of mts degree vertex strength degree distribution clustering coefficient and structure entropy are chosen for mts complexity analysis 1 degree and vertex strength two concepts are introduced degree and vertex strength degree is a very important parameter in complex networks the number of nodes in a network is represented by n and the degree of node n i is the number of edges connected to node n i in the mtscn the degree of nodes represents the number of ships associated with a ship the larger nodal degree means more ships having close relationship with the vessel which causes the larger possibility of conflicts in this paper node degree is represented by k fig 3 c is a typical scenario ships 2 and 3 are convergent and ship 1 is on the contrary thus in fig 3 c k1 0 and k2 k3 0 in the complex network theory the vertex strength is defined as the sum of edge weights associated with a node edges are weighted in the complex network a concept corresponding to the weight of edges is the vertex strength it is a generalization of node degree in unweight networks it can be defined as following 3 s i j n i w i j where s i is the vertex strength of node i w i j the weight of the edge between nodes n i and n j n i is the set of adjacent points of node i 2 degree distribution in complex network the node degree k i is the number of connections it has to other nodes the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network degree distribution can reflect a lot of information from the perspective of network structure it can be defined as following 4 p n k i n where p i is the probability that the node degree is i in the network n k i is the number of node that node degree is i n is the number of node in complex network 3 clustering coefficient the definition of clustering coefficient is as follows 5 c i e i c k i 2 where c i is the clustering coefficient of node v i e i is the actual number of edges in v i s k i neighbor nodes c k i 2 is the number of all possible edges 4 structure entropy the importance of each node is different which reflects the mtscn is non homogeneous in the mtscn the importance of nodes is defined as 6 i i k i j 1 n k j without considering k 0 the network structure entropy is defined as 7 e i 1 n i i ln i i 3 complex network analysis in actual scenarios 3 1 research data zhenjiang dagang section is one of the busiest waters in the yangtze river and a large number of ferries make the traffic environment of the water be very complex so taking the zhenjiang dagang section of the yangtze river as the research area the work selected the ship ais data on 13 june 2018 in observed area to analyze the mtscn because the update time of marine radar data is 6 12 min 6min 9min and 12min was chosen for observation traffic separation scheme was adopted in zhenjiang dagang section of the yangtze river in order to analyze the differences of situation between upstream and downstream traffic the waters of zhenjiang dagagn were divided into the upstream and downstream areas the location of observed areas is shown in table 2 8 a a r e a 1 a r e a 2 area 1 is the upstream area and area 2 the downstream area see fig 4 fig 5 shows the change of traffic volume in two areas in different observation time ship speed distribution in areas 1 and 2 is shown in fig 6 the traffic volume in area 1 is obviously more than that in area 2 however ship speed in area1 is less than that in area2 therefore it is necessary to analyze the traffic situation of the two areas 3 2 complexity measurement in mtscn an index was proposed to describe the complexity of mts based on the topological characteristics of complex network the complexity was defined as the sum of vertex strength of all nodes in a mtscn and reflected the average number of conflicts of nodes in the network in most studies the complexity of mts is defined as the number of ship in unit area and the larger number indicates the higher complexity although the method is simple and applicable it cannot differentiate the mts with the same number of ships the concrete calculating methods are as follows 9 u i s i k i 10 m i 1 n u i where s i is the vertex strength of node n i and w i j is the weight of the edge between node n i and n j u i is the weight of node n i m is the sum of all nodes vertex strength reflect the macro situation value in an area in the complexity of mts in specified area was evaluated using the sum of unit weight of all nodes in a mtscn reflecting the average number of conflicts of nodes in the network in marine traffic the larger number of ships indicates the smaller average distance between ships and the higher conflict probability fig 7 shows the curve of the situation complexity with time in different observation time in fig 7 the situation complexity in area 1 is obviously higher than that in area 2 in fig 5 the traffic volume in area 1 is obviously more than that in area 2 there is similar change trend for the complexity of mts in the two areas and the traffic volume which can reflect the relationship between them in general the complexity of mts increases with the number of ships which proves the calculation model in the work however there are differences between traffic situation complexity and traffic volume in some cases the influence of the number of ships on the complexity of mts is different and the situation complexity and traffic volume are not necessarily positively correlated fig 8 shows the relation between situation complexity and traffic volume in different observation time 3 3 scale free characteristics in mts from the 9th to 12th time slice in fig 8 a four representative scenarios in area 1 are selected to validate the proposed model as shown in fig 9 in four scenarios the number of ships in area 1 at the 11th time slice is the largest with the largest corresponding situation complexity however at the 10th time slice the number of ship is the smallest and the complexity of mts is not moreover the number of ships at the 8th time slice is equal to that at the 12th but the corresponding traffic situation is different we analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of complex network fig 10 shows the mtscn corresponding to the four scenarios in fig 10 the number of complex network edges is not positively correlated with the number of ships but positively correlated with the complexity all nodes vertex strength of mts this indicates that the potential conflict of ships affects the mts as well as the number of ships fig 11 shows the degree distribution in four actual scenarios in area 1 when the situation complexity is low the degree distribution of the network is in the power law distribution see fig 11 a and d this is because when the complexity of the area is low most of the ships have fewer conflicts and only a few ships are crucial these crucial ships are the key nodes in the mtscn while other ships are peripheral nodes when the situation complexity is high the mtscn has a uniform degree distribution see fig 11 b and c for the same reason when the complexity of mts increases most ships are caught in a complex conflict situation and the degree distribution of the complex network is more uniform thus it can be seen when the complexity increases the structure of mtscn will be converted from scale free network to uniform network similarly the distribution of vertex strength in fig 12 has the same trend with degree distribution four scenarios were analyzed to verify the rationality of the proposed model the results of the work are in line with the actual situation it can be concluded that traffic volume only represents the number of ships in specific area rather than the relationship between ships the macro situation complexity model reflects the dynamic variation of complexity of mts sensitively and provides the theoretical support for marine traffic management 3 4 homogeneity of mts in the marine traffic system sometime the density of ship is high in an area so the probability of conflict is high some ships are in low traffic density area and the probability of conflict is low in the short term in other words different ships have different impacts on the whole marine traffic system because of their different motion state and traffic density which also conforms to the essence of the marine traffic system as a non linear system from the perspective of complex networks this phenomenon reflects the importance of different nodes in complex networks therefore this paper puts forward the concept of homogeneity of mts the degree of homogeneity of mts affected by ships in the region the higher the homogeneity of the situation the more even the mts is affected by ships in specific area in this study the complex network structure entropy is introduced as a macro index to measure the homogeneity of mts this measure can accurately reflect the structural differences of mts in different time for the power law degree distribution of mtscn there are core nodes with a large number of connections and most peripheral nodes with a small number of connections see fig 10 a and d fig 13 shows the change of the network structure entropy in areas 1 and 2 in different observation time with a larger number of ships the influence degrees of ships on the overall mts are homogeneous the structure entropy in area 1 is higher than that in area 2 fig 14 shows the relation between structure entropy and situation complexity and network structure entropy and situation complexity have strong correlation to explain this phenomenon four scenarios in section 3 2 are selected see fig 15 the complex networks at the 9th and 12th time slices in area 1 only have few core nodes so the situation complexity non homogeneous of area 1 is greatly affected by a few ships this phenomenon can be explained by the clustering coefficient of the node in network the clustering coefficient distribution in fig 16 a and d is obviously uneven the proportion of nodes is smaller with higher clustering coefficient the clustering coefficient distribution in fig 16 b and c is uniform and the proportion of high clustering coefficients is large this proves that most nodes are in a highly connected situation and the complexity of mts is non homogeneous in practical application the homogeneity of situation can sensitively reflect the differences of situation structure of marine traffic system managers can quickly form situational awareness according to different situations and take corresponding management countermeasures 4 conclusion the complex network theory was introduced to map the complex relationship between multiple ships into the complex network with the mtscn established the sum of unit weights of all nodes was used to indicate the complexity of mts the concept of homogeneity of mts was put forward which reflected by network structure entropy the composition of marine traffic system and the evolution of system state were explained in principle and four empirical cases in zhenjiang dagang waters were given to analyze the complex network model of mts in this study the non linear influence among multiple vessels is considered in the model of mts based on complex network rather than simply superimposing the situation values of single ship it highlights the structural characteristics of marine traffic system providing a new idea for expressing the situation of marine traffic however this study only statistically analyzed the data of a specific area and find the structural characteristics of the mts in the future data from more area will be collected and how to apply this method to traffic management should be pay attention to continuously credit authorship contribution statement zhongyi sui writing

i j d i j v i j d i j v i j cos d i j v i j in eq 1 d i j v i j are the relative distance and speed of a pair of ship respectively fig 2 shows the construction process of mtscn if the approaching rate is greater than or equal to 0 it means that the two ships are sailing in parallel or in a divergence trend in such cases the relationship between the two ships is not considered and there is no connection between the two ships if the approaching rate is less than 0 it indicates that there is a convergence trend between ships at this time the complexity between two ships is calculated as the weight of the edges in the mtscn 2 2 3 the weight of mtscn in our previous studies on the complexity of marine traffic flow velocity course and position of ships are important parameters affecting the marine traffic complexity and the complexity between ships can be calculated by them in the complexity model ship is the basic unit and the traffic density factor and traffic conflict factor are selected to calculate the complexity between two ships in this study the method of calculating the complexity of marine traffic flow in our previous study was used to calculate the complexity between two ships wen et al 2015 the complexity between a pair of ship is set as the edge weight the calculation formula of complexity is as follows 2 c o m p l e x i t y i j d i j v i j θ i j d e n i j d i j c o n f i j d i j v i j θ i j in eq 2 d i j is the relative distance of a pair wise ships v i j is the relative speed of a pair of ship θ i j is the track crossing angle between a pair of ship fig 3 shows three mts with different structures the red in the web version node represents ship edge the relationship between ships w is the edge weight in fig 3 a three ships under the situation shows a disperse trend so they do not influence each other in fig 3 b three ships show a converge trend all ships influence each other at this time the situation is more complex as shown in fig 3 c there are only two ships in a converge trend to which controllers should pay more attention the between ship complexity in fig 3 c is relatively low although there is the same distance between ships and the same density in the three traffic situations in fig 3 the complexity for controller and mariner differs in the current study the analysis of structure in traffic situation is highly deficient 2 3 complexity of mts in this study we use the topological characteristics of complex network to reflect the complexity of mts degree vertex strength degree distribution clustering coefficient and structure entropy are chosen for mts complexity analysis 1 degree and vertex strength two concepts are introduced degree and vertex strength degree is a very important parameter in complex networks the number of nodes in a network is represented by n and the degree of node n i is the number of edges connected to node n i in the mtscn the degree of nodes represents the number of ships associated with a ship the larger nodal degree means more ships having close relationship with the vessel which causes the larger possibility of conflicts in this paper node degree is represented by k fig 3 c is a typical scenario ships 2 and 3 are convergent and ship 1 is on the contrary thus in fig 3 c k1 0 and k2 k3 0 in the complex network theory the vertex strength is defined as the sum of edge weights associated with a node edges are weighted in the complex network a concept corresponding to the weight of edges is the vertex strength it is a generalization of node degree in unweight networks it can be defined as following 3 s i j n i w i j where s i is the vertex strength of node i w i j the weight of the edge between nodes n i and n j n i is the set of adjacent points of node i 2 degree distribution in complex network the node degree k i is the number of connections it has to other nodes the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network degree distribution can reflect a lot of information from the perspective of network structure it can be defined as following 4 p n k i n where p i is the probability that the node degree is i in the network n k i is the number of node that node degree is i n is the number of node in complex network 3 clustering coefficient the definition of clustering coefficient is as follows 5 c i e i c k i 2 where c i is the clustering coefficient of node v i e i is the actual number of edges in v i s k i neighbor nodes c k i 2 is the number of all possible edges 4 structure entropy the importance of each node is different which reflects the mtscn is non homogeneous in the mtscn the importance of nodes is defined as 6 i i k i j 1 n k j without considering k 0 the network structure entropy is defined as 7 e i 1 n i i ln i i 3 complex network analysis in actual scenarios 3 1 research data zhenjiang dagang section is one of the busiest waters in the yangtze river and a large number of ferries make the traffic environment of the water be very complex so taking the zhenjiang dagang section of the yangtze river as the research area the work selected the ship ais data on 13 june 2018 in observed area to analyze the mtscn because the update time of marine radar data is 6 12 min 6min 9min and 12min was chosen for observation traffic separation scheme was adopted in zhenjiang dagang section of the yangtze river in order to analyze the differences of situation between upstream and downstream traffic the waters of zhenjiang dagagn were divided into the upstream and downstream areas the location of observed areas is shown in table 2 8 a a r e a 1 a r e a 2 area 1 is the upstream area and area 2 the downstream area see fig 4 fig 5 shows the change of traffic volume in two areas in different observation time ship speed distribution in areas 1 and 2 is shown in fig 6 the traffic volume in area 1 is obviously more than that in area 2 however ship speed in area1 is less than that in area2 therefore it is necessary to analyze the traffic situation of the two areas 3 2 complexity measurement in mtscn an index was proposed to describe the complexity of mts based on the topological characteristics of complex network the complexity was defined as the sum of vertex strength of all nodes in a mtscn and reflected the average number of conflicts of nodes in the network in most studies the complexity of mts is defined as the number of ship in unit area and the larger number indicates the higher complexity although the method is simple and applicable it cannot differentiate the mts with the same number of ships the concrete calculating methods are as follows 9 u i s i k i 10 m i 1 n u i where s i is the vertex strength of node n i and w i j is the weight of the edge between node n i and n j u i is the weight of node n i m is the sum of all nodes vertex strength reflect the macro situation value in an area in the complexity of mts in specified area was evaluated using the sum of unit weight of all nodes in a mtscn reflecting the average number of conflicts of nodes in the network in marine traffic the larger number of ships indicates the smaller average distance between ships and the higher conflict probability fig 7 shows the curve of the situation complexity with time in different observation time in fig 7 the situation complexity in area 1 is obviously higher than that in area 2 in fig 5 the traffic volume in area 1 is obviously more than that in area 2 there is similar change trend for the complexity of mts in the two areas and the traffic volume which can reflect the relationship between them in general the complexity of mts increases with the number of ships which proves the calculation model in the work however there are differences between traffic situation complexity and traffic volume in some cases the influence of the number of ships on the complexity of mts is different and the situation complexity and traffic volume are not necessarily positively correlated fig 8 shows the relation between situation complexity and traffic volume in different observation time 3 3 scale free characteristics in mts from the 9th to 12th time slice in fig 8 a four representative scenarios in area 1 are selected to validate the proposed model as shown in fig 9 in four scenarios the number of ships in area 1 at the 11th time slice is the largest with the largest corresponding situation complexity however at the 10th time slice the number of ship is the smallest and the complexity of mts is not moreover the number of ships at the 8th time slice is equal to that at the 12th but the corresponding traffic situation is different we analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of complex network fig 10 shows the mtscn corresponding to the four scenarios in fig 10 the number of complex network edges is not positively correlated with the number of ships but positively correlated with the complexity all nodes vertex strength of mts this indicates that the potential conflict of ships affects the mts as well as the number of ships fig 11 shows the degree distribution in four actual scenarios in area 1 when the situation complexity is low the degree distribution of the network is in the power law distribution see fig 11 a and d this is because when the complexity of the area is low most of the ships have fewer conflicts and only a few ships are crucial these crucial ships are the key nodes in the mtscn while other ships are peripheral nodes when the situation complexity is high the mtscn has a uniform degree distribution see fig 11 b and c for the same reason when the complexity of mts increases most ships are caught in a complex conflict situation and the degree distribution of the complex network is more uniform thus it can be seen when the complexity increases the structure of mtscn will be converted from scale free network to uniform network similarly the distribution of vertex strength in fig 12 has the same trend with degree distribution four scenarios were analyzed to verify the rationality of the proposed model the results of the work are in line with the actual situation it can be concluded that traffic volume only represents the number of ships in specific area rather than the relationship between ships the macro situation complexity model reflects the dynamic variation of complexity of mts sensitively and provides the theoretical support for marine traffic management 3 4 homogeneity of mts in the marine traffic system sometime the density of ship is high in an area so the probability of conflict is high some ships are in low traffic density area and the probability of conflict is low in the short term in other words different ships have different impacts on the whole marine traffic system because of their different motion state and traffic density which also conforms to the essence of the marine traffic system as a non linear system from the perspective of complex networks this phenomenon reflects the importance of different nodes in complex networks therefore this paper puts forward the concept of homogeneity of mts the degree of homogeneity of mts affected by ships in the region the higher the homogeneity of the situation the more even the mts is affected by ships in specific area in this study the complex network structure entropy is introduced as a macro index to measure the homogeneity of mts this measure can accurately reflect the structural differences of mts in different time for the power law degree distribution of mtscn there are core nodes with a large number of connections and most peripheral nodes with a small number of connections see fig 10 a and d fig 13 shows the change of the network structure entropy in areas 1 and 2 in different observation time with a larger number of ships the influence degrees of ships on the overall mts are homogeneous the structure entropy in area 1 is higher than that in area 2 fig 14 shows the relation between structure entropy and situation complexity and network structure entropy and situation complexity have strong correlation to explain this phenomenon four scenarios in section 3 2 are selected see fig 15 the complex networks at the 9th and 12th time slices in area 1 only have few core nodes so the situation complexity non homogeneous of area 1 is greatly affected by a few ships this phenomenon can be explained by the clustering coefficient of the node in network the clustering coefficient distribution in fig 16 a and d is obviously uneven the proportion of nodes is smaller with higher clustering coefficient the clustering coefficient distribution in fig 16 b and c is uniform and the proportion of high clustering coefficients is large this proves that most nodes are in a highly connected situation and the complexity of mts is non homogeneous in practical application the homogeneity of situation can sensitively reflect the differences of situation structure of marine traffic system managers can quickly form situational awareness according to different situations and take corresponding management countermeasures 4 conclusion the complex network theory was introduced to map the complex relationship between multiple ships into the complex network with the mtscn established the sum of unit weights of all nodes was used to indicate the complexity of mts the concept of homogeneity of mts was put forward which reflected by network structure entropy the composition of marine traffic system and the evolution of system state were explained in principle and four empirical cases in zhenjiang dagang waters were given to analyze the complex network model of mts in this study the non linear influence among multiple vessels is considered in the model of mts based on complex network rather than simply superimposing the situation values of single ship it highlights the structural characteristics of marine traffic system providing a new idea for expressing the situation of marine traffic however this study only statistically analyzed the data of a specific area and find the structural characteristics of the mts in the future data from more area will be collected and how to apply this method to traffic management should be pay attention to continuously credit authorship contribution statement zhongyi sui writing

21616,experimental and finite element analyses are performed to identify the buckling strength of a large scale specimen of tourist submarine subjected to external hydrostatic pressure the tourist submarines are designed with multi windows built up of structural openings affecting the buckling and ultimate strength of their pressure hulls the hydrostatic pressure experiment is conducted in a pressure chamber recording the external pressure and the structural strains the experimental structural response and permanent deformation show a good agreement with the finite element analysis performed by the abaqus finite element solver the numerical analysis presents some aspects of particular relevance to the buckling failure behaviour of the submarine hull subjected to a uniform external pressure additional analyses are performed to investigate the effect of material properties structural openings and reinforcing rings the buckling and ultimate strength of the prototype submarines are also evaluated to explore the critical design aspects of internal and external ring stiffeners keywords buckling strength tourist submarine pressure hull window opening experiment finite element analysis 1 introduction underwater tourism has overgrown due to the fantastic sightseeing it provides this requires that tourist submarines are built to a very high level of structural requirements and designed for safety and comfort the submarine pressure hulls can be made of cylindrical shells with internal or external ring stiffeners and can be designed employing the rules and regulations of ccs 2018 and abs 2018 as seen in fig 1 such submarines have large plexiglass observation windows to enhance exterior visibility the specific pressure hulls with window openings subjected to the external hydrostatic pressure during deep diving require specific design solutions structural arrangements and strength assessments the ultimate limit state design of the tourist submarines requires that the ultimate diving depth is much higher than the maximum operating depth when the tourist submarine sinks accidently beyond the maximum operating depth the submarine pressure hull can sustain the ultimate water pressure to avoid any severe deformation and loss of human life the submarine pressure hull structures are built with a steel ring stiffened cylindrical shell with hemispherical or conical ends fig 1 the buckling strength of cylindrical shell can be increased through additional ring stiffeners however the presence of internal ring stiffeners reduces the space inside the tourist submarine fig 1a and the presence of the external ring stiffeners may avoid contacting with the vessel attachments such as platform ladder piping and insulation fig 1b the ring stiffeners should be assembled according to the hull structural strength requirements some investigations have been carried out on the ultimate strength analysis of cylindrical spherical and conical shells structures which are the most critical structural components of tourist submarines the submarine pressure hull is constructed of a series of ring stiffened cylindrical shells terminated with spherical or conical shells at either end ross and humphries 1993 and ross and waterman 2000 conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the buckling strength of unstiffened and ring stiffened cylindrical shells subjected to external hydrostatic pressure showing that the ring stiffening improves the structural efficiency significantly recently cho et al 2018a performed experimental and numerical investigations on the failure modes of ring stiffened cylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure the investigation identified the consequence of the structural failure modes including the shell yielding local buckling of the shell between ring stiffeners overall buckling of the shell together with the stiffeners and interactive buckling mode combining local and overall buckling afterwards cho et al 2018b outlined some empirical formulae providing an adequate prediction of the ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinders generally the buckling and ultimate strength of cylindrical shells are affected strongly by the structural scantlings material properties boundary conditions geometrical imperfections and residual stresses zhang et al 2019 performed numerical analyses of the buckling of circumferentially corrugated cylindrical shells under uniform external pressure to evaluate the effect of triangular semi circular and sinusoidal corrugations on buckling strength the study showed that the initial geometrical imperfections affect the elastic buckling strength strongly but only affect the elastic plastic buckling strength slightly spherical shells under uniform external pressure have attracted considerable attention due to their high load supporting capacity in which both stress and deflection are almost equally distributed zhang et al 2018 performed experimental and finite element analyses of the buckling performance of spherical shells recommending the best height to diameter ratio for the spherical cap to sustain the buckling load for ring stiffened conical shells cho et al 2019 reported experimental and numerical analyses investigating their collapse behaviour the conical shells with substantial stiffeners fail by local buckling at the shell between the ring frames and the conical shells with small stiffeners fail by overall buckling of the adjacent frames together with the shell the above comprehensive works have led to a good understanding of the buckling failure of submarines helping to recommend some guidance for failure prevention nevertheless the tourist submarine unlike the naval and the deep sea submarines has multi observation windows few investigations are carried out on the effect of the window openings on the strength of the submarine pressure hulls the observation window openings affect the structural continuity changing the buckling behaviour of pressure hulls in the design of submarine pressure hulls nonlinear finite element analyses should be performed to improve upon the conventional analytical and empirical design formulae mackay et al 2011 mackay and keulen 2013 the accuracy of the finite element results is highly dependent on the skill of analysts the buckling and ultimate strength analyses are sensitive to the boundary conditions imposed loads initial deflections and welding induced residual stresses doan et al 2020 thus the finite element simulations should be validated against large scale experiments before being implemented in the structural design of novel vessels liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in this work the buckling strength of tourist submarines subjected to uniform hydrostatic pressure is investigated experimental work is conducted to examine the buckling and ultimate strength of a large scale cylindrical hull specimen with openings thick stiffening steel rings reinforce the circular openings according to the design of prototype submarines the large scale specimen is designed by employing the elementary scaling law the scaled specimen is not ring stiffened and is used to study the buckling of the long span cylindrical shell with multi openings the experimentally obtained ultimate load collapse mode and structural stresses are compared with the nonlinear finite element analyses using the validated finite element analysis the influence of material properties and structural configurations such as window openings and ring stiffeners on the ultimate strength is analysed moreover the buckling and ultimate strength of the prototype submarines are estimated to explore the critical aspects of internal and external ring stiffener design solutions 2 specimen description 2 1 design two submarine prototypes a and b with similar dimensions of cylindrical shells are selected as the investigated objects fig 1 the principal dimensions of the prototype submarines and the scaled specimen are shown in table 1 and their geometrical descriptors are presented in figs 1 and 2 half length of the cylindrical shells of prototype submarines 7700 mm is investigated an elementary scaling approach is used to design the specimen satisfying the geometrical similarity the scaling selection considers mainly the test capability of the pressure chamber in the laboratory and the fabrication technology of the scaled specimen here the scale of the length is 1 4 and the scale of hull thickness is 1 4 6 for the actual specimen this scaling discrepancy is mainly because the 1 4 plate thickness of the prototype 22 mm 4 5 5 mm cannot be found in the existing steel sheets thus the hull thickness of 5 0 mm is selected in the preliminary design nevertheless the hull of the actual specimen is about 4 8 mm thick as the fabrication is the next step of the design thus the scale of hull thickness is revised to 1 4 6 4 8 mm 22 mm according to scaling laws the scale of uniform external pressure is estimated at 1 1 15 4 4 6 for the reason that the stresses in the scaled specimen can be kept consistent with the ones of the full scale prototype submarines the test specimen is a cylindrical shell with openings terminated with spherical shells at each end each opening is strengthened and sealed by a stiffening ring a rubber washer and a cover plate fig 2 this structural configuration guarantees the tightness of the scaled specimen during the hydrostatic pressure test as the experiment is focused on the buckling and ultimate strength of the long span cylindrical shell with multi window openings the ring stiffeners are not designed in the test specimen it investigates the exclusion of ring stiffeners in the six span cylindrical shell providing insight into the relationship between the reduction of buckling strength and the increase of accommodation space the spherical shells are made of a thicker plate 8 0 mm to ensure that the structural buckling occurs at the cylindrical shell although this reinforcement induces stiffer boundary condition it will not affect the buckling failure mode of the long span cylindrical shell much at the ultimate load level 2 2 fabrication the test specimen is fabricated following the shipbuilding standards the cylindrical shell is cut from the chosen steel sheet cold rolled to the required diameter 660 mm and welded along the longitudinal seam 1920 mm length the circular openings are cut and then are reinforced by thick stiffening rings the prototype submarines are built of dh32 high strength steel and the similar steel is used for the scaled specimen three quasi static tensile tests are performed following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the yield stress of the material is 294 5 mpa and the tensile stress strain curve is presented in fig 3 an outside calliper measures the weld induced imperfections regarding the initial distortions before the experiment it is observed that the maximum deviation of the design diameter is about 4 5 mm and thus the initial out of roundness so called ellipticity is 1 0068 the average thickness of the cylindrical shell is 4 8 mm measured by a digital ultrasonic thickness gauge 4 76 4 85 mm 3 experiment 3 1 experimental set up the external hydrostatic pressure test is conducted using an air pressure chamber see fig 4 the inner diameter and the length of the chamber are 2000 mm and 4000 mm respectively and its maximum testing pressure is 2 0 mpa corresponding to a water depth of approximately 200 m the deformation of the specimen cannot be observed in the enclosed chamber during the testing and only the structural strain is measured from the inside of the specimen in the chamber the air pressure is increased by using an automatic high pressure air pump when the pressure reaches the ultimate value the specimen suddenly collapses and the pressure drops significantly during the test the pressure is measured by an air pressure gauge a pressure speed of about 100 pa s is prescribed presenting a quasi static experimental condition the strain registered during the test of the scaled specimen is measured by three directional strain gauges mounted inside the specimen and the strain at six positions are recorded fig 5 a to ensure proper tightness of the structural specimen airtight seals are fixed on the cover plates of the openings and the internal signal lines are passed fig 5b the procedure of performing the hydrostatic pressure test is divided into two stages preloading stage 1 and collapse stage stage 2 stage 1 the experiment starts by imposing three cycles of loading pressure to eliminate the welding induced residual stresses in the test specimen during the loading process the repeatability of test data is controlled to validate the loading device and data acquisition the tightness of the seals is also checked in the test specimen the maximum external pressure is about 0 3 mpa leading to elastic stresses of the test specimen much less than the material yield stress stage 2 the load pressure is imposed gradually up to the collapse is achieved the strains are recorded per 0 2 mpa pressure before reaching 0 4 mpa pressure and then the data are recorded per 0 1 mpa pressure until the collapse is achieved 3 2 experimental results and discussion 3 2 1 ultimate load and collapse mode the collapse of the scaled specimen during the experiment is indicated by a sudden significant discharge of the load pressure accompanied by a loud noise the maximum applied pressure on the test specimen is 0 67 mpa which is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the scaled specimen as the structure cannot withstand more substantial external loading the pressure is dropped due to the excessive volume created by the structural buckling as the pressure chamber is opened the collapse mode of the scaled specimen is identified by visual inspection after the test fig 6 local deformations of the specimen are depicted in fig 7 the cylindrical shell collapses inwards at the top and the bottom with two large hollows and folds closing to the end spherical shells the overall buckling mode occurs as expected since the openings and the spherical ends are strengthened it is observed that one side experiences more severe collapse at the space of six spans fig 6a but the other side collapses mainly within the middle four spans fig 6b the overall buckling starts from the central span as the openings are strengthened no visual deformations are observed it should be mentioned that the permanent deformation is achieved after the spring back induced by the release of both the external and internal air pressures on the pressure hull in the experiment the spherical shells at both ends represent the performance of ring stiffeners thus when the six span cylindrical shell between substantial ring stiffeners is designed for the prototype submarine its ultimate external pressure is estimated at 0 77 mpa 0 67 mpa 1 15 according to the elementary scaling laws on the other hand the material used for the scaled specimen has smaller yield strength than dh32 high strength steel 294 5 mpa 315 mpa the effect of the material yield stress will be discussed by the finite element analysis in section 4 3 3 2 2 structural stress the stresses estimated as a function of the applied pressure are shown in fig 8 the von mises stresses are calculated based on the collected data from the three directional strain gauges mounted at the six points as shown in fig 5a the measured longitudinal and hoop stresses are also presented the analysed stress takes the material yield stress 294 5 mpa when exceeding this magnitude generally the hoop stress is higher than the longitudinal stress for each point fig 8a and b illustrating the cylindrical shell experiences larger circumferential deformation on the other hand both hoop and longitudinal stresses are negative at the longitudinal centreline p1 p3 and p6 in fig 5a presenting the compressive deformation the rest points p2 p4 p5 show positive stresses presenting the bulge deformation the von mises stresses show a parabolic relationship in the elastic stress range the stresses increase significantly after the applied pressure reaches the level of 0 5 mpa the stresses at points p1 and p3 exceed the material yield stress level at the applied pressure of 0 6 mpa illustrating that the shell yielding occurs before overall buckling 4 finite element analysis of scaled specimen 4 1 finite element model a nonlinear finite element analysis of the test specimen is performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 where the entire structure is modelled see fig 9 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacements and the finite strains are also activated the finite element model is generated using s4r type shell elements for the pressure hulls and c3d8r type solid elements for the strengthened openings the shell element is a 4 node doubly curved finite strain element with a reduced integration and the solid element is an 8 node brick element with a reduced integration shell to solid coupling is used to define constraints between nodes on the shell edge and nodes on the solid surface the element sizes of 25 mm 20 mm 15 mm and 10 mm are used to analyse the buckling failure of the test specimen the number of nodes and elements in the finite element models are summarised in the second and third columns of table 2 the material is defined by an elastic perfectly plastic model with a yield stress of 294 5 mpa young s modulus of 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 the measured geometrical initial imperfections on the pressure hull initial out of roundness of 1 0068 with maximum deformation of 4 5 mm are integrated directly into the finite element analysis as the initial preloading cycles were used to eliminate the residual stresses partially in the experiment the welding induced residual stresses are not explicitly modelled in the finite element analysis the submarine is suspended in water and is free of constraints for simulating well the suspension the following boundary conditions are used considering the symmetrical deformation the longitudinal x axis displacement is constrained at all nodes of the central cross section the transverse y axis and the vertical z axis displacements are constrained at the respective two symmetrical nodes as shown in fig 9 the above constraints are defined instead of the ones proposed in ccs 2018 since the latter numerical solution has not converged passing the limit point and the post buckling deformation was not obtained uniform pressure is applied to the outer shell of the specimen including the circular cover plates 4 2 finite element results the numerically estimated ultimate pressures for different element sizes and their analysed errors are given in table 2 they are compared with the ultimate experimental pressure 0 67 mpa the numerical results reveal a close agreement between the simulations and the experiment generally the finer meshed model predicts a smaller ultimate load and the optimal finite element size is 15 mm as the 10 mm size shows a converged result using this mesh density it may predict slightly smaller ultimate pressure than the experimental result 3 0 however the mesh density is sufficient to capture the global buckling behaviour of the cylindrical shells with openings accurately the numerically estimated pressure as a function of the maximum deformation at the hollow is shown in fig 10 the longitudinal hoop and von mises stresses of key finite elements during the loading process corresponding to the experimental ones fig 8 are given in fig 11 it is observed that the geometrical nonlinearity is significant after the applied pressure of about 0 3 mpa the elastic buckling of cylindrical shell starts at the early deformation stage and the material yielding occurs closing to the ultimate load at the latter stage generally the average error of the stresses between the numerical and experimental results reaches about 20 the error is affected by many factors for example the sizes of the strain gauge 11 mm and the finite element 15 mm are different the von mises stress contour plot of the scaled specimen at the ultimate load level is shown in fig 12 and its post buckling deformations are presented in fig 13 at the ultimate load level the cylindrical shell suffers shell yielding at the buckled region under compression and at the bent region in the vicinity of the reinforcements see the high stress regions in fig 12 the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated on the buckled and bent regions nevertheless the stresses are relatively small in other regions at the locations closing to the reinforcing rings the local stresses are not very high 100 150 mpa the finite element model collapses with an overall failure mode in the cylindrical shell under external pressure similar to the experimental one figs 6 and 13 the cylindrical shell is hollowed by the external pressure with the elliptical cross section until the overall buckling occurs and afterwards the deformation develops rapidly in the post buckling stage the local deformations closing to the hemispherical shells compared to the experimental deformations fig 7 are presented in fig 14 one side experiences more severe folds close to the spherical shells and the deformation of the spherical shells is much smaller than the one of the cylindrical shell the post buckling deformation process of the cylindrical shell is shown in fig 15 both end hemispherical shells are hidden for better illustration of the numerical deformations at the ultimate load level fig 15a the maximum deformation at the hollow is relatively small 11 7 mm as the initial imperfections are involved one side of the cylindrical shell deforms inwards earlier than the other side fig 15b afterwards the buckling deformation increases and the buckling also starts at the other side fig 15c the final buckling failure is obtained after unloading at the end fig 15d 4 3 influence of material yield stress one more numerical analysis is performed defining the material yield stress of 315 mpa and the ultimate pressure is estimated at 0 66 mpa fig 16 the ultimate strength ratio is found at 1 02 0 66 mpa 0 65 mpa smaller than the yield stress ratio of 1 07 315 mpa 294 5 mpa the ultimate load increases much slower than the material yield stress in the current case since the buckling failure mainly dominates the ultimate strength a similar phenomenon can be found in liu et al 2018 5 effect of structural configuration in the design of tourist submarines the strength is related to the selection of the structural component configuration to carry loads some aspects of particular relevance to the ultimate behaviour of structures are presented here the numerical model with an element size of 15 mm is used as a reference for comparison and more numerical analyses are performed with different structural configurations the initial geometrical deflection max 1 0 mm is integrated into the finite element model in the shape of the first order buckling mode from the eigenvalue buckling analysis 5 1 intact pressure hull for investigating the effect of the level of the strengthening of the openings on the ultimate strength of the tourist submarine the ultimate strength analysis of an intact pressure hull is performed the estimated ultimate pressure and the post buckling deformation shape are shown in fig 17 the estimated ultimate pressure of the intact pressure hull is 0 56 mpa smaller than the reference 0 65 mpa the typical bifurcation buckling mode presents weaker buckling with three circumferential waves in the cross section it illustrates that the strengthening of the openings can improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shell 16 the ultimate pressure of cylindrical shell calculated by the formulae of ccs 2018 and abs 2018 are 0 75 and 0 73 mpa respectively the semi analytical results are larger than the numerical value 0 56 mpa this may occur because in the rules the approximate ratio of length to diameter of the cylindrical shell is much smaller than the current long span case 5 2 pressure hull with circular openings this model removes the originally strengthened rings of the circular openings and as a result an ultimate pressure of 0 23 mpa is estimated fig 18 it can carry only 41 of the ultimate load of the intact pressure hull illustrating that the openings decrease the ultimate strength greatly however the presence of the ring reinforcements of the openings can improve the buckling strength greatly 5 3 pressure hull with internal ring stiffeners in this model internal ring stiffeners t 29 25 3 4 5 are mounted to each enclosed section at a distance of 320 mm the ultimate pressure is estimated at 1 65 mpa fig 19 the ring stiffened cylindrical shell presents 2 54 times buckling strength more than the unstiffened one 0 65 mpa the presence of the internal ring stiffeners enhances the structural efficiency due to the shorter span length between reinforcing rings 5 4 pressure hull with external ring stiffeners in this model external ring stiffeners t 31 28 5 9 are mounted to every three spans with a distance of 960 mm the ultimate pressure is estimated at 1 20 mpa fig 20 the external ring stiffeners can also improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shell although larger scantling is used for the external ring stiffeners compared to the internal ones the longer span length induces weaker ultimate strength of the pressure hull 1 20 mpa versus 1 65 mpa 6 finite element analysis of prototype submarines the objective here is to validate the finite element analysis with the experimental one first and then to use the validated finite element analysis to evaluate the ultimate strength of the prototype submarines a and b fig 1 here the elastic perfectly plastic material model is defined with a yield stress of 315 mpa the numerically estimated pressures as a function of the maximum deformation for the prototype submarines are shown in fig 21 and their deformation at the ultimate load and post buckling levels are presented in figs 22 and 23 the resulting ultimate strength of the prototype submarines a and b are 2 94 mpa and 1 67 mpa respectively the span length between reinforcing rings affects the buckling and ultimate strength of the cylindrical shell strongly the submarine b with a longer span suffers much more significant dent deformation at the ultimate loading 39 7 mm versus 7 8 mm based on all experimental and numerical analyses some aspects relevant to the buckling behaviour of the tourist submarine pressure hulls are summarised for both submarines a and b the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated at the strengthened openings due to the shell bending figs 22a and 23a the buckling of the cylindrical shell occurs at the upper and the lower structures for submarines a and b respectively their ultimate failures are dominated by the local buckling of the shell between the ring stiffeners figs 22b and 23b overall buckling of the shell together with the stiffeners can be observed at the post ultimate regions figs 22c and 23c 7 conclusions experimental and finite element analyses of the buckling strength of tourist submarines subjected to uniform external pressure have been performed in the present study the ultimate strength analysed by the finite element method is in a good agreement with the experimental one the openings decrease the ultimate strength of the cylindrical pressure hull significantly it is found however that the strengthened openings improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shells with slightly higher ultimate strength than the intact one on the other hand both the internal and external ring stiffeners improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shells significantly due to the smaller span length between reinforcing rings the analysis procedure employed for evaluating experimentally and numerically the buckling strength of the prototype submarines has proven to be acceptable for the present study it is concluded that the right solution in estimating the ultimate strength of prototype submarines is to use the finite element method validated by the experimental

21616,experimental and finite element analyses are performed to identify the buckling strength of a large scale specimen of tourist submarine subjected to external hydrostatic pressure the tourist submarines are designed with multi windows built up of structural openings affecting the buckling and ultimate strength of their pressure hulls the hydrostatic pressure experiment is conducted in a pressure chamber recording the external pressure and the structural strains the experimental structural response and permanent deformation show a good agreement with the finite element analysis performed by the abaqus finite element solver the numerical analysis presents some aspects of particular relevance to the buckling failure behaviour of the submarine hull subjected to a uniform external pressure additional analyses are performed to investigate the effect of material properties structural openings and reinforcing rings the buckling and ultimate strength of the prototype submarines are also evaluated to explore the critical design aspects of internal and external ring stiffeners keywords buckling strength tourist submarine pressure hull window opening experiment finite element analysis 1 introduction underwater tourism has overgrown due to the fantastic sightseeing it provides this requires that tourist submarines are built to a very high level of structural requirements and designed for safety and comfort the submarine pressure hulls can be made of cylindrical shells with internal or external ring stiffeners and can be designed employing the rules and regulations of ccs 2018 and abs 2018 as seen in fig 1 such submarines have large plexiglass observation windows to enhance exterior visibility the specific pressure hulls with window openings subjected to the external hydrostatic pressure during deep diving require specific design solutions structural arrangements and strength assessments the ultimate limit state design of the tourist submarines requires that the ultimate diving depth is much higher than the maximum operating depth when the tourist submarine sinks accidently beyond the maximum operating depth the submarine pressure hull can sustain the ultimate water pressure to avoid any severe deformation and loss of human life the submarine pressure hull structures are built with a steel ring stiffened cylindrical shell with hemispherical or conical ends fig 1 the buckling strength of cylindrical shell can be increased through additional ring stiffeners however the presence of internal ring stiffeners reduces the space inside the tourist submarine fig 1a and the presence of the external ring stiffeners may avoid contacting with the vessel attachments such as platform ladder piping and insulation fig 1b the ring stiffeners should be assembled according to the hull structural strength requirements some investigations have been carried out on the ultimate strength analysis of cylindrical spherical and conical shells structures which are the most critical structural components of tourist submarines the submarine pressure hull is constructed of a series of ring stiffened cylindrical shells terminated with spherical or conical shells at either end ross and humphries 1993 and ross and waterman 2000 conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the buckling strength of unstiffened and ring stiffened cylindrical shells subjected to external hydrostatic pressure showing that the ring stiffening improves the structural efficiency significantly recently cho et al 2018a performed experimental and numerical investigations on the failure modes of ring stiffened cylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure the investigation identified the consequence of the structural failure modes including the shell yielding local buckling of the shell between ring stiffeners overall buckling of the shell together with the stiffeners and interactive buckling mode combining local and overall buckling afterwards cho et al 2018b outlined some empirical formulae providing an adequate prediction of the ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinders generally the buckling and ultimate strength of cylindrical shells are affected strongly by the structural scantlings material properties boundary conditions geometrical imperfections and residual stresses zhang et al 2019 performed numerical analyses of the buckling of circumferentially corrugated cylindrical shells under uniform external pressure to evaluate the effect of triangular semi circular and sinusoidal corrugations on buckling strength the study showed that the initial geometrical imperfections affect the elastic buckling strength strongly but only affect the elastic plastic buckling strength slightly spherical shells under uniform external pressure have attracted considerable attention due to their high load supporting capacity in which both stress and deflection are almost equally distributed zhang et al 2018 performed experimental and finite element analyses of the buckling performance of spherical shells recommending the best height to diameter ratio for the spherical cap to sustain the buckling load for ring stiffened conical shells cho et al 2019 reported experimental and numerical analyses investigating their collapse behaviour the conical shells with substantial stiffeners fail by local buckling at the shell between the ring frames and the conical shells with small stiffeners fail by overall buckling of the adjacent frames together with the shell the above comprehensive works have led to a good understanding of the buckling failure of submarines helping to recommend some guidance for failure prevention nevertheless the tourist submarine unlike the naval and the deep sea submarines has multi observation windows few investigations are carried out on the effect of the window openings on the strength of the submarine pressure hulls the observation window openings affect the structural continuity changing the buckling behaviour of pressure hulls in the design of submarine pressure hulls nonlinear finite element analyses should be performed to improve upon the conventional analytical and empirical design formulae mackay et al 2011 mackay and keulen 2013 the accuracy of the finite element results is highly dependent on the skill of analysts the buckling and ultimate strength analyses are sensitive to the boundary conditions imposed loads initial deflections and welding induced residual stresses doan et al 2020 thus the finite element simulations should be validated against large scale experiments before being implemented in the structural design of novel vessels liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in this work the buckling strength of tourist submarines subjected to uniform hydrostatic pressure is investigated experimental work is conducted to examine the buckling and ultimate strength of a large scale cylindrical hull specimen with openings thick stiffening steel rings reinforce the circular openings according to the design of prototype submarines the large scale specimen is designed by employing the elementary scaling law the scaled specimen is not ring stiffened and is used to study the buckling of the long span cylindrical shell with multi openings the experimentally obtained ultimate load collapse mode and structural stresses are compared with the nonlinear finite element analyses using the validated finite element analysis the influence of material properties and structural configurations such as window openings and ring stiffeners on the ultimate strength is analysed moreover the buckling and ultimate strength of the prototype submarines are estimated to explore the critical aspects of internal and external ring stiffener design solutions 2 specimen description 2 1 design two submarine prototypes a and b with similar dimensions of cylindrical shells are selected as the investigated objects fig 1 the principal dimensions of the prototype submarines and the scaled specimen are shown in table 1 and their geometrical descriptors are presented in figs 1 and 2 half length of the cylindrical shells of prototype submarines 7700 mm is investigated an elementary scaling approach is used to design the specimen satisfying the geometrical similarity the scaling selection considers mainly the test capability of the pressure chamber in the laboratory and the fabrication technology of the scaled specimen here the scale of the length is 1 4 and the scale of hull thickness is 1 4 6 for the actual specimen this scaling discrepancy is mainly because the 1 4 plate thickness of the prototype 22 mm 4 5 5 mm cannot be found in the existing steel sheets thus the hull thickness of 5 0 mm is selected in the preliminary design nevertheless the hull of the actual specimen is about 4 8 mm thick as the fabrication is the next step of the design thus the scale of hull thickness is revised to 1 4 6 4 8 mm 22 mm according to scaling laws the scale of uniform external pressure is estimated at 1 1 15 4 4 6 for the reason that the stresses in the scaled specimen can be kept consistent with the ones of the full scale prototype submarines the test specimen is a cylindrical shell with openings terminated with spherical shells at each end each opening is strengthened and sealed by a stiffening ring a rubber washer and a cover plate fig 2 this structural configuration guarantees the tightness of the scaled specimen during the hydrostatic pressure test as the experiment is focused on the buckling and ultimate strength of the long span cylindrical shell with multi window openings the ring stiffeners are not designed in the test specimen it investigates the exclusion of ring stiffeners in the six span cylindrical shell providing insight into the relationship between the reduction of buckling strength and the increase of accommodation space the spherical shells are made of a thicker plate 8 0 mm to ensure that the structural buckling occurs at the cylindrical shell although this reinforcement induces stiffer boundary condition it will not affect the buckling failure mode of the long span cylindrical shell much at the ultimate load level 2 2 fabrication the test specimen is fabricated following the shipbuilding standards the cylindrical shell is cut from the chosen steel sheet cold rolled to the required diameter 660 mm and welded along the longitudinal seam 1920 mm length the circular openings are cut and then are reinforced by thick stiffening rings the prototype submarines are built of dh32 high strength steel and the similar steel is used for the scaled specimen three quasi static tensile tests are performed following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the yield stress of the material is 294 5 mpa and the tensile stress strain curve is presented in fig 3 an outside calliper measures the weld induced imperfections regarding the initial distortions before the experiment it is observed that the maximum deviation of the design diameter is about 4 5 mm and thus the initial out of roundness so called ellipticity is 1 0068 the average thickness of the cylindrical shell is 4 8 mm measured by a digital ultrasonic thickness gauge 4 76 4 85 mm 3 experiment 3 1 experimental set up the external hydrostatic pressure test is conducted using an air pressure chamber see fig 4 the inner diameter and the length of the chamber are 2000 mm and 4000 mm respectively and its maximum testing pressure is 2 0 mpa corresponding to a water depth of approximately 200 m the deformation of the specimen cannot be observed in the enclosed chamber during the testing and only the structural strain is measured from the inside of the specimen in the chamber the air pressure is increased by using an automatic high pressure air pump when the pressure reaches the ultimate value the specimen suddenly collapses and the pressure drops significantly during the test the pressure is measured by an air pressure gauge a pressure speed of about 100 pa s is prescribed presenting a quasi static experimental condition the strain registered during the test of the scaled specimen is measured by three directional strain gauges mounted inside the specimen and the strain at six positions are recorded fig 5 a to ensure proper tightness of the structural specimen airtight seals are fixed on the cover plates of the openings and the internal signal lines are passed fig 5b the procedure of performing the hydrostatic pressure test is divided into two stages preloading stage 1 and collapse stage stage 2 stage 1 the experiment starts by imposing three cycles of loading pressure to eliminate the welding induced residual stresses in the test specimen during the loading process the repeatability of test data is controlled to validate the loading device and data acquisition the tightness of the seals is also checked in the test specimen the maximum external pressure is about 0 3 mpa leading to elastic stresses of the test specimen much less than the material yield stress stage 2 the load pressure is imposed gradually up to the collapse is achieved the strains are recorded per 0 2 mpa pressure before reaching 0 4 mpa pressure and then the data are recorded per 0 1 mpa pressure until the collapse is achieved 3 2 experimental results and discussion 3 2 1 ultimate load and collapse mode the collapse of the scaled specimen during the experiment is indicated by a sudden significant discharge of the load pressure accompanied by a loud noise the maximum applied pressure on the test specimen is 0 67 mpa which is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the scaled specimen as the structure cannot withstand more substantial external loading the pressure is dropped due to the excessive volume created by the structural buckling as the pressure chamber is opened the collapse mode of the scaled specimen is identified by visual inspection after the test fig 6 local deformations of the specimen are depicted in fig 7 the cylindrical shell collapses inwards at the top and the bottom with two large hollows and folds closing to the end spherical shells the overall buckling mode occurs as expected since the openings and the spherical ends are strengthened it is observed that one side experiences more severe collapse at the space of six spans fig 6a but the other side collapses mainly within the middle four spans fig 6b the overall buckling starts from the central span as the openings are strengthened no visual deformations are observed it should be mentioned that the permanent deformation is achieved after the spring back induced by the release of both the external and internal air pressures on the pressure hull in the experiment the spherical shells at both ends represent the performance of ring stiffeners thus when the six span cylindrical shell between substantial ring stiffeners is designed for the prototype submarine its ultimate external pressure is estimated at 0 77 mpa 0 67 mpa 1 15 according to the elementary scaling laws on the other hand the material used for the scaled specimen has smaller yield strength than dh32 high strength steel 294 5 mpa 315 mpa the effect of the material yield stress will be discussed by the finite element analysis in section 4 3 3 2 2 structural stress the stresses estimated as a function of the applied pressure are shown in fig 8 the von mises stresses are calculated based on the collected data from the three directional strain gauges mounted at the six points as shown in fig 5a the measured longitudinal and hoop stresses are also presented the analysed stress takes the material yield stress 294 5 mpa when exceeding this magnitude generally the hoop stress is higher than the longitudinal stress for each point fig 8a and b illustrating the cylindrical shell experiences larger circumferential deformation on the other hand both hoop and longitudinal stresses are negative at the longitudinal centreline p1 p3 and p6 in fig 5a presenting the compressive deformation the rest points p2 p4 p5 show positive stresses presenting the bulge deformation the von mises stresses show a parabolic relationship in the elastic stress range the stresses increase significantly after the applied pressure reaches the level of 0 5 mpa the stresses at points p1 and p3 exceed the material yield stress level at the applied pressure of 0 6 mpa illustrating that the shell yielding occurs before overall buckling 4 finite element analysis of scaled specimen 4 1 finite element model a nonlinear finite element analysis of the test specimen is performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 where the entire structure is modelled see fig 9 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacements and the finite strains are also activated the finite element model is generated using s4r type shell elements for the pressure hulls and c3d8r type solid elements for the strengthened openings the shell element is a 4 node doubly curved finite strain element with a reduced integration and the solid element is an 8 node brick element with a reduced integration shell to solid coupling is used to define constraints between nodes on the shell edge and nodes on the solid surface the element sizes of 25 mm 20 mm 15 mm and 10 mm are used to analyse the buckling failure of the test specimen the number of nodes and elements in the finite element models are summarised in the second and third columns of table 2 the material is defined by an elastic perfectly plastic model with a yield stress of 294 5 mpa young s modulus of 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 the measured geometrical initial imperfections on the pressure hull initial out of roundness of 1 0068 with maximum deformation of 4 5 mm are integrated directly into the finite element analysis as the initial preloading cycles were used to eliminate the residual stresses partially in the experiment the welding induced residual stresses are not explicitly modelled in the finite element analysis the submarine is suspended in water and is free of constraints for simulating well the suspension the following boundary conditions are used considering the symmetrical deformation the longitudinal x axis displacement is constrained at all nodes of the central cross section the transverse y axis and the vertical z axis displacements are constrained at the respective two symmetrical nodes as shown in fig 9 the above constraints are defined instead of the ones proposed in ccs 2018 since the latter numerical solution has not converged passing the limit point and the post buckling deformation was not obtained uniform pressure is applied to the outer shell of the specimen including the circular cover plates 4 2 finite element results the numerically estimated ultimate pressures for different element sizes and their analysed errors are given in table 2 they are compared with the ultimate experimental pressure 0 67 mpa the numerical results reveal a close agreement between the simulations and the experiment generally the finer meshed model predicts a smaller ultimate load and the optimal finite element size is 15 mm as the 10 mm size shows a converged result using this mesh density it may predict slightly smaller ultimate pressure than the experimental result 3 0 however the mesh density is sufficient to capture the global buckling behaviour of the cylindrical shells with openings accurately the numerically estimated pressure as a function of the maximum deformation at the hollow is shown in fig 10 the longitudinal hoop and von mises stresses of key finite elements during the loading process corresponding to the experimental ones fig 8 are given in fig 11 it is observed that the geometrical nonlinearity is significant after the applied pressure of about 0 3 mpa the elastic buckling of cylindrical shell starts at the early deformation stage and the material yielding occurs closing to the ultimate load at the latter stage generally the average error of the stresses between the numerical and experimental results reaches about 20 the error is affected by many factors for example the sizes of the strain gauge 11 mm and the finite element 15 mm are different the von mises stress contour plot of the scaled specimen at the ultimate load level is shown in fig 12 and its post buckling deformations are presented in fig 13 at the ultimate load level the cylindrical shell suffers shell yielding at the buckled region under compression and at the bent region in the vicinity of the reinforcements see the high stress regions in fig 12 the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated on the buckled and bent regions nevertheless the stresses are relatively small in other regions at the locations closing to the reinforcing rings the local stresses are not very high 100 150 mpa the finite element model collapses with an overall failure mode in the cylindrical shell under external pressure similar to the experimental one figs 6 and 13 the cylindrical shell is hollowed by the external pressure with the elliptical cross section until the overall buckling occurs and afterwards the deformation develops rapidly in the post buckling stage the local deformations closing to the hemispherical shells compared to the experimental deformations fig 7 are presented in fig 14 one side experiences more severe folds close to the spherical shells and the deformation of the spherical shells is much smaller than the one of the cylindrical shell the post buckling deformation process of the cylindrical shell is shown in fig 15 both end hemispherical shells are hidden for better illustration of the numerical deformations at the ultimate load level fig 15a the maximum deformation at the hollow is relatively small 11 7 mm as the initial imperfections are involved one side of the cylindrical shell deforms inwards earlier than the other side fig 15b afterwards the buckling deformation increases and the buckling also starts at the other side fig 15c the final buckling failure is obtained after unloading at the end fig 15d 4 3 influence of material yield stress one more numerical analysis is performed defining the material yield stress of 315 mpa and the ultimate pressure is estimated at 0 66 mpa fig 16 the ultimate strength ratio is found at 1 02 0 66 mpa 0 65 mpa smaller than the yield stress ratio of 1 07 315 mpa 294 5 mpa the ultimate load increases much slower than the material yield stress in the current case since the buckling failure mainly dominates the ultimate strength a similar phenomenon can be found in liu et al 2018 5 effect of structural configuration in the design of tourist submarines the strength is related to the selection of the structural component configuration to carry loads some aspects of particular relevance to the ultimate behaviour of structures are presented here the numerical model with an element size of 15 mm is used as a reference for comparison and more numerical analyses are performed with different structural configurations the initial geometrical deflection max 1 0 mm is integrated into the finite element model in the shape of the first order buckling mode from the eigenvalue buckling analysis 5 1 intact pressure hull for investigating the effect of the level of the strengthening of the openings on the ultimate strength of the tourist submarine the ultimate strength analysis of an intact pressure hull is performed the estimated ultimate pressure and the post buckling deformation shape are shown in fig 17 the estimated ultimate pressure of the intact pressure hull is 0 56 mpa smaller than the reference 0 65 mpa the typical bifurcation buckling mode presents weaker buckling with three circumferential waves in the cross section it illustrates that the strengthening of the openings can improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shell 16 the ultimate pressure of cylindrical shell calculated by the formulae of ccs 2018 and abs 2018 are 0 75 and 0 73 mpa respectively the semi analytical results are larger than the numerical value 0 56 mpa this may occur because in the rules the approximate ratio of length to diameter of the cylindrical shell is much smaller than the current long span case 5 2 pressure hull with circular openings this model removes the originally strengthened rings of the circular openings and as a result an ultimate pressure of 0 23 mpa is estimated fig 18 it can carry only 41 of the ultimate load of the intact pressure hull illustrating that the openings decrease the ultimate strength greatly however the presence of the ring reinforcements of the openings can improve the buckling strength greatly 5 3 pressure hull with internal ring stiffeners in this model internal ring stiffeners t 29 25 3 4 5 are mounted to each enclosed section at a distance of 320 mm the ultimate pressure is estimated at 1 65 mpa fig 19 the ring stiffened cylindrical shell presents 2 54 times buckling strength more than the unstiffened one 0 65 mpa the presence of the internal ring stiffeners enhances the structural efficiency due to the shorter span length between reinforcing rings 5 4 pressure hull with external ring stiffeners in this model external ring stiffeners t 31 28 5 9 are mounted to every three spans with a distance of 960 mm the ultimate pressure is estimated at 1 20 mpa fig 20 the external ring stiffeners can also improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shell although larger scantling is used for the external ring stiffeners compared to the internal ones the longer span length induces weaker ultimate strength of the pressure hull 1 20 mpa versus 1 65 mpa 6 finite element analysis of prototype submarines the objective here is to validate the finite element analysis with the experimental one first and then to use the validated finite element analysis to evaluate the ultimate strength of the prototype submarines a and b fig 1 here the elastic perfectly plastic material model is defined with a yield stress of 315 mpa the numerically estimated pressures as a function of the maximum deformation for the prototype submarines are shown in fig 21 and their deformation at the ultimate load and post buckling levels are presented in figs 22 and 23 the resulting ultimate strength of the prototype submarines a and b are 2 94 mpa and 1 67 mpa respectively the span length between reinforcing rings affects the buckling and ultimate strength of the cylindrical shell strongly the submarine b with a longer span suffers much more significant dent deformation at the ultimate loading 39 7 mm versus 7 8 mm based on all experimental and numerical analyses some aspects relevant to the buckling behaviour of the tourist submarine pressure hulls are summarised for both submarines a and b the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated at the strengthened openings due to the shell bending figs 22a and 23a the buckling of the cylindrical shell occurs at the upper and the lower structures for submarines a and b respectively their ultimate failures are dominated by the local buckling of the shell between the ring stiffeners figs 22b and 23b overall buckling of the shell together with the stiffeners can be observed at the post ultimate regions figs 22c and 23c 7 conclusions experimental and finite element analyses of the buckling strength of tourist submarines subjected to uniform external pressure have been performed in the present study the ultimate strength analysed by the finite element method is in a good agreement with the experimental one the openings decrease the ultimate strength of the cylindrical pressure hull significantly it is found however that the strengthened openings improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shells with slightly higher ultimate strength than the intact one on the other hand both the internal and external ring stiffeners improve the buckling strength of the cylindrical shells significantly due to the smaller span length between reinforcing rings the analysis procedure employed for evaluating experimentally and numerically the buckling strength of the prototype submarines has proven to be acceptable for the present study it is concluded that the right solution in estimating the ultimate strength of prototype submarines is to use the finite element method validated by the experimental

of mechanical engineering changzhou university jiangsu changzhou 213164 china corresponding author a semi analytical model of the aerodynamic damping for horizontal axis wind turbines was established considering the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of tower top aerodynamic damping forces on the rotor were calculated by the blade element momentum theory and simplified to a resultant force at the tower top and a resultant couple thereafter the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios was suggested subsequently the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbines were calculated by the semi analytical solution and identified from their dynamic response to validate this solution and the sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of control parameters on the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines finally the uncouple analysis method with this aerodynamic damping model was used to predict the dynamic response amplitude of wind turbines wherein the aero servo elastic fully coupled analysis were set as the reference method to examine the reliability of this uncoupled method the results indicated that the uncoupled analysis method employing this aerodynamic damping model can accurately predict the dynamic response of horizontal axis wind turbines excited by a combined wind earthquake loading which is significantly better than the existing uncoupled model keywords aerodynamic damping horizontal axis wind turbine blade element momentum theory uncoupled analysis earthquake 1 introduction the wind power can expand the energy supply and reduce the co2 emissions manwell et al 2009 the global wind energy council forecasts that over 355 gw of new capacity will be added in the next five years implying 71 gw of new installations each year until 2024 gwec 2020 to reduce the levelized cost of wind energy the large scaled horizontal axis wind turbines were widely utilized especially for offshore wind farms and their dynamic responses were sensitive to damping because of the slender and flexible support structures the damping of wind turbines consists of aerodynamic damping and additional damping e g structural hydrodynamic and soil damping wherein the aerodynamic damping is the largest and most variable contributor sinclair 1994 petersen et al 2010 though the tower and nacelle also experiences the aerodynamic damping their contributions to the wind turbine in operating condition can be neglected tarp johansen et al 2009 due to the influence of controller and aeroelasticity the dynamic response of wind turbines indicated aero servo elastic coupling effect jonkman and bull 2005 which could be simulated accurately in the coupled analysis with this method the dynamic behavior of monopile supported offshore wind turbines owts excited by normal and extreme wind wave loadings was investigated see e g jung et al 2015 morato et al 2017 also the seismic response of onshore and offshore wind turbines in different operational conditions were examined see e g asareh et al 2016a yang et al 2019 however it is difficult to model the complex structure and geotechnical materials by using the existing aeroelastic tools of wind turbines katsanos et al 2016 these shortcomings promoted the development of the uncoupled analysis for the dynamic response of wind turbines rezaei et al 2018 in general the uncoupled method was widely used to predict the dynamic response of wind turbines excited by different loadings because it can be implemented using the existing software santangelo et al 2016 asareh et al 2016b schafhirt and muskulus 2018 ju and huang 2019 the aerodynamic damping model was necessity for the uncoupled analysis on the dynamic behavior of wind turbines in the early stage the aerodynamic damping of blades was examined petersen et al 1998 established an aerodynamic damping model using quasi steady analysis this model was immediately used to investigate the aerodynamic damping of the blade in the flapwise and edgewise direction by rasmussen et al 1999 along this line xiong et al 2010 concluded the amplitudes of modal aerodynamic damping ratios for distinct modes were significantly different though these studies were limited to blades they revealed the mechanism of the aerodynamic damping of wind turbines subsequently certain researchers have investigated the aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine system in the context of stall regulation wind turbines several aerodynamic damping models were built for the onshore and offshore wind turbines garrad 1990 kühn 2001 tempel 2006 however the rotational speed of the rotor was assumed to be constant thereafter salzmann and tempel 2005 evaluated these models and extended them to the variable speed owts in the context of modern pitch regulation wind turbines valamanesh and myers 2014 considered the contribution of wind speed and proposed a semi analytical solution to predict the aerodynamic damping ratios of the fore aft fa and side to side ss directions based on the blade element momentum bem theory the similar method was also used to examine the aerodynamic damping ratios of owts chao and philippe 2018 besides liu et al 2017 introduced the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model into the aerodynamic damping model proposed by garrad 1990 to consider the unsteady aerodynamics though the aerodynamic damping ratios of the first fa and ss tower modes were examined in these studies those of higher tower modes have not been evaluated in addition experimental measurements have been directed to identify the damping of wind turbines where the aerodynamic damping was obtained by subtracting additional damping from the total damping shirzadeh et al 2013 the additional damping were estimated from the response of wind turbines in the parked state devriendt et al 2012 2013 carswell et al 2015 bajrić et al 2018 in the tests excitation instruments thomsen et al 2000 or ambient loadings hansen et al 2006 were utilized to induce the vibration of wind turbines then traditional sensors such as accelerometer and strain gauge damgaard et al 2013 thomsen et al 2004 hansen et al 2006 and optical measurement techniques e g photogrammetry and laser interferometry ozbek and rixen 2013 were used to measure the response of wind turbines the time variant characteristic of wind turbines in operating state may cause the traditional operational modal analysis oma to fail therefore the enhanced frequency domain decomposition method koukoura et al 2015 and wavelet based equivalent linearization technique chen et al 2017 were proposed to identify the aerodynamic damping of wind turbines the experimental measurements have become the fundamental tool evaluating the aerodynamic damping however the complexity of measurements and identification restricted their applications the existing semi analytical solutions of modal aerodynamic damping ratios neglected the contribution of tower top rotation however certain researchers proposed that the rotation of tower top may impact the aerodynamic damping of owts chao and philippe 2018 schafhirt and muskulus 2018 moreover the aerodynamic damping ratios of higher tower modes have not been examined in the theoretical models and experiment measures it is assumed that the aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes were identical in the uncoupled analysis for the dynamic response of wind turbines asareh et al 2016b santangelo et al 2016 ju and huang 2019 therefore this study considers the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of tower top and establishes a semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios for different tower modes of horizontal axis wind turbines also the contribution of tower top rotation to the overall aerodynamic damping and the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of higher tower modes are investigated the outline of this paper is as follow firstly aerodynamic loadings along the blades are divided into dynamic loadings and aerodynamic damping loadings secondly the aerodynamic damping loadings are simplified as equivalent damping forces acting at the tower top and the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the system is established finally taking the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbine as examples the aerodynamic damping model is validated and introduced into the uncoupled analysis of the dynamic response of wind turbines 2 aerodynamic loadings on the rotor fig 1 shows a generic three bladed horizontal axis wind turbine and the x y z coordinate system was fixed at the ground where the x axis was along the fa direction of the wind turbine downwind for the horizontal axis wind turbines shaft tilt and rotor precone are usually employed to increase the clearance between the blade and tower however the angles are so little that they were neglected when analyzing the aerodynamic damping in the literature see e g valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 liu et al 2017 therefore it is also assumed that the shaft of wind turbines is horizontal and the blade is vertical in the present study it is assumed that the rotor is subjected to a uniform upstream wind speed v w in the fa direction of wind turbines and rotating around the low speed shaft with an angular velocity ω consistent with the literature garrad 1990 van der tempel 2006 kühn 2001 salzmann and tempel 2005 valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 liu et al 2017 the rotor is also treated as a rigid body in the present study when neglecting the deformation of the support structure the aerodynamic lift and drag experienced by the blade element at radius r are projected into the normal and tangential directions of the rotor plane hansen 2008 1 p n0 1 2 ρ v x 2 sin 2 ϕ c r c n 2 p τ0 1 2 ρ v r 2 cos 2 ϕ c r c t where v w is the wind speed v x v w 1 a v r ω r 1 a c n c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ c t c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ ϕ is the sum of α r t β p t and κ r under the excitation of lateral loadings the support structure of the wind turbine deforms in the wind field which will lead to the oscillation of the rigid rotor in the fa and ss directions the vibration velocity of the blade induced by the translation and rotation of the tower top will change the normal and tangential components of the relative wind speed 3 d v x x β r cos γ i t 4 d v r y cos γ i t α r the aerodynamic loadings on blades of the rotor will be altered by the changes of the relative wind speed felt by the blade element assuming that dv x and dv r are small compared to v x and v r respectively the aerodynamic loadings on the oscillatory blade can be obtained through a first order taylor expansion 5

respectively the vibration velocity of the blade will not only influence the relative wind speed v x and v r but also influence the local flow angle ϕ assuming p n0 and p τ0 are function of v x and ϕ and ϕ is a function of v x the derivatives of aerodynamic loadings can be expressed as 7 d p n0 d v x p n0 v x p n0 ϕ d ϕ d v x 8 d p τ0 d v r p τ0 v r p τ0 ϕ d ϕ d v r introducing denotations they

results of the terms in b and b are shown in appendix a to keep the text concise introducing eqs 3 and 4 into eqs 5 and 6 respectively the incremental changes of aerodynamic loadings acting on the blade can be expressed as 11 d p n d p n0 d v x d v x a b x r β cos γ i t 12 d p τ d p τ0 d v r d v r b a r α y cos γ i t the changes of aerodynamic loadings on the oscillatory rotor shown in eqs 11 and 12 indicate damping effects on the support structure such that they are aerodynamic damping loadings on the rotor of wind turbines 3 semi analytical solution of aerodynamic damping the system of aerodynamic loadings on the oscillatory rotor shown in fig 3 a are simplified to a resultant force acting at the tower top and a resultant couple as shown in fig 3 b the two components of the resultant force are f dx and f dy and the two components of the resultant couple are m dx and m dy 13 f d x i 1 n b 0 r p n d r 14 f d y i 1 n b 0 r p τ cos γ i t d r 15 m dx i 1 n b 0 r r p τ d r 16

the aerodynamic loadings on the rotor are divided into two parts according to their definitions and eqs 1 2 f x0 f y0 m x0 and m y0 are obtained based on the rigid structure and independent with the vibration velocity of the blade such that they can be determined before analyzing the dynamic response of wind turbines df x df y dm x and dm y are caused by the vibration of the rotor and are proportional to the translational or rotational speed of tower top with the opposite direction in fact the similar decomposition of the aerodynamic loadings was also used in the literature valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 subsequently a linearized structural model is established using the finite element method and the rotor nacelle assembly rna is simplified as a lumped mass whose translational and rotational degrees of freedom are considered as the mass and damping properties of wind turbines in the fa and ss directions are different the linearized structure models for the two directions are set up respectively which are shown in fig 4 therefore the tower is modelled with 50 2 d euler bernoulli elements sufficient to investigate the dynamic behavior of wind turbines referring the literature arany et al 2015 feyzollahzadeh et al 2016 and the stiffness and mass matrices of the element are shown in eqs 25 and 26 respectively 25 k e 2 e i l 3 6 6 3 l 3 l 6 6 3 l 3 l

matrix of the corresponding element i e element n in fig 4 should be summed with the attached mass matrices which are m nxz d i a g 0 0 m r i β and m nyz d i a g 0 0 m r i α in the fa and ss direction respectively as shown in fig 4 f x0 f y0 m x0 and m y0 which can be determined in advance are applied at the tower top in the corresponding directions and df x df y dm x and dm y are modelled by dashpot whose the damping coefficient should be determined according to eqs 18 20 22 and 24 to obtain the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines all damping except the aerodynamic damping is neglected the damping matrices of the element n are c nxz d i a g 0 0 c x c β and c nyz d i a g 0 0 c y c α in the fa and ss direction respectively because only the aerodynamic damping is included the elements in the damping matrix of the system are 0 except those corresponding to the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the tower top the governing equations of the wind turbine in the fa and ss directions have the same form 27 m u t c u t k u t f t where m c and k represent the mass stiffness and damping matrices of the system respectively u t is the displacement vector and f t is the external force vector the corresponding mass stiffness and damping matrices and force vector should be taken into eq 27 when it is used to analyze the dynamic behavior of wind turbines in the fa or ss direction in this case the wind turbine is simplified as a cantilever beam with a lump mass at the top which is only used to compute the modes and natural frequencies of the system thus the modal aerodynamic damping ratio ξ i of ith mode shape of wind turbines can be calculated by eq 28 28 ξ i φ i t c φ i 2 ω i φ i t m φ i where φ i and φ i t are the ith mode shape vector of the system and its transpose φ i t respectively ω i is the frequency of the of ith mode shape 4 validation and application the 5 mw wind turbine created by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is taken as the example and its modal aerodynamic damping ratios are determined by the semi analytical solution and a benchmark method subsequently the new aerodynamic damping model is introduced into the uncoupled method to analyze the dynamic response of wind turbines 4 1 the nrel 5 mw wind turbine the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is an upwind horizontal axis wind turbine with three blades and the controller adopts variable speed and blade pitch technology this reference wind turbine is extensively utilized in the wind energy research marino et al 2011 lee et al 2012 tran and kim 2015 the main properties of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine are summarized in table 1 more details of the structure and controller are available in the report of nrel jonkman et al 2009 4 1 1 modes blade pitch angle and rotation speed of rotor to compute the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine some parameters must be determined in advance firstly the modes are analyzed using the structural models described in part 3 and parameters from the report of this wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the first two normalized modes in the fa and ss direction are shown in fig 5 in this report the modes of the tower are expressed in 6 orders polynomial which are shown in table 2 where u is the dimensionless coordinates obtained by the height of section relative to the tower base divided by the tower height to validate the linearized structural model the modes in fig 5 are also expressed in 6 orders polynomial as the following 29 ϕ fa 1 2 51 u 6 6 23 u 5 5 62 u 4 2 2 u 3 0 7 u 2 30 ϕ ss 1 0 55 u 6

tower modes respectively ϕ fa 2 and ϕ ss 2 are the second fa and ss tower modes respectively obviously the tower mode shapes of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine calculated by the linearized model are in good agreement with those reported by jonkman et al 2009 which indicates the structural model is reliable table 3 lists the natural frequencies of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine reported by jonkman et al 2009 and computed using the linearized structural models respectively the errors between them are less than 5 such that the linearized structural model can predict the natural frequencies accurately it should be noted that the frequencies computed by the linearized model do not include modes of the blade because the rna is replaced by a lumped mass subsequently the rotation speed of the rotor and pitch angle of the blade are determined by numerical simulations using fast the controlling strategy and parameters proposed by jonkman et al 2009 is utilized the total time and time step are 600 s and 0 005 s respectively fig 6 shows the rotation speed of the rotor and pitch angle of the blade for different wind speeds when the wind turbine is operating stable and the blade pitch angle is consistent with that reported by the nrel it should be noted that the control strategy affects the value of these parameters which will be evaluated in section 4 2 4 1 2 derivatives of lift and drag coefficients the lift and drag coefficients are determined by the wind tunnel test or numerical simulations consequently it is difficult to express them in continuous functions such that the derivatives of lift and drag coefficients are obtained by difference method in this example the 4th order central difference scheme is utilized to calculate the derivatives of lift and drag coefficients 33 d c l d α α α 0 8 c l 1 c l 1 c l 2 c l 2 12 δ α 34 d c d d α α α 0 8 c d 1 c d 1 c d 2 c d 2 12 δ α where c l 1 c l 1 c l 2 and c l 2 stand for the lift coefficients of the airfoil

2 δ α and α 0 2 δ α respectively the values of the lift and drag coefficients supplied by nrel have a least interval of 0 5 such that δ α is set as 0 5 the blade aerodynamic properties of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine are based on the dowec blades kooijman et al 2003 moriarty and hansen 2005 fig 7 shows the lift and drag coefficient and their derivatives of the du40 airfoil 4 1 3 validation of assumptions during the derivation of the semi analytical solution it is assumed that the pitch angle of the blade is not influenced by the vibration of the blade in appendix a the reliability of this assumption is evaluated using the numerical simulation where the turbulent wind field is utilized the turbsim code jonkman 2009 is used to generate stochastic and turbulent wind samples where the mean wind speed at hub height is 11 4 m s the duration of the wind sample is 650 s to cover the whole simulation and the wind field is discretized into a vertical rectangular grid fixed in the space whose size is 160 m 160 m shown in fig 8 the distance between two adjacent nodes of the grid is 10 m in horizontal and vertical directions for the turbulent wind the kaimal spectrum is employed and the power law with exponent of 0 2 is adopted to determine the wind profile selecting iec turbulence level b in the study all the related parameters of the turbulent wind can be determined according to this standard international electrotechnical commissioniec 61400 1 2005 the time history of the wind speed at the hub height is shown in fig 9 a the blade pitch angle for the rigid and elastic structural models is compared in fig 9 b where a good agreement is achieved the vibration of the blade is neglected when computing the aerodynamic loadings in the rigid structural model therefore the blade pitch angle is independent with the vibration of the blade 4 2 validation of the semi analytical solution 4 2 1 modal aerodynamic damping ratios for different modes to validate the semi analytical solution the modal aerodynamic damping ratios identified from the response of the wind turbine are taken as benchmark the responses are simulated by fast where the steady wind is applied the structural damping of the blade and tower is set to 0 in order that all damping may be attributed to aerodynamic effects then an acceleration impulse at the tower base is acted at the 200th second to avoid the influence of initial conditions following the impulse the decay of the displacement time history of the tower top is recorded and the modal aerodynamic damping ratios are calculated by applying the logarithmic decrement method chopra 2011 to the first and fifth peaks of the displacement time history this model is also utilized by other researchers tarp johansen et al 2009 valamanesh and myers 2014 such that its result is taken as the benchmark and it is important that only the mode whose aerodynamic damping ratio to be identified is included to insure the tower top displacement just contributed by this mode in the simulations the computing of aerodynamic damping forces and modal damping ratios are carried out in matlab for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine fig 10 compares the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first fa and ss tower modes which are determined by the semi analytical solution and the benchmark method respectively for the legends of figures in the following fa represents the fa tower modes while ss denotes the ss tower modes for the first tower mode in the fa direction the aerodynamic damping ratio increases from 4 2 at the low wind speed to 6 5 at the rated wind speed and reduces to 5 6 when the wind speed equals the cut out speed this tendency is in full agreement with the results reported in the literature valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 in the ss direction the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the first tower mode increases monotonously from 0 2 to 1 2 which is significantly less than that in the fa direction and the modal aerodynamic damping ratios obtained by the two methods have the similar trends and the relative errors between them are less than 10 on the whole a good agreement is found for the results of these two methods such that the semi analytical solution is reliable to predict the modal aerodynamic damping ratios for the first fa and ss tower modes in the theoretical model the rotation of the tower top is taken into account to improve the accuracy of the semi analytical solution therefore the errors between these two methods are less compared with the results reported in the literature valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 fig 11 shows modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the second fa and ss tower modes which are also determined by the semi analytical solution and benchmark method respectively on the whole the agreement is found for the results of these two methods such that the semi analytical solution is reliable to predict the aerodynamic damping for the second fa and ss tower modes for the second tower mode in the fa direction the aerodynamic damping ratio calculated by the semi analytical solution increases from 1 2 at the low wind speed to 1 7 at the rated wind speed after which it remains broadly constant in the ss direction the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second tower mode increases monotonously from 0 02 to 0 3 and is significantly less than that in the fa direction this phenomenon is consistent with that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the first flapwise blade mode was significantly larger than those of other modes rasmussen et al 1999 xiong et al 2010 when the uncoupled model was used to analyze the seismic response of wind turbines excited by wind and earthquake it is assumed that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the first two fa tower modes are the same in the literature asareh et al 2016b santangelo et al 2016 ju and huang 2019 according to figs 10 and 11 this assumption is not suitable for the nrel 5 mw wind turbines and its influence will be evaluated in the last section of this study to validate the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping furtherly the wp 1 5 mw wind turbine is taken as the example its main properties are shown in table 4 more details about the structure controller and aerodynamic properties can be obtained from the related report using the similar method as the analysis of nrel 5 mw wind turbines the modal aerodynamic damping ratios for the first two tower modes of the wp 1 5 mw wind turbine are presented in figs 12 and 13 obviously the results of the two methods are consistent that the semi analytical model of aerodynamic damping is reliable 4 2 2 contribution of tower top rotation including the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the tower top a semi analytical solution is established and validated in the present study to assess the influence of tower top rotation on the modal aerodynamic damping ratios the contribution coefficient μ is defined as 35 μ ξ i r ξ i where ξ i r is the modal aerodynamic damping ratio just including the contribution of c α and c β in eqs 22 and 24 respectively while the modal mass includes the contribution of translation and rotation of tower top fig 14 shows the contribution coefficients of the tower top rotation for the first two tower modes in the fa and ss directions where the coefficient for the second modes are significantly larger than the first modes the contribution coefficient for the first fa tower mode is 20 for different wind speeds and that of the first ss tower mode increases from 0 6 to 3 9 for the second fa and ss tower modes the coefficients are larger than 80 for all wind speeds therefore the rotational degrees of freedom of the tower top should be considered when predicting the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines 4 2 3 sensitivity analysis the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios for wind turbines involves the rotation speed of rotor and pitch angle of blade which are determined by the controller manwell et al 2009 the difference of controllers and the inaccuracy of simulations may disturb the value of these parameters thereby impacting the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the wind turbine consequently the influence of these parameters are discussed in the following to evaluate the sensitivity of modal aerodynamic damping ratios fig 15 shows the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine when the rotation speed of the rotor increases by 5 and 10 respectively when the rotation speed of the rotor increases by 5 the largest relative error of modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two tower fa modes is 15 when the rotation speed increases by 10 the largest relative error is 20 meanwhile the relative error is the largest when the wind speed is equal to the rated wind speed therefore the rotation speed of the rotor for different wind speeds should be determined accurately when predicting the modal aerodynamic damping ratio when the average wind speed is larger than the rated wind speed the controller implements blade pitch regular due to the errors of installation and operation the blade pitch angle may be different from the target value also the difference of control strategy will also change the blade pitch angle fig 16 shows the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine when the blade pitch angle increases by 5 and 10 respectively for the case that the wind speed does not exceed the rated wind speed the same value as that of the wind speed equal 12 m s is adopted for the increment of pitch angle obviously the blade pitch angle has a substantial effect on the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the wind turbine especially when the average wind speed is close to the rated wind speed therefore it is necessary to determine the blade pitch angle accurately while computing the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines 4 3 application of the aerodynamic damping model with the emergence of complex support structure and foundation for wind turbines wang et al 2019 the existing analysis software cannot model them accurately therefore the uncoupled method has becoming an important tool while analyzing the dynamic response of wind turbines schafhirt and muskulus 2018 kim and lee 2015 zhao et al 2019 for this part the closed form solution of the modal aerodynamic damping ratios is introduced into the uncoupled model to analyze the dynamic responses of wind turbines the analysis results of the coupled model are taken as the benchmark and all the simulations are implemented by the fast code to ensure that the difference between the two methods lies only in the aerodynamic models 4 3 1 excited by wind only in this section both the coupled and uncoupled models are used to analyze the dynamic response of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine under the excitation of steady and unsteady wind in the uncoupled model the effect of blade vibration is neglected when computing the aerodynamic loadings and the aeroelastic effect is replaced by aerodynamic damping for the figures in the following coupled represents the results using the coupled method and uncoupled refers to the results of the uncoupled method firstly the dynamic response of the wind turbine excited by steady wind is discussed for this circumstance the aerodynamic loadings on the rotor are quasi static loadings such that the vibration velocity and acceleration of the tower are quite small the displacement and bending moment of the tower are shown in fig 17 obviously a good agreement between the results of the two models is achieved therefore the uncoupled method based on the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratio can accurately predict the response of the tower when the wind turbine is excited by steady wind subsequently the dynamic response of the wind turbine excited by unsteady wind is discussed the turbulent wind field is created using the same model described in section 4 1 3 and five samples are generated for each average wind speed at hub height for a specified average wind speed at the hub height the response amplitude of the tower is averaged with respect to the five wind samples in order to consider the randomness of the wind the results of the coupled and uncoupled models are compared where the displacement and bending moment amplitude of the tower calculated by the coupled and uncoupled models are shown in fig 18 the amplitude of tower top displacement and tower base bending moment of the wind turbine with different average wind speeds at hub height are shown in fig 19 the errors between the results of coupled and uncoupled models are within engineering margins so the uncoupled method employing this aerodynamic damping model can predict the response amplitude of the tower accurately 4 3 2 excited by wind and earthquake it is concluded that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second fa tower mode is significantly different from that of the first fa tower mode for wind turbines in section 4 2 1 consequently the uncoupled method adopts two aerodynamic damping models to evaluate the influence of this characteristic the first is the semi analytical solution established in the present study the second assumes the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes are equal which was a widely used assumption see e g asareh et al 2016b santangelo et al 2016 ju and huang 2019 in the following figures uncouple 1 represents the results of the uncoupled analysis employing the first aerodynamic damping model while uncouple 2 denotes the results of the uncoupled method employing the second aerodynamic damping model the consistent turbulent wind field as section 4 3 1 is employed the bolu seismic wave is taken as the input ground motion which is a record of the 1999 duzce earthquake in turkey a complete seismic record has two horizontal and one vertical components because the aeroelasticity is mainly in the fa direction of the wind turbine the simultaneous input of three components will underestimate the error of the uncoupled model therefore the horizontal component shown in fig 20 is used to analyze the seismic response of wind turbines the period of the second tower mode of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is 0 345 s and the corresponding value of the acceleration response spectrum is 2 g according to fig 20 b obviously this record is rich of high frequency components which will stimulate the higher modes of the support structure significantly the total simulation time is set as 600 s and the ground motion begins at the 400th s to avoid the influence of the initial conditions fig 21 shows the response amplitude of the tower when the average wind speed is 11 4 m s and the input ground motion is bolu seismic wave the relative errors of the amplitude of tower response between the coupled model and the first uncoupled model are less than 10 which is within the engineering margin however the second uncoupled model significantly underestimates the tower acceleration shear force and bending moment amplitude the reason is that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second tower mode is significantly overestimated in the second uncoupled model therefore it is necessary to determine the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the higher tower modes accurately subsequently the analysis results of the three models for different average wind speeds are compared the amplitudes of tower top displacement and acceleration and tower base shear force and bending moment for the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbines are shown in figs 22 and 23 for the tower top displacement agreement is found among the results of these three models for the other parameters the second uncoupled model significantly underestimates their amplitudes due to the overestimation of the modal aerodynamic damping ratio for the second fa tower mode the relative errors between the first uncoupled model and the coupled model are less than 10 which meets the requirement of engineering therefore the uncoupled model adopting the new aerodynamic damping model established in this study can predict the seismic response of the wind turbine accurately also the comparisons between the results of the two uncoupled models indicate that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second fa tower mode significantly influence the seismic response of wind turbines therefore it is crucial to determine the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of different modes of wind turbines in the uncoupled model 5 conclusions considering the translation and rotation of tower top the aerodynamic damping forces on the rotor induced by the vibration of the support structure was obtained by the bem theory subsequently a semi analytical solution was proposed by transforming the aerodynamic damping forces into the modal aerodynamic damping ratios for different tower modes of the linearized wind turbines then this model is used to compute the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbines and introduced into the uncoupled analysis of the seismic response of wind turbines the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the proposed semi analytical model is reliable to predict the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines and the uncoupled method employed this aerodynamic damping model can analyze the dynamic response of the horizontal wind turbine excited by the wind alone and wind earthquake combination accurately 2 both the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of tower top are considered in the semi analytical aerodynamic damping model the examples show that the contribution of tower top rotation on the total modal aerodynamic damping ratio for the first fa tower mode is larger than 20 while those for the first two ss tower modes are larger than 80 3 the modal aerodynamic damping ratios are related with the tower modes of wind turbines which is consistent with the characteristic of the aerodynamic damping for the blade the examples indicate that modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second tower mode is significantly less than that of the first tower mode this characteristic will influence the dynamic behavior of wind turbines excited by wind earthquake loading 4 the rotation speed of the rotor and pitch angle of the blade are determined by the control strategy and their variation influence the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines the examples indicate that the errors of these parameters should not exceed 5 to predict the modal aerodynamic damping ratios accurately considering that the foundation of owts has different types the derivation and examples of this aerodynamic damping model are applied on the onshore wind turbine to maintain the universality of the results in fact the new aerodynamic damping model can be directly applied to owts as long as the corresponding natural frequency mode shape mass and damping matrices are introduced into eq 28 moreover the existing uncoupled method with this aerodynamic damping model can be utilized in the finite element analysis of dynamic response of wind turbines wherein more precise structural and geotechnical models can be implemented credit authorship contribution statement renqiang xi conceptualization methodology data curation writing

of mechanical engineering changzhou university jiangsu changzhou 213164 china corresponding author a semi analytical model of the aerodynamic damping for horizontal axis wind turbines was established considering the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of tower top aerodynamic damping forces on the rotor were calculated by the blade element momentum theory and simplified to a resultant force at the tower top and a resultant couple thereafter the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios was suggested subsequently the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbines were calculated by the semi analytical solution and identified from their dynamic response to validate this solution and the sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of control parameters on the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines finally the uncouple analysis method with this aerodynamic damping model was used to predict the dynamic response amplitude of wind turbines wherein the aero servo elastic fully coupled analysis were set as the reference method to examine the reliability of this uncoupled method the results indicated that the uncoupled analysis method employing this aerodynamic damping model can accurately predict the dynamic response of horizontal axis wind turbines excited by a combined wind earthquake loading which is significantly better than the existing uncoupled model keywords aerodynamic damping horizontal axis wind turbine blade element momentum theory uncoupled analysis earthquake 1 introduction the wind power can expand the energy supply and reduce the co2 emissions manwell et al 2009 the global wind energy council forecasts that over 355 gw of new capacity will be added in the next five years implying 71 gw of new installations each year until 2024 gwec 2020 to reduce the levelized cost of wind energy the large scaled horizontal axis wind turbines were widely utilized especially for offshore wind farms and their dynamic responses were sensitive to damping because of the slender and flexible support structures the damping of wind turbines consists of aerodynamic damping and additional damping e g structural hydrodynamic and soil damping wherein the aerodynamic damping is the largest and most variable contributor sinclair 1994 petersen et al 2010 though the tower and nacelle also experiences the aerodynamic damping their contributions to the wind turbine in operating condition can be neglected tarp johansen et al 2009 due to the influence of controller and aeroelasticity the dynamic response of wind turbines indicated aero servo elastic coupling effect jonkman and bull 2005 which could be simulated accurately in the coupled analysis with this method the dynamic behavior of monopile supported offshore wind turbines owts excited by normal and extreme wind wave loadings was investigated see e g jung et al 2015 morato et al 2017 also the seismic response of onshore and offshore wind turbines in different operational conditions were examined see e g asareh et al 2016a yang et al 2019 however it is difficult to model the complex structure and geotechnical materials by using the existing aeroelastic tools of wind turbines katsanos et al 2016 these shortcomings promoted the development of the uncoupled analysis for the dynamic response of wind turbines rezaei et al 2018 in general the uncoupled method was widely used to predict the dynamic response of wind turbines excited by different loadings because it can be implemented using the existing software santangelo et al 2016 asareh et al 2016b schafhirt and muskulus 2018 ju and huang 2019 the aerodynamic damping model was necessity for the uncoupled analysis on the dynamic behavior of wind turbines in the early stage the aerodynamic damping of blades was examined petersen et al 1998 established an aerodynamic damping model using quasi steady analysis this model was immediately used to investigate the aerodynamic damping of the blade in the flapwise and edgewise direction by rasmussen et al 1999 along this line xiong et al 2010 concluded the amplitudes of modal aerodynamic damping ratios for distinct modes were significantly different though these studies were limited to blades they revealed the mechanism of the aerodynamic damping of wind turbines subsequently certain researchers have investigated the aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine system in the context of stall regulation wind turbines several aerodynamic damping models were built for the onshore and offshore wind turbines garrad 1990 kühn 2001 tempel 2006 however the rotational speed of the rotor was assumed to be constant thereafter salzmann and tempel 2005 evaluated these models and extended them to the variable speed owts in the context of modern pitch regulation wind turbines valamanesh and myers 2014 considered the contribution of wind speed and proposed a semi analytical solution to predict the aerodynamic damping ratios of the fore aft fa and side to side ss directions based on the blade element momentum bem theory the similar method was also used to examine the aerodynamic damping ratios of owts chao and philippe 2018 besides liu et al 2017 introduced the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model into the aerodynamic damping model proposed by garrad 1990 to consider the unsteady aerodynamics though the aerodynamic damping ratios of the first fa and ss tower modes were examined in these studies those of higher tower modes have not been evaluated in addition experimental measurements have been directed to identify the damping of wind turbines where the aerodynamic damping was obtained by subtracting additional damping from the total damping shirzadeh et al 2013 the additional damping were estimated from the response of wind turbines in the parked state devriendt et al 2012 2013 carswell et al 2015 bajrić et al 2018 in the tests excitation instruments thomsen et al 2000 or ambient loadings hansen et al 2006 were utilized to induce the vibration of wind turbines then traditional sensors such as accelerometer and strain gauge damgaard et al 2013 thomsen et al 2004 hansen et al 2006 and optical measurement techniques e g photogrammetry and laser interferometry ozbek and rixen 2013 were used to measure the response of wind turbines the time variant characteristic of wind turbines in operating state may cause the traditional operational modal analysis oma to fail therefore the enhanced frequency domain decomposition method koukoura et al 2015 and wavelet based equivalent linearization technique chen et al 2017 were proposed to identify the aerodynamic damping of wind turbines the experimental measurements have become the fundamental tool evaluating the aerodynamic damping however the complexity of measurements and identification restricted their applications the existing semi analytical solutions of modal aerodynamic damping ratios neglected the contribution of tower top rotation however certain researchers proposed that the rotation of tower top may impact the aerodynamic damping of owts chao and philippe 2018 schafhirt and muskulus 2018 moreover the aerodynamic damping ratios of higher tower modes have not been examined in the theoretical models and experiment measures it is assumed that the aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes were identical in the uncoupled analysis for the dynamic response of wind turbines asareh et al 2016b santangelo et al 2016 ju and huang 2019 therefore this study considers the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of tower top and establishes a semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios for different tower modes of horizontal axis wind turbines also the contribution of tower top rotation to the overall aerodynamic damping and the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of higher tower modes are investigated the outline of this paper is as follow firstly aerodynamic loadings along the blades are divided into dynamic loadings and aerodynamic damping loadings secondly the aerodynamic damping loadings are simplified as equivalent damping forces acting at the tower top and the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the system is established finally taking the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbine as examples the aerodynamic damping model is validated and introduced into the uncoupled analysis of the dynamic response of wind turbines 2 aerodynamic loadings on the rotor fig 1 shows a generic three bladed horizontal axis wind turbine and the x y z coordinate system was fixed at the ground where the x axis was along the fa direction of the wind turbine downwind for the horizontal axis wind turbines shaft tilt and rotor precone are usually employed to increase the clearance between the blade and tower however the angles are so little that they were neglected when analyzing the aerodynamic damping in the literature see e g valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 liu et al 2017 therefore it is also assumed that the shaft of wind turbines is horizontal and the blade is vertical in the present study it is assumed that the rotor is subjected to a uniform upstream wind speed v w in the fa direction of wind turbines and rotating around the low speed shaft with an angular velocity ω consistent with the literature garrad 1990 van der tempel 2006 kühn 2001 salzmann and tempel 2005 valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 liu et al 2017 the rotor is also treated as a rigid body in the present study when neglecting the deformation of the support structure the aerodynamic lift and drag experienced by the blade element at radius r are projected into the normal and tangential directions of the rotor plane hansen 2008 1 p n0 1 2 ρ v x 2 sin 2 ϕ c r c n 2 p τ0 1 2 ρ v r 2 cos 2 ϕ c r c t where v w is the wind speed v x v w 1 a v r ω r 1 a c n c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ c t c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ ϕ is the sum of α r t β p t and κ r under the excitation of lateral loadings the support structure of the wind turbine deforms in the wind field which will lead to the oscillation of the rigid rotor in the fa and ss directions the vibration velocity of the blade induced by the translation and rotation of the tower top will change the normal and tangential components of the relative wind speed 3 d v x x β r cos γ i t 4 d v r y cos γ i t α r the aerodynamic loadings on blades of the rotor will be altered by the changes of the relative wind speed felt by the blade element assuming that dv x and dv r are small compared to v x and v r respectively the aerodynamic loadings on the oscillatory blade can be obtained through a first order taylor expansion 5 p n p n0 d p n p n0 d p n0 d v x d v x 6 p τ p τ0 d p τ p τ0 d p τ0 d v r d v r the incremental changes of aerodynamic loadings normal and tangential to the rotor plane are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the vibration velocity of the blade will not only influence the relative wind speed v x and v r but also influence the local flow angle ϕ assuming p n0 and p τ0 are function of v x and ϕ and ϕ is a function of v x the derivatives of aerodynamic loadings can be expressed as 7 d p n0 d v x p n0 v x p n0 ϕ d ϕ d v x 8 d p τ0 d v r p τ0 v r p τ0 ϕ d ϕ d v r introducing denotations they can be simplified as 9 d p n0 d v x a b 10 d p τ0 d v r a b where a p n0 v x ρ c r v x sin 2 ϕ c n a p τ0 v r ρ c r v r cos 2 ϕ c t b p n0 ϕ d ϕ d v x b p τ0 ϕ d ϕ d v r the derivation process and results of the terms in b and b are shown in appendix a to keep the text concise introducing eqs 3 and 4 into eqs 5 and 6 respectively the incremental changes of aerodynamic loadings acting on the blade can be expressed as 11 d p n d p n0 d v x d v x a b x r β cos γ i t 12 d p τ d p τ0 d v r d v r b a r α y cos γ i t the changes of aerodynamic loadings on the oscillatory rotor shown in eqs 11 and 12 indicate damping effects on the support structure such that they are aerodynamic damping loadings on the rotor of wind turbines 3 semi analytical solution of aerodynamic damping the system of aerodynamic loadings on the oscillatory rotor shown in fig 3 a are simplified to a resultant force acting at the tower top and a resultant couple as shown in fig 3 b the two components of the resultant force are f dx and f dy and the two components of the resultant couple are m dx and m dy 13 f d x i 1 n b 0 r p n d r 14 f d y i 1 n b 0 r p τ cos γ i t d r 15 m dx i 1 n b 0 r r p τ d r 16 m d y i 1 n b 0 r p n r cos γ i t d r introducing the expressions of p n and p τ i e eqs 5 and 6 the components of the resultant force and couple in eqs 13 16 can be divided into two parts respectively 17 f x0 i 1 n b 0 r p n0 d r 18 d f x c x x 19 f y0 i 1 n b 0 r p τ0 cos γ i t d r 20 d f y c y y 21 m x0 i 1 n b 0 r r p τ0 d r 22 d m x c α α 23 m y0 i 1 n b 0 r p n0 r cos γ i t d r 24 d m y c β β where f x0 f y0 m x0 and m y0 denote the components of the resultant force and couple of p n0 and p τ0 df x df y dm x and dm y denote the components of the resultant force and couple of d p n and d p τ c x n b 0 r a b d r c y n b 2 0 r b a d r c α n b 0 r b a r 2 d r and c β n b 2 0 r a b r 2 d r and their derivation process is reported in appendix b therefore the resultant forces of the aerodynamic loadings on the rotor are divided into two parts according to their definitions and eqs 1 2 f x0 f y0 m x0 and m y0 are obtained based on the rigid structure and independent with the vibration velocity of the blade such that they can be determined before analyzing the dynamic response of wind turbines df x df y dm x and dm y are caused by the vibration of the rotor and are proportional to the translational or rotational speed of tower top with the opposite direction in fact the similar decomposition of the aerodynamic loadings was also used in the literature valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 subsequently a linearized structural model is established using the finite element method and the rotor nacelle assembly rna is simplified as a lumped mass whose translational and rotational degrees of freedom are considered as the mass and damping properties of wind turbines in the fa and ss directions are different the linearized structure models for the two directions are set up respectively which are shown in fig 4 therefore the tower is modelled with 50 2 d euler bernoulli elements sufficient to investigate the dynamic behavior of wind turbines referring the literature arany et al 2015 feyzollahzadeh et al 2016 and the stiffness and mass matrices of the element are shown in eqs 25 and 26 respectively 25 k e 2 e i l 3 6 6 3 l 3 l 6 6 3 l 3 l

matrix of the corresponding element i e element n in fig 4 should be summed with the attached mass matrices which are m nxz d i a g 0 0 m r i β and m nyz d i a g 0 0 m r i α in the fa and ss direction respectively as shown in fig 4 f x0 f y0 m x0 and m y0 which can be determined in advance are applied at the tower top in the corresponding directions and df x df y dm x and dm y are modelled by dashpot whose the damping coefficient should be determined according to eqs 18 20 22 and 24 to obtain the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines all damping except the aerodynamic damping is neglected the damping matrices of the element n are c nxz d i a g 0 0 c x c β and c nyz d i a g 0 0 c y c α in the fa and ss direction respectively because only the aerodynamic damping is included the elements in the damping matrix of the system are 0 except those corresponding to the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the tower top the governing equations of the wind turbine in the fa and ss directions have the same form 27 m u t c u t k u t f t where m c and k represent the mass stiffness and damping matrices of the system respectively u t is the displacement vector and f t is the external force vector the corresponding mass stiffness and damping matrices and force vector should be taken into eq 27 when it is used to analyze the dynamic behavior of wind turbines in the fa or ss direction in this case the wind turbine is simplified as a cantilever beam with a lump mass at the top which is only used to compute the modes and natural frequencies of the system thus the modal aerodynamic damping ratio ξ i of ith mode shape of wind turbines can be calculated by eq 28 28 ξ i φ i t c φ i 2 ω i φ i t m φ i where φ i and φ i t are the ith mode shape vector of the system and its transpose φ i t respectively ω i is the frequency of the of ith mode shape 4 validation and application the 5 mw wind turbine created by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is taken as the example and its modal aerodynamic damping ratios are determined by the semi analytical solution and a benchmark method subsequently the new aerodynamic damping model is introduced into the uncoupled method to analyze the dynamic response of wind turbines 4 1 the nrel 5 mw wind turbine the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is an upwind horizontal axis wind turbine with three blades and the controller adopts variable speed and blade pitch technology this reference wind turbine is extensively utilized in the wind energy research marino et al 2011 lee et al 2012 tran and kim 2015 the main properties of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine are summarized in table 1 more details of the structure and controller are available in the report of nrel jonkman et al 2009 4 1 1 modes blade pitch angle and rotation speed of rotor to compute the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine some parameters must be determined in advance firstly the modes are analyzed using the structural models described in part 3 and parameters from the report of this wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the first two normalized modes in the fa and ss direction are shown in fig 5 in this report the modes of the tower are expressed in 6 orders polynomial which are shown in table 2 where u is the dimensionless coordinates obtained by the height of section relative to the tower base divided by the tower height to validate the linearized structural model the modes in fig 5 are also expressed in 6 orders polynomial as the following 29 ϕ fa 1 2 51 u 6 6 23 u 5 5 62 u 4 2 2 u 3 0 7 u 2 30 ϕ ss 1 0 55 u 6

tower modes respectively ϕ fa 2 and ϕ ss 2 are the second fa and ss tower modes respectively obviously the tower mode shapes of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine calculated by the linearized model are in good agreement with those reported by jonkman et al 2009 which indicates the structural model is reliable table 3 lists the natural frequencies of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine reported by jonkman et al 2009 and computed using the linearized structural models respectively the errors between them are less than 5 such that the linearized structural model can predict the natural frequencies accurately it should be noted that the frequencies computed by the linearized model do not include modes of the blade because the rna is replaced by a lumped mass subsequently the rotation speed of the rotor and pitch angle of the blade are determined by numerical simulations using fast the controlling strategy and parameters proposed by jonkman et al 2009 is utilized the total time and time step are 600 s and 0 005 s respectively fig 6 shows the rotation speed of the rotor and pitch angle of the blade for different wind speeds when the wind turbine is operating stable and the blade pitch angle is consistent with that reported by the nrel it should be noted that the control strategy affects the value of these parameters which will be evaluated in section 4 2 4 1 2 derivatives of lift and drag coefficients the lift and drag coefficients are determined by the wind tunnel test or numerical simulations consequently it is difficult to express them in continuous functions such that the derivatives of lift and drag coefficients are obtained by difference method in this example the 4th order central difference scheme is utilized to calculate the derivatives of lift and drag coefficients 33 d c l d α α α 0 8 c l 1 c l 1 c l 2 c l 2 12 δ α 34 d c d d α α α 0 8 c d 1 c d 1 c d 2 c d 2 12 δ α where c l 1 c l 1 c l 2 and c l 2 stand for the lift coefficients of the airfoil

2 δ α and α 0 2 δ α respectively the values of the lift and drag coefficients supplied by nrel have a least interval of 0 5 such that δ α is set as 0 5 the blade aerodynamic properties of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine are based on the dowec blades kooijman et al 2003 moriarty and hansen 2005 fig 7 shows the lift and drag coefficient and their derivatives of the du40 airfoil 4 1 3 validation of assumptions during the derivation of the semi analytical solution it is assumed that the pitch angle of the blade is not influenced by the vibration of the blade in appendix a the reliability of this assumption is evaluated using the numerical simulation where the turbulent wind field is utilized the turbsim code jonkman 2009 is used to generate stochastic and turbulent wind samples where the mean wind speed at hub height is 11 4 m s the duration of the wind sample is 650 s to cover the whole simulation and the wind field is discretized into a vertical rectangular grid fixed in the space whose size is 160 m 160 m shown in fig 8 the distance between two adjacent nodes of the grid is 10 m in horizontal and vertical directions for the turbulent wind the kaimal spectrum is employed and the power law with exponent of 0 2 is adopted to determine the wind profile selecting iec turbulence level b in the study all the related parameters of the turbulent wind can be determined according to this standard international electrotechnical commissioniec 61400 1 2005 the time history of the wind speed at the hub height is shown in fig 9 a the blade pitch angle for the rigid and elastic structural models is compared in fig 9 b where a good agreement is achieved the vibration of the blade is neglected when computing the aerodynamic loadings in the rigid structural model therefore the blade pitch angle is independent with the vibration of the blade 4 2 validation of the semi analytical solution 4 2 1 modal aerodynamic damping ratios for different modes to validate the semi analytical solution the modal aerodynamic damping ratios identified from the response of the wind turbine are taken as benchmark the responses are simulated by fast where the steady wind is applied the structural damping of the blade and tower is set to 0 in order that all damping may be attributed to aerodynamic effects then an acceleration impulse at the tower base is acted at the 200th second to avoid the influence of initial conditions following the impulse the decay of the displacement time history of the tower top is recorded and the modal aerodynamic damping ratios are calculated by applying the logarithmic decrement method chopra 2011 to the first and fifth peaks of the displacement time history this model is also utilized by other researchers tarp johansen et al 2009 valamanesh and myers 2014 such that its result is taken as the benchmark and it is important that only the mode whose aerodynamic damping ratio to be identified is included to insure the tower top displacement just contributed by this mode in the simulations the computing of aerodynamic damping forces and modal damping ratios are carried out in matlab for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine fig 10 compares the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first fa and ss tower modes which are determined by the semi analytical solution and the benchmark method respectively for the legends of figures in the following fa represents the fa tower modes while ss denotes the ss tower modes for the first tower mode in the fa direction the aerodynamic damping ratio increases from 4 2 at the low wind speed to 6 5 at the rated wind speed and reduces to 5 6 when the wind speed equals the cut out speed this tendency is in full agreement with the results reported in the literature valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 in the ss direction the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the first tower mode increases monotonously from 0 2 to 1 2 which is significantly less than that in the fa direction and the modal aerodynamic damping ratios obtained by the two methods have the similar trends and the relative errors between them are less than 10 on the whole a good agreement is found for the results of these two methods such that the semi analytical solution is reliable to predict the modal aerodynamic damping ratios for the first fa and ss tower modes in the theoretical model the rotation of the tower top is taken into account to improve the accuracy of the semi analytical solution therefore the errors between these two methods are less compared with the results reported in the literature valamanesh and myers 2014 chao and philippe 2018 fig 11 shows modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the second fa and ss tower modes which are also determined by the semi analytical solution and benchmark method respectively on the whole the agreement is found for the results of these two methods such that the semi analytical solution is reliable to predict the aerodynamic damping for the second fa and ss tower modes for the second tower mode in the fa direction the aerodynamic damping ratio calculated by the semi analytical solution increases from 1 2 at the low wind speed to 1 7 at the rated wind speed after which it remains broadly constant in the ss direction the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second tower mode increases monotonously from 0 02 to 0 3 and is significantly less than that in the fa direction this phenomenon is consistent with that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the first flapwise blade mode was significantly larger than those of other modes rasmussen et al 1999 xiong et al 2010 when the uncoupled model was used to analyze the seismic response of wind turbines excited by wind and earthquake it is assumed that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the first two fa tower modes are the same in the literature asareh et al 2016b santangelo et al 2016 ju and huang 2019 according to figs 10 and 11 this assumption is not suitable for the nrel 5 mw wind turbines and its influence will be evaluated in the last section of this study to validate the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping furtherly the wp 1 5 mw wind turbine is taken as the example its main properties are shown in table 4 more details about the structure controller and aerodynamic properties can be obtained from the related report using the similar method as the analysis of nrel 5 mw wind turbines the modal aerodynamic damping ratios for the first two tower modes of the wp 1 5 mw wind turbine are presented in figs 12 and 13 obviously the results of the two methods are consistent that the semi analytical model of aerodynamic damping is reliable 4 2 2 contribution of tower top rotation including the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the tower top a semi analytical solution is established and validated in the present study to assess the influence of tower top rotation on the modal aerodynamic damping ratios the contribution coefficient μ is defined as 35 μ ξ i r ξ i where ξ i r is the modal aerodynamic damping ratio just including the contribution of c α and c β in eqs 22 and 24 respectively while the modal mass includes the contribution of translation and rotation of tower top fig 14 shows the contribution coefficients of the tower top rotation for the first two tower modes in the fa and ss directions where the coefficient for the second modes are significantly larger than the first modes the contribution coefficient for the first fa tower mode is 20 for different wind speeds and that of the first ss tower mode increases from 0 6 to 3 9 for the second fa and ss tower modes the coefficients are larger than 80 for all wind speeds therefore the rotational degrees of freedom of the tower top should be considered when predicting the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines 4 2 3 sensitivity analysis the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratios for wind turbines involves the rotation speed of rotor and pitch angle of blade which are determined by the controller manwell et al 2009 the difference of controllers and the inaccuracy of simulations may disturb the value of these parameters thereby impacting the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the wind turbine consequently the influence of these parameters are discussed in the following to evaluate the sensitivity of modal aerodynamic damping ratios fig 15 shows the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine when the rotation speed of the rotor increases by 5 and 10 respectively when the rotation speed of the rotor increases by 5 the largest relative error of modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two tower fa modes is 15 when the rotation speed increases by 10 the largest relative error is 20 meanwhile the relative error is the largest when the wind speed is equal to the rated wind speed therefore the rotation speed of the rotor for different wind speeds should be determined accurately when predicting the modal aerodynamic damping ratio when the average wind speed is larger than the rated wind speed the controller implements blade pitch regular due to the errors of installation and operation the blade pitch angle may be different from the target value also the difference of control strategy will also change the blade pitch angle fig 16 shows the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine when the blade pitch angle increases by 5 and 10 respectively for the case that the wind speed does not exceed the rated wind speed the same value as that of the wind speed equal 12 m s is adopted for the increment of pitch angle obviously the blade pitch angle has a substantial effect on the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the wind turbine especially when the average wind speed is close to the rated wind speed therefore it is necessary to determine the blade pitch angle accurately while computing the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines 4 3 application of the aerodynamic damping model with the emergence of complex support structure and foundation for wind turbines wang et al 2019 the existing analysis software cannot model them accurately therefore the uncoupled method has becoming an important tool while analyzing the dynamic response of wind turbines schafhirt and muskulus 2018 kim and lee 2015 zhao et al 2019 for this part the closed form solution of the modal aerodynamic damping ratios is introduced into the uncoupled model to analyze the dynamic responses of wind turbines the analysis results of the coupled model are taken as the benchmark and all the simulations are implemented by the fast code to ensure that the difference between the two methods lies only in the aerodynamic models 4 3 1 excited by wind only in this section both the coupled and uncoupled models are used to analyze the dynamic response of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine under the excitation of steady and unsteady wind in the uncoupled model the effect of blade vibration is neglected when computing the aerodynamic loadings and the aeroelastic effect is replaced by aerodynamic damping for the figures in the following coupled represents the results using the coupled method and uncoupled refers to the results of the uncoupled method firstly the dynamic response of the wind turbine excited by steady wind is discussed for this circumstance the aerodynamic loadings on the rotor are quasi static loadings such that the vibration velocity and acceleration of the tower are quite small the displacement and bending moment of the tower are shown in fig 17 obviously a good agreement between the results of the two models is achieved therefore the uncoupled method based on the semi analytical solution of modal aerodynamic damping ratio can accurately predict the response of the tower when the wind turbine is excited by steady wind subsequently the dynamic response of the wind turbine excited by unsteady wind is discussed the turbulent wind field is created using the same model described in section 4 1 3 and five samples are generated for each average wind speed at hub height for a specified average wind speed at the hub height the response amplitude of the tower is averaged with respect to the five wind samples in order to consider the randomness of the wind the results of the coupled and uncoupled models are compared where the displacement and bending moment amplitude of the tower calculated by the coupled and uncoupled models are shown in fig 18 the amplitude of tower top displacement and tower base bending moment of the wind turbine with different average wind speeds at hub height are shown in fig 19 the errors between the results of coupled and uncoupled models are within engineering margins so the uncoupled method employing this aerodynamic damping model can predict the response amplitude of the tower accurately 4 3 2 excited by wind and earthquake it is concluded that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second fa tower mode is significantly different from that of the first fa tower mode for wind turbines in section 4 2 1 consequently the uncoupled method adopts two aerodynamic damping models to evaluate the influence of this characteristic the first is the semi analytical solution established in the present study the second assumes the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the first two fa tower modes are equal which was a widely used assumption see e g asareh et al 2016b santangelo et al 2016 ju and huang 2019 in the following figures uncouple 1 represents the results of the uncoupled analysis employing the first aerodynamic damping model while uncouple 2 denotes the results of the uncoupled method employing the second aerodynamic damping model the consistent turbulent wind field as section 4 3 1 is employed the bolu seismic wave is taken as the input ground motion which is a record of the 1999 duzce earthquake in turkey a complete seismic record has two horizontal and one vertical components because the aeroelasticity is mainly in the fa direction of the wind turbine the simultaneous input of three components will underestimate the error of the uncoupled model therefore the horizontal component shown in fig 20 is used to analyze the seismic response of wind turbines the period of the second tower mode of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is 0 345 s and the corresponding value of the acceleration response spectrum is 2 g according to fig 20 b obviously this record is rich of high frequency components which will stimulate the higher modes of the support structure significantly the total simulation time is set as 600 s and the ground motion begins at the 400th s to avoid the influence of the initial conditions fig 21 shows the response amplitude of the tower when the average wind speed is 11 4 m s and the input ground motion is bolu seismic wave the relative errors of the amplitude of tower response between the coupled model and the first uncoupled model are less than 10 which is within the engineering margin however the second uncoupled model significantly underestimates the tower acceleration shear force and bending moment amplitude the reason is that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second tower mode is significantly overestimated in the second uncoupled model therefore it is necessary to determine the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the higher tower modes accurately subsequently the analysis results of the three models for different average wind speeds are compared the amplitudes of tower top displacement and acceleration and tower base shear force and bending moment for the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbines are shown in figs 22 and 23 for the tower top displacement agreement is found among the results of these three models for the other parameters the second uncoupled model significantly underestimates their amplitudes due to the overestimation of the modal aerodynamic damping ratio for the second fa tower mode the relative errors between the first uncoupled model and the coupled model are less than 10 which meets the requirement of engineering therefore the uncoupled model adopting the new aerodynamic damping model established in this study can predict the seismic response of the wind turbine accurately also the comparisons between the results of the two uncoupled models indicate that the modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second fa tower mode significantly influence the seismic response of wind turbines therefore it is crucial to determine the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of different modes of wind turbines in the uncoupled model 5 conclusions considering the translation and rotation of tower top the aerodynamic damping forces on the rotor induced by the vibration of the support structure was obtained by the bem theory subsequently a semi analytical solution was proposed by transforming the aerodynamic damping forces into the modal aerodynamic damping ratios for different tower modes of the linearized wind turbines then this model is used to compute the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of the nrel 5 mw and wp 1 5 mw wind turbines and introduced into the uncoupled analysis of the seismic response of wind turbines the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the proposed semi analytical model is reliable to predict the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines and the uncoupled method employed this aerodynamic damping model can analyze the dynamic response of the horizontal wind turbine excited by the wind alone and wind earthquake combination accurately 2 both the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of tower top are considered in the semi analytical aerodynamic damping model the examples show that the contribution of tower top rotation on the total modal aerodynamic damping ratio for the first fa tower mode is larger than 20 while those for the first two ss tower modes are larger than 80 3 the modal aerodynamic damping ratios are related with the tower modes of wind turbines which is consistent with the characteristic of the aerodynamic damping for the blade the examples indicate that modal aerodynamic damping ratio of the second tower mode is significantly less than that of the first tower mode this characteristic will influence the dynamic behavior of wind turbines excited by wind earthquake loading 4 the rotation speed of the rotor and pitch angle of the blade are determined by the control strategy and their variation influence the modal aerodynamic damping ratios of wind turbines the examples indicate that the errors of these parameters should not exceed 5 to predict the modal aerodynamic damping ratios accurately considering that the foundation of owts has different types the derivation and examples of this aerodynamic damping model are applied on the onshore wind turbine to maintain the universality of the results in fact the new aerodynamic damping model can be directly applied to owts as long as the corresponding natural frequency mode shape mass and damping matrices are introduced into eq 28 moreover the existing uncoupled method with this aerodynamic damping model can be utilized in the finite element analysis of dynamic response of wind turbines wherein more precise structural and geotechnical models can be implemented credit authorship contribution statement renqiang xi conceptualization methodology data curation writing

21618,a composite casing is a new kind of pipe string composed of an upper conductor and a lower casing it reduces the installation time considerably and can be applied to hard formations however the wellhead stability when using a composite casing is not the same as that of a conventional conductor and it is not yet well understood a mechanical model was established to evaluate the wellhead stability considering the effects of the cement waiting time and end resistance force of the joint the results showed that the composite casing structure had better stability than previous conventional jetting conductors sensitivity analysis was also conducted first in the horizontal direction the influence of the load was mainly within 30 m below the mudline while in the vertical direction the influence of the load was as deep as 80 m second the end resistance force of the joint was large and thus could not be ignored third the composite casing composed of a conductor with a larger size had relatively good stability and lower horizontal displacement and vertical load the top tension of the riser should be designed to be relatively large finally the waiting time which was short was sufficient to obtain the required stability and it should be designed by considering other factors the results of this article will contribute to the drilling design of composite casings in the future keywords composite casing wellhead stability deepwater drilling cement 1 introduction deepwater drilling is characterized by massive investments and high risk bo et al 2014 which drive the drilling process to be as short reliable and safe as possible when drilling in a deepwater shallow formation several geological hazards may be encountered such as shallow gas shallow water flow and gas hydrates dutta et al 2010 therefore the establishment of a wellhead and drilling fluid circulation channel is very important in shallow formations a blowout preventer bop is usually installed after the surface casing strings are cemented before the surface casing strings are run in a conductor pipe which supports the complex load from the wellhead should be installed traditionally two methods are used when setting up a conductor pipe molaschi et al 2010 1 drilling a 36 in or 42 in hole and running a 30 in or 36 in conductor pipe 2 jetting with a 30 in or 36 in conductor pipe and then drilling ahead the first method involves four round trips before the bop is installed two drilling phases and two cementing jobs this technique is time consuming and costly moreover the verticality and concentricity of the conductor pipe cannot be guaranteed the second method which contains only two round trips one jetting and drilling phase and one cementing job phase is a more commonly used method in deepwater drilling after the conductor pipe is set to the desired depth by jetting the drill ahead tool is released and a following hole is drilled to the setting depth of surface casing however if hard formations are encountered jetting cannot be applied and it is necessary to drill a hole a new kind of composite casing string also called a dual casing which is composed of upper conductor and lower conductor sections was introduced to overcome these problems when a composite casing is used it enables the drilling of a tapered hole with two different diameters in one unique riser less drilling phase using a tandem bottom hole assembly and running the conductor pipe and surface casing together calderoni et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 the surface casing and conductor were run as a single assembly and the cementing job was performed in the same stage for both casings allowing a reduction of the operation time and costs compared with those of a conventional jetting conductor in previous jetting methods the conductor must be stable under bending moment horizontal force and vertical force when the composite casing is applied the upper conductor and lower casing combined with cement can withstand the complex load as a whole composite casing technology was successfully implemented in roncador field campos basin in 2017 with a water depth of about 1800 m which led to a large reduction in the operation time and costs roberto et al 2018 molaschi et al 2010 reported the field application of a composite casing structure when using a conventional conductor the installation time was 110 140 h when using a composite casing structure the installation time decreased to 40 80 h the wellhead stability of a composite casing string is not well understood because of the highly unconsolidated soil and low bearing capacity of the shallow formation a deepwater environment will bring complex wind wave and current loads the loads will be transferred to the wellhead through the risers which may cause a large lateral displacement or even failure of the wellhead in addition if the vertical bearing capacity of the surface pipe is insufficient it may cause the sinking of the wellhead which will result in severe drilling accidents previous studies on wellheads mainly focused on the wellhead stability of conventional jetting conductors yan et al 2015 established a numerical model of subsea wellhead stability using the pile and nonlinear spring elements of ansys this model was used to analyze the effects of the drilling vessel s offsets and top tension ratio wang et al 2015 analyzed the subsea wellhead stability of a deepwater conductor using the finite element method considering contact interface models between the pile and soil the authors suggested that the conductor bearing capacity should be calculated using different contact models between the pile and soil and the minimum value should be taken as the conductor design basis xu et al 2017 studied a risk assessment method of subsea wellhead instability considering the uncertain factors in deepwater drilling including the water depth current speed and resistance coefficient kan et al 2018 studied the bearing capacity of a novel deepwater composite drilling conductor which consisted of a bucket foundation and drilling conductor deng et al 2019 studied deepwater subsea wellhead shallow casing deflection considering the system mass forces by simulations and experiments there have been no publications on the wellhead stability of the composite casings used in deepwater drilling there are some differences between the composite casing strings and the jetting conductor strings first the upper section is different if a conventional conductor is used the upper section consists of concentric pipes while it becomes a single layer when a composite casing is applied which may lead to a decrease in the lateral bearing capacity second the cementing operation is different because the cement slurry is pumped up to the seabed mudline for the composite casing while the conventional conductor does not require cementing third for composite casing there is a terrace at the joint that connects the upper conductor and lower casing string which may lead to a change in the axial force transfer therefore the wellhead stability analysis methods in previous references may no longer be applicable to composite casings in this study a mechanical model was constructed to evaluate the wellhead stability of a composite casing by considering the horizontal displacement bending moment and axial force the horizontal stability and the transfer of vertical axial forces were analyzed the results of this study will contribute to the drilling design and control of composite casings in the future 2 mechanical model 2 1 lateral deflection model the composite casing and cement are taken as an integral structure to withstand the moment and force together the force diagram of the casing cement structure is shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b shows the force diagram of a small segment of the casing cement structure for a small segment of the casing cement structure the moment equilibrium equation can be expressed as follows 1 m x d m m x n x d y q x d x 0 where m x is the bending moment on the casing cement structure n m n x is the axial force n and q is the shearing force n according to the theory of structural mechanics the moment transfer can be expressed as follows 2 d m x d x q x cos θ n x sin θ q x n x d y d x 3 m e i x d 2 y d x 2 where θ is the deflection angle dimensionless and e i x is the stiffness of the casing cement structure n m2 the horizontal force balance can be expressed as follows 4 d q x d x d x p x where p x y is the subgrade reaction force per unit area n m2 and d x is the outer diameter m which changes with depth because the casing cement structure is tapered by substituting equations 2 4 into equation 1 the differential equation of deflection can be obtained as follows 5 d d x 2 e i x d 2 y d x 2 d d x n x d y d x d x p x y 0 each term in equation 5 varies with depth 2 2 vertical axial force in the vertical section the bearing capacity generated by the shallow soil should be larger than the wellhead load otherwise the wellhead will sink under the large vertical load after the bop is installed the axial force of any node except the node under the joint can be obtained as follows 6 n i 1 n i w x d x above the mudline n i w x d x π d x f d x n i 0 below the mudline n i w x d x π d x f d x f q n i 0 the joint position 0 n i 0 where f q is the end resistance force of the terrace generated by the vertical compression of the soil which can be calculated as follows 7 f q q π d cem 1 2 d cem 2 2 4 where q is the unit area end resistance force w x is the unit length weight of the casing cement structure n m which can be calculated as follows 8 w x w c o n above mudline section w c o n w c e m 1 cemented conductor section w c a s w c e m 2 cemented casing section w c o n and w c a s are the unit length weights of the upper conductor pipe and lower casing pipe n m respectively and w c e m 1 and w c e m 2 are the unit length weights of the cement at the upper and lower sections respectively n m 2 2 1 lateral friction force a composite casing can be longer than 1000 m and thus the vertical bearing capacity can be met a major concern is the depth to which the effect of the vertical force can be transferred from which the depth of the joint can be optimized from the viewpoint of classic tribology the friction force can be calculated by a contact force multiplied by a friction coefficient however the friction coefficient changes with depth and is difficult to determine moreover when a hole is drilled in a shallow formation it will cause certain disturbance in the weak consolidated formation which will recover to some degree with time the unit area friction of the outer cement surface generated by the formation can be calculated as follows 9 f α t s u where α t is the time dependent adhesion coefficient on the average friction factor dimensionless and s u is the undrained shear strength of shallow soil n m2 which should be measured or predicted by a fit through available data the total friction force can be calculated as follows 10 f f f f 0 α t π d s u d l where f 0 is the initial capacity at t 0 01 d n which can be considered to be 0 as its value is quite small generally jeanjean 2002 determined the equation for α t using an existing database of load tests on jetted conductors 11 α t 0 055 2 log t where t is the waiting time after the drilling process d 2 2 2 end resistance force of the joint at the depth of the joint position the cement sheath diameter changes and the tapered joint behaves like an annular pile unlike the lateral friction force which arises from the slip deformation of the soil around the cement the end resistance force of the pile arises from the compression deformation therefore the end resistance force at the joint position should be calculated which will lead to a drop off of the axial force for clayey soil the unit area end resistance force can be calculated as follows rausche et al 2004 12 q n c s u where n c is the bearing capacity coefficient dimensionless which can be calculated as follows 13 n c 6 1 0 2 d b u r i e d d w b 9 where d b u r i e d is the buried depth under the seabed and d w b can be considered to be the diameter of the wellhole m for sandy soil the unit area end resistance force can be calculated as follows 14 q 0 3 γ 2 b n γ p 0 n q 1 where γ 2 is the average effective weight of the soil kg m3 p 0 is the overburden pressure pa and n γ and n q are the bearing capacity coefficients dimensionless of the drained granular soil based on the angle of internal friction given by api 2000 2 3 horizontal subgrade reaction force when the conductor pipe deflects under the moment and the complex loads in the vertical and horizontal directions a horizontal subgrade reaction force will be generated by the surrounding soil generally the horizontal subgrade reaction force can be calculated by three methods based on different assumptions 1 the ultimate foundation reaction method 2 the elastic subgrade reaction method and 3 the elastic plastic subgrade reaction method the elastic plastic subgrade reaction method is the most widely used method as it can describe the non linear characteristics between the string and the shallow formation furthermore it can be used to analyze the transverse bearing capacity of the string with greater accuracy than other methods it is also known as the p y curve method the p y curve can be obtained by shallow geological survey parameters when the p y curve is obtained the secant modulus can be calculated from it as follows 15 p e s y where e s is the secant modulus of the subgrade force in a shallow formation n m3 however the p y curve is sometimes absent or incomplete in which case the modulus can be calculated based on the following empirical equation yan et al 2015 16 e s 12000 s u 2 4 casing cement structure flexural rigidity assuming that the deformation of the composite casing and cement is within the range of elastic deformation and no slippage occurs at the bonding interface between the casing and cement for the tapered casing cement structure each segment is a concentric cylinder the total bending stiffness can be calculated as follows 17 e i e st i c o n above mudline section e s t i c o n a e c e m i c e m 1 cemented conductor section e s t i c a s a e c e m i c e m 2 cemented casing section where e s t and e c e m are the elasticity modulus of the casing conductor and cement mpa respectively and i c o n i c a s i c e m 1 and i c e m 2 are the sectional moments of inertia of the upper conductor lower casing upper cement and lower cement m4 respectively considering the possibility of concrete cracking when the casing cement structure is bent the flexural stiffness of the concrete part is reduced appropriately by introducing the coefficient a for circular steel concrete structures the reduction coefficient can be set to 0 8 lin and you 2004 3 numerical simulations 3 1 difference equations to facilitate the installation of the wellhead and bop the upper end of the conductor is generally several meters higher 3 m in this article than the mudline as shown in fig 3 the whole casing cement structure can be divided into several parts of the same length h using the finite difference method from the top to the bottom of the casing cement structure the node numbers were set as 0 1 2 3 i n 1 n the microsections with lengths of h on the top and bottom of the structure were increased by two segments as shown in fig 3 equation 5 can be converted into a system of difference equations including n 1 difference equations which can be written as follows 18 a

obtained by combining the n 5 equations once the horizontal displacement profile is obtained the bending moment deflection angle and shearing force profiles can be calculated as following 24 θ i y i 1

on the shallow soil data from the geological survey presented by yan et al 2015 which is summarized in table 1 the undrained shear strength of soil at any depth can be predicted by the data of the top and bottom points of the local soil layer the shallow geological survey only provided data to a depth of 100 3 m and the parameters of deeper sections were predicted from the obtained data using linear fitting methods the length of the upper conductor was set to be 50 m and the length of lower casing length was 150 m for this example the length of the surface casing can be longer in engineering practice however the bending moment and load cannot be transferred too deeply the waiting time was set to be 4 d the maximum loads imposed on the wellhead were determined to be as follows n t 2 5 10 6 n m t 2 10 6 k n m and q t 6 10 4 n 4 1 comparison with jetting conductor in this section the wellhead stabilities when the composite casing and conventional jetting conductor were used are compared the calculation of the conventional jetting conductor was conducted using the model built by guan 2009 and calculation of the composite casing was conducted using the model developed in this article the horizontal displacement profile bending moment and subgrade reaction force when using composite casing and the conventional jetting conductor are shown in figs 4 6 the horizontal displacement was smaller when using the composite casing than when using the jetting conductor although the bending stiffness of the composite casing structure was smaller the outer diameter of the cement sheath was larger which resulted in a larger subgrade reaction force when it was deflected however the bending moment showed small differences when using different casing structures in essence the composite casing structure with a higher installation efficiency which was demonstrated by calderoni et al 2011 showed even better stability than previous conventional jetting conductors 4 2 sensitivity analysis in this section all the factors were fixed during the calculation except for the one that was being analyzed the wellhead stability was studied by analyzing the horizontal deflection moment shearing force and axial force the results and discussions are as follows 4 2 1 effects of parameters of upper conductor the effects of the parameters of the upper conductor on the horizontal deflection of the casing cement structure are shown in fig 7 when the outer diameter of the conductor was 36 in and the wall thickness was 1 5 in the horizontal deflection at the top was the smallest of all the conductors the horizontal deflection of the conductor with a 30 in diameter and 1 in wall thickness was 0 89 m which was the largest and decreased faster than those of the other conductors regardless of the conductor size the horizontal deflection of the casing cement structure was mainly concentrated in the shallow section where the depth was shallower than 30 m which is consistent with the conclusions of guan 2009 for conventional conductor structures when the depth was larger than 30 m the horizontal deflection decreased and tended to zero the effects of the parameters of the upper conductor on the bending moment of the casing cement structure are shown in fig 8 the moments of the different upper conductors exhibited similar variation trends first the moments increased linearly in the section above the mudline because of the horizontal force on the wellhead after which they decreased and tended to zero similar to the horizontal deflection variation the bending moment of the 30 in 1 in conductor was smaller than those of the other conductors and the bending moment of 36 in 1 5 in conductor was the largest when the depth shallower than 20 m the horizontal subgrade reaction force is shown in fig 9 when the size of the upper conductor was 30 in 1 in the maximum subgrade reaction force was 51 kn m although the diameter was not the largest its horizontal deflection was the largest and the subgrade force was proportional to the outer diameter and horizontal deflection as shown in equation 4 furthermore the subgrade reaction force of the 30 in 1 in conductor had the largest value in the opposite direction and converged to zero the fastest fig 10 shows the change of the axial force profile along the casing cement structure with depth the axial forces of the 36 in 1 in and 36 in 1 5 in conductors decreased to 0 n at the depth of the joint while the axial forces of the 30 in 1 in and 30 in 1 5 in conductors decreased to 0 at depths of 63 65 m because the conductor with a larger diameter collocated larger cement sheath diameter which led to a larger vertical friction force in addition the axial force dropped sharply at the joint position because of the end resistance force of the joint in particular when the conductor diameter was 36 in the axial force dropped to 0 n directly because the pile end resistance force was too large the axial force of the conductor with a 1 in thickness decreased slightly faster than that of a 1 5 in conductor because of the difference in the conductor weight based on figs 7 10 the composite casing with the 36 in 1 5 in conductor had relatively good stability especially in the horizontal direction 4 2 2 effects of external load in this section several groups of external loads bending moment horizontal load and vertical load were used in the calculations the values are shown in table 3 fig 11 shows the horizontal displacement under different load conditions the horizontal deflection curves under conditions i and ii were similar as were the deflection curves of conditions iii and iv for the load groupings shown in table 3 it was concluded that the deflection of the casing cement structure was mainly affected by the bending moment applied at the top changing either the horizontal or vertical load did not have a significant influence on the deflection curve when it was under external load condition iii the horizontal deflection at the top was 0 83 m and for condition i the horizontal deflection at the top dropped to 0 406 m figs 12 and 13 show the bending moment and horizontal subgrade reaction force respectively under different load conditions similar to the horizontal displacement the bending moment curves or subgrade reaction force curves under conditions i and ii were similar as were those under conditions iii and iv the moment curves above the mudline under condition i had the lowest slopes because the horizontal load was smaller than those under the other conditions fig 14 shows the axial force of the casing cement structure under different load conditions the black red and blue curves coincide which indicates that the axial force was almost unaffected by the bending moment and horizontal load because the friction force was set to be affected by the waiting time and the initial undrained shear strength only as shown in equation 9 the axial force increased slightly in the shallow section decreased with depth and dropped sharply in the joint section if the vertical load was small the axial force was counteracted completely at the joint depth by the friction force and pile end resistance force if the vertical load was as large as 2 5 mn the neutral depth was deeper than 65 2 m from the discussion above the bending moment significantly influenced the horizontal displacement and the vertical load mainly affected the axial force transfer of the casing cement structure previous studies concluded that a larger top tension of the riser would lead to a smaller vertical load and smaller bending moment on the wellhead jin et al 2015 tucker and murtha 1973 wang et al 2016 therefore the top tension of the riser should be designed to be large within the allowable range 4 2 3 effects of waiting time jetting drilling requires several days of waiting time after the conductor is run into the determined depth to regain an adequate friction force from the subsea soil and the required minimum depth of the jetting conductor depends on the waiting time generally the minimum depth negatively correlates with the waiting time zhou et al 2014 when a composite casing is run into the determined depth it also requires a waiting period because it takes some time for the cement slurry to become solid here the effects of the waiting time are discussed the results are shown in figs 15 18 from figs 15 and 16 it was concluded that the waiting time only had small effects on the horizontal displacement and bending moment but significant effects on the subgrade reaction and axial forces the longer the waiting time the larger the horizontal subgrade reaction force in this model the cement sheath was assumed to be strong enough and the subgrade reaction force was mainly affected by the soil characteristics in the vertical direction if the waiting time was 7 d the depth of the axial force neutral point was about 60 m and if the waiting time was 1 d the depth was about 81 m when the conventional jetting conductor was used wellhead sinking occurred if the waiting time was inadequate as shown in fig 18 the axial force was neutralized by friction at a depth 60 80 m which was shallower than that of the composite casing structure based on the discussion above the waiting time mainly affected the transfer of the axial force and had a small influence on the horizontal displacement thus its influence on wellhead stability was small in practice the waiting time is the interval between the cementing job and the next operation it is affected by other factors including the waiting on cement woc time the daily cost of the drilling vessel and the preparation of the next operation therefore the waiting time should be designed by considering these factors 5 conclusions 1 based on the theory of pile foundations and material mechanics an analysis model for the lateral bearing capacities of composite casings was established that accounted for the effects of the cement waiting time and end resistance force of the joint 2 the composite casing structure exhibited better stability than the conventional jetting conductor 3 in the horizontal direction the influence of the load was mainly within 30 m below the mudline while in the vertical direction the influence of the load could be as deep as 80 m 4 the end resistance force of the joint was large and hence it cannot be ignored 5 the composite casing composed of a conductor with a larger size had relatively good stability to lower the horizontal displacement and vertical load the top tension of the riser should be relatively large 6 the effect of the waiting time on the wellhead stability was not significant and the waiting time should be designed by taking other factors into consideration credit authorship contribution statement wenlong li conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft writing review editing deli

21618,a composite casing is a new kind of pipe string composed of an upper conductor and a lower casing it reduces the installation time considerably and can be applied to hard formations however the wellhead stability when using a composite casing is not the same as that of a conventional conductor and it is not yet well understood a mechanical model was established to evaluate the wellhead stability considering the effects of the cement waiting time and end resistance force of the joint the results showed that the composite casing structure had better stability than previous conventional jetting conductors sensitivity analysis was also conducted first in the horizontal direction the influence of the load was mainly within 30 m below the mudline while in the vertical direction the influence of the load was as deep as 80 m second the end resistance force of the joint was large and thus could not be ignored third the composite casing composed of a conductor with a larger size had relatively good stability and lower horizontal displacement and vertical load the top tension of the riser should be designed to be relatively large finally the waiting time which was short was sufficient to obtain the required stability and it should be designed by considering other factors the results of this article will contribute to the drilling design of composite casings in the future keywords composite casing wellhead stability deepwater drilling cement 1 introduction deepwater drilling is characterized by massive investments and high risk bo et al 2014 which drive the drilling process to be as short reliable and safe as possible when drilling in a deepwater shallow formation several geological hazards may be encountered such as shallow gas shallow water flow and gas hydrates dutta et al 2010 therefore the establishment of a wellhead and drilling fluid circulation channel is very important in shallow formations a blowout preventer bop is usually installed after the surface casing strings are cemented before the surface casing strings are run in a conductor pipe which supports the complex load from the wellhead should be installed traditionally two methods are used when setting up a conductor pipe molaschi et al 2010 1 drilling a 36 in or 42 in hole and running a 30 in or 36 in conductor pipe 2 jetting with a 30 in or 36 in conductor pipe and then drilling ahead the first method involves four round trips before the bop is installed two drilling phases and two cementing jobs this technique is time consuming and costly moreover the verticality and concentricity of the conductor pipe cannot be guaranteed the second method which contains only two round trips one jetting and drilling phase and one cementing job phase is a more commonly used method in deepwater drilling after the conductor pipe is set to the desired depth by jetting the drill ahead tool is released and a following hole is drilled to the setting depth of surface casing however if hard formations are encountered jetting cannot be applied and it is necessary to drill a hole a new kind of composite casing string also called a dual casing which is composed of upper conductor and lower conductor sections was introduced to overcome these problems when a composite casing is used it enables the drilling of a tapered hole with two different diameters in one unique riser less drilling phase using a tandem bottom hole assembly and running the conductor pipe and surface casing together calderoni et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 the surface casing and conductor were run as a single assembly and the cementing job was performed in the same stage for both casings allowing a reduction of the operation time and costs compared with those of a conventional jetting conductor in previous jetting methods the conductor must be stable under bending moment horizontal force and vertical force when the composite casing is applied the upper conductor and lower casing combined with cement can withstand the complex load as a whole composite casing technology was successfully implemented in roncador field campos basin in 2017 with a water depth of about 1800 m which led to a large reduction in the operation time and costs roberto et al 2018 molaschi et al 2010 reported the field application of a composite casing structure when using a conventional conductor the installation time was 110 140 h when using a composite casing structure the installation time decreased to 40 80 h the wellhead stability of a composite casing string is not well understood because of the highly unconsolidated soil and low bearing capacity of the shallow formation a deepwater environment will bring complex wind wave and current loads the loads will be transferred to the wellhead through the risers which may cause a large lateral displacement or even failure of the wellhead in addition if the vertical bearing capacity of the surface pipe is insufficient it may cause the sinking of the wellhead which will result in severe drilling accidents previous studies on wellheads mainly focused on the wellhead stability of conventional jetting conductors yan et al 2015 established a numerical model of subsea wellhead stability using the pile and nonlinear spring elements of ansys this model was used to analyze the effects of the drilling vessel s offsets and top tension ratio wang et al 2015 analyzed the subsea wellhead stability of a deepwater conductor using the finite element method considering contact interface models between the pile and soil the authors suggested that the conductor bearing capacity should be calculated using different contact models between the pile and soil and the minimum value should be taken as the conductor design basis xu et al 2017 studied a risk assessment method of subsea wellhead instability considering the uncertain factors in deepwater drilling including the water depth current speed and resistance coefficient kan et al 2018 studied the bearing capacity of a novel deepwater composite drilling conductor which consisted of a bucket foundation and drilling conductor deng et al 2019 studied deepwater subsea wellhead shallow casing deflection considering the system mass forces by simulations and experiments there have been no publications on the wellhead stability of the composite casings used in deepwater drilling there are some differences between the composite casing strings and the jetting conductor strings first the upper section is different if a conventional conductor is used the upper section consists of concentric pipes while it becomes a single layer when a composite casing is applied which may lead to a decrease in the lateral bearing capacity second the cementing operation is different because the cement slurry is pumped up to the seabed mudline for the composite casing while the conventional conductor does not require cementing third for composite casing there is a terrace at the joint that connects the upper conductor and lower casing string which may lead to a change in the axial force transfer therefore the wellhead stability analysis methods in previous references may no longer be applicable to composite casings in this study a mechanical model was constructed to evaluate the wellhead stability of a composite casing by considering the horizontal displacement bending moment and axial force the horizontal stability and the transfer of vertical axial forces were analyzed the results of this study will contribute to the drilling design and control of composite casings in the future 2 mechanical model 2 1 lateral deflection model the composite casing and cement are taken as an integral structure to withstand the moment and force together the force diagram of the casing cement structure is shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b shows the force diagram of a small segment of the casing cement structure for a small segment of the casing cement structure the moment equilibrium equation can be expressed as follows 1 m x d m m x n x d y q x d x 0 where m x is the bending moment on the casing cement structure n m n x is the axial force n and q is the shearing force n according to the theory of structural mechanics the moment transfer can be expressed as follows 2 d m x d x q x cos θ n x sin θ q x n x d y d x 3 m e i x d 2 y d x 2 where θ is the deflection angle dimensionless and e i x is the stiffness of the casing cement structure n m2 the horizontal force balance can be expressed as follows 4 d q x d x d x p x where p x y is the subgrade reaction force per unit area n m2 and d x is the outer diameter m which changes with depth because the casing cement structure is tapered by substituting equations 2 4 into equation 1 the differential equation of deflection can be obtained as follows 5 d d x 2 e i x d 2 y d x 2 d d x n x d y d x d x p x y 0 each term in equation 5 varies with depth 2 2 vertical axial force in the vertical section the bearing capacity generated by the shallow soil should be larger than the wellhead load otherwise the wellhead will sink under the large vertical load after the bop is installed the axial force of any node except the node under the joint can be obtained as follows 6 n i 1 n i w x d x above the mudline n i w x d x π d x f d x n i 0 below the mudline n i w x d x π d x f d x f q n i 0 the joint position 0 n i 0 where f q is the end resistance force of the terrace generated by the vertical compression of the soil which can be calculated as follows 7 f q q π d cem 1 2 d cem 2 2 4 where q is the unit area end resistance force w x is the unit length weight of the casing cement structure n m which can be calculated as follows 8 w x w c o n above mudline section w c o n w c e m 1 cemented conductor section w c a s w c e m 2 cemented casing section w c o n and w c a s are the unit length weights of the upper conductor pipe and lower casing pipe n m respectively and w c e m 1 and w c e m 2 are the unit length weights of the cement at the upper and lower sections respectively n m 2 2 1 lateral friction force a composite casing can be longer than 1000 m and thus the vertical bearing capacity can be met a major concern is the depth to which the effect of the vertical force can be transferred from which the depth of the joint can be optimized from the viewpoint of classic tribology the friction force can be calculated by a contact force multiplied by a friction coefficient however the friction coefficient changes with depth and is difficult to determine moreover when a hole is drilled in a shallow formation it will cause certain disturbance in the weak consolidated formation which will recover to some degree with time the unit area friction of the outer cement surface generated by the formation can be calculated as follows 9 f α t s u where α t is the time dependent adhesion coefficient on the average friction factor dimensionless and s u is the undrained shear strength of shallow soil n m2 which should be measured or predicted by a fit through available data the total friction force can be calculated as follows 10 f f f f 0 α t π d s u d l where f 0 is the initial capacity at t 0 01 d n which can be considered to be 0 as its value is quite small generally jeanjean 2002 determined the equation for α t using an existing database of load tests on jetted conductors 11 α t 0 055 2 log t where t is the waiting time after the drilling process d 2 2 2 end resistance force of the joint at the depth of the joint position the cement sheath diameter changes and the tapered joint behaves like an annular pile unlike the lateral friction force which arises from the slip deformation of the soil around the cement the end resistance force of the pile arises from the compression deformation therefore the end resistance force at the joint position should be calculated which will lead to a drop off of the axial force for clayey soil the unit area end resistance force can be calculated as follows rausche et al 2004 12 q n c s u where n c is the bearing capacity coefficient dimensionless which can be calculated as follows 13 n c 6 1 0 2 d b u r i e d d w b 9 where d b u r i e d is the buried depth under the seabed and d w b can be considered to be the diameter of the wellhole m for sandy soil the unit area end resistance force can be calculated as follows 14 q 0 3 γ 2 b n γ p 0 n q 1 where γ 2 is the average effective weight of the soil kg m3 p 0 is the overburden pressure pa and n γ and n q are the bearing capacity coefficients dimensionless of the drained granular soil based on the angle of internal friction given by api 2000 2 3 horizontal subgrade reaction force when the conductor pipe deflects under the moment and the complex loads in the vertical and horizontal directions a horizontal subgrade reaction force will be generated by the surrounding soil generally the horizontal subgrade reaction force can be calculated by three methods based on different assumptions 1 the ultimate foundation reaction method 2 the elastic subgrade reaction method and 3 the elastic plastic subgrade reaction method the elastic plastic subgrade reaction method is the most widely used method as it can describe the non linear characteristics between the string and the shallow formation furthermore it can be used to analyze the transverse bearing capacity of the string with greater accuracy than other methods it is also known as the p y curve method the p y curve can be obtained by shallow geological survey parameters when the p y curve is obtained the secant modulus can be calculated from it as follows 15 p e s y where e s is the secant modulus of the subgrade force in a shallow formation n m3 however the p y curve is sometimes absent or incomplete in which case the modulus can be calculated based on the following empirical equation yan et al 2015 16 e s 12000 s u 2 4 casing cement structure flexural rigidity assuming that the deformation of the composite casing and cement is within the range of elastic deformation and no slippage occurs at the bonding interface between the casing and cement for the tapered casing cement structure each segment is a concentric cylinder the total bending stiffness can be calculated as follows 17 e i e st i c o n above mudline section e s t i c o n a e c e m i c e m 1 cemented conductor section e s t i c a s a e c e m i c e m 2 cemented casing section where e s t and e c e m are the elasticity modulus of the casing conductor and cement mpa respectively and i c o n i c a s i c e m 1 and i c e m 2 are the sectional moments of inertia of the upper conductor lower casing upper cement and lower cement m4 respectively considering the possibility of concrete cracking when the casing cement structure is bent the flexural stiffness of the concrete part is reduced appropriately by introducing the coefficient a for circular steel concrete structures the reduction coefficient can be set to 0 8 lin and you 2004 3 numerical simulations 3 1 difference equations to facilitate the installation of the wellhead and bop the upper end of the conductor is generally several meters higher 3 m in this article than the mudline as shown in fig 3 the whole casing cement structure can be divided into several parts of the same length h using the finite difference method from the top to the bottom of the casing cement structure the node numbers were set as 0 1 2 3 i n 1 n the microsections with lengths of h on the top and bottom of the structure were increased by two segments as shown in fig 3 equation 5 can be converted into a system of difference equations including n 1 difference equations which can be written as follows 18 a i y i 2 b i y i 1 c i y i d i y i 1 e i y i 2 0 the algebraic terms can be written as follows 19 a i e i i 1 b i 2 e i i 1 2 e i i n i h 2 c i e i i 1 4 e i i e i i 1 2 n i h 2 d i e i i h 4 d i 2 e i

structure was equal to it i e 20 m 0 m t q 0 q t using the beam column deflection differential equation equation 20 can be changed into the following 21 y 1 2 y 0 y 1 m t h 2 e i 0 y 2 2 y 1 2 y 1 y 2

can be rewritten as following 23 y n 1 2 y n y n 1 0 y n 2 2 y n 1 2 y n 1 y n 2 0 there are n 1 equations in equations 18 and 4 equations in equations 21 and 23 there are n 5 y variables which can be obtained by combining the n 5 equations once the horizontal displacement profile is obtained the bending moment deflection angle and shearing force profiles can be calculated as following 24 θ i y i 1

on the shallow soil data from the geological survey presented by yan et al 2015 which is summarized in table 1 the undrained shear strength of soil at any depth can be predicted by the data of the top and bottom points of the local soil layer the shallow geological survey only provided data to a depth of 100 3 m and the parameters of deeper sections were predicted from the obtained data using linear fitting methods the length of the upper conductor was set to be 50 m and the length of lower casing length was 150 m for this example the length of the surface casing can be longer in engineering practice however the bending moment and load cannot be transferred too deeply the waiting time was set to be 4 d the maximum loads imposed on the wellhead were determined to be as follows n t 2 5 10 6 n m t 2 10 6 k n m and q t 6 10 4 n 4 1 comparison with jetting conductor in this section the wellhead stabilities when the composite casing and conventional jetting conductor were used are compared the calculation of the conventional jetting conductor was conducted using the model built by guan 2009 and calculation of the composite casing was conducted using the model developed in this article the horizontal displacement profile bending moment and subgrade reaction force when using composite casing and the conventional jetting conductor are shown in figs 4 6 the horizontal displacement was smaller when using the composite casing than when using the jetting conductor although the bending stiffness of the composite casing structure was smaller the outer diameter of the cement sheath was larger which resulted in a larger subgrade reaction force when it was deflected however the bending moment showed small differences when using different casing structures in essence the composite casing structure with a higher installation efficiency which was demonstrated by calderoni et al 2011 showed even better stability than previous conventional jetting conductors 4 2 sensitivity analysis in this section all the factors were fixed during the calculation except for the one that was being analyzed the wellhead stability was studied by analyzing the horizontal deflection moment shearing force and axial force the results and discussions are as follows 4 2 1 effects of parameters of upper conductor the effects of the parameters of the upper conductor on the horizontal deflection of the casing cement structure are shown in fig 7 when the outer diameter of the conductor was 36 in and the wall thickness was 1 5 in the horizontal deflection at the top was the smallest of all the conductors the horizontal deflection of the conductor with a 30 in diameter and 1 in wall thickness was 0 89 m which was the largest and decreased faster than those of the other conductors regardless of the conductor size the horizontal deflection of the casing cement structure was mainly concentrated in the shallow section where the depth was shallower than 30 m which is consistent with the conclusions of guan 2009 for conventional conductor structures when the depth was larger than 30 m the horizontal deflection decreased and tended to zero the effects of the parameters of the upper conductor on the bending moment of the casing cement structure are shown in fig 8 the moments of the different upper conductors exhibited similar variation trends first the moments increased linearly in the section above the mudline because of the horizontal force on the wellhead after which they decreased and tended to zero similar to the horizontal deflection variation the bending moment of the 30 in 1 in conductor was smaller than those of the other conductors and the bending moment of 36 in 1 5 in conductor was the largest when the depth shallower than 20 m the horizontal subgrade reaction force is shown in fig 9 when the size of the upper conductor was 30 in 1 in the maximum subgrade reaction force was 51 kn m although the diameter was not the largest its horizontal deflection was the largest and the subgrade force was proportional to the outer diameter and horizontal deflection as shown in equation 4 furthermore the subgrade reaction force of the 30 in 1 in conductor had the largest value in the opposite direction and converged to zero the fastest fig 10 shows the change of the axial force profile along the casing cement structure with depth the axial forces of the 36 in 1 in and 36 in 1 5 in conductors decreased to 0 n at the depth of the joint while the axial forces of the 30 in 1 in and 30 in 1 5 in conductors decreased to 0 at depths of 63 65 m because the conductor with a larger diameter collocated larger cement sheath diameter which led to a larger vertical friction force in addition the axial force dropped sharply at the joint position because of the end resistance force of the joint in particular when the conductor diameter was 36 in the axial force dropped to 0 n directly because the pile end resistance force was too large the axial force of the conductor with a 1 in thickness decreased slightly faster than that of a 1 5 in conductor because of the difference in the conductor weight based on figs 7 10 the composite casing with the 36 in 1 5 in conductor had relatively good stability especially in the horizontal direction 4 2 2 effects of external load in this section several groups of external loads bending moment horizontal load and vertical load were used in the calculations the values are shown in table 3 fig 11 shows the horizontal displacement under different load conditions the horizontal deflection curves under conditions i and ii were similar as were the deflection curves of conditions iii and iv for the load groupings shown in table 3 it was concluded that the deflection of the casing cement structure was mainly affected by the bending moment applied at the top changing either the horizontal or vertical load did not have a significant influence on the deflection curve when it was under external load condition iii the horizontal deflection at the top was 0 83 m and for condition i the horizontal deflection at the top dropped to 0 406 m figs 12 and 13 show the bending moment and horizontal subgrade reaction force respectively under different load conditions similar to the horizontal displacement the bending moment curves or subgrade reaction force curves under conditions i and ii were similar as were those under conditions iii and iv the moment curves above the mudline under condition i had the lowest slopes because the horizontal load was smaller than those under the other conditions fig 14 shows the axial force of the casing cement structure under different load conditions the black red and blue curves coincide which indicates that the axial force was almost unaffected by the bending moment and horizontal load because the friction force was set to be affected by the waiting time and the initial undrained shear strength only as shown in equation 9 the axial force increased slightly in the shallow section decreased with depth and dropped sharply in the joint section if the vertical load was small the axial force was counteracted completely at the joint depth by the friction force and pile end resistance force if the vertical load was as large as 2 5 mn the neutral depth was deeper than 65 2 m from the discussion above the bending moment significantly influenced the horizontal displacement and the vertical load mainly affected the axial force transfer of the casing cement structure previous studies concluded that a larger top tension of the riser would lead to a smaller vertical load and smaller bending moment on the wellhead jin et al 2015 tucker and murtha 1973 wang et al 2016 therefore the top tension of the riser should be designed to be large within the allowable range 4 2 3 effects of waiting time jetting drilling requires several days of waiting time after the conductor is run into the determined depth to regain an adequate friction force from the subsea soil and the required minimum depth of the jetting conductor depends on the waiting time generally the minimum depth negatively correlates with the waiting time zhou et al 2014 when a composite casing is run into the determined depth it also requires a waiting period because it takes some time for the cement slurry to become solid here the effects of the waiting time are discussed the results are shown in figs 15 18 from figs 15 and 16 it was concluded that the waiting time only had small effects on the horizontal displacement and bending moment but significant effects on the subgrade reaction and axial forces the longer the waiting time the larger the horizontal subgrade reaction force in this model the cement sheath was assumed to be strong enough and the subgrade reaction force was mainly affected by the soil characteristics in the vertical direction if the waiting time was 7 d the depth of the axial force neutral point was about 60 m and if the waiting time was 1 d the depth was about 81 m when the conventional jetting conductor was used wellhead sinking occurred if the waiting time was inadequate as shown in fig 18 the axial force was neutralized by friction at a depth 60 80 m which was shallower than that of the composite casing structure based on the discussion above the waiting time mainly affected the transfer of the axial force and had a small influence on the horizontal displacement thus its influence on wellhead stability was small in practice the waiting time is the interval between the cementing job and the next operation it is affected by other factors including the waiting on cement woc time the daily cost of the drilling vessel and the preparation of the next operation therefore the waiting time should be designed by considering these factors 5 conclusions 1 based on the theory of pile foundations and material mechanics an analysis model for the lateral bearing capacities of composite casings was established that accounted for the effects of the cement waiting time and end resistance force of the joint 2 the composite casing structure exhibited better stability than the conventional jetting conductor 3 in the horizontal direction the influence of the load was mainly within 30 m below the mudline while in the vertical direction the influence of the load could be as deep as 80 m 4 the end resistance force of the joint was large and hence it cannot be ignored 5 the composite casing composed of a conductor with a larger size had relatively good stability to lower the horizontal displacement and vertical load the top tension of the riser should be relatively large 6 the effect of the waiting time on the wellhead stability was not significant and the waiting time should be designed by taking other factors into consideration credit authorship contribution statement wenlong li conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft writing review editing deli

152 4 304 8 mm in diameter the liner pipe is made slightly smaller than the outer pipe so that it can be inserted into the outer pipe hydraulic mechanical or temperature pressure is then applied inside the liner pipe so that it expands radially as the pressure increases it first deforms elastically then plastically and ultimately gets in contact with the outer pipe which then also deforms elastically when the pressure is released and both the outer pipe and the liner pipe shrink elastically due to the remaining plastic deformation of the liner pipe it bonds with the outer pipe the liner pipe is also welded circumferentially at an interval to the outer pipe wang et al 2019 which further guarantees the interaction between the two pipe layers most of the studies of lined pipes

carbon steel pipe lined with a 2 45 mm 304l stainless steel liner was successfully conducted while test on the other specimen a 12 75 inch pipe lined with 3 0 mm liner failed due to the limited capacity of the loading facility the behaviour of the lined pipes under axial compression has also been studied numerically by yuan and kyriakides 2015b hilberink et al 2010 and wang et al 2018 2019 where the developments of the liner wrinkling under axial compression as well as the influence of geometric imperfections and two layer interaction on the ultimate capacity were studied the few existing studies on lined pipes under axial compression focus only on short lined pipes i e stub columns while no study on long lined pipes about their flexural buckling behaviour has been ever

all the specimens were made from a 6 625 inch 168 3 mm tfp api specification 5ld 2009 consists of a 12 7 mm thick x65 hot rolled seamless outer pipe and a 3 mm ss316l cold formed welded liner pipe to simulate the practical service conditions the specimens experienced reeling installation to 26 m water depth in bohai bay china prior to the column tests the experimental studies consisted of complimentary tensile coupon tests and 6 flexural buckling tests all the tests and measurements were performed in the laboratory centre of engineering mechanics and structural engineering of the school of civil engineering at shenyang jianzhu university china the conducted experiment configuration testing procedure and the recorded test results are reported in the following sections 2 1 material tests the basic stress strain material properties of the lined pipe were determined through tensile coupon tests six longitudinal coupons were extracted for the liner and the outer pipe respectively including three tested directly with the cross sectional curvature and three tested after pressed flat the cross section geometry and the position of the coupons relative to the weld is shown in fig 1 where d is the diameter t o is the outer pipe thickness and t i is the liner pipe thickness the coupons were machined and tested according to gb t 228 1 gb national standard 2010 the dimensions of the machined coupons are given in fig 2 where r denotes the radius it is worth noting that the gauge length of coupons varies with the thickness of the plate a pair of specially designed loading rigs were used for all the curved tensile coupons as shown in fig 3 a all the coupon tests were conducted using a changchun 600 kn hydraulic testing machine uni axial strain gauges were affixed at the middle point of each side of the coupons to capture the longitudinal strain while an extensometer was used at high strain level the strain gauge measurements were first used to determine the young s modulus and then employed to calibrate the strain recordings from the extensometer test data including load displacement strain and input voltage were all recorded through the data acquisition equipment mobrey imp isolated measurement pods and logged at 1 s intervals through dh3820 computer package a summary of key results from all tensile coupon tests is given in table 1 where c and f were appended to the specimen designation to indicate curved and flattened coupons respectively in table 1 e is the young s modulus f y and f u are the yield or 0 2 proof strength and ultimate strength and ε f is the strain at fracture typical stress strain curves are shown in fig 4 note that the extensometer was taken off the specimen prior to the onset of necking to avoid damage from vibration upon fracture the measured stress strain responses for stainless steel were represented using the two stage modified ramberg osgood models that utilise the 0 2 proof stress f y and 1 0 proof stress f 1 0 gardner and nethercot 2004 the ramberg osgood parameters n and n 0 2 1 0 which are measures of the degree of nonlinearity of the material response are also listed in table 1 2 2 geometry and imperfection measurement a total of 6 pin ended long lined pipe specimens were tested under axial compression the nominal lengths of the specimens were selected as 1700 mm and 3400 mm to provide different global slenderness while the nominal diameters of the lined pipes were consistently 168 3 mm and the nominal d t o is 13 3 three repeated tests for each length were carried out denoted as 1 2 and 3 in table 2 both ends of each specimen were machined flat and welded to 20 mm thick plates with stiffeners prior to testing the geometry of the specimens and the initial global geometric imperfections were measured as listed in table 2 where l is the pipe length including the end plates and t is the total thickness of the pipe the global imperfection was measured at 5 points equally spaced along the pipe length as shown in fig 5 following the requirement of api spec 5ld the values were determined by means of a thin wire and a vernier caliper the maximum values of the measured initial global geometric imperfections denoted as δ 0 are listed in table 2 the average measured global geometric imperfection magnitude was about l 1674 which is significantly lower than the fabrication tolerance of l 1000 set out in annex d of en 1090 2 cen 2018 2 3 axial compression tests the experimental setup is given in fig 6 a 5000 kn hydraulic testing machine was used both ends of the specimens were simply supported on knife edges allowing for free rotation about the in plane axis the full histories of applied loads axial displacements in plane lateral displacements end rotations and strains during testing were recorded at 1 s interval employing mobrey imp acquisition equipment and dh3820 computer package in plane and out of plane lateral deflections were measured by displacement transducers d6 and d5 respectively while the other displacement transducers d1 d4 and d7 d8 were employed to monitor the end rotations and axial displacements of the bottom and the top plate respectively four strain gauges were affixed at mid length of the specimens the strain distributions at mid length were recorded marked as sg 1 to sg 4 depending on their positions global buckling failure modes were observed for all the tested specimens and the typical failure modes were presented in fig 7 all the load lateral displacement curves are presented in fig 8 it can be seen that the load displacement curves of specimens lp 1700 3 and lp 3400 1 shows negative displacement at the beginning of the loading process which may be due to low loading eccentricities in the setup load strain curves for two specimens are presented in fig 9 key test results for lined pipe specimens are summarized in table 3 3 numerical simulations 3 1 model assumptions the general propose finite element fe package abaqus 6 14 is adopted to perform the analysis stiffeners end plates and kinfe edges were modeled with measured geometries and meshed with 3d solid elements c3d8r while the liner pipe and the outer pipe were meshed with shell elements s4r one element was assigned through thickness of both the outer pipe and the liner pipe the fe models were developed taking symmetry about the mid length a typical finite element mesh used in the present analyses is shown in fig 10 boundary conditions in accordance with the test setup were applied where the knife edge support was fully constrained to a reference point with kinematic coupling and all degrees of freedom at the reference point except vertical translation were restrained surface to surface interaction models with isotropic coulomb friction and hard contact was considered between the knife edges where friction coefficient μ of 0 15 was considered the manufacture process of lined pipe introduces contact pressure and residual hoop stress between the two layers of the pipe it was found that the residual hoop stress remained at a low level after manufacture spooling and unloading focke et al 2007 in previous studies on interaction behaviour of lined pipe under axial compression and liner wrinkling under bending by wang et al 2019 and yuan and kyriakides 2014b the residual hoop stress was taken into consideration in finite element models and accurate predictions were achieved thus in this paper residual hoop stress at a low level of amplitude giving in ref focke et al 2007 was adopted in the model to simulate the mechanical expansion of liner pipe during the manufacture process tow lawyers interaction models with hard contact and no friction were applied between the two pipe layers similar to refs hilberink et al 2011 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 where the outer pipe was set as the master surface and the liner pipe as the slave surface due to the end plate and stiffener restraint effect uneven stress distribution occurred at the end of the pipeline and uniform stress distribution in the mid span of the pipeline was observed after predefined hoop stresses 3 2 validation fe models were validated against all the experimental results reported in the previous section the material properties and geometries as listed in tables 1 and 2 were employed it is worth noting that since it is not possible to measure the thickness values of the liner and outer pipes t o and t i they were taken in proportion to the norminal thickness values as tabulated in table 2 the buckling length l cr was taken as the sum of the column length with the end plates l together with the thickness to the two knife edges note that l cr l differs for different specimens and the measured values were used the average measured engineering stress strain responses were converted into true stress and log plastic strain and applied in the fe models following the method in ref bu and gardner 2019 the measured amplitude of the imperfection was incorporate in the models the ultimate loads obtained from the tests n test were compared to the ultimate loads obtained from the fe models n fe as shown in table 4 the mean valueof the n test n fe ratios of all specimens is 0 979 with the coefficient of variation cov equals to 0 059 showing that the numerical models may be seen to provide an accurate prediction of the behaviour in the physical tests in addition to ultimate loads typical load deflection curves from tests and fe analyses are compared in fig 11 typical failure modes obtained from the numerical models and observed from the experiments are compared in fig 12 where global buckling was observed in either case previous studies hilberink et al 2011 yuan and kyriakides 2015a focke 2007 have pointed out that separation of the liner pipe and the outer pipe is a typical failure mode for lined pipes under various loading cases for long lined pipe under compression the wrinkle development was investigated no wrinkle development can be observed in the liner pipe prior to the ultimate load showing that the liner pipe is working together with the outer pipe till this point however with increasing deflection the wrinkle starts developing in the liner pipe in the post buckling phase as shown fig 13 3 3 parametric study a series of parametric studies was carried out to investigate the structural behaviour of long lined pipes parameters including the outer pipe material liner pipe material diameter thickness of the outer pipe thickness of the liner pipe imperfection amplitude and residual hoop stress were considered as listed in table 5 in the first batch of parametric studies various commonly used material properties of the outer and liner pipe were considered where the yield strength of the outer pipe f yo was taken 340 440 540 and 640 mpa while the 0 2 proof strength of the liner pipe f yi was taken 240 350 and 420 mpa the rest of the variables were kept constant where d 168 3 mm t o 12 7 mm t i 3 mm δ 0 l cr 1000 residual hoop stress σ h 7 mpa contact pressure p c 0 2 mpa the buckling lengths l cr of the models were chosen for the global slenderness λ to be 1 0 the global slenderness is defined by eq 1 1 λ a o f y o n c r where n cr is the elastic buckling load of the outer pipe a o is the cross section area of the outer pipe the ultimate loads were plotted in fig 14 it can be seen that the effect of changing lining material proof strength on the ultimate load of the lined pipe under compression can be ignored while changing the yield strength of the outer pipe material can effectively improve the ultimate carrying capacity of the bimetallic pipe the second batch of parametric studies investigated the influence of imperfection amplitude and contact pressure p c three imperfection amplitudes were considered l cr 1500 l cr 1000 and l cr 500 six contact pressure values were considered 0 0 8 2 4 6 8 mpa the rest of the variables were kept constant where d 168 3 mm t o 12 7 mm t i 3 mm l cr 4000 mm making λ 1 156 fig 15 shows the relationship between the applied hoop stress and the contact pressure generated in the simulations a linear relationship between the hoop stress and contact pressure can be observed which can be explained by the load equilibrium of the cross section fig 16 shows the ultimate loads with various imperfection values and contact pressures it can be seen that the contact pressure has negligible influence on the ultimate capacity of the lined pipe while the imperfection amplitude has a greater impact on the ultimate capacity the third batch of parametric studies looked at the column buckling behaviour of the lined pipes different values of non dimensional member slenderness λ and d t o were considered throughout this batch of parametric studies the imperfection amplitude and residual hoop stress were kept constant where δ 0 l cr 1000 and p c 0 2 mpa six commonly used diameters of the pipe d were selected to generate different d t o ratios thus different cross section classifications two outer pipe thickness values were considered for different liner outer thickness ratios two liner pipe thickness were taken t i 3 mm and 0 mm to consider lined pipes and single pipes respectively lined pipes of different lengths were simulated for each cross section to give a spectrum of non dimensional member slenderness λ from 0 5 to 2 0 noted that only outer pipe where considered in the slenderness calculation the results generated from the third batch of parametric studies together with the test results are used in the next section to evaluate the existing design provisions and making new design recommendations for long lined pipes under compression 4 design recommendations the current design recommendation of dnv os f101 veritas det norske 2010 for lined pipes is introduced and assessed in this section since the long lined pipes show the same global flexural buckling failure mode as columns the buckling curve in en 1993 1 1 cen 2005 is firstly assessed having observed some inaccuracy in the strength predictions of the existing provisions improvements are sought and a new buckling curve was proposed 4 1 en 1993 1 1 the existing design code for steel columns with hollow sections is assessed where only the outer pipe was considered in en 1993 1 1 cross sections of class 1 2 and 3 are deemed to be fully effective and capable of reaching their yield load af y under pure compression the flexural buckling resistance n b rd of a column is given by eq 2 for columns with non slender class 1 3 cross sections 2 n b r d χ a f y γ m 1 where χ is the overall buckling reduction factor and γ m1 is the partial safety factor the buckling reduction factor χ to account for member instability can be calculated from eqs 3 and 4 3 χ 1 ϕ ϕ 2 λ 2 4 ϕ 0 5 1 α λ 0 2 λ 2 where φ is global initial sway imperfection α is an imperfection factor for steel hollow section columns en 1993 1 1 adopts buckling curve a0 and imperfection factor of α 0 13 the comparison of experimental and numerical results with strength predictions from ec3 is presented in table 6 and fig 17 it can be seen that ec3 predictions for single subsea pipelines are accurate while the predictions for lined pipes shows conservatism the mean ratios of n u n u ec3 are 1 014 and 1 173 with the corresponding covs equal to 0 017 and 0 046 for single pipes and lined piped respectively 4 2 dnv os f101 according to the pipeline guidance dnv os f101 veritas det norske 2010 the design of lined pipe only considered the cross section capacity as given by eq 5 while the overall buckling of the pipeline is allowed if the displacement of pipe line is acceptable 5 γ m γ s c m s d α c m p t 2 γ m γ s c s s d p i α c s p t 2 2 2 α p p i p e α c p b t 2 2 1 where γ m is the material resistance factor γ sc is the condition load effect factor m sd is the design moment m p is calculation moment s sd is the design effective axial force p i is the internal pressure p e is the external pressure p b is the burst pressure α c is a flow stress parameter in the case of this paper where only axial compression is considered the equation reduces to 6 s s d α c s p and s p f y π d t o t o it can be seen that in the existing guidance only the contribution of the outer pipe is considered since the objectives in this paper are long columns the reduction factor from en 1993 1 1 was employed to take this strength reduction into consideration the test and fe ultimate strengths were first divided by the reduction factor χ to eliminate the global buckling reduction then compared to the cross section capacity prediction s p in dnv os 101 the comparison of dnv predictions with cross sectional capacity is shown in table 7 it can be seen that dnv os 101 shows good predictions of the single subsea pipelines while the predictions for lined pipes show conservatism the mean ratios of n u χ s p are 1 014 and 1 173 with the corresponding covs equal to 0 017 and 0 046 for single pipes and lined pipes respectively 4 3 proposed buckling curve as found out from previous section 1 no wrinkle of the liner pipe was formed prior to the ultimate buckling load 2 considering only outer pipes for the member buckling resistance results conservatism a new buckling curve is proposed based on the buckling curve form of ec3 the contribution of the liner pipe to the member resistance as well as reduction from the non linear behaviour of the stainless steel were taken into consideration for long lined pipes with carbon steel outer pipe and stainless steel liner pipe eq 7 is proposed 7 n b r d χ l p a s s f y i a c s f y o γ m 1 where a ss and a cs are the cross section area of the carbon steel outer pipe and the stainless steel liner pipe respectively and χ lp is the buckling reduction factor for the lined pipe and can be calculated by eq 8 8 χ l p χ c s t o t χ s s t i t where χ cs and χ ss are calculated separately according to the en 1993 1 1 cen 2005 and design manual for structural stainless steel sci 2017 with the updated stainless steel buckling curve in en 1993 1 4 cen 2015 the carbon steel curve adopts buckling curve with a plateau length λ 0 0 2 and imperfection factor of α 0 13 while the stainless steel curve adopts a buckling curve with a plateau length λ 0 0 2 and imperfection factor of α 0 49 the global slenderness of the lined pipe is defined by eq 9 9 λ a c s f y o a s s f y i π 2 e s s i s s e c s i c s l 2 where i ss i cs are the inertia moment of inertia of liner pipe and outer pipe the comparisons of existing and proposed buckling curves are shown in fig 18 the proposed method offers more accurate predictions for lined pipes the mean ratios of n u n u prop are 1 029 with the corresponding covs equal to 0 040 for lined piped as shown in table 6 note that for different outer liner thickness ratio the proposed curves are different as shown in fig 19 5 conclusions the flexural buckling behaviour of lined pipes with carbon steel outer pipes and stainless steel liner pipes were studied in this paper a total of six long lined pipe specimens were tested under axial compression finite element fe models were developed and validated against the experiments parametric studies were performed upon validation considering various material properties pipe cross section geometries residual hoop stress global imperfections and global slenderness the current design recommendation of dnv os f101 for lined pipes and en 1993

data acquisition equipment mobrey imp isolated measurement pods and logged at 1 s intervals through dh3820 computer package a summary of key results from all tensile coupon tests is given in table 1 where c and f were appended to the specimen designation to indicate curved and flattened coupons respectively in table 1 e is the young s modulus f y and f u are the yield or 0 2 proof strength and ultimate strength and ε f is the strain at fracture typical stress strain curves are shown in fig 4 note that the extensometer was taken off the specimen prior to the onset of necking to avoid damage from vibration upon fracture the measured stress strain responses for stainless steel were represented using the two stage modified ramberg osgood models that utilise the 0 2 proof stress f y and 1 0 proof stress f 1 0 gardner and nethercot 2004 the ramberg osgood parameters n and n 0 2 1 0 which are measures of the degree of nonlinearity of the material response are also listed in table 1 2 2 geometry and imperfection measurement a total of 6 pin ended long lined pipe specimens were tested under axial compression the nominal lengths of the specimens were selected as 1700 mm and 3400 mm to provide different global slenderness while the nominal diameters of the lined pipes were consistently 168 3 mm and the nominal d t o is 13 3 three repeated tests for each length were carried out denoted as 1 2 and 3 in table 2 both ends of each specimen were machined flat and welded to 20 mm thick plates with stiffeners prior to testing the geometry of the specimens and the initial global geometric imperfections were measured as listed in table 2 where l is the pipe length including the end plates and t is the total thickness of the pipe the global imperfection was measured at 5 points equally spaced along the pipe length as shown in fig 5 following the requirement of api spec 5ld the values were determined by means of a thin wire and a vernier caliper the maximum values of the measured initial global geometric imperfections denoted as δ 0 are listed in table 2 the average measured global geometric imperfection magnitude was about l 1674 which is significantly lower than the fabrication tolerance of l 1000 set out in annex d of en 1090 2 cen 2018 2 3 axial compression tests the experimental setup is given in fig 6 a 5000 kn hydraulic testing machine was used both ends of the specimens were simply supported on knife edges allowing for free rotation about the in plane axis the full histories of applied loads axial displacements in plane lateral displacements end rotations and strains during testing were recorded at 1 s interval employing mobrey imp acquisition equipment and dh3820 computer package in plane and out of plane lateral deflections were measured by displacement transducers d6 and d5 respectively while the other displacement transducers d1 d4 and d7 d8 were employed to monitor the end rotations and axial displacements of the bottom and the top plate respectively four strain gauges were affixed at mid length of the specimens the strain distributions at mid length were recorded marked as sg 1 to sg 4 depending on their positions global buckling failure modes were observed for all the tested specimens and the typical failure modes were presented in fig 7 all the load lateral displacement curves are presented in fig 8 it can be seen that the load displacement curves of specimens lp 1700 3 and lp 3400 1 shows negative displacement at the beginning of the loading process which may be due to low loading eccentricities in the setup load strain curves for two specimens are presented in fig 9 key test results for lined pipe specimens are summarized in table 3 3 numerical simulations 3 1 model assumptions the general propose finite element fe package abaqus 6 14 is adopted to perform the analysis stiffeners end plates and kinfe edges were modeled with measured geometries and meshed with 3d solid elements c3d8r while the liner pipe and the outer pipe were meshed with shell elements s4r one element was assigned through thickness of both the outer pipe and the liner pipe the fe models were developed taking symmetry about the mid length a typical finite element mesh used in the present analyses is shown in fig 10 boundary conditions in accordance with the test setup were applied where the knife edge support was fully constrained to a reference point with kinematic coupling and all degrees of freedom at the reference point except vertical translation were restrained surface to surface interaction models with isotropic coulomb friction and hard contact was considered between the knife edges where friction coefficient μ of 0 15 was considered the manufacture process of lined pipe introduces contact pressure and residual hoop stress between the two layers of the pipe it was found that the residual hoop stress remained at a low level after manufacture spooling and unloading focke et al 2007 in previous studies on interaction behaviour of lined pipe under axial compression and liner wrinkling under bending by wang et al 2019 and yuan and kyriakides 2014b the residual hoop stress was taken into consideration in finite element models and accurate predictions were achieved thus in this paper residual hoop stress at a low level of amplitude giving in ref focke et al 2007 was adopted in the model to simulate the mechanical expansion of liner pipe during the manufacture process tow lawyers interaction models with hard contact and no friction were applied between the two pipe layers similar to refs hilberink et al 2011 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 where the outer pipe was set as the master surface and the liner pipe as the slave surface due to the end plate and stiffener restraint effect uneven stress distribution occurred at the end of the pipeline and uniform stress distribution in the mid span of the pipeline was observed after predefined hoop stresses 3 2 validation fe models were validated against all the experimental results reported in the previous section the material properties and geometries as listed in tables 1 and 2 were employed it is worth noting that since it is not possible to measure the thickness values of the liner and outer pipes t o and t i they were taken in proportion to the norminal thickness values as tabulated in table 2 the buckling length l cr was taken as the sum of the column length with the end plates l together with the thickness to the two knife edges note that l cr l differs for different specimens and the measured values were used the average measured engineering stress strain responses were converted into true stress and log plastic strain and applied in the fe models following the method in ref bu and gardner 2019 the measured amplitude of the imperfection was incorporate in the models the ultimate loads obtained from the tests n test were compared to the ultimate loads obtained from the fe models n fe as shown in table 4 the mean valueof the n test n fe ratios of all specimens is 0 979 with the coefficient of variation cov equals to 0 059 showing that the numerical models may be seen to provide an accurate prediction of the behaviour in the physical tests in addition to ultimate loads typical load deflection curves from tests and fe analyses are compared in fig 11 typical failure modes obtained from the numerical models and observed from the experiments are compared in fig 12 where global buckling was observed in either case previous studies hilberink et al 2011 yuan and kyriakides 2015a focke 2007 have pointed out that separation of the liner pipe and the outer pipe is a typical failure mode for lined pipes under various loading cases for long lined pipe under compression the wrinkle development was investigated no wrinkle development can be observed in the liner pipe prior to the ultimate load showing that the liner pipe is working together with the outer pipe till this point however with increasing deflection the wrinkle starts developing in the liner pipe in the post buckling phase as shown fig 13 3 3 parametric study a series of parametric studies was carried out to investigate the structural behaviour of long lined pipes parameters including the outer pipe material liner pipe material diameter thickness of the outer pipe thickness of the liner pipe imperfection amplitude and residual hoop stress were considered as listed in table 5 in the first batch of parametric studies various commonly used material properties of the outer and liner pipe were considered where the yield strength of the outer pipe f yo was taken 340 440 540 and 640 mpa while the 0 2 proof strength of the liner pipe f yi was taken 240 350 and 420 mpa the rest of the variables were kept constant where d 168 3 mm t o 12 7 mm t i 3 mm δ 0 l cr 1000 residual hoop stress σ h 7 mpa contact pressure p c 0 2 mpa the buckling lengths l cr of the models were chosen for the global slenderness λ to be 1 0 the global slenderness is defined by eq 1 1 λ a o f y o n c r where n cr is the elastic buckling load of the outer pipe a o is the cross section area of the outer pipe the ultimate loads were plotted in fig 14 it can be seen that the effect of changing lining material proof strength on the ultimate load of the lined pipe under compression can be ignored while changing the yield strength of the outer pipe material can effectively improve the ultimate carrying capacity of the bimetallic pipe the second batch of parametric studies investigated the influence of imperfection amplitude and contact pressure p c three imperfection amplitudes were considered l cr 1500 l cr 1000 and l cr 500 six contact pressure values were considered 0 0 8 2 4 6 8 mpa the rest of the variables were kept constant where d 168 3 mm t o 12 7 mm t i 3 mm l cr 4000 mm making λ 1 156 fig 15 shows the relationship between the applied hoop stress and the contact pressure generated in the simulations a linear relationship between the hoop stress and contact pressure can be observed which can be explained by the load equilibrium of the cross section fig 16 shows the ultimate loads with various imperfection values and contact pressures it can be seen that the contact pressure has negligible influence on the ultimate capacity of the lined pipe while the imperfection amplitude has a greater impact on the ultimate capacity the third batch of parametric studies looked at the column buckling behaviour of the lined pipes different values of non dimensional member slenderness λ and d t o were considered throughout this batch of parametric studies the imperfection amplitude and residual hoop stress were kept constant where δ 0 l cr 1000 and p c 0 2 mpa six commonly used diameters of the pipe d were selected to generate different d t o ratios thus different cross section classifications two outer pipe thickness values were considered for different liner outer thickness ratios two liner pipe thickness were taken t i 3 mm and 0 mm to consider lined pipes and single pipes respectively lined pipes of different lengths were simulated for each cross section to give a spectrum of non dimensional member slenderness λ from 0 5 to 2 0 noted that only outer pipe where considered in the slenderness calculation the results generated from the third batch of parametric studies together with the test results are used in the next section to evaluate the existing design provisions and making new design recommendations for long lined pipes under compression 4 design recommendations the current design recommendation of dnv os f101 veritas det norske 2010 for lined pipes is introduced and assessed in this section since the long lined pipes show the same global flexural buckling failure mode as columns the buckling curve in en 1993 1 1 cen 2005 is firstly assessed having observed some inaccuracy in the strength predictions of the existing provisions improvements are sought and a new buckling curve was proposed 4 1 en 1993 1 1 the existing design code for steel columns with hollow sections is assessed where only the outer pipe was considered in en 1993 1 1 cross sections of class 1 2 and 3 are deemed to be fully effective and capable of reaching their yield load af y under pure compression the flexural buckling resistance n b rd of a column is given by eq 2 for columns with non slender class 1 3 cross sections 2 n b r d χ a f y γ m 1 where χ is the overall buckling reduction factor and γ m1 is the partial safety factor the buckling reduction factor χ to account for member instability can be calculated from eqs 3 and 4 3 χ 1 ϕ ϕ 2 λ 2 4 ϕ 0 5 1 α λ 0 2 λ 2 where φ is global initial sway imperfection α is an imperfection factor for steel hollow section columns en 1993 1 1 adopts buckling curve a0 and imperfection factor of α 0 13 the comparison of experimental and numerical results with strength predictions from ec3 is presented in table 6 and fig 17 it can be seen that ec3 predictions for single subsea pipelines are accurate while the predictions for lined pipes shows conservatism the mean ratios of n u n u ec3 are 1 014 and 1 173 with the corresponding covs equal to 0 017 and 0 046 for single pipes and lined piped respectively 4 2 dnv os f101 according to the pipeline guidance dnv os f101 veritas det norske 2010 the design of lined pipe only considered the cross section capacity as given by eq 5 while the overall buckling of the pipeline is allowed if the displacement of pipe line is acceptable 5 γ m γ s c m s d α c m p t 2 γ m γ s c s s d p i α c s p t 2 2 2 α p p i p e α c p b t 2 2 1 where γ m is the material resistance factor γ sc is the condition load effect factor m sd is the design moment m p is calculation moment s sd is the design effective axial force p i is the internal pressure p e is the external pressure p b is the burst pressure α c is a flow stress parameter in the case of this paper where only axial compression is considered the equation reduces to 6 s s d α c s p and s p f y π d t o t o it can be seen that in the existing guidance only the contribution of the outer pipe is considered since the objectives in this paper are long columns the reduction factor from en 1993 1 1 was employed to take this strength reduction into consideration the test and fe ultimate strengths were first divided by the reduction factor χ to eliminate the global buckling reduction then compared to the cross section capacity prediction s p in dnv os 101 the comparison of dnv predictions with cross sectional capacity is shown in table 7 it can be seen that dnv os 101 shows good predictions of the single subsea pipelines while the predictions for lined pipes show conservatism the mean ratios of n u χ s p are 1 014 and 1 173 with the corresponding covs equal to 0 017 and 0 046 for single pipes and lined pipes respectively 4 3 proposed buckling curve as found out from previous section 1 no wrinkle of the liner pipe was formed prior to the ultimate buckling load 2 considering only outer pipes for the member buckling resistance results conservatism a new buckling curve is proposed based on the buckling curve form of ec3 the contribution of the liner pipe to the member resistance as well as reduction from the non linear behaviour of the stainless steel were taken into consideration for long lined pipes with carbon steel outer pipe and stainless steel liner pipe eq 7 is proposed 7 n b r d χ l p a s s f y i a c s f y o γ m 1 where a ss and a cs are the cross section area of the carbon steel outer pipe and the stainless steel liner pipe respectively and χ lp is the buckling reduction factor for the lined pipe and can be calculated by eq 8 8 χ l p χ c s t o t χ s s t i t where χ cs and χ ss are calculated separately according to the en 1993 1 1 cen 2005 and design manual for structural stainless steel sci 2017 with the updated stainless steel buckling curve in en 1993 1 4 cen 2015 the carbon steel curve adopts buckling curve with a plateau length λ 0 0 2 and imperfection factor of α 0 13 while the stainless steel curve adopts a buckling curve with a plateau length λ 0 0 2 and imperfection factor of α 0 49 the global slenderness of the lined pipe is defined by eq 9 9 λ a c s f y o a s s f y i π 2 e s s i s s e c s i c s l 2 where i ss i cs are the inertia moment of inertia of liner pipe and outer pipe the comparisons of existing and proposed buckling curves are shown in fig 18 the proposed method offers more accurate predictions for lined pipes the mean ratios of n u n u prop are 1 029 with the corresponding covs equal to 0 040 for lined piped as shown in table 6 note that for different outer liner thickness ratio the proposed curves are different as shown in fig 19 5 conclusions the flexural buckling behaviour of lined pipes with carbon steel outer pipes and stainless steel liner pipes were studied in this paper a total of six long lined pipe specimens were tested under axial compression finite element fe models were developed and validated against the experiments parametric studies were performed upon validation considering various material properties pipe cross section geometries residual hoop stress global imperfections and global slenderness the current design recommendation of dnv os f101 for lined pipes and en 1993
