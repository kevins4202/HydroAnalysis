9670,the effects of water deficit on maize growth and physiological activities have been extensively studied however there are few studies about how various nitrogen n fertilizer types alleviate the impact of water stress on maize yield a two year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of n type on maize growth physiological characteristics and gain yield under various water stressed conditions in 2019 and 2020 this experiment included three irrigation levels of w1 60 etc etc is crop evapotranspiration w2 80 etc and w3 100 etc and three n fertilizer types of urea u slow release nitrogen fertilizer srf and blending u and srf uns the results showed that w1 and w2 significantly reduced maize leaf area index and leaf n content which declined maize net photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and chlorophyll fluorescence inhibited chlorophyll synthesis and thus reduced maize yield w3 not only increased maize growth p n and t r but also enhanced the correlation between p n chlorophyll content chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and leaf area index leaf n content the application of uns alleviated the grain yield reduction associated with water stress under w1 w2 the grain yield in uns were 3 6 22 1 10 4 25 0 and 4 4 24 2 5 3 15 4 greater than that in u and srf respectively although w3srf obtained the highest yield grain among all the treatments no significant difference was found between w3uns and w3srf under the same irrigation amount uns increased the water productivity compared with u in conclusion uns could stabilize grain yield by regulating maize leaf functional traits to cope with future climate change and ensure regional food security keywords water deficit n fertilizer type leaf area index leaf n content physiological characteristics grain yield 1 introduction drought has become a worldwide problem with high frequency increasing severity and long duration which is one of the most severe meteorological disasters affecting agricultural production trenberth et al 2014 drought has also caused serious losses in crop yields up to 300 billion kg each year zhou 2014 meanwhile water deficit caused by drought is widespread in agricultural production li et al 2019a water deficit is a major limiting factor for crop growth physiological processes and yield zhang et al 2011 teixeira et al 2014 and chilundo et al 2016 reported that water deficit delayed maize growth reduced photosynthetic products accumulation and significantly reduced crop yield in addition the limitations on biological process related to photosynthesis due to water deficit include reductions in chlorophyll content chl net photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and photosystem photochemical psii efficiency parameters etc li et al 2006 efeoglu et al 2009 murchie and lawson 2013 tambussi et al 2005 and hura et al 2007 also reported that water deficit affected crop physiology in many ways which not only caused structural damage to psii but also led to abnormal photosynthetic mechanism therefore the responses of crop growth and leaf functional processes to water deficit remain to be clarified further maize is one of the main food crops in northwest china li et al 2017 and it is also one of the principal sources of feed industrial materials and bioenergy which also plays a critical role in agricultural production cui et al 2018 china is currently facing the challenge of growing population and land shortage for agricultural production which puts great pressure on increasing maize production in the future cui et al 2018 in addition it is hot and dry during the maize growing season in northwest china resulting in high evaporation loss and low rainwater use efficiency zheng et al 2018 more importantly water deficit often occurs during the maize growing season due to the large spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in the region xu et al 2008 lobell et al 2014 avramova et al 2015 water stress can decline potential maize photosynthetic and radiation use efficiencies thereby reducing maize growth and reproductive activities shen et al 2015 water deficit has led to 25 30 reduction of maize yield which can be up to 100 yield losses under severe water shortages campos et al 2004 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the effect of water deficit on maize maize can regulate the growth and development by adapting to the absorbed light profile which is closely related to canopy growth and physiological indexes chen et al 2015 hikosaka et al 2016 leaf area index lai and leaf n content are important parameters that determine the nutritive status of maize therefore monitoring lai and leaf n content can provide a vital reference for field water and n management maize growth performance and yield estimation greenwood et al 1986 li et al 2019a photosynthesis is the fundamental process for crop growth and development and also the key pathway affected by water deficit through constraining co2 diffusion to chloroplast and plant metabolism farooq et al 2009 pinheiro and chaves 2010 chl can determine the ability of plant photosynthesis and assimilation which is primarily affected by factors such as water and n song et al 2018 li et al 2019a chlorophyll fluorescence is an important component of maize photosynthesis which can be used as an indicator to evaluate grain yield zivcak et al 2013 xu et al 2014 meanwhile photosynthesis chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence are the most sensitive physiological processes of maize to water and n stresses which can be taken as proxies of drought stress degree for plants pan et al 2014 previous studies have shown that when crops were subjected to water stress chl and photosynthetic capacity of leaves decreased ultimately leading to yield reduction song et al 2018 li et al 2019a leaf chl is the basis for the photosynthetic efficiency of maize the assimilation ability of maize largely depends on the efficiency of chlorophyll transmitting captured light energy to psii and is affected by electron transfer and photochemical activity which is manifested as the response of fluorescence parameters feng et al 2015 ali et al 2018 the sensitivity of these photosynthetic indexes to water and n stresses often markedly differ at different growth stages of maize taylor et al 1983 fereres and soriano 2007 therefore it is necessary to monitor the dynamic changes of maize physiological indexes and their responses to lai and leaf n content previous studies have shown that n is a necessary element for regulating maize growth and development and also plays an irreplaceable role in maize physiological function and overall metabolism mueller and vyn 2016 li et al 2020 as an important component of chlorophyll n has a significant influence on many eco physiological processes of crops ma et al 2021 the reasonable application of n fertilizer can prolong green leaf duration and increase population photosynthetic time shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 farquhar et al 2002 and li et al 2020 reported that n fertilization could alleviate the yield reduction pressure caused by water stress more importantly n fertilization could delay crop senescence and increased stabilized photosynthetic potentials under changing water status may assist in well dealing with climatic change to ensure crop production stability godfray et al 2010 however n deficiency or surplus could significantly decrease crop growth and physiological characteristics li et al 2020 traditional urea significantly decreased leaf vitality and photosynthetic capacity during the reproductive growth period of crops sutton et al 2011 grant et al 2012 reported that slow n release from slow release nitrogen fertilizer srf at the beginning of application led to vegetative growth inhibition with short plant size small leaves and internodes even the canopy structure however previous studies showed that n release rate of blending u and srf uns synchronized with crop n uptake guo et al 2021a zheng et al 2020 uns not only improved leaf vitality and photosynthetic capacity during the vegetative growth period but also delayed leaf senescence and increased post silking n uptake guo et al 2021b ma et al 2021 water deficit effects on crop growth photosynthesis and other crucial eco physiological processes have been investigated extensively however there are few studies about how various n fertilizer types alleviate the pressure of maize yield reduction caused by water stress therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the effects of water deficit n fertilizer types and their interaction on leaf growth physiological characteristics during the entire developmental process of maize 2 explore the relationships between lai leaf n content and physiological functional traits of maize leaf under different irrigation amount 3 investigate whether and how uns alleviate the yield reduction pressure caused by water deficit 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year field experiment was carried out on summer maize in 2019 and 2020 at the water saving

vital references for field fertilization management crop growth performance and yield estimation li et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 arunyanark et al 2008 reported that leaf functional traits were mostly positively correlated with morphological indexes which could be used as a sensitive index to evaluate the response of plants to water drought in this study w2 and w3 significantly increased maize lai and leaf n content increased lai of ear leaves may intercept more light to increase photosynthesis rate and light use efficiency which further enhance the carbohydrates and productivity of maize vitale et al 2016 a higher leaf n content was observed in maize canopies under conditions of high irrigation matching the light distribution hikosaka et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 reported that photosynthesis activity was the foundation of crop material and energy metabolism and also an important factor affecting plant growth and crop yield previous studies have reported that reasonable irrigation amount could protect photosynthetic organs and partially photosynthetic capacity li et al 2019a compared with w3 w1 and w2 significantly decreased the p n t r and chl in this study thereby leading f v f m φ psii and q p reductions associated with the drought damaged photochemical process zhang et al 2015 these results indicated that w3 increased the maximum light energy absorption and capture efficiency of maize and accumulated more energy for photosynthetic carbon assimilation of dark reaction to promote photosynthesis however npq decreased with higher irrigation amount consistent with the finding of efeoglu et al 2009 who reported that water deficit declined f v f m φ psii and q p but increased the npq of maize leaves these results may be due to maize leaves through photoprotective mechanism dissipated excess energy in a form of heat murchie and lawson 2013 in addition harmlessly dissipating excess energy under water deficit is often accompanied by a decline in npq xu et al 2008 more importantly improving npq may be at the cost of p n thereby weakening the carbon sequestration capacity and reducing crop yield by about 20 kromdijk et al 2016 in this study the difference of p n t r chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters among various treatments increased gradually over time in other words continuous water deficit w1 greatly and negatively impacted photosynthetic physiological process which was supported by li et al 2020 therefore adequate irrigation was important to maintaining long term leaf activity and benefiting leaf photosynthesis and finally achieving maize high yield clarifying the relationship between lai leaf n content and maize physiological parameters under different irrigation amounts could improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanism that crops must call when facing persistent adverse climate change lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 p n increased first and then decreased with increasing lai quadratic function relationship because the light energy penetrating the canopy decreased with the leaves growth chen et al 2015 li et al 2019a reported that the relationship between chl and leaf n content could be an assessment tool for n fertilizer managements under different drought conditions to maintain high yields of maize in this study there was a strong linear relationship between chl and leaf n content lai which was closely related to grain yields table 4 however dwyer et al 1995 indicated that strong quadratic functions between chl and leaf n content although li et al 2019a showed that the relationships between the chl and leaf n content could be modified by watering regimes a higher irrigation amount in this study only showed enhanced r2 these results may be varying on cultivar soil n availability and water regime song et al 2018 in this study quadratic function was more suitable for fitting the relationship between lai leaf n content and f v f m in response to different irrigation amounts which may be due to the value of f v f m fluctuating within a small range this result was supported by björkman and demmig 1987 reported that f v f m often ranged between 0 80 and 0 83 without photo inhibition and generally decreased only under water deficit the correlation coefficients of lai leaf n content and maize physiological indexes increased with increasing irrigation amount indicating that higher irrigation amount could enhance their correlation figs 7 and 8 li et al 2019a there was a linear relationship between φ psii q p and lai leaf n content under different irrigation in 2019 and w3 in 2020 figs 7 and 8 however a nonlinear relationship existed between φ psii q p and lai leaf n content under water deficit w1 or w2 in 2020 figs 7 and 8 these results may be the adaptive response of leaf development process to the changes of water status li et al 2019b escobar gutiérrez and combe 2012 also indicated that a decrease in chl lai or leaf n content was not concomitant with a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence parameters of maize leaves in addition the meteorological condition in 2019 were markedly different from that in 2020 fig 1 resulting in remarkable difference of irrigation amount during two growing seasons fig 2 therefore the relationships between lai leaf n content and maize physiological indexes in 2019 were not the same as those in 2020 li et al 2019a these findings may contribute to better understand the impact of climate change on the growth and physiological indexes of the maize canopy lai leaf n content p n chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were significantly positively correlated with grain yield sws and et table 4 our results demonstrated that p n chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were relatively accurate water stress indices in depth understanding of the potential mechanisms of maize physiological indexes in response to water deficit could help to stabilize maize yield to deal with future climate change and ensure regional food security lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 in this study we found a significantly positive correlation between chl and lai leaf n content in addition a significantly negative linear relationship existed between lai leaf n content and npq figs 7 and 8 the changes of chl and npq were closely related to lai leaf n content and the effects of water stress on lai and leaf n content could also be reflected by chl and npq li et al 2019a also suggested that the variability of chl can be used as an indicator for adjusting water management during the whole maize growing season however previous studies showed that leaves growth status under water deficit was usually represented by f v f m or φ psii rather than npq song et al 2018 li et al 2019a these results may be changing regarding cultivar cultivation techniques soil nutrition and watering and fertilizing management which requires further studies chen et al 2015 song et al 2018 in addition remote sensing is a nondestructive measurement in precision farming and lai and leaf n content can be monitored using characteristic spectral signatures by remote sensing methods boegh et al 2013 delloye et al 2018 in the future remote sensing can be used for nondestructively and rapidly estimation maize leaf growth and physiological status proper n fertilization could alleviate the adverse effects of water deficit on lai chl p n and leaf n content in maize farquhar et al 2002 adamtey et al 2010 hernández et al 2015 various n types may lead to different leaf physiological activity under different irrigation amount at various growth stages in this study uns prolonged the availability of n fertilizer compared with u delayed leaf senescence and maintained higher p n in the canopy which is an effective way to increase dry matter accumulation and yield richards 2000 ma et al 2021 compared with srf uns increased photosynthetic efficiency during vegetative growth period which may enhance drought tolerance and improve leaf growth tissue carbohydrate accumulation and subsequent remobilization to grains qu et al 2020 guo et al 2021ab continuous n supply of uns triggered key physiological activities such as n uptake anabolic n process photosynthetic capacity and even plant growth this result was similar to the finding of ma et al 2021 who reported that the improvement in n supply matched maize n demanded improved crop growth promoted dry matter accumulation and n uptake and prevented premature senescence maize yield in uns was about 20 and 5 higher than that in u and srf under water deficit this result was consistent with the finding of li et al 2020 who demonstrated that optimized n fertilizer could effectively alleviate the adverse effects of drought on maize by delaying leaf senescence and improving chl and photosynthetic performance thereby increasing maize yield and wp these results explained why uns was considered to increase stabilize photosynthetic potential under changing water conditions which may help crops with climatic change to ensure stable yields xu et al 2010 ben ari et al 2016 5 conclusions water deficit w1 60 etc and w2 80 etc decreased lai and leaf n content to different degrees and thus reduced p n t r chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of maize resulting in maize yield reduction lai and leaf n content can be used to evaluate the response of leaf development process to water deficit in addition uns delayed leaf senescence and increased population photosynthetic time compared with u thereby increasing grain yield compared with srf uns increased lai leaf n content and photosynthetic products of maize during the vegetative growth period which laid the foundation for maize high yield maize yield in uns was about 20 and 5 higher than that in u and srf under water deficit therefore applying uns to areas with scarce water resources and low rainfall can stabilize grain yield to cope with the threat of

9670,the effects of water deficit on maize growth and physiological activities have been extensively studied however there are few studies about how various nitrogen n fertilizer types alleviate the impact of water stress on maize yield a two year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of n type on maize growth physiological characteristics and gain yield under various water stressed conditions in 2019 and 2020 this experiment included three irrigation levels of w1 60 etc etc is crop evapotranspiration w2 80 etc and w3 100 etc and three n fertilizer types of urea u slow release nitrogen fertilizer srf and blending u and srf uns the results showed that w1 and w2 significantly reduced maize leaf area index and leaf n content which declined maize net photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and chlorophyll fluorescence inhibited chlorophyll synthesis and thus reduced maize yield w3 not only increased maize growth p n and t r but also enhanced the correlation between p n chlorophyll content chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and leaf area index leaf n content the application of uns alleviated the grain yield reduction associated with water stress under w1 w2 the grain yield in uns were 3 6 22 1 10 4 25 0 and 4 4 24 2 5 3 15 4 greater than that in u and srf respectively although w3srf obtained the highest yield grain among all the treatments no significant difference was found between w3uns and w3srf under the same irrigation amount uns increased the water productivity compared with u in conclusion uns could stabilize grain yield by regulating maize leaf functional traits to cope with future climate change and ensure regional food security keywords water deficit n fertilizer type leaf area index leaf n content physiological characteristics grain yield 1 introduction drought has become a worldwide problem with high frequency increasing severity and long duration which is one of the most severe meteorological disasters affecting agricultural production trenberth et al 2014 drought has also caused serious losses in crop yields up to 300 billion kg each year zhou 2014 meanwhile water deficit caused by drought is widespread in agricultural production li et al 2019a water deficit is a major limiting factor for crop growth physiological processes and yield zhang et al 2011 teixeira et al 2014 and chilundo et al 2016 reported that water deficit delayed maize growth reduced photosynthetic products accumulation and significantly reduced crop yield in addition the limitations on biological process related to photosynthesis due to water deficit include reductions in chlorophyll content chl net photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and photosystem photochemical psii efficiency parameters etc li et al 2006 efeoglu et al 2009 murchie and lawson 2013 tambussi et al 2005 and hura et al 2007 also reported that water deficit affected crop physiology in many ways which not only caused structural damage to psii but also led to abnormal photosynthetic mechanism therefore the responses of crop growth and leaf functional processes to water deficit remain to be clarified further maize is one of the main food crops in northwest china li et al 2017 and it is also one of the principal sources of feed industrial materials and bioenergy which also plays a critical role in agricultural production cui et al 2018 china is currently facing the challenge of growing population and land shortage for agricultural production which puts great pressure on increasing maize production in the future cui et al 2018 in addition it is hot and dry during the maize growing season in northwest china resulting in high evaporation loss and low rainwater use efficiency zheng et al 2018 more importantly water deficit often occurs during the maize growing season due to the large spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in the region xu et al 2008 lobell et al 2014 avramova et al 2015 water stress can decline potential maize photosynthetic and radiation use efficiencies thereby reducing maize growth and reproductive activities shen et al 2015 water deficit has led to 25 30 reduction of maize yield which can be up to 100 yield losses under severe water shortages campos et al 2004 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the effect of water deficit on maize maize can regulate the growth and development by adapting to the absorbed light profile which is closely related to canopy growth and physiological indexes chen et al 2015 hikosaka et al 2016 leaf area index lai and leaf n content are important parameters that determine the nutritive status of maize therefore monitoring lai and leaf n content can provide a vital reference for field water and n management maize growth performance and yield estimation greenwood et al 1986 li et al 2019a photosynthesis is the fundamental process for crop growth and development and also the key pathway affected by water deficit through constraining co2 diffusion to chloroplast and plant metabolism farooq et al 2009 pinheiro and chaves 2010 chl can determine the ability of plant photosynthesis and assimilation which is primarily affected by factors such as water and n song et al 2018 li et al 2019a chlorophyll fluorescence is an important component of maize photosynthesis which can be used as an indicator to evaluate grain yield zivcak et al 2013 xu et al 2014 meanwhile photosynthesis chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence are the most sensitive physiological processes of maize to water and n stresses which can be taken as proxies of drought stress degree for plants pan et al 2014 previous studies have shown that when crops were subjected to water stress chl and photosynthetic capacity of leaves decreased ultimately leading to yield reduction song et al 2018 li et al 2019a leaf chl is the basis for the photosynthetic efficiency of maize the assimilation ability of maize largely depends on the efficiency of chlorophyll transmitting captured light energy to psii and is affected by electron transfer and photochemical activity which is manifested as the response of fluorescence parameters feng et al 2015 ali et al 2018 the sensitivity of these photosynthetic indexes to water and n stresses often markedly differ at different growth stages of maize taylor et al 1983 fereres and soriano 2007 therefore it is necessary to monitor the dynamic changes of maize physiological indexes and their responses to lai and leaf n content previous studies have shown that n is a necessary element for regulating maize growth and development and also plays an irreplaceable role in maize physiological function and overall metabolism mueller and vyn 2016 li et al 2020 as an important component of chlorophyll n has a significant influence on many eco physiological processes of crops ma et al 2021 the reasonable application of n fertilizer can prolong green leaf duration and increase population photosynthetic time shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 farquhar et al 2002 and li et al 2020 reported that n fertilization could alleviate the yield reduction pressure caused by water stress more importantly n fertilization could delay crop senescence and increased stabilized photosynthetic potentials under changing water status may assist in well dealing with climatic change to ensure crop production stability godfray et al 2010 however n deficiency or surplus could significantly decrease crop growth and physiological characteristics li et al 2020 traditional urea significantly decreased leaf vitality and photosynthetic capacity during the reproductive growth period of crops sutton et al 2011 grant et al 2012 reported that slow n release from slow release nitrogen fertilizer srf at the beginning of application led to vegetative growth inhibition with short plant size small leaves and internodes even the canopy structure however previous studies showed that n release rate of blending u and srf uns synchronized with crop n uptake guo et al 2021a zheng et al 2020 uns not only improved leaf vitality and photosynthetic capacity during the vegetative growth period but also delayed leaf senescence and increased post silking n uptake guo et al 2021b ma et al 2021 water deficit effects on crop growth photosynthesis and other crucial eco physiological processes have been investigated extensively however there are few studies about how various n fertilizer types alleviate the pressure of maize yield reduction caused by water stress therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the effects of water deficit n fertilizer types and their interaction on leaf growth physiological characteristics during the entire developmental process of maize 2 explore the relationships between lai leaf n content and physiological functional traits of maize leaf under different irrigation amount 3 investigate whether and how uns alleviate the yield reduction pressure caused by water deficit 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year field experiment was carried out on summer maize in 2019 and 2020 at the water saving

p 0 01 in 2019 and r2 0 69 p 0 05 in 2020 4 discussion lai and leaf n content are important parameters refleting the nutritional status of crops and monitoring lai and leaf n content can thus provide vital references for field fertilization management crop growth performance and yield estimation li et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 arunyanark et al 2008 reported that leaf functional traits were mostly positively correlated with morphological indexes which could be used as a sensitive index to evaluate the response of plants to water drought in this study w2 and w3 significantly increased maize lai and leaf n content increased lai of ear leaves may intercept more light to increase photosynthesis rate and light use efficiency which further enhance the carbohydrates and productivity of maize vitale et al 2016 a higher leaf n content was observed in maize canopies under conditions of high irrigation matching the light distribution hikosaka et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 reported that photosynthesis activity was the foundation of crop material and energy metabolism and also an important factor affecting plant growth and crop yield previous studies have reported that reasonable irrigation amount could protect photosynthetic organs and partially photosynthetic capacity li et al 2019a compared with w3 w1 and w2 significantly decreased the p n t r and chl in this study thereby leading f v f m φ psii and q p reductions associated with the drought damaged photochemical process zhang et al 2015 these results indicated that w3 increased the maximum light energy absorption and capture efficiency of maize and accumulated more energy for photosynthetic carbon assimilation of dark reaction to promote photosynthesis however npq decreased with higher irrigation amount consistent with the finding of efeoglu et al 2009 who reported that water deficit declined f v f m φ psii and q p but increased the npq of maize leaves these results may be due to maize leaves through photoprotective mechanism dissipated excess energy in a form of heat murchie and lawson 2013 in addition harmlessly dissipating excess energy under water deficit is often accompanied by a decline in npq xu et al 2008 more importantly improving npq may be at the cost of p n thereby weakening the carbon sequestration capacity and reducing crop yield by about 20 kromdijk et al 2016 in this study the difference of p n t r chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters among various treatments increased gradually over time in other words continuous water deficit w1 greatly and negatively impacted photosynthetic physiological process which was supported by li et al 2020 therefore adequate irrigation was important to maintaining long term leaf activity and benefiting leaf photosynthesis and finally achieving maize high yield clarifying the relationship between lai leaf n content and maize physiological parameters under different irrigation amounts could improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanism that crops must call when facing persistent adverse climate change lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 p n increased first and then decreased with increasing lai quadratic function relationship because the light energy penetrating the canopy decreased with the leaves growth chen et al 2015 li et al 2019a reported that the relationship between chl and leaf n content could be an assessment tool for n fertilizer managements under different drought conditions to maintain high yields of maize in this study there was a strong linear relationship between chl and leaf n content lai which was closely related to grain yields table 4 however dwyer et al 1995 indicated that strong quadratic functions between chl and leaf n content although li et al 2019a showed that the relationships between the chl and leaf n content could be modified by watering regimes a higher irrigation amount in this study only showed enhanced r2 these results may be varying on cultivar soil n availability and water regime song et al 2018 in this study quadratic function was more suitable for fitting the relationship between lai leaf n content and f v f m in response to different irrigation amounts which may be due to the value of f v f m fluctuating within a small range this result was supported by björkman and demmig 1987 reported that f v f m often ranged between 0 80 and 0 83 without photo inhibition and generally decreased only under water deficit the correlation coefficients of lai leaf n content and maize physiological indexes increased with increasing irrigation amount indicating that higher irrigation amount could enhance their correlation figs 7 and 8 li et al 2019a there was a linear relationship between φ psii q p and lai leaf n content under different irrigation in 2019 and w3 in 2020 figs 7 and 8 however a nonlinear relationship existed between φ psii q p and lai leaf n content under water deficit w1 or w2 in 2020 figs 7 and 8 these results may be the adaptive response of leaf development process to the changes of water status li et al 2019b escobar gutiérrez and combe 2012 also indicated that a decrease in chl lai or leaf n content was not concomitant with a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence parameters of maize leaves in addition the meteorological condition in 2019 were markedly different from that in 2020 fig 1 resulting in remarkable difference of irrigation amount during two growing seasons fig 2 therefore the relationships between lai leaf n content and maize physiological indexes in 2019 were not the same as those in 2020 li et al 2019a these findings may contribute to better understand the impact of climate change on the growth and physiological indexes of the maize canopy lai leaf n content p n chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were significantly positively correlated with grain yield sws and et table 4 our results demonstrated that p n chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were relatively accurate water stress indices in depth understanding of the potential mechanisms of maize physiological indexes in response to water deficit could help to stabilize maize yield to deal with future climate change and ensure regional food security lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 in this study we found a significantly positive correlation between chl and lai leaf n content in addition a significantly negative linear relationship existed between lai leaf n content and npq figs 7 and 8 the changes of chl and npq were closely related to lai leaf n content and the effects of water stress on lai and leaf n content could also be reflected by chl and npq li et al 2019a also suggested that the variability of chl can be used as an indicator for adjusting water management during the whole maize growing season however previous studies showed that leaves growth status under water deficit was usually represented by f v f m or φ psii rather than npq song et al 2018 li et al 2019a these results may be changing regarding cultivar cultivation techniques soil nutrition and watering and fertilizing management which requires further studies chen et al 2015 song et al 2018 in addition remote sensing is a nondestructive measurement in precision farming and lai and leaf n content can be monitored using characteristic spectral signatures by remote sensing methods boegh et al 2013 delloye et al 2018 in the future remote sensing can be used for nondestructively and rapidly estimation maize leaf growth and physiological status proper n fertilization could alleviate the adverse effects of water deficit on lai chl p n and leaf n content in maize farquhar et al 2002 adamtey et al 2010 hernández et al 2015 various n types may lead to different leaf physiological activity under different irrigation amount at various growth stages in this study uns prolonged the availability of n fertilizer compared with u delayed leaf senescence and maintained higher p n in the canopy which is an effective way to increase dry matter accumulation and yield richards 2000 ma et al 2021 compared with srf uns increased photosynthetic efficiency during vegetative growth period which may enhance drought tolerance and improve leaf growth tissue carbohydrate accumulation and subsequent remobilization to grains qu et al 2020 guo et al 2021ab continuous n supply of uns triggered key physiological activities such as n uptake anabolic n process photosynthetic capacity and even plant growth this result was similar to the finding of ma et al 2021 who reported that the improvement in n supply matched maize n demanded improved crop growth promoted dry matter accumulation and n uptake and prevented premature senescence maize yield in uns was about 20 and 5 higher than that in u and srf under water deficit this result was consistent with the finding of li et al 2020 who demonstrated that optimized n fertilizer could effectively alleviate the adverse effects of drought on maize by delaying leaf senescence and improving chl and photosynthetic performance thereby increasing maize yield and wp these results explained why uns was considered to increase stabilize photosynthetic potential under changing water conditions which may help crops with climatic change to ensure stable yields xu et al 2010 ben ari et al 2016 5 conclusions water deficit w1 60 etc and w2 80 etc decreased lai and leaf n content to different degrees and thus reduced p n t r chl and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of maize resulting in maize yield reduction lai and leaf n content can be used to evaluate the response of leaf development process to water deficit in addition uns delayed leaf senescence and increased population photosynthetic time compared with u thereby increasing grain yield compared with srf uns increased lai leaf n content and photosynthetic products of maize during the vegetative growth period which laid the foundation for maize high yield maize yield in uns was about 20 and 5 higher than that in u and srf under water deficit therefore applying uns to areas with scarce water resources and low rainfall can stabilize grain yield to cope with the threat of

the lowest thermal amplitude and the highest insolation ratio in the growth stage that preceded the second cut contributed to the highest tadmp shown at 180 dafp tadmp depends on photosynthetically active radiation par which has a direct correlation with the insolation ratio cultivation environments subjected to excessively low or extremely high temperatures generate variations in biomass production as well as in the quality of the plant material obtained lorenzo 2012 variations in matter production in l alba are related to physiological processes the plant continuously produces leaves

9672,irrigation plays an important role in agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid regions however the conflict between water supply and demand will become more serious with increasing population this study was to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation processes in agricultural areas due to frequent vertical interactions between the saturated groundwater zone and the unsaturated soil water zone and significant lateral groundwater movement between different horizontal areas in arid and semi arid agricultural areas with shallow groundwater level a quasi three dimensional quasi 3d model was adopted which coupled one dimensional 1d soil water and salt movement and 3d groundwater and salt movement the yonglian irrigation area was used as the typical study site nine limited irrigation scenarios based on different allocations of irrigation water and hydrological years were set and analyzed the main results were as follows 1 the net groundwater recharge is negative under most of limited irrigation conditions causing the decline of groundwater level ranging from 0 028 m to 0 199 m within one year 2 with the decrease of irrigation and precipitation in farmland during the crop growth period the groundwater recharge groundwater recharge concentration leaching efficiency coefficient will decrease linearly while soil salt storage index will increase linearly 3 salts may accumulate in the root zone for dry years or normal years with autumn irrigation water less than 100 mm per unit area 4 lateral groundwater fluxes and salts contained in lateral groundwater fluxes will reduce approximately 30 and 40 under limited irrigation conditions 5 the root zone will suffer from a very severe threat of soil salinization in farmlands in the future when considering the average annual increase rate of soil salt in the root zone is 3 6 under limited irrigation conditions and necessarily intervenes are needed the results could support decision making for water saving and soil salinity prevention in arid agricultural districts keywords soil salinity groundwater recharge

1 introduction irrigation plays an important role in agricultural production worldwide li and ren 2021 world bank 2017 sauer et al 2010 especially in arid and semi arid regions such as agricultural areas in egypt northern china western united states and central asian countries miao et al 2021 shokri kuehni et al 2020 jahin et al 2020 fao and itps 2015 li et al 2014 karimov et al 2014 however irrigation consumes most of the available water resources velasco muñoz et al 2019 adeyemi et al 2017 and the conflict between water supply and demand is a major challenge for agriculture in arid and semi arid regions therefore limited irrigation has been adopted in many areas kisekka et al 2017 jahanzad et al 2013 however reduction of irrigation water may disrupt existing agro hydrological processes which may lead to a series of problems such as the decrease of groundwater levels and secondary soil salinization singh 2021 cuevas et al 2019 daliakopoulos et al 2016 assouline et al 2015 and the effect of limited irrigation on soil salt dynamic in the root zone is unclear therefore it is essential to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation for the sustainable development of agriculture hetao irrigation district is a representative agricultural district in arid region in china nowadays the district relies heavily on water diversion from the yellow river with an average annual diversion water of 4 7 billion m3 however water resources management agency has substantially reduced the future diversion water to the hetao irrigation district to 4 0 billion m3 to sustain irrigated agriculture in the district limited irrigation is an inevitable alternative because of the arid climate however the average groundwater level of the district has gradually decreased in recent years and limited irrigation will further decrease the groundwater levels besides the district is threatened by soil salinization yao et al 2020 yu et al 2010 and soil salinization will become more severe because limited irrigation will lead to insufficient soil salt leaching and poor drainage as there are no drainage tubes and most ditches in the fields are no longer functional due to disrepair however on the other hand decreased groundwater levels may result in less phreatic evaporation which is beneficial for soil salt control as the amount of salts introduced from groundwater to the root zone will be less as a result a throughout understanding of agro hydrological processes under limited irrigation is necessary shallow groundwater system in arid and semi arid agricultural areas plays an important role in affecting soil water environments gao et al 2018 normally the groundwater recharge coefficient gwc is used as a simple but comprehensive description wang et al 2008 which is the ratio between groundwater recharge and precipitation irrigation groundwater level fluctuation method tracer method and empirical and numerical models have been adopted to evaluate groundwater recharge and groundwater recharge coefficient singh 2018 moeck et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 however groundwater recharge process is influenced spatially and temporally by factors such as meteorology soil characteristics land cover and topography allocca et al 2014 szilagyi and jozsa 2013 therefore spatio temporal variation should be considered and distributed models have been developed and used li and ren 2019 tan et al 2014 assefa and woodbury 2013 liggett and allen 2010 for example ren et al 2019 used a distributed 1d variably saturated model and set the lower boundary of the profile below the groundwater level to describe the vertical interactions between groundwater and soil water in the hetao irrigation district however detailed regional scale descriptions of water movement processes in both saturated and unsaturated zones are required because in addition to frequently vertical interactions between groundwater and soil water there are significant lateral groundwater movement driven by obvious lateral hydraulic gradients which are caused by fragmented land use especially in the developing regions with smallholder agriculture schmitter et al 2015 karimov et al 2014 comparing with the estimation of groundwater recharge the estimation of groundwater recharge concentration during soil salt leaching is more complex and empirical however the result is crucial in the analysis of soil salt leaching and accumulation processes assouline et al 2015 two major methods are adopted when considering transient leaching process one is to consider groundwater recharge concentration as a weighted average result of the concentration of infiltration water and the concentration of soil water which is widely used in various empirical methods based on the mass balance principle chang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 and leaching efficiency coefficient is the core parameter in these methods ritzema 2006 the other is to obtain the groundwater recharge concentration based on numerical models for example the hydrus 1d model was used to obtain groundwater recharge concentrations and the results were then used as upper boundary conditions for shallow groundwater system xiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 however the uncoupled considering of unsaturated zone or saturated zone cannot obtain the spatio temporal interface boundary between the saturated zone and unsaturated zone accurately and synchronously moreover there may be significant lateral groundwater movement in arid and semi arid agricultural areas take the hetao irrigation district as an example there is an intensive irrigation during the autumn period for soil salt leaching which will result in significant groundwater recharge and increase the groundwater level in farmland by more than 1 m xu et al 2010 then a large amount of groundwater and salts leached from the root zone will be transferred to adjacent areas without autumn irrigation driven by significant lateral groundwater gradients this process is believed as one of the efficient ways for soil salt control in farmlands and remote sensing method field experiments and conceptual model have been used to quantify the process xiao et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2009 konukcu et al 2006 however surface salinity dynamics are paid more attention by previous studies while the spatio temporal groundwater and salt lateral exchange remains unclear due to the limitations of regional scale observations and simulation techniques in summary soil water moves mainly vertically influenced by precipitation irrigation and evapotranspiration while the groundwater system shows complex three dimensional 3d flow characteristics in arid agricultural areas with shallow groundwater levels which are influenced by drastic variation in upper boundary conditions and significant lateral hydraulic gradients therefore quasi 3d models coupling 1d unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport with 3d groundwater movement and solute transport are the most suitable schemes considering the characteristics described above which provide a trade off between model accuracy and computational cost and have been used in recent years xiang et al 2020 beegum et al 2020 mosase et al 2019 such as uzf modflow mt3dms morway et al 2013 uzf modflow rt3d bailey et al 2013 pht3d uzf wu et al 2016 hydrus moflow beegum et al 2020 and q3d zhu et al 2013 to address the specific problems of regional scale agricultural district a new quasi 3d model was developed by mao et al 2021 and the satisfactory performance of the model has been demonstrated based on synthetic and real world applications in this study the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation processes were evaluated at a typical study site in the hetao irrigation district the quasi 3d model was used to describe the complex agro hydrological processes in agricultural areas and nine limited irrigation scenarios were set and compared the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate regional scale groundwater recharge and salt leaching and accumulation in the root zone of farmlands under limited irrigation 2 assess the budget of water and salt under limited irrigation and 3 quantify lateral groundwater movement and salt transport processes among different land use types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and observation data the specific study site is yonglian irrigation area 107 59 9 108 1 51 e 41 0 50 41 8 6 n located in the lower part of hetao irrigation district as shown in fig 1 the study site is 12 km long from north to south and 3 km wide from east to west and the area is 29 75 km2 the east west and north sides are surrounded by drainage ditches while only a portion of the south side is adjacent to the zaohuo trunk canal which is an earthen canal the study site can be considered as an independent hydrological area moreover detailed saturated unsaturated water and salt data were monitored in the study site as a result the yonglian irrigation area was selected as the typical area to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation yonglian irrigation area locates in the north arid temperate zone during the winter period from november to march the average temperature of the study site was below 0 while the average precipitation was less than 4 mm in each month therefore the study site is quite cold and dry during the winter period and crops are planted only once a year from may to september the average annual precipitation is 173 mm while the average annual water surface evaporation measured with 20 cm pan is 2088 mm irrigated agriculture relies heavily on surface water diverted from the yellow river besides to leach out soil salts accumulated in the root zone there is an intensive irrigation after crop harvest during the autumn period october which is referred to as the autumn irrigation and consumes about 1 3 of the diverted water per year as a result three water use periods are divided in a year named as the crop growth period from may to september the autumn irrigation period in october and the non irrigation period from november to the following april the ground surface elevation of the study site ranges from 1028 5 m to 1025 4 m as shown in fig 2 a and the average slope is 3 10000 from south to north the elevation datum is the mean sea level of the yellow sea of china which is the unified elevation datum adopted by china according to the local geological department the unconfined aquifer is composed of two water bearing strata thus the unconfined aquifer can be divided into two aquifers which are the upper aquifer composed of sandy loam with a thickness between 4 m and 7 m and the bottom aquifer composed of fine sand with a thickness of about 46 m zhu et al 2012 in addition three land use types can be distinguished on the ground surface named as farmlands villages and bare soil as shown in fig 1 moreover there are well developed irrigation canals and drainage ditches of different levels in the study site as shown in fig 2 b therefore the study site was divided into 56 subregions based on the land use types and canal system as shown in fig 2 c the average groundwater table depth is less than 1 5 m thirteen monitoring points were set up in the study site in 2008 as shown in fig 1 no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 no 5 no 6 and no 13 were located in farmlands no 8 in villages and no 7 no 9 no 10 no 11 and no 12 in bare soil each monitoring point has a groundwater observation well and the groundwater table depths were observed 6 times every month from may to october while the groundwater concentrations were observed 3 times every month during the same period the depth of groundwater observation well is 5 m besides soil water and salt monitoring points were set up near each groundwater observation well and soil samples were obtained by manual drilling soil water contents were obtained by the oven drying method and soil soluble salts were extracted by 1 5 soil water ratio to determine soil salt contents the soil types of each monitoring point were detailed surveyed as shown in fig 2 d the soil water contents of each monitoring point were observed 3 times every month from may to october while the soil salts were observed a total of 3 times which were before the crop growth period on april 26 2008 during the crop growth period on july 26 2008 and after crop harvest on october 6 2008 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 description of the quasi 3d model the schematic of the spatial scheme of the quasi 3d model is presented in fig 3 a the unsaturated zone is divided into a series of subregions based on the spatial distribution conditions such as surface elevation land use types and soil types the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport in each subregion are simplified as 1d processes in the vertical direction while the horizontal heterogeneity is ignored the simplification is reasonable as the lateral hydraulic gradient is usually significantly smaller than the vertical hydraulic gradient in the unsaturated zone and soil water movement is almost vertically oriented in flat agricultural areas the inter subregion heterogeneity can be simplified by the overall description dagan and bresler 1979 which supports the 1d vertical soil solute transport in regional scale this concept has been widely adopted by several quasi 3d unsaturated saturated models xiang et al 2020 beegum et al 2020 mosase et al 2019 morway et al 2013 bailey et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes are described by ubmod mao et al 2020 2018 which is developed by a hybrid of mass balance method and numerical method and the mobile immobile assumption has been adopted to describe the significant anomalous solute transport in heterogeneous porous media in practice four hydraulic parameters i e the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the saturated water content θ s the field capacity θ f and the residual water content θ r are used to describe soil water movement while the longitudinal dispersion d l the immobile soil water content fraction β and the first order mass transfer coefficient α are used to describe the anomalous salt transport in the unsaturated zone the specific governing equations can be found in appendix a groundwater movement and solute transport are considered as 3d processes and the widely used modflow and mt3dms are adopted to describe groundwater movement and solute transport a dual iterative coupling scheme has been adopted to ensure the calculation accuracy and efficiency of the model specifically the quasi 3d model can be divided into four major calculation modules and the relationships between different modules are shown in fig 3 b the unsaturated soil water movement module runs firstly based on the specified groundwater table depth then the groundwater recharge is obtained from the results of the unsaturated soil water movement module and the saturated groundwater movement will be calculated based on the obtained groundwater recharge in addition the result of the saturated groundwater movement module is used to update the groundwater table depth and the procedures presented above will be repeated until convergence criteria are achieved similarly the unsaturated soil solute transport module is iteratively coupled with the saturated solute transport module the specific dual iterative coupling scheme can be found in mao et al 2021 2 2 2 coefficients reflecting water movement and salt transport processes thera are three coefficients the groundwater recharge coefficient gwc the leaching efficiency coefficient f and the salt storage index ssi used to reflect water movement and salt transport processes under different scenarios which are calculated based on the results of simulations the expression of groundwater recharge coefficient gwc is 1 g w c r i p where r is net groundwater recharge during the calculation period l i and p are irrigation and precipitation during the calculation period respectively l the groundwater recharge process is completed 8 10 days after water application in the hetao irrigation district zhang et al 2011 therefore irrigation precipitation and groundwater recharge were used to calculate groundwater recharge coefficients for every 10 days besides the groundwater recharge coefficients were further categorized based on different land use types and water use periods it should be specific that the groundwater recharge coefficient is calculated for each irrigation or precipitation event the gwc value of the crop growing period or the autumn irrigation period is the average value for all irrigation or precipitation events during the same period groundwater recharge concentration can be considered as a weighted average result of the concentration of infiltration water and the concentration of soil water and the weighting coefficient is referred to as leaching efficiency coefficient f which can be expressed as 2 f c g w r c i c s w c i where c gwr is the groundwater recharge concentration ml 3 c sw is the concentration of soil water ml 3 c i is the concentration of infiltration water ml 3 which is 0 g l for the precipitation and 0 65 g l for the irrigation water according to the measurement the salt storage index ssi which is defined as the ratio of salt storage change in the profile to the initial salt storage li and ren 2021 is used to evaluate the salt storage change in the root zone the thickness of the root zone was assumed as 1 m in this study the expression of ssi is 3 s s i s e n d s i n i t s i n i t where s init and s end are the initial and ending salt storage amount in the root zone respectively m 2 3 model setup the study site is a relatively closed hydraulic system surrounded by a series of irrigation canals and drainage ditches variable pressure head boundary conditions were set for the southern boundary adjacent to the zaohuo trunk canal based on observed groundwater levels in well 1 the northern western and eastern boundaries were set as variable flux boundary conditions when the hydraulic head in the cell containing the drain is higher than the drain elevation the drainage flux happening in the boundary can be calculated by the drain package of modflow as 4 q o u t c h h d h h d q o u t 0 h h d where q out is the drainage flux l3t 1 c is the drain conductance l3t 1 hd is the drain elevation l h is the head in the cell containing the drain l if however the hydraulic head falls below the drain elevation the drainage flux is zero and the boundary condition is set as non flux the simulation period was set from may 1 2008 to october 31 2008 and a warm up period of 30 days was adopted the warm up period scheme was adopted to eliminate the drastic fluctuations in groundwater level at the beginning of the simulation the reference evapotranspiration et 0 precipitation p and irrigation i in 2008 are shown in fig 4 a in each subregion the atmospheric boundary condition was used as the upper boundary condition four stages were divided during a crop growth period to calculate the actual evapotranspiration for each land use type and the corresponding parameters e g crop coefficient k c leaf area index lai and root depth h root are shown in fig 4 b mao et al 2020 it should be noted that the impervious ground surface in villages is small and most are earthen areas some of which have trees with deep roots causing a slight larger k c than that in the bare soil with most covered by short grasses the saturated zone was horizontally divided into 300 100 finite difference grids and the unsaturated zone was horizontally divided into 56 subregions as shown in fig 2 c the upper aquifer was divided into two layers for simulation and the bottom aquifer was divided into five layers the specific yield and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer were set as 0 08 and 1 0 m d respectively and those of the bottom aquifer were set as 0 1 and 3 5 m d respectively these values were obtained by model calibration based on observed groundwater levels in 2004 and validated based on a two year s groundwater tracer experiment shown in our previous study mao et al 2019 the longitudinal dispersion for the saturated zone was set as 10 m based on the scale of the study site and previous studies and the value were validated based on observations in 2004 2006 and 2007 zhao 2011 li 2009 for unsaturated subregions containing soil monitoring points the unsaturated soil types were set according to the observation results from the monitoring points the soil type of other subregions was set as sandy loam the most widely distributed soil in the study area the hydraulic parameters for different soil types were listed in table 1 which were obtained based on the statistical results given by carsel and parrish 1988 and ratliff et al 1983 these parameters have also been validated based on the observed soil water contents in 2004 mao et al 2019 the mobile immobile assumption was adopted because of the intensive heterogeneity under practical conditions the longitudinal dispersion d l the immobile soil water content fraction β and the first order mass transfer coefficient α for the unsaturated zone were set as 0 4 m 0 2 and 0 001 d 1 which were validated based on the autumn irrigation experiment in the study area mao et al 2020 the simulation results were quantified using the mean absolute relative error mre the root mean squared error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the determination coefficient r 2 which are defined as 5 m r e 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 8 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where the subscript i indicates the serial number of the results n indicates the total number of the results y i indicates the simulated result y i indicates the reference result y is the averaged simulated result and y is the averaged reference result 2 4 set of different limited irrigation scenarios the situation in year 2008 is referred to as scenario s0 the total diversion in the hetao irrigation district in 2008 was 4 6 billion m3 which will be reduced to 4 0 billion m3 in the future therefore the quantity of irrigation for the yonglian study site under limited irrigation scenarios was obtained as a proportional reduction of the situation in 2008 as a result the total irrigation water under limited irrigation scenarios during the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period is 318 5 mm per unit area for the study site besides three allocation schemes of irrigation water during one year were further distinguished the first scheme limits irrigation water only during the autumn irrigation period the other scheme reduces irrigation water during the autumn irrigation period and the crop growth period in equal proportions the last scheme is in between the first two schemes which reduces irrigation water mainly during the autumn irrigation period and less during the crop growth period moreover meteorology data for a total of 58 years from 1961 to 2018 were used for hydrological frequency analysis using the pearson ⅲ curve the results indicate that year 2008 is an extremely wet year and the precipitation in dry year p 75 normal year p 50 and wet year p 25 are 127 mm 163 mm and 207 mm respectively above all nine scenarios can be obtained according to three different irrigation schemes and three precipitation schemes which will be referred to as s1 to s9 hereinafter as shown in fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation and water and salt dynamics comparison between simulated and observed soil water content profiles and soil salt content profiles at different times categorized by land use types is shown in fig 6 the statistical index values are listed in table 2 for soil water content profiles of different land use types the mre values are smaller than 20 the rmse values smaller than 0 06 cm3 cm3 the nse values bigger than 0 14 except for one value and the r 2 values bigger than 0 50 the simulated values fit well with the observed values for soil salt content profiles the mre values are smaller than 41 the rmse values smaller than 4 1 g kg the nse values bigger than 0 0 and r 2 values bigger than 0 65 when ignoring 2 poorer values considering the significant spatial variability of the unsaturated zone at regional scale the simulated results can be acceptable the unsmooth soil water content profiles were caused by the significant heterogeneity of the porous media the misfit of the simulated soil salt content near the soil surface was caused by the intensive irrigation and precipitation during the simulation period and significant spatial variability of soil salts in general the results show reasonable change trend of soil water and soil salt transport over the study site the observed and the simulated results of groundwater table depths and groundwater concentrations in the upper aquifer of the whole study site and different observation wells are shown in fig 7 the simulated average groundwater table depths and groundwater concentrations are consistent with the observed values as shown in fig 7 a the statistical index values are listed in table 3 for regional average groundwater table depths the mre value is smaller than 32 the rmse value smaller than 0 25 m the nse value bigger than 0 60 and the r 2 value bigger than 0 70 for regional average groundwater concentrations the mre value is smaller than 10 the rmse value smaller than 0 3 g l the nse value bigger than 0 04 and the r 2 value bigger than 0 50 for individual observation well the mre and rmse values for groundwater table depth are smaller than 35 and 0 40 m and the nse and r 2 values are bigger than 0 20 and 0 50 besides the mre and rmse values of groundwater concentration for each observation well are smaller than 30 and 0 7 g l while nse and r 2 values are bigger than 0 20 when ignoring 2 poorer values the statistical index values of simulated groundwater table depths and groundwater concentrations for individual observation wells are slightly worse than the regional results but the results still indicate a satisfactory performance of the quasi 3d model some of the poor performance values found in table 3 are explained as follows negative groundwater table depths were founded during the autumn irrigation period which resulted in the worse mre values for well 11 as shown in table 3 the quantity of water calculated by spreading all autumn irrigation water over the farmlands was used as upper boundary conditions during the simulation which was smaller than the actual autumn irrigation per unit area because it was difficult to distinguish a large number of roads field canals and ditches from the actual irrigation area for the regional scale problem thus the observed groundwater table depths are smaller than the calculated values during this period besides for groundwater concentrations the simulated groundwater concentrations were fairly stable and the negative nse values of groundwater concentration were caused by the variability and heterogeneity of the porous media in general the quasi 3d model can capture the characteristics of the saturated water movement and solute transport system in the study site above all the calculation results show satisfactory performance of the quasi 3d model with the calibrated parameters in previous studies which indicates that the model can reasonably describe the unsaturated saturated water movement and salt transport of practical regional scale problems in arid and semi arid agricultural areas 3 2 groundwater recharge the calculated net groundwater recharges during the crop growth period or the autumn irrigation period categorized by land use types under the current s0 and 9 limited irrigation conditions s1 s9 are presented in fig 8 groundwater recharge during the crop growth period was positive for different land use types of s0 as the extremely large precipitation in 2008 groundwater recharge in villages and bare soil was significantly greater than that in farmlands during the crop growth period since soil water in farmlands was heavily consumed by crop transpiration and less soil water was able to percolate into groundwater there was significant groundwater recharge during the autumn irrigation period in farmlands because of the intensive autumn irrigation while the values in villages and bare soil were negative which implies the consumption of groundwater due to the arid climate and evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone in general the average groundwater recharge per unit area in 2008 was 0 054 m and the total quantity was 1 4 106 m3 the percentage of groundwater recharge in farmlands villages and bare soil were 89 3 6 5 and 4 2 respectively when considering water use periods 88 9 of groundwater recharge came from autumn irrigation in farmlands groundwater in farmlands was consumed during the crop growth period under different limited irrigation conditions with negative values as shown in fig 8 groundwater consumption during the crop growth period increases significantly due to the reduction of precipitation and irrigation a significant negative correlation relationship can be concluded that for every 0 1 m reduction in precipitation and irrigation groundwater consumption during the crop growth period increases by approximately 0 014 m as shown in fig 9 a groundwater recharge in farmlands during the autumn irrigation period was significantly and positively correlated with the amount of autumn irrigation there was no irrigation in villages and bare soil which received only natural precipitation and soil water was consumed by evaporation from trees and shrubs therefore groundwater recharge and consumption per unit area were small in these areas and the regional scale groundwater recharge and consumption was dominated by processes in farmlands for different land use types under limited irrigation conditions groundwater recharge during the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period was negative for all scenarios except scenario s3 the negative values ranged from 6 1 104 m3 to 4 7 105 m3 indicating the net groundwater consumption per unit area ranging from 0 002 m to 0 016 m which resulted in the increase of average groundwater table depth ranging from 0 028 m to 0 199 m in scenario s3 groundwater recharge was 2 0 103 m3 and the net groundwater recharge per unit area was 0 007 m the decrease of average groundwater table depth was 0 088 m scenario s3 was in a wet year with adequate autumn irrigation which led to effective groundwater recharge in other scenarios groundwater was not effectively recharged and groundwater consumption gradually increased with the decrease of precipitation and irrigation thus the decline of groundwater level is unavoidable under limited irrigation 3 3 groundwater recharge coefficients groundwater recharge coefficient after each precipitation or irrigation event was calculated and the average values categorized by land use types and water use periods are shown in fig 8 the groundwater recharge coefficients in farmlands for the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period for s0 are 0 351 and 0 38 respectively zhang et al 2011 proposed that groundwater recharge coefficients of the hetao irrigation district were 0 15 and 0 3 for the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period respectively by jointly using field experiment method and numerical method yang et al 2018 used bromide tracer experiment and mass balance method to estimate groundwater recharge process and the results indicated that groundwater recharge coefficient during the crop growth period was 0 18 while it was 0 44 during the autumn irrigation period the result in this study for the autumn irrigation period is consistent with previous studies while the result for the crop growth period is larger due to the extreme precipitation in 2008 under limited irrigation conditions s1 s9 groundwater recharge coefficients in farmlands ranged from 0 104 to 0 173 during the crop growth period which were significantly smaller than the values during the autumn irrigation period ranging from 0 338 to 0 445 with the average value of 0 39 because autumn irrigation was an extremely intensive irrigation with a short duration which resulted in significant deep percolation in villages and bare soil groundwater recharge coefficients during the crop growth period reflect groundwater recharge caused by precipitation and the average value was 0 14 with the help of water balance principle groundwater recharge coefficient reflecting the effect of irrigation in farmlands during the crop growth period can be obtained and the result was 0 16 compared with the current results of s0 limited irrigation would lead to smaller groundwater recharge coefficients in the future because of the insufficient irrigation water and increased groundwater table depth which should be given attention 3 4 leaching efficiency coefficients of soil salt groundwater recharge concentrations and leaching efficiency coefficients for different scenarios are shown in table 4 leaching efficiency coefficients range from 0 785 to 0 900 for farmlands in this study while range from 0 5 to 0 9 in hetao irrigation district in previous studies obtained with empirical models sun et al 2019 chang et al 2019 mao et al 2017 which are consistent with this study groundwater recharge concentration and leaching efficiency coefficient showed obvious positive correlation relationships with precipitation and irrigation for every 0 1 m increase of precipitation and irrigation groundwater recharge concentration and leaching efficiency coefficient during the crop growth period increases by approximately 1 093 g l and 0 216 respectively as shown in fig 9 b and fig 9 c note that the positive correlation relationships exist only when there are significant amount of soil salts containing in the unsaturated zone the groundwater recharge concentration will become small after almost all the soil salts are leached out for different scenarios groundwater recharge concentrations in farmlands during the crop growth period ranged from 4 345 g l to 5 484 g l with the average value 4 805 g l and the leaching efficiency coefficients ranged from 0 546 to 0 772 with the average value 0 639 groundwater recharge concentrations in farmlands during the autumn irrigation period ranged from 4 816 g l to 5 140 g l with the average value 5 011 g l and the leaching efficiency coefficients ranged from 0 663 to 0 770 with the average value 0 717 groundwater recharge concentrations during the crop growth period were smaller than those during the autumn irrigation period because soil salts were more sufficiently leached under the influence of intensive autumn irrigation as a result with the decrease of irrigation and precipitation in farmland during the crop growth period the groundwater recharge concentration and leaching efficiency coefficient decrease linearly it is important to note that the leaching efficiency coefficient is variable depending on the amount of irrigation and precipitation 3 5 soil salt storage change in the root zone changes of soil salt storage in the root zone categorized by land use types and water use periods under limited irrigation conditions are presented in fig 10 ssi values for different land use types during the crop growth period in 2008 were negative due to the large amount of precipitation during the autumn irrigation period soil salts in the root zone of farmlands were significantly leached and the ssi value was 0 199 while the ssi values of villages and bare soil were positive under different limited irrigation conditions soil salts in the root zone during the crop growth period increased for all land use types as shown in fig 10 a significant positive correlation relationship can be found as soil salts gradually accumulated with the decrease of precipitation and irrigation as shown in fig 9 d the results indicated that for every 0 1 m reduction in precipitation and irrigation ssi values of farmlands during the crop growth period increased by about 0 066 there was a negative correlation relationship between the amount of autumn irrigation and ssi values during the autumn irrigation period for wet years s1 s2 and s3 soil salts in the root zone of farmlands accumulated during the crop growth period can be effectively leached by autumn irrigation ensuring no accumulation of soil salts in the root zone however other scenarios for normal years s4 and s5 and all scenarios for dry years s7 s8 and s9 could not sufficiently leach soil salts out of the root zone more seriously with the smaller amount of irrigation and precipitation the salt storage index of the root zone increases and the leaching efficient coefficient decreases fig 9 which will further aggravate the accumulation process of soil salts in the root zone the results herein can be used to estimate the possible long term salinization process of farmland in the future the average soil salt content of 2 5 g kg in 2008 is set as the initial value which belongs to a mild saline situation referring to table 5 under the nine limited irrigation conditions the average annual increase rate of soil salt in the root zone is 3 6 therefore the farmland could become middle saline land 4 g kg after 14 years and become strongly saline land 6 g kg after 25 years as a result the root zone may suffer from a very severe threat of soil salinization with limited irrigation if there are no effective measurements used 3 6 budget of soil water and salt in the unsaturated zone a summary of all water and salt inflows and outflows to and from the unsaturated zone at the study site was carried out and the budget of soil water is shown in fig 11 in 2008 the large precipitation was the major source of water inflow into the unsaturated zone while the irrigation was second soil water consumption items were crop transpiration 64 9 soil evaporation 28 2 and groundwater recharge 7 5 in order the quantity of crop transpiration and soil evaporation and the proportion of each item categorized by different land use types were counted shown in table 6 the largest part of the total evapotranspiration was crop transpiration from farmlands 65 6 followed by soil evaporation from farmlands 22 7 while villages and bare soil accounted for a smaller percentage of total evapotranspiration due to their smaller areas and sparser trees under different limited irrigation conditions all scenarios except s3 showed that groundwater recharged to soil water and all scenarios showed a decrease of storage water in the unsaturated zone for all scenarios except s3 the soil water inflow items were irrigation precipitation soil water storage change and groundwater recharge in order irrigation water was the major source of water inflow to the unsaturated zone with a percentage ranging from 49 0 to 55 7 moreover the decrease of water storage in the unsaturated zone was also an important source of water inflow which ranged from 12 9 to 17 6 with an average of 15 1 for all scenarios except s3 the only soil water outflow items were crop transpiration and soil evaporation and the quantity and proportion of each item categorized by different land use types are shown in table 6 crop transpiration and soil evaporation in farmlands accounted for approximately 90 of the total evapotranspiration the budget of soil salt inflows and outflows to and from the unsaturated zone is shown in fig 12 soil salt inflow items in 2008 were salts in irrigation water and salts storage change in the unsaturated zone soil salt outflow items in 2008 were salts in groundwater recharge in different land use types salts in groundwater recharge in farmlands was the major outflow which accounted for 90 5 of the total salt outflow under the limited irrigation conditions for wet years s1 s2 and s3 the major salt inflow item was salts in irrigation with an average percentage of 88 8 soil salts taken away by groundwater recharge were smaller than those introduced by irrigation therefore salts storage in farmlands also increased in wet years for normal years s4 s5 and s6 the major source of salt inflow was salts in irrigation due to the decrease of precipitation salts in groundwater recharge in villages and bare soil which were account for salt inflow items increased and averaged percentage of salts in irrigation reduced to 85 4 for scenarios s4 and s5 salts storage in the root zone of farmlands increased due to the insufficient leaching process which was the same for dry years s7 s8 and s9 comparing the results of different scenarios it was increasingly difficult for soil salt leaching with the decrease of precipitation 3 7 lateral groundwater flow and salt transport during autumn irrigation intensive autumn irrigation will result in lateral hydraulic gradients between farmlands and villages and bare soil which may drive significant lateral groundwater movement and salt transport the process is an efficient way for soil salt control in farmlands xiao et al 2021 wu et al 2009 konukcu et al 2006 take s5 as an example and the results of lateral groundwater flow and salt transport during the autumn irrigation period are shown in fig 13 the amount of groundwater recharge in farmlands was 3 9 105 m3 with 87 8 remained in farmlands 0 4 migrated laterally to villages 7 2 migrated laterally to bare soil there was no irrigation and precipitation during the autumn irrigation period in villages and bare soil and lateral groundwater from farmlands was the major recharge source in these areas resulting in a decrease of groundwater table depth for other scenarios the ratios between lateral groundwater fluxes and groundwater recharge in farmlands are shown in table 7 the results indicated that the average ratio between lateral groundwater fluxes to villages and groundwater recharge in farmlands was 1 1 while the value to bare soil was 7 8 the lateral salt transport processes during the autumn irrigation period of s5 are shown in fig 13 b large amount of soil salts was leached into groundwater due to autumn irrigation in farmlands and the quantity of leached salts was 2 4 106 kg the leached salts were about 38 4 of the total salts contained in the first groundwater layer of farmlands at the beginning of the autumn irrigation period then 90 0 of leached salts remained in the first groundwater layer which had a thickness of about 2 0 m the groundwater concentration in this layer increased from 2 31 g l at the beginning of the period to 2 63 g l at the end of the period besides 5 0 of salts went into the secondary groundwater layer and the quantity was about 0 7 of the total salts contained in this layer at the beginning of the period the thickness of this layer was 4 0 m and the groundwater concentration in this layer increased from 2 32 g l to 2 34 g l during the period 2 5 of salts laterally transported into villages and bare soil along with the lateral groundwater fluxes the salts storage in the first groundwater layer of villages and bare soil increased by 5 2 and 9 7 respectively the salts storage in the second groundwater layer of villages remained stable while the salts storage in the second layer of bare soil decreased by 0 3 the decrease of salts storage in the second layer of bare soil is caused by two reasons the upward convection along with the groundwater level raise when receiving lateral groundwater recharge from adjacent farmlands and the upward diffusion caused by concentration gradient between the second and first layers for other scenarios the ratios between salts contained in lateral groundwater fluxes and salts contained in groundwater recharge in farmlands are shown in table 7 under different limited irrigation conditions the average ratio between salts contained in lateral groundwater fluxes to villages and salts contained in groundwater recharge in farmlands was 0 1 and the value to bare soil was 2 8 the lateral transport ratio of salt was smaller than that of groundwater the reason is that the groundwater recharge concentration was larger than groundwater concentration as shown in sect 3 4 however because of the large volume of groundwater groundwater recharge with high concentrations would be diluted and the concentration of lateral groundwater flux was comparable to the concentration of groundwater in the aquifer 4 conclusions this study evaluated the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation processes of the hetao irrigation district groundwater recharge soil salt leaching process and lateral groundwater movement and salt transport processes among different land use types were quantitatively analyzed several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 groundwater recharge during the autumn irrigation period was less than groundwater consumption during the crop growth period under limited irrigation conditions and the decline of groundwater level is unavoidable the decrease of averaged groundwater level ranged from 0 028 m to 0 199 m within one year 2 for wet years and normal years with abundant autumn irrigation water soil salts in the root zone of farmlands accumulated during the crop growth period can be effectively leached while salts accumulate in the root zone for dry years and normal years with autumn irrigation water less than 100 mm per unit area 3 significant lateral groundwater movement and salt transport happen during the autumn irrigation period the average ratio between lateral groundwater fluxes to other land use types and groundwater recharge in farmlands was 8 9 while the ratio for salts was 2 9 under limited irrigation conditions which were 30 and 40 less compared to unlimited conditions respectively 4 the root zone may suffer from a very severe threat of soil salinization in farmlands in the future with limited irrigation therefore under limited irrigation conditions it is necessary to intervene in the soil salinization process with other measures financial support the

9672,irrigation plays an important role in agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid regions however the conflict between water supply and demand will become more serious with increasing population this study was to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation processes in agricultural areas due to frequent vertical interactions between the saturated groundwater zone and the unsaturated soil water zone and significant lateral groundwater movement between different horizontal areas in arid and semi arid agricultural areas with shallow groundwater level a quasi three dimensional quasi 3d model was adopted which coupled one dimensional 1d soil water and salt movement and 3d groundwater and salt movement the yonglian irrigation area was used as the typical study site nine limited irrigation scenarios based on different allocations of irrigation water and hydrological years were set and analyzed the main results were as follows 1 the net groundwater recharge is negative under most of limited irrigation conditions causing the decline of groundwater level ranging from 0 028 m to 0 199 m within one year 2 with the decrease of irrigation and precipitation in farmland during the crop growth period the groundwater recharge groundwater recharge concentration leaching efficiency coefficient will decrease linearly while soil salt storage index will increase linearly 3 salts may accumulate in the root zone for dry years or normal years with autumn irrigation water less than 100 mm per unit area 4 lateral groundwater fluxes and salts contained in lateral groundwater fluxes will reduce approximately 30 and 40 under limited irrigation conditions 5 the root zone will suffer from a very severe threat of soil salinization in farmlands in the future when considering the average annual increase rate of soil salt in the root zone is 3 6 under limited irrigation conditions and necessarily intervenes are needed the results could support decision making for water saving and soil salinity prevention in arid agricultural districts keywords soil salinity groundwater recharge

1 introduction irrigation plays an important role in agricultural production worldwide li and ren 2021 world bank 2017 sauer et al 2010 especially in arid and semi arid regions such as agricultural areas in egypt northern china western united states and central asian countries miao et al 2021 shokri kuehni et al 2020 jahin et al 2020 fao and itps 2015 li et al 2014 karimov et al 2014 however irrigation consumes most of the available water resources velasco muñoz et al 2019 adeyemi et al 2017 and the conflict between water supply and demand is a major challenge for agriculture in arid and semi arid regions therefore limited irrigation has been adopted in many areas kisekka et al 2017 jahanzad et al 2013 however reduction of irrigation water may disrupt existing agro hydrological processes which may lead to a series of problems such as the decrease of groundwater levels and secondary soil salinization singh 2021 cuevas et al 2019 daliakopoulos et al 2016 assouline et al 2015 and the effect of limited irrigation on soil salt dynamic in the root zone is unclear therefore it is essential to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation for the sustainable development of agriculture hetao irrigation district is a representative agricultural district in arid region in china nowadays the district relies heavily on water diversion from the yellow river with an average annual diversion water of 4 7 billion m3 however water resources management agency has substantially reduced the future diversion water to the hetao irrigation district to 4 0 billion m3 to sustain irrigated agriculture in the district limited irrigation is an inevitable alternative because of the arid climate however the average groundwater level of the district has gradually decreased in recent years and limited irrigation will further decrease the groundwater levels besides the district is threatened by soil salinization yao et al 2020 yu et al 2010 and soil salinization will become more severe because limited irrigation will lead to insufficient soil salt leaching and poor drainage as there are no drainage tubes and most ditches in the fields are no longer functional due to disrepair however on the other hand decreased groundwater levels may result in less phreatic evaporation which is beneficial for soil salt control as the amount of salts introduced from groundwater to the root zone will be less as a result a throughout understanding of agro hydrological processes under limited irrigation is necessary shallow groundwater system in arid and semi arid agricultural areas plays an important role in affecting soil water environments gao et al 2018 normally the groundwater recharge coefficient gwc is used as a simple but comprehensive description wang et al 2008 which is the ratio between groundwater recharge and precipitation irrigation groundwater level fluctuation method tracer method and empirical and numerical models have been adopted to evaluate groundwater recharge and groundwater recharge coefficient singh 2018 moeck et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 however groundwater recharge process is influenced spatially and temporally by factors such as meteorology soil characteristics land cover and topography allocca et al 2014 szilagyi and jozsa 2013 therefore spatio temporal variation should be considered and distributed models have been developed and used li and ren 2019 tan et al 2014 assefa and woodbury 2013 liggett and allen 2010 for example ren et al 2019 used a distributed 1d variably saturated model and set the lower boundary of the profile below the groundwater level to describe the vertical interactions between groundwater and soil water in the hetao irrigation district however detailed regional scale descriptions of water movement processes in both saturated and unsaturated zones are required because in addition to frequently vertical interactions between groundwater and soil water there are significant lateral groundwater movement driven by obvious lateral hydraulic gradients which are caused by fragmented land use especially in the developing regions with smallholder agriculture schmitter et al 2015 karimov et al 2014 comparing with the estimation of groundwater recharge the estimation of groundwater recharge concentration during soil salt leaching is more complex and empirical however the result is crucial in the analysis of soil salt leaching and accumulation processes assouline et al 2015 two major methods are adopted when considering transient leaching process one is to consider groundwater recharge concentration as a weighted average result of the concentration of infiltration water and the concentration of soil water which is widely used in various empirical methods based on the mass balance principle chang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 and leaching efficiency coefficient is the core parameter in these methods ritzema 2006 the other is to obtain the groundwater recharge concentration based on numerical models for example the hydrus 1d model was used to obtain groundwater recharge concentrations and the results were then used as upper boundary conditions for shallow groundwater system xiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 however the uncoupled considering of unsaturated zone or saturated zone cannot obtain the spatio temporal interface boundary between the saturated zone and unsaturated zone accurately and synchronously moreover there may be significant lateral groundwater movement in arid and semi arid agricultural areas take the hetao irrigation district as an example there is an intensive irrigation during the autumn period for soil salt leaching which will result in significant groundwater recharge and increase the groundwater level in farmland by more than 1 m xu et al 2010 then a large amount of groundwater and salts leached from the root zone will be transferred to adjacent areas without autumn irrigation driven by significant lateral groundwater gradients this process is believed as one of the efficient ways for soil salt control in farmlands and remote sensing method field experiments and conceptual model have been used to quantify the process xiao et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2009 konukcu et al 2006 however surface salinity dynamics are paid more attention by previous studies while the spatio temporal groundwater and salt lateral exchange remains unclear due to the limitations of regional scale observations and simulation techniques in summary soil water moves mainly vertically influenced by precipitation irrigation and evapotranspiration while the groundwater system shows complex three dimensional 3d flow characteristics in arid agricultural areas with shallow groundwater levels which are influenced by drastic variation in upper boundary conditions and significant lateral hydraulic gradients therefore quasi 3d models coupling 1d unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport with 3d groundwater movement and solute transport are the most suitable schemes considering the characteristics described above which provide a trade off between model accuracy and computational cost and have been used in recent years xiang et al 2020 beegum et al 2020 mosase et al 2019 such as uzf modflow mt3dms morway et al 2013 uzf modflow rt3d bailey et al 2013 pht3d uzf wu et al 2016 hydrus moflow beegum et al 2020 and q3d zhu et al 2013 to address the specific problems of regional scale agricultural district a new quasi 3d model was developed by mao et al 2021 and the satisfactory performance of the model has been demonstrated based on synthetic and real world applications in this study the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation processes were evaluated at a typical study site in the hetao irrigation district the quasi 3d model was used to describe the complex agro hydrological processes in agricultural areas and nine limited irrigation scenarios were set and compared the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate regional scale groundwater recharge and salt leaching and accumulation in the root zone of farmlands under limited irrigation 2 assess the budget of water and salt under limited irrigation and 3 quantify lateral groundwater movement and salt transport processes among different land use types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and observation data the specific study site is yonglian irrigation area 107 59 9 108 1 51 e 41 0 50 41 8 6 n located in the lower part of hetao irrigation district as shown in fig 1 the study site is 12 km long from north to south and 3 km wide from east to west and the area is 29 75 km2 the east west and north sides are surrounded by drainage ditches while only a portion of the south side is adjacent to the zaohuo trunk canal which is an earthen canal the study site can be considered as an independent hydrological area moreover detailed saturated unsaturated water and salt data were monitored in the study site as a result the yonglian irrigation area was selected as the typical area to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation yonglian irrigation area locates in the north arid temperate zone during the winter period from november to march the average temperature of the study site was below 0 while the average precipitation was less than 4 mm in each month therefore the study site is quite cold and dry during the winter period and crops are planted only once a year from may to september the average annual precipitation is 173 mm while the average annual water surface evaporation measured with 20 cm pan is 2088 mm irrigated agriculture relies heavily on surface water diverted from the yellow river besides to leach out soil salts accumulated in the root zone there is an intensive irrigation after crop harvest during the autumn period october which is referred to as the autumn irrigation and consumes about 1 3 of the diverted water per year as a result three water use periods are divided in a year named as the crop growth period from may to september the autumn irrigation period in october and the non irrigation period from november to the following april the ground surface elevation of the study site ranges from 1028 5 m to 1025 4 m as shown in fig 2 a and the average slope is 3 10000 from south to north the elevation datum is the mean sea level of the yellow sea of china which is the unified elevation datum adopted by china according to the local geological department the unconfined aquifer is composed of two water bearing strata thus the unconfined aquifer can be divided into two aquifers which are the upper aquifer composed of sandy loam with a thickness between 4 m and 7 m and the bottom aquifer composed of fine sand with a thickness of about 46 m zhu et al 2012 in addition three land use types can be distinguished on the ground surface named as farmlands villages and bare soil as shown in fig 1 moreover there are well developed irrigation canals and drainage ditches of different levels in the study site as shown in fig 2 b therefore the study site was divided into 56 subregions based on the land use types and canal system as shown in fig 2 c the average groundwater table depth is less than 1 5 m thirteen monitoring points were set up in the study site in 2008 as shown in fig 1 no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 no 5 no 6 and no 13 were located in farmlands no 8 in villages and no 7 no 9 no 10 no 11 and no 12 in bare soil each monitoring point has a groundwater observation well and the groundwater table depths were observed 6 times every month from may to october while the groundwater concentrations were observed 3 times every month during the same period the depth of groundwater observation well is 5 m besides soil water and salt monitoring points were set up near each groundwater observation well and soil samples were obtained by manual drilling soil water contents were obtained by the oven drying method and soil soluble salts were extracted by 1 5 soil water ratio to determine soil salt contents the soil types of each monitoring point were detailed surveyed as shown in fig 2 d the soil water contents of each monitoring point were observed 3 times every month from may to october while the soil salts were observed a total of 3 times which were before the crop growth period on april 26 2008 during the crop growth period on july 26 2008 and after crop harvest on october 6 2008 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 description of the quasi 3d model the schematic of the spatial scheme of the quasi 3d model is presented in fig 3 a the unsaturated zone is divided into a series of subregions based on the spatial distribution conditions such as surface elevation land use types and soil types the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport in each subregion are simplified as 1d processes in the vertical direction while the horizontal heterogeneity is ignored the simplification is reasonable as the lateral hydraulic gradient is usually significantly smaller than the vertical hydraulic gradient in the unsaturated zone and soil water movement is almost vertically oriented in flat agricultural areas the inter subregion heterogeneity can be simplified by the overall description dagan and bresler 1979 which supports the 1d vertical soil solute transport in regional scale this concept has been widely adopted by several quasi 3d unsaturated saturated models xiang et al 2020 beegum et al 2020 mosase et al 2019 morway et al 2013 bailey et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes are described by ubmod mao et al 2020 2018 which is developed by a hybrid of mass balance method and numerical method and the mobile immobile assumption has been adopted to describe the significant anomalous solute transport in heterogeneous porous media in practice four hydraulic parameters i e the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the saturated water content θ s the field capacity θ f and the residual water content θ r are used to describe soil water movement while the longitudinal dispersion d l the immobile soil water content fraction β and the first order mass transfer coefficient α are used to describe the anomalous salt transport in the unsaturated zone the specific governing equations can be found in appendix a groundwater movement and solute transport are considered as 3d processes and the widely used modflow and mt3dms are adopted to describe groundwater movement and solute transport a dual iterative coupling scheme has been adopted to ensure the calculation accuracy and efficiency of the model specifically the quasi 3d model can be divided into four major calculation modules and the relationships between different modules are shown in fig 3 b the unsaturated soil water movement module runs firstly based on the specified groundwater table depth then the groundwater recharge is obtained from the results of the unsaturated soil water movement module and the saturated groundwater movement will be calculated based on the obtained groundwater recharge in addition the result of the saturated groundwater movement module is used to update the groundwater table depth and the procedures presented above will be repeated until convergence criteria are achieved similarly the unsaturated soil solute transport module is iteratively coupled with the saturated solute transport module the specific dual iterative coupling scheme can be found in mao et al 2021 2 2 2 coefficients reflecting water movement and salt transport processes thera are three coefficients the groundwater recharge coefficient gwc the leaching efficiency coefficient f and the salt storage index ssi used to reflect water movement and salt transport processes under different scenarios which are calculated based on the results of simulations the expression of groundwater recharge coefficient gwc is 1 g w c r i p where r is net groundwater recharge during the calculation period l i and p are irrigation and precipitation during the calculation period respectively l the groundwater recharge process is completed 8 10 days after water application in the hetao irrigation district zhang et al 2011 therefore irrigation precipitation and groundwater recharge were used to calculate groundwater recharge coefficients for every 10 days besides the groundwater recharge coefficients were further categorized based on different land use types and water use periods it should be specific that the groundwater recharge coefficient is calculated for each irrigation or precipitation event the gwc value of the crop growing period or the autumn irrigation period is the average value for all irrigation or precipitation events during the same period groundwater recharge concentration can be considered as a weighted average result of the concentration of infiltration water and the concentration of soil water and the weighting coefficient is referred to as leaching efficiency coefficient f which can be expressed as 2 f c g w r c i c s w c i where c gwr is the groundwater recharge concentration ml 3 c sw is the concentration of soil water ml 3 c i is the concentration of infiltration water ml 3 which is 0 g l for the precipitation and 0 65 g l for the irrigation water according to the measurement the salt storage index ssi which is defined as the ratio of salt storage change in the profile to the initial salt storage li and ren 2021 is used to evaluate the salt storage change in the root zone the thickness of the root zone was assumed as 1 m in this study the expression of ssi is 3 s s i s e n d s i n i t s i n i t where s init and s end are the initial and ending salt storage amount in the root zone respectively m 2 3 model setup the study site is a relatively closed hydraulic system surrounded by a series of irrigation canals and drainage ditches variable pressure head boundary conditions were set for the southern boundary adjacent to the zaohuo trunk canal based on observed groundwater levels in well 1 the northern western and eastern boundaries were set as variable flux boundary conditions when the hydraulic head in the cell containing the drain is higher than the drain elevation the drainage flux happening in the boundary can be calculated by the drain package of modflow as 4 q o u t c h h d h h d q o u t 0 h h d where q out is the drainage flux l3t 1 c is the drain conductance l3t 1 hd is the drain elevation l h is the head in the cell containing the drain l if however the hydraulic head falls below the drain elevation the drainage flux is zero and the boundary condition is set as non flux the simulation period was set from may 1 2008 to october 31 2008 and a warm up period of 30 days was adopted the warm up period scheme was adopted to eliminate the drastic fluctuations in groundwater level at the beginning of the simulation the reference evapotranspiration et 0 precipitation p and irrigation i in 2008 are shown in fig 4 a in each subregion the atmospheric boundary condition was used as the upper boundary condition four stages were divided during a crop growth period to calculate the actual evapotranspiration for each land use type and the corresponding parameters e g crop coefficient k c leaf area index lai and root depth h root are shown in fig 4 b mao et al 2020 it should be noted that the impervious ground surface in villages is small and most are earthen areas some of which have trees with deep roots causing a slight larger k c than that in the bare soil with most covered by short grasses the saturated zone was horizontally divided into 300 100 finite difference grids and the unsaturated zone was horizontally divided into 56 subregions as shown in fig 2 c the upper aquifer was divided into two layers for simulation and the bottom aquifer was divided into five layers the specific yield and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer were set as 0 08 and 1 0 m d respectively and those of the bottom aquifer were set as 0 1 and 3 5 m d respectively these values were obtained by model calibration based on observed groundwater levels in 2004 and validated based on a two year s groundwater tracer experiment shown in our previous study mao et al 2019 the longitudinal dispersion for the saturated zone was set as 10 m based on the scale of the study site and previous studies and the value were validated based on observations in 2004 2006 and 2007 zhao 2011 li 2009 for unsaturated subregions containing soil monitoring points the unsaturated soil types were set according to the observation results from the monitoring points the soil type of other subregions was set as sandy loam the most widely distributed soil in the study area the hydraulic parameters for different soil types were listed in table 1 which were obtained based on the statistical results given by carsel and parrish 1988 and ratliff et al 1983 these parameters have also been validated based on the observed soil water contents in 2004 mao et al 2019 the mobile immobile assumption was adopted because of the intensive heterogeneity under practical conditions the longitudinal dispersion d l the immobile soil water content fraction β and the first order mass transfer coefficient α for the unsaturated zone were set as 0 4 m 0 2 and 0 001 d 1 which were validated based on the autumn irrigation experiment in the study area mao et al 2020 the simulation results were quantified using the mean absolute relative error mre the root mean squared error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the determination coefficient r 2 which are defined as 5 m r e 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 8 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where the subscript i indicates the serial number of the results n indicates the total number of the results y i indicates the simulated result y i indicates the reference result y is the averaged simulated result and y is the averaged reference result 2 4 set of different limited irrigation scenarios the situation in year 2008 is referred to as scenario s0 the total diversion in the hetao irrigation district in 2008 was 4 6 billion m3 which will be reduced to 4 0 billion m3 in the future therefore the quantity of irrigation for the yonglian study site under limited irrigation scenarios was obtained as a proportional reduction of the situation in 2008 as a result the total irrigation water under limited irrigation scenarios during the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period is 318 5 mm per unit area for the study site besides three allocation schemes of irrigation water during one year were further distinguished the first scheme limits irrigation water only during the autumn irrigation period the other scheme reduces irrigation water during the autumn irrigation period and the crop growth period in equal proportions the last scheme is in between the first two schemes which reduces irrigation water mainly during the autumn irrigation period and less during the crop growth period moreover meteorology data for a total of 58 years from 1961 to 2018 were used for hydrological frequency analysis using the pearson ⅲ curve the results indicate that year 2008 is an extremely wet year and the precipitation in dry year p 75 normal year p 50 and wet year p 25 are 127 mm 163 mm and 207 mm respectively above all nine scenarios can be obtained according to three different irrigation schemes and three precipitation schemes which will be referred to as s1 to s9 hereinafter as shown in fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation and water and salt dynamics comparison between simulated and observed soil water content profiles and soil salt content profiles at different times categorized by land use types is shown in fig 6 the statistical index values are listed in table 2 for soil water content profiles of different land use types the mre values are smaller than 20 the rmse values smaller than 0 06 cm3 cm3 the nse values bigger than 0 14 except for one value and the r 2 values bigger than 0 50 the simulated values fit well with the observed values for soil salt content profiles the mre values are smaller than 41 the rmse values smaller than 4 1 g kg the nse values bigger than 0 0 and r 2 values bigger than 0 65 when ignoring 2 poorer values considering the significant spatial variability of the unsaturated zone at regional scale the simulated results can be acceptable the unsmooth soil water content profiles were caused by the significant heterogeneity of the porous media the misfit of the simulated soil salt content near the soil surface was caused by the intensive irrigation and precipitation during the simulation period and significant spatial variability of soil salts in general the results show reasonable change trend of soil water and soil salt transport over the study site the observed and the simulated results of groundwater table depths and groundwater concentrations in the upper aquifer of the whole study site and different observation wells are shown in fig 7 the simulated average groundwater table depths and groundwater concentrations are consistent with the observed values as shown in fig 7 a the statistical index values are listed in table 3 for regional average groundwater table depths the mre value is smaller than 32 the rmse value smaller than 0 25 m the nse value bigger than 0 60 and the r 2 value bigger than 0 70 for regional average groundwater concentrations the mre value is smaller than 10 the rmse value smaller than 0 3 g l the nse value bigger than 0 04 and the r 2 value bigger than 0 50 for individual observation well the mre and rmse values for groundwater table depth are smaller than 35 and 0 40 m and the nse and r 2 values are bigger than 0 20 and 0 50 besides the mre and rmse values of groundwater concentration for each observation well are smaller than 30 and 0 7 g l while nse and r 2 values are bigger than 0 20 when ignoring 2 poorer values the statistical index values of simulated groundwater table depths and groundwater concentrations for individual observation wells are slightly worse than the regional results but the results still indicate a satisfactory performance of the quasi 3d model some of the poor performance values found in table 3 are explained as follows negative groundwater table depths were founded during the autumn irrigation period which resulted in the worse mre values for well 11 as shown in table 3 the quantity of water calculated by spreading all autumn irrigation water over the farmlands was used as upper boundary conditions during the simulation which was smaller than the actual autumn irrigation per unit area because it was difficult to distinguish a large number of roads field canals and ditches from the actual irrigation area for the regional scale problem thus the observed groundwater table depths are smaller than the calculated values during this period besides for groundwater concentrations the simulated groundwater concentrations were fairly stable and the negative nse values of groundwater concentration were caused by the variability and heterogeneity of the porous media in general the quasi 3d model can capture the characteristics of the saturated water movement and solute transport system in the study site above all the calculation results show satisfactory performance of the quasi 3d model with the calibrated parameters in previous studies which indicates that the model can reasonably describe the unsaturated saturated water movement and salt transport of practical regional scale problems in arid and semi arid agricultural areas 3 2 groundwater recharge the calculated net groundwater recharges during the crop growth period or the autumn irrigation period categorized by land use types under the current s0 and 9 limited irrigation conditions s1 s9 are presented in fig 8 groundwater recharge during the crop growth period was positive for different land use types of s0 as the extremely large precipitation in 2008 groundwater recharge in villages and bare soil was significantly greater than that in farmlands during the crop growth period since soil water in farmlands was heavily consumed by crop transpiration and less soil water was able to percolate into groundwater there was significant groundwater recharge during the autumn irrigation period in farmlands because of the intensive autumn irrigation while the values in villages and bare soil were negative which implies the consumption of groundwater due to the arid climate and evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone in general the average groundwater recharge per unit area in 2008 was 0 054 m and the total quantity was 1 4 106 m3 the percentage of groundwater recharge in farmlands villages and bare soil were 89 3 6 5 and 4 2 respectively when considering water use periods 88 9 of groundwater recharge came from autumn irrigation in farmlands groundwater in farmlands was consumed during the crop growth period under different limited irrigation conditions with negative values as shown in fig 8 groundwater consumption during the crop growth period increases significantly due to the reduction of precipitation and irrigation a significant negative correlation relationship can be concluded that for every 0 1 m reduction in precipitation and irrigation groundwater consumption during the crop growth period increases by approximately 0 014 m as shown in fig 9 a groundwater recharge in farmlands during the autumn irrigation period was significantly and positively correlated with the amount of autumn irrigation there was no irrigation in villages and bare soil which received only natural precipitation and soil water was consumed by evaporation from trees and shrubs therefore groundwater recharge and consumption per unit area were small in these areas and the regional scale groundwater recharge and consumption was dominated by processes in farmlands for different land use types under limited irrigation conditions groundwater recharge during the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period was negative for all scenarios except scenario s3 the negative values ranged from 6 1 104 m3 to 4 7 105 m3 indicating the net groundwater consumption per unit area ranging from 0 002 m to 0 016 m which resulted in the increase of average groundwater table depth ranging from 0 028 m to 0 199 m in scenario s3 groundwater recharge was 2 0 103 m3 and the net groundwater recharge per unit area was 0 007 m the decrease of average groundwater table depth was 0 088 m scenario s3 was in a wet year with adequate autumn irrigation which led to effective groundwater recharge in other scenarios groundwater was not effectively recharged and groundwater consumption gradually increased with the decrease of precipitation and irrigation thus the decline of groundwater level is unavoidable under limited irrigation 3 3 groundwater recharge coefficients groundwater recharge coefficient after each precipitation or irrigation event was calculated and the average values categorized by land use types and water use periods are shown in fig 8 the groundwater recharge coefficients in farmlands for the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period for s0 are 0 351 and 0 38 respectively zhang et al 2011 proposed that groundwater recharge coefficients of the hetao irrigation district were 0 15 and 0 3 for the crop growth period and the autumn irrigation period respectively by jointly using field experiment method and numerical method yang et al 2018 used bromide tracer experiment and mass balance method to estimate groundwater recharge process and the results indicated that groundwater recharge coefficient during the crop growth period was 0 18 while it was 0 44 during the autumn irrigation period the result in this study for the autumn irrigation period is consistent with previous studies while the result for the crop growth period is larger due to the extreme precipitation in 2008 under limited irrigation conditions s1 s9 groundwater recharge coefficients in farmlands ranged from 0 104 to 0 173 during the crop growth period which were significantly smaller than the values during the autumn irrigation period ranging from 0 338 to 0 445 with the average value of 0 39 because autumn irrigation was an extremely intensive irrigation with a short duration which resulted in significant deep percolation in villages and bare soil groundwater recharge coefficients during the crop growth period reflect groundwater recharge caused by precipitation and the average value was 0 14 with the help of water balance principle groundwater recharge coefficient reflecting the effect of irrigation in farmlands during the crop growth period can be obtained and the result was 0 16 compared with the current results of s0 limited irrigation would lead to smaller groundwater recharge coefficients in the future because of the insufficient irrigation water and increased groundwater table depth which should be given attention 3 4 leaching efficiency coefficients of soil salt groundwater recharge concentrations and leaching efficiency coefficients for different scenarios are shown in table 4 leaching efficiency coefficients range from 0 785 to 0 900 for farmlands in this study while range from 0 5 to 0 9 in hetao irrigation district in previous studies obtained with empirical models sun et al 2019 chang et al 2019 mao et al 2017 which are consistent with this study groundwater recharge concentration and leaching efficiency coefficient showed obvious positive correlation relationships with precipitation and irrigation for every 0 1 m increase of precipitation and irrigation groundwater recharge concentration and leaching efficiency coefficient during the crop growth period increases by approximately 1 093 g l and 0 216 respectively as shown in fig 9 b and fig 9 c note that the positive correlation relationships exist only when there are significant amount of soil salts containing in the unsaturated zone the groundwater recharge concentration will become small after almost all the soil salts are leached out for different scenarios groundwater recharge concentrations in farmlands during the crop growth period ranged from 4 345 g l to 5 484 g l with the average value 4 805 g l and the leaching efficiency coefficients ranged from 0 546 to 0 772 with the average value 0 639 groundwater recharge concentrations in farmlands during the autumn irrigation period ranged from 4 816 g l to 5 140 g l with the average value 5 011 g l and the leaching efficiency coefficients ranged from 0 663 to 0 770 with the average value 0 717 groundwater recharge concentrations during the crop growth period were smaller than those during the autumn irrigation period because soil salts were more sufficiently leached under the influence of intensive autumn irrigation as a result with the decrease of irrigation and precipitation in farmland during the crop growth period the groundwater recharge concentration and leaching efficiency coefficient decrease linearly it is important to note that the leaching efficiency coefficient is variable depending on the amount of irrigation and precipitation 3 5 soil salt storage change in the root zone changes of soil salt storage in the root zone categorized by land use types and water use periods under limited irrigation conditions are presented in fig 10 ssi values for different land use types during the crop growth period in 2008 were negative due to the large amount of precipitation during the autumn irrigation period soil salts in the root zone of farmlands were significantly leached and the ssi value was 0 199 while the ssi values of villages and bare soil were positive under different limited irrigation conditions soil salts in the root zone during the crop growth period increased for all land use types as shown in fig 10 a significant positive correlation relationship can be found as soil salts gradually accumulated with the decrease of precipitation and irrigation as shown in fig 9 d the results indicated that for every 0 1 m reduction in precipitation and irrigation ssi values of farmlands during the crop growth period increased by about 0 066 there was a negative correlation relationship between the amount of autumn irrigation and ssi values during the autumn irrigation period for wet years s1 s2 and s3 soil salts in the root zone of farmlands accumulated during the crop growth period can be effectively leached by autumn irrigation ensuring no accumulation of soil salts in the root zone however other scenarios for normal years s4 and s5 and all scenarios for dry years s7 s8 and s9 could not sufficiently leach soil salts out of the root zone more seriously with the smaller amount of irrigation and precipitation the salt storage index of the root zone increases and the leaching efficient coefficient decreases fig 9 which will further aggravate the accumulation process of soil salts in the root zone the results herein can be used to estimate the possible long term salinization process of farmland in the future the average soil salt content of 2 5 g kg in 2008 is set as the initial value which belongs to a mild saline situation referring to table 5 under the nine limited irrigation conditions the average annual increase rate of soil salt in the root zone is 3 6 therefore the farmland could become middle saline land 4 g kg after 14 years and become strongly saline land 6 g kg after 25 years as a result the root zone may suffer from a very severe threat of soil salinization with limited irrigation if there are no effective measurements used 3 6 budget of soil water and salt in the unsaturated zone a summary of all water and salt inflows and outflows to and from the unsaturated zone at the study site was carried out and the budget of soil water is shown in fig 11 in 2008 the large precipitation was the major source of water inflow into the unsaturated zone while the irrigation was second soil water consumption items were crop transpiration 64 9 soil evaporation 28 2 and groundwater recharge 7 5 in order the quantity of crop transpiration and soil evaporation and the proportion of each item categorized by different land use types were counted shown in table 6 the largest part of the total evapotranspiration was crop transpiration from farmlands 65 6 followed by soil evaporation from farmlands 22 7 while villages and bare soil accounted for a smaller percentage of total evapotranspiration due to their smaller areas and sparser trees under different limited irrigation conditions all scenarios except s3 showed that groundwater recharged to soil water and all scenarios showed a decrease of storage water in the unsaturated zone for all scenarios except s3 the soil water inflow items were irrigation precipitation soil water storage change and groundwater recharge in order irrigation water was the major source of water inflow to the unsaturated zone with a percentage ranging from 49 0 to 55 7 moreover the decrease of water storage in the unsaturated zone was also an important source of water inflow which ranged from 12 9 to 17 6 with an average of 15 1 for all scenarios except s3 the only soil water outflow items were crop transpiration and soil evaporation and the quantity and proportion of each item categorized by different land use types are shown in table 6 crop transpiration and soil evaporation in farmlands accounted for approximately 90 of the total evapotranspiration the budget of soil salt inflows and outflows to and from the unsaturated zone is shown in fig 12 soil salt inflow items in 2008 were salts in irrigation water and salts storage change in the unsaturated zone soil salt outflow items in 2008 were salts in groundwater recharge in different land use types salts in groundwater recharge in farmlands was the major outflow which accounted for 90 5 of the total salt outflow under the limited irrigation conditions for wet years s1 s2 and s3 the major salt inflow item was salts in irrigation with an average percentage of 88 8 soil salts taken away by groundwater recharge were smaller than those introduced by irrigation therefore salts storage in farmlands also increased in wet years for normal years s4 s5 and s6 the major source of salt inflow was salts in irrigation due to the decrease of precipitation salts in groundwater recharge in villages and bare soil which were account for salt inflow items increased and averaged percentage of salts in irrigation reduced to 85 4 for scenarios s4 and s5 salts storage in the root zone of farmlands increased due to the insufficient leaching process which was the same for dry years s7 s8 and s9 comparing the results of different scenarios it was increasingly difficult for soil salt leaching with the decrease of precipitation 3 7 lateral groundwater flow and salt transport during autumn irrigation intensive autumn irrigation will result in lateral hydraulic gradients between farmlands and villages and bare soil which may drive significant lateral groundwater movement and salt transport the process is an efficient way for soil salt control in farmlands xiao et al 2021 wu et al 2009 konukcu et al 2006 take s5 as an example and the results of lateral groundwater flow and salt transport during the autumn irrigation period are shown in fig 13 the amount of groundwater recharge in farmlands was 3 9 105 m3 with 87 8 remained in farmlands 0 4 migrated laterally to villages 7 2 migrated laterally to bare soil there was no irrigation and precipitation during the autumn irrigation period in villages and bare soil and lateral groundwater from farmlands was the major recharge source in these areas resulting in a decrease of groundwater table depth for other scenarios the ratios between lateral groundwater fluxes and groundwater recharge in farmlands are shown in table 7 the results indicated that the average ratio between lateral groundwater fluxes to villages and groundwater recharge in farmlands was 1 1 while the value to bare soil was 7 8 the lateral salt transport processes during the autumn irrigation period of s5 are shown in fig 13 b large amount of soil salts was leached into groundwater due to autumn irrigation in farmlands and the quantity of leached salts was 2 4 106 kg the leached salts were about 38 4 of the total salts contained in the first groundwater layer of farmlands at the beginning of the autumn irrigation period then 90 0 of leached salts remained in the first groundwater layer which had a thickness of about 2 0 m the groundwater concentration in this layer increased from 2 31 g l at the beginning of the period to 2 63 g l at the end of the period besides 5 0 of salts went into the secondary groundwater layer and the quantity was about 0 7 of the total salts contained in this layer at the beginning of the period the thickness of this layer was 4 0 m and the groundwater concentration in this layer increased from 2 32 g l to 2 34 g l during the period 2 5 of salts laterally transported into villages and bare soil along with the lateral groundwater fluxes the salts storage in the first groundwater layer of villages and bare soil increased by 5 2 and 9 7 respectively the salts storage in the second groundwater layer of villages remained stable while the salts storage in the second layer of bare soil decreased by 0 3 the decrease of salts storage in the second layer of bare soil is caused by two reasons the upward convection along with the groundwater level raise when receiving lateral groundwater recharge from adjacent farmlands and the upward diffusion caused by concentration gradient between the second and first layers for other scenarios the ratios between salts contained in lateral groundwater fluxes and salts contained in groundwater recharge in farmlands are shown in table 7 under different limited irrigation conditions the average ratio between salts contained in lateral groundwater fluxes to villages and salts contained in groundwater recharge in farmlands was 0 1 and the value to bare soil was 2 8 the lateral transport ratio of salt was smaller than that of groundwater the reason is that the groundwater recharge concentration was larger than groundwater concentration as shown in sect 3 4 however because of the large volume of groundwater groundwater recharge with high concentrations would be diluted and the concentration of lateral groundwater flux was comparable to the concentration of groundwater in the aquifer 4 conclusions this study evaluated the effects of limited irrigation on regional scale water movement and salt accumulation processes of the hetao irrigation district groundwater recharge soil salt leaching process and lateral groundwater movement and salt transport processes among different land use types were quantitatively analyzed several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 groundwater recharge during the autumn irrigation period was less than groundwater consumption during the crop growth period under limited irrigation conditions and the decline of groundwater level is unavoidable the decrease of averaged groundwater level ranged from 0 028 m to 0 199 m within one year 2 for wet years and normal years with abundant autumn irrigation water soil salts in the root zone of farmlands accumulated during the crop growth period can be effectively leached while salts accumulate in the root zone for dry years and normal years with autumn irrigation water less than 100 mm per unit area 3 significant lateral groundwater movement and salt transport happen during the autumn irrigation period the average ratio between lateral groundwater fluxes to other land use types and groundwater recharge in farmlands was 8 9 while the ratio for salts was 2 9 under limited irrigation conditions which were 30 and 40 less compared to unlimited conditions respectively 4 the root zone may suffer from a very severe threat of soil salinization in farmlands in the future with limited irrigation therefore under limited irrigation conditions it is necessary to intervene in the soil salinization process with other measures financial support the

9673,the biodegradable film is an alternative to polyethylene film due to polyethylene residue pollution but whether the biodegradable film can replace polyethylene film in terms of root growth utilization of water and nitrogen yield and reducing n application remains unclear therefore two year field trials involved two films biodegradable film and polyethylene film as the main plots and four nitrogen levels 0 n0 90 n1 180 n2 and 270 n3 kg n ha 1 as the subplots were conducted the results showed that compared with n0 n application significantly increased root length density 0 20 cm layer root surface area density 0 10 cm layer root weight 0 10 cm layer and root shoot ratio by 41 6 38 8 89 8 and 33 0 on average for biodegradable film and by 40 3 33 9 61 5 and 23 3 for polyethylene film respectively however n application only significantly increased the root bleeding sap per unit area rbs by 20 1 for biodegradable film compared to n0 furthermore n fertilization significantly increased shoot dry matter evapotranspiration et water use efficiency wue nitrogen use efficiency nue except for n3 and yield by an average of 31 8 9 5 33 2 7 9 and 46 1 biodegradable film 24 8 11 6 34 4 7 5 and 50 3 polyethylene film respectively compared with n0 compared with polyethylene film root length densities root surface area densities root weights in the 0 10 cm layer and wue were significantly lower but rbs except for n0 et and nue were significantly higher under biodegradable film path analysis showed that both improving root length density and root weight were conducive to increasing dry matter accumulation wue and yield for two films the optimum n rate was also found at 173 2 kg ha 1 for biodegradable film and 182 1 kg ha 1 for polyethylene film which could increase nue therefore ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulching combined with 173 2 kg n ha 1 could achieve the goal of replacing polyethylene film in terms of high yield efficient utilization of nitrogen and reducing n application keywords root distribution maize water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency biodegradable film introduction the development and distribution of roots greatly influence a plant s ability to absorb nutrients and water from the soil palta et al 2007 therefore shoot growth and yield are directly related to root growth wang et al 2018 such morphological characters as root length density root diameter root surface area density and root weight density are widely used in assessing root growth amato and ritchie 2002 root bleeding sap has been examined primarily to elucidate the mechanism by which substances are transported from roots to shoots engels and marschner 1993 morita et al 2000 found a close relationship between root bleeding sap and root traits in maize and doussan et al 2006 reported that the amount of root bleeding sap is a measure of root pressure the growth potential of the plant and root activity the root shoot ratio is used to estimate biomass partitioning between the above ground and underground parts of plants in general deep and productive roots are advantageous because they reduce lodging jia et al 2018a and extract more moisture from deeper layers of soil trachsel et al 2013 however such agronomic practices as the application of fertilizers irrigation and planting in furrows in the ridge furrow planting system combined with mulching confine the roots mainly to the top 0 40 cm layer of soil jia et al 2018b zou et al 2018 hu et al 2020 this is because these practices keep the soil in the upper layer moister warmer and more fertile than that in the lower layer for example gao et al 2014 indicated that maize under full film mulching on double ridges achieved greater root weight density root length density and root diameter than under half film mulching on double ridges or flat planting with no mulching because of greater soil moisture furthermore the ridge furrow planting method combined with mulching increased not only the amount of root bleeding sap in maize significantly jia et al 2018b but also soil enzyme activity and the abundance of microorganisms in winter oilseed rape brassica napus l gu et al 2019 therefore this study will study root growth combined with rhizosphere soil environment maize zea mays l is grown worldwide and along with rice and wheat is one of the three staple crops for the growing world population however the area under maize in china declined from 4 5 107 ha in 2015 4 1 107 ha in 2019 www agri cn as a result of national policy therefore it is essential to increase maize yield to ensure food security in northwestern china the climate is mostly semi arid and insufficient and uneven rainfall is one of the major factors limiting maize production in rain fed farming the ridge furrow planting together with mulching with polyethylene film rffm has been used for using precipitation more effectively and for higher grain yield and greater water use efficiency wue wang et al 2011 gu et al 2016 furthermore rffm has been shown not only to improve the root zone environment significantly in terms of soil temperature and enzyme activity but also to decrease the concentration of soil oxygen gu et al 2019 although mulching with polyethylene film has its advantages it also leaves large amounts of polyethylene debris in soil which has many adverse effects on the environment ren et al 2017 it also lowers soil quality liu et al 2014 gao et al 2019 thereby affecting root growth and in turn inhibiting the assimilation of water and nutrients yan et al 2006 for these reasons biodegradable film has been studied to replace polyethylene film in terms of soil moisture temperature and yield for example yin et al 2019 found that biodegradable film with a slow degradation rate and polyethylene film led to similar soil temperature soil water storage and yield fang et al 2020 and gu et al 2020 reported that grain yield of the biodegradable film under different n application was lower under than under polyethylene film however the degradable components such as starch and cellulose in its composition affect the performance of the biodegradable film in complex ways he et al 2017 gu et al 2020 therefore whether biodegradable film can replace polyethylene film remains a controversial matter poor soil fertility is another factor that limits crop production in semi arid areas spedding et al 2004 among the required nutrients n is the one usually required in the largest quantities and plant growth and grain yield are markedly improved by applying n fertilizer li et al 2009 excess application of n is common in china and the dose of n application is as high as 240 330 kg ha 1 in northwestern china zhou et al 2012a it is not only wasteful but also affects the environment adversely the n use efficiency nue of the three main crops namely rice oryza sativa l maize and wheat triticum aestivum l is only about 30 duan et al 2014 50 75 of the n applied either remains in the soil or is lost through ammonia volatilization and denitrification zhu and chen 2002 therefore we need to find the optimal dose of n to reduce n losses there are several methods of optimizing n fertilization rate such as gradient n application li et al 2019 critical n concentration dilution curve n c a m b gastal and lemaire 2002 and the relationship between n rate and increase of grain fang et al 2020 but no consistent amount of n application can be obtained in northwest china for example yin et al 2015 reported that the optimal dose of n for summer maize was 160 kg ha 1 174 kg ha 1 while chen et al 2020 found this value was 210 kg ha 1 therefore to obtain the optimal n fertilization rate multiple targets such as yield and utilization of water and n need to be taken into consideration therefore we hypothesized that the biodegradable film could replace polyethylene film in terms of root growth utilization of water and nitrogen yield and reducing n application a 2 year field trial was carried out 1 to explore the effect of two types of film and four n fertilization rates on root growth grain yield and water and n use efficiencies and 2 to find optimal n fertilization rate for two films materials and methods site description the field trial was carried out over two maize growing seasons june september in 2018 and 2019 at the shaanxi experimental center of water saving irrigation 34 18 n 108 24 e elevation 521 m this area is a semi arid region with a typical monsoon climate meteorological data and properties of the top layer 0 40 cm of soil for the trial site are given in table 1 daily mean air temperature and precipitation throughout the summer maize growing seasons were displayed in fig 4 the rainfall 418 2 mm in the 2018 season was mainly concentrated from july to august 300 7 mm and only 64 2 mm rainfall in september while rainfall 500 mm in the 2019 season was distributed evenly and was 108 2 mm 111 7 mm and 182 5 mm in july august and september respectively the mean air temperature was 24 7 and 23 3 in the 2018 and 2019 seasons respectively experimental design the trial used a split plot design and three replications the two types of film i e biodegradable film and conventional polyethylene film were in the main plots and four levels of n as urea 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 namely n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively were in the subplots both films were white 90 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick and manufactured by yangling ruifeng environmental protection technology co ltd yangling shaanxi china the biodegradable film consisted of maize starch 40 polycaprolactone 50 grease 5 and adjuvants 5 and lasted for 50 80 d before it began to disintegrate the degradation of the biodegradable film was observed every 10 days from the beginning of degradation and the process of disintegration was described as fang et al 2021b the planting pattern was shown in fig 1 each subplot measured 28 0 m2 4 0 7 m and was separated from the adjacent plots by a 1 0 m wide strip the ridges were formed and then covered manually with the film before fertilizer application which consisted of the appropriate dose of n urea n 46 4 120 kg ha 1 of phosphate fertilizer p2o5 16 and 60 kg ha 1 of potash fertilizer k2o 51 all as a single basal dose applied by broadcasting in the furrows of each plot and raked into the soil manually maize cv zhengdan 958 was sown with a spacing of 30 cm between plants within a row on 11 june 2018 and 14 june 2019 the crops were harvested on 28 sept 2018 and on 29 sept 2019 no irrigation was applied and pests and diseases were controlled as needed throughout the experiment sampling and measurement shoot and root sampling during the growth stages v12 jointing and r3 milk three typical plants were selected from each plot for collecting root bleeding sap the plants were cut at an internode about 10 cm above the ground at 8 00 a m the top part was placed plus the stem 10 cm above the ground after root bleeding sap collection in an oven and dried at 75 to constant weight whereas the stump that remained was covered with a piece of medical absorbent cotton 10 10 0 5 cm weighed before use which in turn was covered with a sealable plastic bag fig 2a and then with a black plastic sheet to protect the root exudates from evaporation the cotton with the exudate was collected every 12 h for 3 d replacing them with fresh cotton each time and weighed after collection the cross sectional area csa of the stump was also recorded the stem was covered with a sheet of paper the outline of the section was traced and the area was calculated using autocad autodesk 2007 the specific gravity of the exudate was assumed to be 1 0 and the volume of root bleeding sap per unit area rbs was calculated from the increment in the weight of the cotton using eq 1 1 r b s i 1 6 δ w i c s a where the w i is the increment in the weight of the cotton a soil sampler a 15 15 10 cm cube was used for sampling the root system of the same plants that were used for collecting the rbs from the top 0 40 cm soil at 10 cm depth intervals after the last round of collecting the root bleeding sap the sampler was pushed vertically into the soil at each of four points around the plant fig 2b retrieved carefully to keep the soil block intact and placed in a sealable plastic bag the roots were separated from the soil by gently washing the samples with water to determine their morphological characters their image was captured with a scanner epson v700 jakarta indonesia and then analyzed using winrhizo ver 5 0 regent instruments quebec city canada the scanned roots were then dried in an oven at 75 c to constant weight and then weighed soil temperature a series of geothermometers hebei chuanghe instrument co ltd wuqiang hebei china with three replicates were placed in the ridges and furrows of each plot near the stem up to a depth of 30 cm at 5 cm intervals three bright sunny days during growth stages v12 and r3 were chosen to record soil temperature every 2 h from 8 00 18 00 and soil temperatures at different depths were averaged to arrive at the mean soil temperature in the root zone soil nutrients soil samples were obtained with a soil auger from each of the four points mentioned earlier 2 3 cm away from the stem up to a depth of 40 cm at 10 cm intervals the samples around each plant were pooled and then divided into two parts one for measuring the soil gravimetric water content and the other which was air dried for nutrient analysis soil inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n was extracted using 2 m kcl and the concentration of inorganic n was determined with a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyzer iii seal company germany using the colorimetry method hood nowotny et al 2010 soil organic carbon soc was determined by the wet oxidation method using k2cr2o7 h2so4 wang et al 2003 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the soil gravimetric water content was measured to a depth of 200 cm at 10 cm intervals before sowing and after harvesting for sampling the soil auger was positioned midway between two plants within a row soil gravimetric water content was determined using the oven drying method at 105 for 8 h soil water storage sws mm was computed by using eq 2 2 s w s γ i h i ω i where the γ i h i

used for multiple comparisons p 0 05 results properties of rhizosphere soil compared with polyethylene film the soil temperature at different n application rates in 2018 was 0 8 1 9 mean over daily significantly lower under biodegradable film except for n1 which soil temperature after 12 00 was 0 6 1 0 significantly higher under biodegradable film fig 5 however during the 2019 season soil temperature only at the v12 stage was on an average of 0 6 at n0 and 0 7 at n1 significantly higher under biodegradable film than that under polyethylene film compared with n0 n application significantly decreased soil temperature by 0 1 1 4 under the biodegradable film and 0 2 1 8 under polyethylene film soil water content was only significantly affected by n application table 2 compared with n0 n application significantly decreased soil water content at v12 and r3 stages by 11 1 and 9 4 in biodegradable film and 11 2 and 8 2 in polyethylene film respectively except for the v12 stage in 2018 during growth stage r3 in 2018 soc content at n2 and n3 under polyethylene film was 0 5 g kg 1 on average significantly lower than those under biodegradable film table 2 however in 2019 soc content was 0 4 0 9 g kg 1 significantly higher under biodegradable film compared to polyethylene film except at n0 and n1 at growth stage v12 soil inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n content increased under both types of film as the dose of n increased table 2 the nh4 n content was 0 5 2 3 mg kg 1 significantly higher under biodegradable film than those under polyethylene film in both years except at n0 and n1 at growth stage r3 in 2018 soil no3 n contents were 1 3 4 3 mg kg 1 significantly lower under biodegradable film compared to polyethylene film except at n0 however at growth stage v12 in 2019 soil no3 n contents were 4 8 9 9 mg kg 1 significantly higher under biodegradable film than those under polyethylene film root parameters root length density consistently decreased with soil depth irrespective of the type of film the dose of n or the year fig 6 at a given dose of n root length densities in the 0 10 cm layer under biodegradable film were significantly lower by 8 7 27 5 than those under polyethylene film whereas in the deeper layers 10 40 cm the type of film made no significant difference application of n increased root length density significantly in the 0 20 cm layer irrespective of the type of film with the highest root length density in both types being recorded at n2 in both years for example compared to n0 application of n under biodegradable film increased root length densities by 4 2 105 5 in the 0 10 cm layer and by 7 8 53 3 in the 10 20 cm layer in both years similarly under polyethylene film n application increased root length densities by 12 7 79 3 in the 0 10 cm layer and by 5 0 51 3 in the 10 20 cm layer in both years application of n compared to n0 also increased the root surface area density significantly by 10 1 62 4 in the 0 10 cm layer under biodegradable film fig 7 the corresponding increase under polyethylene film was 14 6 71 2 at any given dose of n root surface area densities only in the 0 10 cm layer under biodegradable film were significantly lower by 4 8 28 3 than those under polyethylene film in both years the application of n significantly increased root weight in the 0 10 cm layer by 35 4 141 1 under biodegradable film and by 19 7 107 0 under polyethylene film compared with n0 fig 8 at a given dose of n root weight in the 0 10 cm layer was 6 2 35 1 significantly lower under biodegradable film compared to that under polyethylene film except that at n2 and n3 which root weight was 9 3 and 12 5 significantly greater at growth stage v12 of 2019 under biodegradable film respectively however the differences between the two films ceased to be significant in the deeper layers 10 40 cm in both years as to the rbs the application of n increased the rbs under biodegradable film but decreased it under polyethylene film in both years table 3 in addition rbs at any given dose of n under biodegradable film was 27 9 183 5 significantly higher than that under polyethylene film in both years whereas when no n was given the rbs under biodegradable film was 15 on average significantly lower than that under polyethylene film in 2019 application of n under both types of the film increased the root shoot ratio table 3 the ratios at low n application n n1 were 9 1 21 0 lower under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film in 2018 however in 2019 the root shoot ratio under polyethylene film was 5 4 significantly higher at n2 during growth stage v12 and was 11 1 significantly higher at n0 during growth stage r3 than that under biodegradable film plant growth utilization of water and nitrogen and grain yield during the stages of v12 and r3 only n fertilization significantly increased shoot dry matter and increased by 15 6 64 89 under biodegradable film and 11 2 46 49 under polyethylene film fig 9 compared with n0 both n fertilization and film mulching significantly affected et wue nue and yield except for film mulching table 4 in both years n fertilization significantly increased et wue nue except for n3 and yield by 6 6 13 2 23 6 41 2 3 9 11 3 and 32 9 54 8 biodegradable film 6 5 15 3 23 1 44 6 3 8 10 6 and 32 9 63 3 polyethylene film respectively compared with n0 compared with polyethylene film the et was 20 8 24 4 significantly higher but wue was 16 6 17 7 significantly lower under biodegradable film however nue was only 3 9 on average significantly higher under biodegradable film than in polyethylene film path analysis and optimizing n fertilization rate the path analysis for root parameters of biodegradable film showed that root length density root surface area density root weight rbs and root shoot ratio were all main directly enhanced by soil mineral n direct path coefficient 0 7 0 5 0 5 1 0 and 0 8 respectively whereas root length density and root weight main directly limited by soil water content 0 4 and 1 0 respectively and temperature 0 4 and 0 6 respectively table 5 furthermore root length density was also indirectly affected by soil water content soc and soil temperature through soil mineral n indirect path coefficient 0 5 0 4 and 0 7 respectively root surface area density was indirectly affected by soil temperature through soil mineral n 0 5 root weight was indirectly affected by soc through soil temperature 0 4 by soil mineral n through soil water content and temperature 0 6 and by soil temperature through soil water content 0 6 rbs was indirectly affected by soil water content soc and st through soil mineral n 0 7 0 5 and 0 9 respectively root shoot ratio was indirectly affected by soil water content soc and st through soil mineral n 0 6 0 4 and 0 7 respectively however according to the total correlation coefficient and the decision coefficient root length density was main enhanced by soil mineral n decision coefficient 71 0 and limited by soil water content 43 7 root surface area density was main enhanced by soil water content 56 2 and soil mineral n 50 3 root weight was main limited by soil water content 219 2 both rbs and root shoot ratio were enhanced by soil mineral n 98 4 84 0 respectively the path analysis for root parameters of polyethylene film showed that root length density was main directly enhanced by soil water content direct path coefficient 0 6 and soil mineral n 0 9 root surface area density was main directly enhanced by soil water content 0 9 root weight was main directly enhanced by soc 1 1 both rbs and root shoot ratio were main directly enhanced by soil water content 1 0 and 0 8 respectively table 6 furthermore root length density was also indirectly affected by soil mineral n through soil water content indirect path coefficient 0 4 and soc 0 6 both root surface area density and root shoot ratio were indirectly affected by soil mineral n and soil temperature both through soil water content both were 0 5 and 0 7 respectively root weight was indirectly affected by soil mineral n through soc 0 7 rbs was indirectly affected by soil mineral n and soil temperature both through soil water content 0 6 and 0 8 respectively according to the total correlation coefficient and the decision coefficient both root length density and root weight were main enhanced by soc decision coefficient 67 2 and 81 0 respectively whereas root surface area density rbs and root shoot ratio were all main enhanced by soil water content 84 0 98 7 and 76 0 respectively the correlations among root parameters dry matter wue nue and yield of the biodegradable film showed that both dry matter and wue were significantly correlated to root length density root weight and rbs the yield was significantly correlated to root length density root weight dry matter and wue table 7 the correlations of polyethylene film showed that dry matter was significantly correlated to root length density root weight the wue was significantly correlated to root length density root surface area density root shoot ratio and dry matter the yield was also significantly correlated to root length density root weight dry matter and wue therefore improving root length density and root weight under the two films was conducive to increasing dry matter accumulation wue and yield the relationships between n fertilization rate and wue nue and yield indicated that wue nue and yield all firstly increased and then decreased with n rate rose but nue decreased sharply when n rate reached n3 fig 10 therefore an optimum n rate could be found by calculating the intersection of the fitting curves of nue and wue or yield the optimum n fertilization rate for biodegradable film and polyethylene film was 173 2 kg ha 1 and 182 1 kg ha 1 respectively discussion the effect of film mulching and n application on properties of rhizosphere soil mulching soil with film reduced latent heat flux and the exchange of sensible heat between soil and air warming the topsoil gan et al 2013 in the present study soil temperatures in all treatments were significantly higher at growth stage v12 than at growth stage r3 a result supported by the findings of fang et al 2021a the main reason is that in its early stages of development the maize plant is small allowing most of the soil surface covered by the film to receive solar energy gan et al 2013 n fertilization under two films both decreased soil temperature due to greater canopy had a shading effect kader et al 2020 however the effect of film mulching under different doses of n on soil temperature has seldom been documented in the present study soil temperatures at n0 and n1 were higher under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film in both years except at n0 in 2018 whereas soil temperatures at n2 and n3 under biodegradable film were significantly lower than those under polyethylene film this may be because that smaller canopy of biodegradable film at low n rates n0 n1 resulted in more solar energy received by soil and accelerated disintegration of biodegradable film but at higher n rates the difference was caused by the lower soil moisture table 2 and better warming effect of polyethylene film sun et al 2018 in the present study soil water content decreased as the dose of n increased this is because the application of n not only enhanced crop growth thereby enabling the canopy to intercept more rainfall zheng et al 2018 and solar radiation kergoat et al 2008 but also increased water consumption wang et al 2016 the soil water content was slightly lower under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film supported by gu et al 2020 this may be because that the biodegradable film disintegrated over time and weakened the water retention performance ammala et al 2011 soil organic carbon is a major indicator of soil fertility mulching with film in combination with n application is beneficial to maintaining soc content jin et al 2020 in the present study soc contents under both types of film stabilized within a short time and kept higher at high doses of n n2 and n3 than at lower doses this finding matches that reported by gong et al 2009 furthermore at growth stage r3 soc contents at n2 and n3 under biodegradable film were significantly lower than those under polyethylene film in 2018 but the pattern in 2019 was the exact opposite this may be because at n2 and n3 although higher soil temperature under polyethylene film fig 5 accelerated the decomposition of soc zhou et al 2012b increased biomass under polyethylene film fig 9 offset the loss of soc zhang et al 2017 soil inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n is an important indicator of n cycling activity and soil fertility nitrogen from urea is more available as no3 n through nitrification kaneko et al 2021 and nitrification is influenced by soil temperature soil water and soil microenvironmental conditions li et al 2009 gan et al 2013 in the present study application of n increased soil inorganic n content significantly irrespective of the type of film a finding consistent with that of kaneko et al 2021 in general the biodegradable film recorded significantly higher soil nh4 n contents and significantly lower soil no3 n contents compared to polyethylene film in both years except at n0 probably because the disintegrated biodegradable film resulted in lower soil water content table 2 and lower soil temperature at n2 and n3 fig 5 which affecting nh4 n transferred to no3 n by nitrification disintegrated biodegradable film also causing the downward movement of no3 n with water kaneko et al 2021 therefore the amount of soil inorganic n was higher under polyethylene film than under biodegradable film especially at growth stage r3 the effect of film mulching and n application on root growth studies have shown that root morphology is modified to suit soil moisture temperature and nutrient status clarkson et al 2000 for example if soil conditions were good roots would be concentrated in topsoil while roots would grow deep into the soil if soil conditions were not good in the present study the application of n significantly increased root length density root surface area density and root weight in the top layer especially in the 0 10 cm layer this is because n application combined with ridge furrow with film mulching not only supplied nitrogen nutrients but also provided appropriate soil conditions in the topsoil such as soil moisture and soil temperature gao et al 2014 thidar et al 2020 the effect of biodegradable film on maize root growth has rarely been documented in this study root length density root surface area density and root weight in 0 10 cm soil layer were significantly lower under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film this is because biodegradable film disintegrated with time causing easy changes in soil properties such as soil moisture soil temperature especially nitrogen nutrients leaching path analysis also showed that soil properties had a different effect on root parameters of biodegradable film and polyethylene film tables 5 and 6 furthermore both root length density and root surface area density in the 0 10 cm layer of soil was higher at growth stage r3 than at growth stage v12 in 2018 this result was reversed in 2019 because in 2019 rainfall events were more frequent during growth stage v12 and air temperature at growth stage r3 was lower fig 1 leading to poor soil aeration and as a result limiting root growth li et al 2020 root bleeding sap is another parameter greatly influenced by water and nutrient uptake making rbs a reliable indicator of physiological activity in the root system noguchi et al 2005 in the present experiment we took care to calculate the amount of root bleeding sap per unit area to eliminate the effect of stem diameter unlike in the earlier studies guan et al 2014 jia et al 2018b we found that as the dose of n increased the rbs increased under biodegradable film but decreased under polyethylene film and was also higher under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film in both years although the higher levels of soil inorganic n and higher soil temperatures under polyethylene film promoted root activity wang et al 2019a n application under polyethylene film also increased stem diameter therefore this was a consequence of the vigorous growth thereby lowering the amount of root bleeding sap per unit area especially under higher doses of n n2 and n3 the root shoot ratio shows the distribution of total biomass between above ground and underground plant parts as soil temperature and the quantities of available water and n increase the root shoot ratio usually increases amos and walters 2006 in the present research under both types of film the root shoot ratio increased with n application and reached a peak at n2 compared with n0 this may be because that the main factor that affected the root shoot ratio for biodegradable film was soil mineral n table 5 but for polyethylene film was soil water content table 6 although other biotic and abiotic factors related to the plant and soil can also affect the ratio mokany et al 2006 the root shoot ratio was greater under polyethylene film than under biodegradable film but both reached a peak at n2 showing that mulching with polyethylene film was more conducive to crop growth and n2 was the best under the two films the effect of film mulching and n application on dry matter utilization of water and nitrogen and grain yield in this study n fertilization significantly increased shoot dry matter in line with quan et al 2020 n fertilization also significantly increased et wue nue except for n3 and yield consistent with the results of gan et al 2013 compared with polyethylene film the et was significantly higher but wue was significantly lower under biodegradable film this is because wue was the ratio of yield to et and the et was higher under biodegradable film due to higher soil evaporation caused by the disintegration of the biodegradable film fang et al 2021b furthermore there was no significant difference in shoot dry matter and yield between the two films yin et al 2017 fang et al 2021b but nue was significantly higher under biodegradable film compared to polyethylene film this may be because polyethylene film improved the nitrogen absorption of plants during the late growth period chen et al 2020 the relationships between root and soil properties utilization of water and nitrogen and grain yield previous studies reported that root weight was significantly enhanced by n input urea bai et al 2021 while root weight and rbs is significantly related to soil moisture jia et al 2018b however how soil properties affect the roots of biodegradable film and polyethylene film has been rarely reported in the current study path analysis showed soil properties had different effects on root parameters of biodegradable film and polyethylene film for biodegradable film root length density was main enhanced by soil mineral n and limited by soil water content root surface area density was main enhanced by soil water content and soil mineral n root weight was main limited by soil water content both rbs and root shoot ratio were enhanced by soil mineral n for polyethylene film root length density and root weight were main enhanced by soc whereas root surface area density rbs and root shoot ratio were all main enhanced by soil water content this is because properties of topsoil were improved under ridge furrow with film mulching wang et al 2019b resulting in shallow root distribution and more fine roots increasing root surface area density li et al 2009 however with the disintegration of biodegradable film soil properties especially soil water content and temperature changed significantly which changed the availability of soil nitrogen nutrient yin et al 2019 soil water under polyethylene film moved to the topsoil because of high temperature wang et al 2019b resulting in a strong correlation between soil water content and root surface area density rbs and root shoot ratio in this study the correlations among root parameters dry matter wue nue and yield of two films showed that improving root length density and root weight under the two films were conducive to increasing dry matter accumulation wue and yield the results were supported by previous studies gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 previous studies also explored the optimal n fertilization rate in northwestern china for instance yin et al 2015 reported that the optimal n fertilization rate for flat planting was 160 174 kg ha 1 according to n nutrition index and n accumulation deficit index but zhang et al 2021 found that the optimal n fertilization rate for ridge furrow with film mulching was 200 300 kg ha 1 according to higher grain yield and reducing the n2o emissions this study optimized the n fertilization rate according to the relationship between n application rate and wue nue and yield and the optimum n rate was 173 2 kg ha 1 for biodegradable film and 182 1 kg ha 1 polyethylene film therefore biodegradable film could reduce n application but not significantly decrease nue and yield conclusions n application under biodegradable film and polyethylene film made roots mainly distributed in topsoil 0 20 cm layer also significantly increased root shoot ratio rbs except for polyethylene film shoot dry matter et wue nue except for n3 and yield although root length densities root surface area densities root weight in the 0 10 cm layer and wue were significantly lower under biodegradable film rbs except for n0 et and nue were significantly higher compared with polyethylene film this study also found the optimum n rate was 173 2 kg ha 1 for biodegradable film and 182 1 kg ha 1 polyethylene film which could increase nue therefore ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulching combined with 173 2 kg n ha 1 could replace polyethylene film in terms of high yield efficient utilization of nitrogen and reducing

9673,the biodegradable film is an alternative to polyethylene film due to polyethylene residue pollution but whether the biodegradable film can replace polyethylene film in terms of root growth utilization of water and nitrogen yield and reducing n application remains unclear therefore two year field trials involved two films biodegradable film and polyethylene film as the main plots and four nitrogen levels 0 n0 90 n1 180 n2 and 270 n3 kg n ha 1 as the subplots were conducted the results showed that compared with n0 n application significantly increased root length density 0 20 cm layer root surface area density 0 10 cm layer root weight 0 10 cm layer and root shoot ratio by 41 6 38 8 89 8 and 33 0 on average for biodegradable film and by 40 3 33 9 61 5 and 23 3 for polyethylene film respectively however n application only significantly increased the root bleeding sap per unit area rbs by 20 1 for biodegradable film compared to n0 furthermore n fertilization significantly increased shoot dry matter evapotranspiration et water use efficiency wue nitrogen use efficiency nue except for n3 and yield by an average of 31 8 9 5 33 2 7 9 and 46 1 biodegradable film 24 8 11 6 34 4 7 5 and 50 3 polyethylene film respectively compared with n0 compared with polyethylene film root length densities root surface area densities root weights in the 0 10 cm layer and wue were significantly lower but rbs except for n0 et and nue were significantly higher under biodegradable film path analysis showed that both improving root length density and root weight were conducive to increasing dry matter accumulation wue and yield for two films the optimum n rate was also found at 173 2 kg ha 1 for biodegradable film and 182 1 kg ha 1 for polyethylene film which could increase nue therefore ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulching combined with 173 2 kg n ha 1 could achieve the goal of replacing polyethylene film in terms of high yield efficient utilization of nitrogen and reducing n application keywords root distribution maize water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency biodegradable film introduction the development and distribution of roots greatly influence a plant s ability to absorb nutrients and water from the soil palta et al 2007 therefore shoot growth and yield are directly related to root growth wang et al 2018 such morphological characters as root length density root diameter root surface area density and root weight density are widely used in assessing root growth amato and ritchie 2002 root bleeding sap has been examined primarily to elucidate the mechanism by which substances are transported from roots to shoots engels and marschner 1993 morita et al 2000 found a close relationship between root bleeding sap and root traits in maize and doussan et al 2006 reported that the amount of root bleeding sap is a measure of root pressure the growth potential of the plant and root activity the root shoot ratio is used to estimate biomass partitioning between the above ground and underground parts of plants in general deep and productive roots are advantageous because they reduce lodging jia et al 2018a and extract more moisture from deeper layers of soil trachsel et al 2013 however such agronomic practices as the application of fertilizers irrigation and planting in furrows in the ridge furrow planting system combined with mulching confine the roots mainly to the top 0 40 cm layer of soil jia et al 2018b zou et al 2018 hu et al 2020 this is because these practices keep the soil in the upper layer moister warmer and more fertile than that in the lower layer for example gao et al 2014 indicated that maize under full film mulching on double ridges achieved greater root weight density root length density and root diameter than under half film mulching on double ridges or flat planting with no mulching because of greater soil moisture furthermore the ridge furrow planting method combined with mulching increased not only the amount of root bleeding sap in maize significantly jia et al 2018b but also soil enzyme activity and the abundance of microorganisms in winter oilseed rape brassica napus l gu et al 2019 therefore this study will study root growth combined with rhizosphere soil environment maize zea mays l is grown worldwide and along with rice and wheat is one of the three staple crops for the growing world population however the area under maize in china declined from 4 5 107 ha in 2015 4 1 107 ha in 2019 www agri cn as a result of national policy therefore it is essential to increase maize yield to ensure food security in northwestern china the climate is mostly semi arid and insufficient and uneven rainfall is one of the major factors limiting maize production in rain fed farming the ridge furrow planting together with mulching with polyethylene film rffm has been used for using precipitation more effectively and for higher grain yield and greater water use efficiency wue wang et al 2011 gu et al 2016 furthermore rffm has been shown not only to improve the root zone environment significantly in terms of soil temperature and enzyme activity but also to decrease the concentration of soil oxygen gu et al 2019 although mulching with polyethylene film has its advantages it also leaves large amounts of polyethylene debris in soil which has many adverse effects on the environment ren et al 2017 it also lowers soil quality liu et al 2014 gao et al 2019 thereby affecting root growth and in turn inhibiting the assimilation of water and nutrients yan et al 2006 for these reasons biodegradable film has been studied to replace polyethylene film in terms of soil moisture temperature and yield for example yin et al 2019 found that biodegradable film with a slow degradation rate and polyethylene film led to similar soil temperature soil water storage and yield fang et al 2020 and gu et al 2020 reported that grain yield of the biodegradable film under different n application was lower under than under polyethylene film however the degradable components such as starch and cellulose in its composition affect the performance of the biodegradable film in complex ways he et al 2017 gu et al 2020 therefore whether biodegradable film can replace polyethylene film remains a controversial matter poor soil fertility is another factor that limits crop production in semi arid areas spedding et al 2004 among the required nutrients n is the one usually required in the largest quantities and plant growth and grain yield are markedly improved by applying n fertilizer li et al 2009 excess application of n is common in china and the dose of n application is as high as 240 330 kg ha 1 in northwestern china zhou et al 2012a it is not only wasteful but also affects the environment adversely the n use efficiency nue of the three main crops namely rice oryza sativa l maize and wheat triticum aestivum l is only about 30 duan et al 2014 50 75 of the n applied either remains in the soil or is lost through ammonia volatilization and denitrification zhu and chen 2002 therefore we need to find the optimal dose of n to reduce n losses there are several methods of optimizing n fertilization rate such as gradient n application li et al 2019 critical n concentration dilution curve n c a m b gastal and lemaire 2002 and the relationship between n rate and increase of grain fang et al 2020 but no consistent amount of n application can be obtained in northwest china for example yin et al 2015 reported that the optimal dose of n for summer maize was 160 kg ha 1 174 kg ha 1 while chen et al 2020 found this value was 210 kg ha 1 therefore to obtain the optimal n fertilization rate multiple targets such as yield and utilization of water and n need to be taken into consideration therefore we hypothesized that the biodegradable film could replace polyethylene film in terms of root growth utilization of water and nitrogen yield and reducing n application a 2 year field trial was carried out 1 to explore the effect of two types of film and four n fertilization rates on root growth grain yield and water and n use efficiencies and 2 to find optimal n fertilization rate for two films materials and methods site description the field trial was carried out over two maize growing seasons june september in 2018 and 2019 at the shaanxi experimental center of water saving irrigation 34 18 n 108 24 e elevation 521 m this area is a semi arid region with a typical monsoon climate meteorological data and properties of the top layer 0 40 cm of soil for the trial site are given in table 1 daily mean air temperature and precipitation throughout the summer maize growing seasons were displayed in fig 4 the rainfall 418 2 mm in the 2018 season was mainly concentrated from july to august 300 7 mm and only 64 2 mm rainfall in september while rainfall 500 mm in the 2019 season was distributed evenly and was 108 2 mm 111 7 mm and 182 5 mm in july august and september respectively the mean air temperature was 24 7 and 23 3 in the 2018 and 2019 seasons respectively experimental design the trial used a split plot design and three replications the two types of film i e biodegradable film and conventional polyethylene film were in the main plots and four levels of n as urea 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 namely n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively were in the subplots both films were white 90 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick and manufactured by yangling ruifeng environmental protection technology co ltd yangling shaanxi china the biodegradable film consisted of maize starch 40 polycaprolactone 50 grease 5 and adjuvants 5 and lasted for 50 80 d before it began to disintegrate the degradation of the biodegradable film was observed every 10 days from the beginning of degradation and the process of disintegration was described as fang et al 2021b the planting pattern was shown in fig 1 each subplot measured 28 0 m2 4 0 7 m and was separated from the adjacent plots by a 1 0 m wide strip the ridges were formed and then covered manually with the film before fertilizer application which consisted of the appropriate dose of n urea n 46 4 120 kg ha 1 of phosphate fertilizer p2o5 16 and 60 kg ha 1 of potash fertilizer k2o 51 all as a single basal dose applied by broadcasting in the furrows of each plot and raked into the soil manually maize cv zhengdan 958 was sown with a spacing of 30 cm between plants within a row on 11 june 2018 and 14 june 2019 the crops were harvested on 28 sept 2018 and on 29 sept 2019 no irrigation was applied and pests and diseases were controlled as needed throughout the experiment sampling and measurement shoot and root sampling during the growth stages v12 jointing and r3 milk three typical plants were selected from each plot for collecting root bleeding sap the plants were cut at an internode about 10 cm above the ground at 8 00 a m the top part was placed plus the stem 10 cm above the ground after root bleeding sap collection in an oven and dried at 75 to constant weight whereas the stump that remained was covered with a piece of medical absorbent cotton 10 10 0 5 cm weighed before use which in turn was covered with a sealable plastic bag fig 2a and then with a black plastic sheet to protect the root exudates from evaporation the cotton with the exudate was collected every 12 h for 3 d replacing them with fresh cotton each time and weighed after collection the cross sectional area csa of the stump was also recorded the stem was covered with a sheet of paper the outline of the section was traced and the area was calculated using autocad autodesk 2007 the specific gravity of the exudate was assumed to be 1 0 and the volume of root bleeding sap per unit area rbs was calculated from the increment in the weight of the cotton using eq 1 1 r b s i 1 6 δ w i c s a where the w i is the increment in the weight of the cotton a soil sampler a 15 15 10 cm cube was used for sampling the root system of the same plants that were used for collecting the rbs from the top 0 40 cm soil at 10 cm depth intervals after the last round of collecting the root bleeding sap the sampler was pushed vertically into the soil at each of four points around the plant fig 2b retrieved carefully to keep the soil block intact and placed in a sealable plastic bag the roots were separated from the soil by gently washing the samples with water to determine their morphological characters their image was captured with a scanner epson v700 jakarta indonesia and then analyzed using winrhizo ver 5 0 regent instruments quebec city canada the scanned roots were then dried in an oven at 75 c to constant weight and then weighed soil temperature a series of geothermometers hebei chuanghe instrument co ltd wuqiang hebei china with three replicates were placed in the ridges and furrows of each plot near the stem up to a depth of 30 cm at 5 cm intervals three bright sunny days during growth stages v12 and r3 were chosen to record soil temperature every 2 h from 8 00 18 00 and soil temperatures at different depths were averaged to arrive at the mean soil temperature in the root zone soil nutrients soil samples were obtained with a soil auger from each of the four points mentioned earlier 2 3 cm away from the stem up to a depth of 40 cm at 10 cm intervals the samples around each plant were pooled and then divided into two parts one for measuring the soil gravimetric water content and the other which was air dried for nutrient analysis soil inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n was extracted using 2 m kcl and the concentration of inorganic n was determined with a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyzer iii seal company germany using the colorimetry method hood nowotny et al 2010 soil organic carbon soc was determined by the wet oxidation method using k2cr2o7 h2so4 wang et al 2003 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the soil gravimetric water content was measured to a depth of 200 cm at 10 cm intervals before sowing and after harvesting for sampling the soil auger was positioned midway between two plants within a row soil gravimetric water content was determined using the oven drying method at 105 for 8 h soil water storage sws mm was computed by using eq 2 2 s w s γ i h i ω i where the γ i h i and ω i is the soil dry bulk density g cm ³ the thickness of the soil layer mm and soil gravimetric water content in the ith soil layer respectively evapotranspiration et mm was determined by water balance 3 e t i p d δ w where the i p and d are the amounts of irrigation mm precipitation mm and deep percolation mm respectively and δw is the difference in sws between its value mm before sowing and after harvesting in the present experiment d was negligible because no heavy rainfall occurred during either of the two growing seasons wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was determined using eq 4 4 w u e g r a i n y i e l d e t nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield at harvest three plants were randomly selected plants were separated by organs and then put in an oven at 105 for 30 min and 75 until to a constant weight each part of the plant was weighed m i kg and then ground to determine n content p i kg kg 1 with a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyzer iii seal company germany using the method of gu et al 2017 the nue was then calculated by eq 5 three rows of plants were selected from the middle of each plot at maturity ears were collected and then air dried threshed and weighted to determine grain yield standardized to 14 water content 5 n u e g r a i n y i e l d p i m i statistical analysis the data were calculated using microsoft excel microsoft cooperation redmond wa the analysis of variance standardizing data for correlation analysis and path analysis were carried out using spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il origin ver 8 5 originlab corporation northampton ma was used for fitting and creating the figures path analysis was carried out as described by dong et al 2019 the relationships between y and x n are shown in fig 3 the method of duncan s new multiple range test ssr was used for multiple comparisons p 0 05 results properties of rhizosphere soil compared with polyethylene film the soil temperature at different n application rates in 2018 was 0 8 1 9 mean over daily significantly lower under biodegradable film except for n1 which soil temperature after 12 00 was 0 6 1 0 significantly higher under biodegradable film fig 5 however during the 2019 season soil temperature only at the v12 stage was on an average of 0 6 at n0 and 0 7 at n1 significantly higher under biodegradable film than that under polyethylene film compared with n0 n application significantly decreased soil temperature by 0 1 1 4 under the biodegradable film and 0 2 1 8 under polyethylene film soil water content was only significantly affected by n application table 2 compared with n0 n application significantly decreased soil water content at v12 and r3 stages by 11 1 and 9 4 in biodegradable film and 11 2 and 8 2 in polyethylene film respectively except for the v12 stage in 2018 during growth stage r3 in 2018 soc content at n2 and n3 under polyethylene film was 0 5 g kg 1 on average significantly lower than those under biodegradable film table 2 however in 2019 soc content was 0 4 0 9 g kg 1 significantly higher under biodegradable film compared to polyethylene film except at n0 and n1 at growth stage v12 soil inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n content increased under both types of film as the dose of n increased table 2 the nh4 n content was 0 5 2 3 mg kg 1 significantly higher under biodegradable film than those under polyethylene film in both years except at n0 and n1 at growth stage r3 in 2018 soil no3 n contents were 1 3 4 3 mg kg 1 significantly lower under biodegradable film compared to polyethylene film except at n0 however at growth stage v12 in 2019 soil no3 n contents were 4 8 9 9 mg kg 1 significantly higher under biodegradable film than those under polyethylene film root parameters root length density consistently decreased with soil depth irrespective of the type of film the dose of n or the year fig 6 at a given dose of n root length densities in the 0 10 cm layer under biodegradable film were significantly lower by 8 7 27 5 than those under polyethylene film whereas in the deeper layers 10 40 cm the type of film made no significant difference application of n increased root length density significantly in the 0 20 cm layer irrespective of the type of film with the highest root length density in both types being recorded at n2 in both years for example compared to n0 application of n under biodegradable film increased root length densities by 4 2 105 5 in the 0 10 cm layer and by 7 8 53 3 in the 10 20 cm layer in both years similarly under polyethylene film n application increased root length densities by 12 7 79 3 in the 0 10 cm layer and by 5 0 51 3 in the 10 20 cm layer in both years application of n compared to n0 also increased the root surface area density significantly by 10 1 62 4 in the 0 10 cm layer under biodegradable film fig 7 the corresponding increase under polyethylene film was 14 6 71 2 at any given dose of n root surface area densities only in the 0 10 cm layer under biodegradable film were significantly lower by 4 8 28 3 than those under polyethylene film in both years the application of n significantly increased root weight in the 0 10 cm layer by 35 4 141 1 under biodegradable film and by 19 7 107 0 under polyethylene film compared with n0 fig 8 at a given dose of n root weight in the 0 10 cm layer was 6 2 35 1 significantly lower under biodegradable film compared to that under polyethylene film except that at n2 and n3 which root weight was 9 3 and 12 5 significantly greater at growth stage v12 of 2019 under biodegradable film respectively however the differences between the two films ceased to be significant in the deeper layers 10 40 cm in both years as to the rbs the application of n increased the rbs under biodegradable film but decreased it under polyethylene film in both years table 3 in addition rbs at any given dose of n under biodegradable film was 27 9 183 5 significantly higher than that under polyethylene film in both years whereas when no n was given the rbs under biodegradable film was 15 on average significantly lower than that under polyethylene film in 2019 application of n under both types of the film increased the root shoot ratio table 3 the ratios at low n application n n1 were 9 1 21 0 lower under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film in 2018 however in 2019 the root shoot ratio under polyethylene film was 5 4 significantly higher at n2 during growth stage v12 and was 11 1 significantly higher at n0 during growth stage r3 than that under biodegradable film plant growth utilization of water and nitrogen and grain yield during the stages of v12 and r3 only n fertilization significantly increased shoot dry matter and increased by 15 6 64 89 under biodegradable film and 11 2 46 49 under polyethylene film fig 9 compared with n0 both n fertilization and film mulching significantly affected et wue nue and yield except for film mulching table 4 in both years n fertilization significantly increased et wue nue except for n3 and yield by 6 6 13 2 23 6 41 2 3 9 11 3 and 32 9 54 8 biodegradable film 6 5 15 3 23 1 44 6 3 8 10 6 and 32 9 63 3 polyethylene film respectively compared with n0 compared with polyethylene film the et was 20 8 24 4 significantly higher but wue was 16 6 17 7 significantly lower under biodegradable film however nue was only 3 9 on average significantly higher under biodegradable film than in polyethylene film path analysis and optimizing n fertilization rate the path analysis for root parameters of biodegradable film showed that root length density root surface area density root weight rbs and root shoot ratio were all main directly enhanced by soil mineral n direct path coefficient 0 7 0 5 0 5 1 0 and 0 8 respectively whereas root length density and root weight main directly limited by soil water content 0 4 and 1 0 respectively and temperature 0 4 and 0 6 respectively table 5 furthermore root length density was also indirectly affected by soil water content soc and soil temperature through soil mineral n indirect path coefficient 0 5 0 4 and 0 7 respectively root surface area density was indirectly affected by soil temperature through soil mineral n 0 5 root weight was indirectly affected by soc through soil temperature 0 4 by soil mineral n through soil water content and temperature 0 6 and by soil temperature through soil water content 0 6 rbs was indirectly affected by soil water content soc and st through soil mineral n 0 7 0 5 and 0 9 respectively root shoot ratio was indirectly affected by soil water content soc and st through soil mineral n 0 6 0 4 and 0 7 respectively however according to the total correlation coefficient and the decision coefficient root length density was main enhanced by soil mineral n decision coefficient 71 0 and limited by soil water content 43 7 root surface area density was main enhanced by soil water content 56 2 and soil mineral n 50 3 root weight was main limited by soil water content 219 2 both rbs and root shoot ratio were enhanced by soil mineral n 98 4 84 0 respectively the path analysis for root parameters of polyethylene film showed that root length density was main directly enhanced by soil water content direct path coefficient 0 6 and soil mineral n 0 9 root surface area density was main directly enhanced by soil water content 0 9 root weight was main directly enhanced by soc 1 1 both rbs and root shoot ratio were main directly enhanced by soil water content 1 0 and 0 8 respectively table 6 furthermore root length density was also indirectly affected by soil mineral n through soil water content indirect path coefficient 0 4 and soc 0 6 both root surface area density and root shoot ratio were indirectly affected by soil mineral n and soil temperature both through soil water content both were 0 5 and 0 7 respectively root weight was indirectly affected by soil mineral n through soc 0 7 rbs was indirectly affected by soil mineral n and soil temperature both through soil water content 0 6 and 0 8 respectively according to the total correlation coefficient and the decision coefficient both root length density and root weight were main enhanced by soc decision coefficient 67 2 and 81 0 respectively whereas root surface area density rbs and root shoot ratio were all main enhanced by soil water content 84 0 98 7 and 76 0 respectively the correlations among root parameters dry matter wue nue and yield of the biodegradable film showed that both dry matter and wue were significantly correlated to root length density root weight and rbs the yield was significantly correlated to root length density root weight dry matter and wue table 7 the correlations of polyethylene film showed that dry matter was significantly correlated to root length density root weight the wue was significantly correlated to root length density root surface area density root shoot ratio and dry matter the yield was also significantly correlated to root length density root weight dry matter and wue therefore improving root length density and root weight under the two films was conducive to increasing dry matter accumulation wue and yield the relationships between n fertilization rate and wue nue and yield indicated that wue nue and yield all firstly increased and then decreased with n rate rose but nue decreased sharply when n rate reached n3 fig 10 therefore an optimum n rate could be found by calculating the intersection of the fitting curves of nue and wue or yield the optimum n fertilization rate for biodegradable film and polyethylene film was 173 2 kg ha 1 and 182 1 kg ha 1 respectively discussion the effect of film mulching and n application on properties of rhizosphere soil mulching soil with film reduced latent heat flux and the exchange of sensible heat between soil and air warming the topsoil gan et al 2013 in the present study soil temperatures in all treatments were significantly higher at growth stage v12 than at growth stage r3 a result supported by the findings of fang et al 2021a the main reason is that in its early stages of development the maize plant is small allowing most of the soil surface covered by the film to receive solar energy gan et al 2013 n fertilization under two films both decreased soil temperature due to greater canopy had a shading effect kader et al 2020 however the effect of film mulching under different doses of n on soil temperature has seldom been documented in the present study soil temperatures at n0 and n1 were higher under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film in both years except at n0 in 2018 whereas soil temperatures at n2 and n3 under biodegradable film were significantly lower than those under polyethylene film this may be because that smaller canopy of biodegradable film at low n rates n0 n1 resulted in more solar energy received by soil and accelerated disintegration of biodegradable film but at higher n rates the difference was caused by the lower soil moisture table 2 and better warming effect of polyethylene film sun et al 2018 in the present study soil water content decreased as the dose of n increased this is because the application of n not only enhanced crop growth thereby enabling the canopy to intercept more rainfall zheng et al 2018 and solar radiation kergoat et al 2008 but also increased water consumption wang et al 2016 the soil water content was slightly lower under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film supported by gu et al 2020 this may be because that the biodegradable film disintegrated over time and weakened the water retention performance ammala et al 2011 soil organic carbon is a major indicator of soil fertility mulching with film in combination with n application is beneficial to maintaining soc content jin et al 2020 in the present study soc contents under both types of film stabilized within a short time and kept higher at high doses of n n2 and n3 than at lower doses this finding matches that reported by gong et al 2009 furthermore at growth stage r3 soc contents at n2 and n3 under biodegradable film were significantly lower than those under polyethylene film in 2018 but the pattern in 2019 was the exact opposite this may be because at n2 and n3 although higher soil temperature under polyethylene film fig 5 accelerated the decomposition of soc zhou et al 2012b increased biomass under polyethylene film fig 9 offset the loss of soc zhang et al 2017 soil inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n is an important indicator of n cycling activity and soil fertility nitrogen from urea is more available as no3 n through nitrification kaneko et al 2021 and nitrification is influenced by soil temperature soil water and soil microenvironmental conditions li et al 2009 gan et al 2013 in the present study application of n increased soil inorganic n content significantly irrespective of the type of film a finding consistent with that of kaneko et al 2021 in general the biodegradable film recorded significantly higher soil nh4 n contents and significantly lower soil no3 n contents compared to polyethylene film in both years except at n0 probably because the disintegrated biodegradable film resulted in lower soil water content table 2 and lower soil temperature at n2 and n3 fig 5 which affecting nh4 n transferred to no3 n by nitrification disintegrated biodegradable film also causing the downward movement of no3 n with water kaneko et al 2021 therefore the amount of soil inorganic n was higher under polyethylene film than under biodegradable film especially at growth stage r3 the effect of film mulching and n application on root growth studies have shown that root morphology is modified to suit soil moisture temperature and nutrient status clarkson et al 2000 for example if soil conditions were good roots would be concentrated in topsoil while roots would grow deep into the soil if soil conditions were not good in the present study the application of n significantly increased root length density root surface area density and root weight in the top layer especially in the 0 10 cm layer this is because n application combined with ridge furrow with film mulching not only supplied nitrogen nutrients but also provided appropriate soil conditions in the topsoil such as soil moisture and soil temperature gao et al 2014 thidar et al 2020 the effect of biodegradable film on maize root growth has rarely been documented in this study root length density root surface area density and root weight in 0 10 cm soil layer were significantly lower under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film this is because biodegradable film disintegrated with time causing easy changes in soil properties such as soil moisture soil temperature especially nitrogen nutrients leaching path analysis also showed that soil properties had a different effect on root parameters of biodegradable film and polyethylene film tables 5 and 6 furthermore both root length density and root surface area density in the 0 10 cm layer of soil was higher at growth stage r3 than at growth stage v12 in 2018 this result was reversed in 2019 because in 2019 rainfall events were more frequent during growth stage v12 and air temperature at growth stage r3 was lower fig 1 leading to poor soil aeration and as a result limiting root growth li et al 2020 root bleeding sap is another parameter greatly influenced by water and nutrient uptake making rbs a reliable indicator of physiological activity in the root system noguchi et al 2005 in the present experiment we took care to calculate the amount of root bleeding sap per unit area to eliminate the effect of stem diameter unlike in the earlier studies guan et al 2014 jia et al 2018b we found that as the dose of n increased the rbs increased under biodegradable film but decreased under polyethylene film and was also higher under biodegradable film than under polyethylene film in both years although the higher levels of soil inorganic n and higher soil temperatures under polyethylene film promoted root activity wang et al 2019a n application under polyethylene film also increased stem diameter therefore this was a consequence of the vigorous growth thereby lowering the amount of root bleeding sap per unit area especially under higher doses of n n2 and n3 the root shoot ratio shows the distribution of total biomass between above ground and underground plant parts as soil temperature and the quantities of available water and n increase the root shoot ratio usually increases amos and walters 2006 in the present research under both types of film the root shoot ratio increased with n application and reached a peak at n2 compared with n0 this may be because that the main factor that affected the root shoot ratio for biodegradable film was soil mineral n table 5 but for polyethylene film was soil water content table 6 although other biotic and abiotic factors related to the plant and soil can also affect the ratio mokany et al 2006 the root shoot ratio was greater under polyethylene film than under biodegradable film but both reached a peak at n2 showing that mulching with polyethylene film was more conducive to crop growth and n2 was the best under the two films the effect of film mulching and n application on dry matter utilization of water and nitrogen and grain yield in this study n fertilization significantly increased shoot dry matter in line with quan et al 2020 n fertilization also significantly increased et wue nue except for n3 and yield consistent with the results of gan et al 2013 compared with polyethylene film the et was significantly higher but wue was significantly lower under biodegradable film this is because wue was the ratio of yield to et and the et was higher under biodegradable film due to higher soil evaporation caused by the disintegration of the biodegradable film fang et al 2021b furthermore there was no significant difference in shoot dry matter and yield between the two films yin et al 2017 fang et al 2021b but nue was significantly higher under biodegradable film compared to polyethylene film this may be because polyethylene film improved the nitrogen absorption of plants during the late growth period chen et al 2020 the relationships between root and soil properties utilization of water and nitrogen and grain yield previous studies reported that root weight was significantly enhanced by n input urea bai et al 2021 while root weight and rbs is significantly related to soil moisture jia et al 2018b however how soil properties affect the roots of biodegradable film and polyethylene film has been rarely reported in the current study path analysis showed soil properties had different effects on root parameters of biodegradable film and polyethylene film for biodegradable film root length density was main enhanced by soil mineral n and limited by soil water content root surface area density was main enhanced by soil water content and soil mineral n root weight was main limited by soil water content both rbs and root shoot ratio were enhanced by soil mineral n for polyethylene film root length density and root weight were main enhanced by soc whereas root surface area density rbs and root shoot ratio were all main enhanced by soil water content this is because properties of topsoil were improved under ridge furrow with film mulching wang et al 2019b resulting in shallow root distribution and more fine roots increasing root surface area density li et al 2009 however with the disintegration of biodegradable film soil properties especially soil water content and temperature changed significantly which changed the availability of soil nitrogen nutrient yin et al 2019 soil water under polyethylene film moved to the topsoil because of high temperature wang et al 2019b resulting in a strong correlation between soil water content and root surface area density rbs and root shoot ratio in this study the correlations among root parameters dry matter wue nue and yield of two films showed that improving root length density and root weight under the two films were conducive to increasing dry matter accumulation wue and yield the results were supported by previous studies gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 previous studies also explored the optimal n fertilization rate in northwestern china for instance yin et al 2015 reported that the optimal n fertilization rate for flat planting was 160 174 kg ha 1 according to n nutrition index and n accumulation deficit index but zhang et al 2021 found that the optimal n fertilization rate for ridge furrow with film mulching was 200 300 kg ha 1 according to higher grain yield and reducing the n2o emissions this study optimized the n fertilization rate according to the relationship between n application rate and wue nue and yield and the optimum n rate was 173 2 kg ha 1 for biodegradable film and 182 1 kg ha 1 polyethylene film therefore biodegradable film could reduce n application but not significantly decrease nue and yield conclusions n application under biodegradable film and polyethylene film made roots mainly distributed in topsoil 0 20 cm layer also significantly increased root shoot ratio rbs except for polyethylene film shoot dry matter et wue nue except for n3 and yield although root length densities root surface area densities root weight in the 0 10 cm layer and wue were significantly lower under biodegradable film rbs except for n0 et and nue were significantly higher compared with polyethylene film this study also found the optimum n rate was 173 2 kg ha 1 for biodegradable film and 182 1 kg ha 1 polyethylene film which could increase nue therefore ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulching combined with 173 2 kg n ha 1 could replace polyethylene film in terms of high yield efficient utilization of nitrogen and reducing

9674,the natural characteristics are a valuable asset for the production of wine grapes but the availability of quality water and the composition of the soil are decisive in semi arid areas the province of mendoza is a prestigious region for the production of wine that is going through a period of water scarcity which implies a greater use of groundwater that could compromise the availability of resources and trigger salinity levels this paper evaluates the environmental performance of winegrowers in the face of a productive threat such as the saline content in irrigation water we estimate environmental efficiency based on a directional output distance function using the salinity hazard of irrigation as an undesirable output the average environmental performance is 0 88 and it can be reduced by participating in producer groups receiving technical assistance increasing the density of the vineyard and receiving an energy subsidy for irrigation in addition the shadow price of the salinity hazard reveals that higher salinity content in irrigation water and soil characteristics cause excessive irrigation at the expense of environmental and economic performance furthermore the pre existing market price relationship water balance and district characteristics can deflate shadow prices but only vineyards with joint water sources can benefit from this keywords environmental efficiency directional distance functions salinity hazard shadow price wine grape production 1 introduction irrespective of the intention any production process will have an effect on the environment in the agricultural sector this bond is direct due to the interaction with natural resources where the agro ecosystems could suffer the collateral effects of agricultural activities the region on the right bank of the mendoza river is a prestigious enological area where vineyards have uneven access to water depending on their location and infrastructure the quality of surface and groundwater sources is influenced by the stakeholders and their exploitation practices increased pumping of groundwater is expected during periods of scarcity which may lead to diffuse pollution caused by the overdraft pressure on the carrizal aquifer in the past serious pollution threats unfolded from local and diffuse sources which significantly affected agricultural activity foster and garduño 2005 lohn et al 2000 under the current water scarcity conditions the demand for groundwater is likely to increase ceteris paribus confined aquifers could experience significant pumping pressures which may affect their hydrogeological characteristics and the quality of irrigation water through salinization álvarez and fasciolo 2011 in the research area soils are relatively saline which would require additional irrigation to induce salt percolation and subsequently increase the saline content of soil and the aquifer to date parametric techniques have not been sufficiently used to investigate this situation and shed light on these critical issues azad et al 2015 bravo ureta et al 2015 this paper analyzes the environmental efficiency of grapevine producers in mendoza accounting for the grapevine production and the salinity hazard of irrigation water where the former represents the desired output and the latter acts as the undesired output the use of the directional output distance functions dodf in an efficiency model enables efficiency estimation that accounts for desirable and undesirable outputs given the production technology of each producer azad and ancev 2014 the selected framework is a suitable approach to evaluate the detrimental effects of diffuse pollution while improving the production performance under water scarcity given the quasi fixed access to land and water in particular the research questions to be addressed are i what is the performance of vineyards in the underlying trade off function between grapevine production and the saline content of irrigation water ii what is the estimation of the shadow price for undesirable output the paper proceeds by describing the theoretical approach and the data employed followed by the econometric analysis and a discussion of the environmental implications finally it concludes with recommendations and policy implications for grapevine producers in this region of mendoza 2 literature review the literature on efficiency and environmental adjustment is a promising line of research in productivity analysis since 1990s the analysis of the relationship between economic and environmental performance has grew substantially and currently modeling technology and the measurement of inefficiency in the presence of undesired outputs is not a trivial issue ancev et al 2017b parmeter 2014 initial efforts to model good output and bad output were carried out by using inputs good and bad outputs as arguments in a by production function this approach embedded the bad output as an input in the production function and imposed the regularity conditions to separate the good from the bad hailu and veeman 2001 reinhard et al 1999 generally inputs are freely combined by agents and the model indirectly assumes output disposability which led to the main criticism of this approach subsequently the measurement of inefficiency envisaged two methodological issues namely how to jointly model technical and environmental efficiency and whether their effects can be separated on the one hand the consideration of different technologies are considered for the two outputs acknowledging the bad output as a production process itself fernández et al 2002 along these lines the estimation of technical and environmental efficiency is carried out under the separability assumptions which implies two different technologies a regular production function and an environmental production function on the other hand a joint production process that emphasizes the relationship between simultaneously producing the good and bad output but assuming the inherence of the externality to the existing technology the assessment of a by production process under one functional form that accounts for strong disposability can be performed with the ddf approach färe et al 2005 which also assumes the null jointness to treat both outputs as by products suitability and techniques are relevant in integrating technical efficiency and environmental performance measures färe et al 2007 acknowledge the shortcomings of the environmental production function this approach overcame the limitation of the environmental production function that only credits the producer for expanding good output production as the directional environmental distance function would also acknowledge the reduction of the bad output several approaches have been developed with the objective of measuring environmentally adjusted productivity and efficiency this integration depends on the suitability of employed techniques suitability can be focused on the analysis of deterministic or stochastic processes the former can be estimated using parametric and non parametric techniques while the latter employs exclusively parametric estimation the evidence shows a greater share of applications of the non parametric techniques such as data envelopment analysis dea rather than parametric techniques as stochastic frontier analysis sfa ancev et al 2017a in general the non parametric techniques estimate maximal output and attribute all differences from this as inefficiency while the parametric techniques acknowledge stochastic noise allowing output variation due to shocks measurement errors and inefficiency also as the directional vector determines the trajectory to the frontier in non parametric techniques this may affect the peer observations färe et al 2014 parametric techniques acknowledge a functional form for the production process that entails results for interpretation directional distance functions ddf measure the breach in a given orientation from a specific point towards the boundary within a set of production possibilities including desired outputs and environmental externalities or undesired outputs in a by production process the method was introduced by chung et al 1997 and färe and grosskopf 2000 as a variation of the luenberger shortage function given a quantity of inputs in a production environment färe and primont 1995 shephard 1970 and it overcame the limitation of parametric approaches to study multi output technologies while environmental threats have continuously stimulated the focus on natural resources and competition for water growth across economic sectors the complex characteristics of the resource undermines the planning potential for storage distribution and quantification in economic activities the average demand of 70 of water for agricultural use can increase up to 90 in semi arid areas while technology progress aimed for more effective application to relieve water pressure in agricultural systems the consumption continued to growth compromising the resource quality and availability grafton et al 2018 although empirical applications in the agricultural sector following ddf have increased over time huang et al 2016 njuki and bravo ureta 2015 njuki et al 2016 evidence is still scarce on the application of parametric techniques the hyperbolic distance functions cuesta and zofío 2005 have also been employed for eco efficiency analysis in agriculture rosano peña et al 2018 estimated a 32 of eco inefficiency in degraded lands by agricultural practices in brazil song et al 2018 found a reversed u shape between economic development and water resource efficiency in china following a ddf approach their analysis acknowledged that regions with higher agricultural participation report lower water resource efficiency considering the increasing interest for optimal water resource management in the agricultural sector the evidence is scant on including water resources measurement and estimation of their effects azad and ancev 2014 by employing parametric techniques that jointly model agricultural goods and environmental externalities devoting little attention to these critical issues azad et al 2015 bravo ureta et al 2015 3 methods and materials 3 1 theoretical model the modeling of a production technology that accommodates the production of undesirable outputs requires a representing of the functional relationship between inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs where the latter are not strongly disposable a suitable candidate is the ddf where an individual production unit i that employs a k dimensional vector of inputs x x 1 x 2 x k ℜ k to produce an m dimensional vector of desirable outputs y y 1 y 2 y m ℜ m while also producing an n dimensional vector of undesirable outputs b b 1 b 2 b n ℜ n the ddf is defined as follows for each individual observation k 1 d 0 x k y k b k g y g b max β β y k β g y b k β g b p x k in this specification β is the maximum feasible expansion of good outputs along the g y vector and the contraction of bad outputs along the g b vector so that the resulting vector y g y b g b remains in the feasible production set p x k chung et al 1997 färe et al 2005 the ddf also satisfies the translation property which states that with the addition of a non negative θ to the directional vector the desired output will expand by θg y and the undesired output will contract by θg b intuitively this means that if the directional vector is e g doubled in size ceteris paribus the resulting value of the distance function will be halved the translation property allows the econometric estimation of the ddf with a suitable choice of θ färe et al 2008 and is similar to the homogeneity property by shephard 1970 2 θ d 0 x y θ g y b θ g b g y g b u i ν i as the ddf is differentiable it is possible to estimate the shadow price for the bad output a desired calculation to value outputs where market prices are non existent traditional productivity models can employ quantity and price information for the estimation whereas direction function based models only require quantity information unlike other production inputs environmental externalities are not tradable and there is a lack of market prices therefore the estimation of shadow price is key to exposing the existing link between the standard productivity of the distance function framework for correct economic interpretation the shadow price of the bad output is calculated at the frontier which means that the value of the distance function with respect to the good output equals to zero fare et al 1993 3 p b p y d 0 x y b g y g b b d 0 x y b g y g b y at least one output price must be known and equal to its shadow price the shadow price describes the good output production that must be foregone in order to reduce the bad output by one unit for all of the production units along the efficiency frontier färe et al 2005 here only production units with the monotonicity conditions are considered 3 2 empirical specification estimation of environmental efficiency ee is based on a dodf the preference for this framework relies on the multiple output nature of grapevine production with the presence of an undesirable output i e the pressure on water quality we chose an output orientation because the inputs employed in the production process are quasi fixed in the short run due to either high adjustment costs or legal restrictions in order to account for sampling and measurement errors using sfa seems preferable in our context whereby a parametric specification of the frontier is required the quadratic functional form allows for full flexible specification that does not impose any a priori restrictions on the substitution possibilities between inputs additionally this functional form is relatively more stable in concave functional form technologies as it is assumed in this paper and holds the flexible characteristics of the technology färe and vardanyan 2016 4 d 0 x i y i b i g α 0 k 1 k α k x i k m 1 m β

expansion of the good output alternative directional combinations were tested with no stronger significance and the most common choice 1 1 also does not compromise the estimation of shadow price and efficiency so remained as the preferred in addition this choice allows for a re parameterization of the quadratic functional form to impose the translation property so that the left hand side of the reparametrized quadratic function exhibits variability the translation property d o x y g y b g b g d o x y b g θ must be fulfilled by any theoretically consistent ddf for any θ although the choice of θ is arbitrary selecting θ y i with the directional vector 1 1 is a particular suitable choice färe et al 2005 5 d 0 x i y i b i 1 1 y i d 0 x i y i y i b y i 1 1 d 0 t x i b y i 1 1 y i d 0 t x i b y

the error terms by means of an exponential function of the covariates z to ensure that the estimated variance parameters are non negative in addition this specification implements the scaling property alvarez et al 2006 wang and schmidt 2002 so that the shape of the inefficiency distribution is the same across all firms whereby the exponential function scales this basic distribution according to the estimated parameters the point estimates for the ee scores are obtained as the conditional mean of u i given the observed residuals kumbhakar and knox lovell 2000 since the effects of the

selected at the district level based on the official records of the national viticulture institution data was collected between november 2016 and february 2017 in four districts of luján de cuyo mendoza as shown in fig 1 following a structured questionnaire farmers provided quantitative information on their grapevine production systems water management practices market orientation and technology assessment there are several reasons for heterogeneous crop management within the vineyard whereby agronomic and enological characteristics market requirements and different sources of water are among the most common driving forces water application at the plot level was estimated following reported values of irrigation with surface and groundwater sources details of surface water volumes were provided by the watershed inspection and estimated for groundwater users based on consumed energy depth of the aquifer and pumping equipment characteristics regarding water quality farmers voluntarily provided a sample of irrigation water for the analysis 1 1 a sensor hi98129 was employed to obtain temperature adjusted values of ec total dissolved solids tds and acidic levels ph the description of the data in table 1 shows values per hectare to facilitate comparison with other wine regions and interpretation by interested parties however the empirical analysis is carried out with the information scaled in the decision making unit of the farmers which is the grape plot for winemaking on average each vineyard has 7 7 plots and produces 10 2 tons of grapes per hectare main white varieties are chardonnay sauvignon blanc and pedro giménez their average yield is 14 485 ton ha while red varieties are predominantly malbec 55 the average mean of red varieties is 9 837 ton ha average yield per color are significantly different p value 0 most of the surveyed plots irrigate with a dual source of water 68 while a considerable share rely solely on groundwater 30 and only a small proportion irrigate with surface water only 2 as for irrigation systems at the plot level furrow is the most common in the region 68 followed by drip irrigation 28 and flooding 4 in light of the recent pollution threats water quality for irrigation is certainly important for this area the mean acidity values in the sample were 6 9 ph and average electro conductivity ec values 966 9 were acceptable according to international standards and reference values for the region fao and iwmi 2018 with a considerable standard deviation 524 2 4 1 variables selection the capital variable represents the annual economic value of services provided by production infrastructure including land ball et al 2004 given the sample heterogeneity in infrastructure and operational machinery with respect to size economic prices and depreciation this approach contributes to the value interpretation of capital services of existing production infrastructure since water rights are not tradable and they are inherent to the piece of land main reason why land prices are strongly associated with water rights regarding the other input variables the total number of working hours was considered at the plot level seasonal workers are commonly employed for management practices mainly for harvesting and pruning given the high dependence on agricultural income the greater share of permanent labor over seasonal labor was expected while intensive management of wine grape production systems is generalized there is no general consensus for a detailed records of crop management expenditures but farmers do consider the average expenditure per vineyard hectare as the technical analysis seeks to unveil the unobserved heterogeneity in wine grape management detailed information on agrochemical usage and instructions was collected at the plot level also controlling for input prices in the research area exposed a common constant prices across the vineyards while some quality differences were not captured with the exception of explicit organic or low input management practices then considering that farms buy in large similar combinations of agrochemicals the monetary expenditures captures the input quantity and total expenses in agrochemicals at the plot level derived as the constructed variable for crop management all prices were adjusted at the us dollar value at the time the data was collected all variables were normalized by their means concerning the level variables white varieties and pergola trained grapevines are production alternatives that aim for relatively higher yields than red varieties or an espalier training system the depth of the water table measured in meters was also selected as a production shifter acknowledging the difficulties in pumping water with reliable quality for irrigation foster and garduño 2005 a categorical variable of soil characteristics was introduced in the production function in the research area the soil variable has three categories based on their main component superficial texture and drainage finally the level variable of ec was included in the analysis which represents the measured value in micro siemens per centimeter µs cm reported from the water quality analysis 4 2 undesirable output the research area has been subject to salinity threats for the past two decades which has led to farmers pumping water from deeper sources increasing the risk of further damage to the aquifer by saline intrusion foster and garduño 2005 wine grapes yield and quality are sensitive to the saline content of irrigation water zhang et al 2002 and depend on the grape variety soil characteristics and irrigation practices irrigation with saline water diminishes the osmotic potential of soil and excessive concentrations could cause salt accumulation in the wooden tissue and leaves of vines jackson 2008 excess irrigation could stimulate the rise of phreatic levels and further increase soil salinity provoking radicular suffocation and thus substantially affecting vine development and yields substantially the term of salinity hazard is commonly employed in viticulture to acknowledge the grapevine yield sensibility threshold with respect to the kilograms of saline content in the water applied for irrigation 8 sh kg plot 640 ψ e c i b w a t e r m 3 p l o t the salinityhazard sh was estimated according to the standard calculation of salt concentrations in irrigation water and adapted according to the grapevine sensitivity in the research area miyamoto et al 2010 where ψ is a scale volume conversion from micro siemens per centimeter to kilograms per cubic meter 10 6 and the standard conversion value is 640 for the calculation evidence has shown that the relationship between grapevine yields and salinity content is not linear and can be adjusted to the salt concentration levels by varying the values of b according to certain thresholds that acknowledge the crop sensitivity to increments of ec values ayers and westcot 1994 maas 1990 romero et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 the threshold for ec values for grapevines is 1000 micro siemens per centimeter µs cm in this region de lorenzi et al 2009 4 3 noise and inefficiency determinants external variables were selected based on their potential contribution to better explain the production decisions along with plot characteristics that could have some influence on the undesirable output to some degree these variables rely on management decision and enological production objectives the membership variable controls whether the wine grape producers belongs to any farmer association whereas technical assistance received through extension programs or paid consultants is captured by the extensionist dummy vine density is the number of plants per plot and energy subsidy is a dummy variable acknowledging that the producer pays a lower rate for pumping water on account of technological improvements and facing the difficulty in employing qualified labor in the area some vineyards are adopting technology to substitute labor for some tasks whereby the technical dummy acknowledges these improvements the water balance variable is the difference between the water supplied by the farmer and the resource demanded by the vine in cubic meters within the production year for the water supply the volume estimations considered the reported irrigation practices by the farmer adapted to their irrigation system water source and pumping equipment 9 w a t e r b a l a n c e i w a t e r s u p p l y i w a t e r d e m a n d i i r r i g

and ss i represents the stone share in the soil 50 100 crescimanno and marcum 2013 hernández et al 2012 maas 1990 the estimation of water demanded by the vines considered density training system evapotranspiration et 0 plant transpiration k c soil percolation requirements and the use of hail protection nets for grapevines the calculated variable is a reliable approximation of the water usage and consumption relationship based on the available information 5 results and discussion following a viable treatment for the environmental externality higher efficiency levels are embraced in the direction of augmenting the desirable output grapevines while reducing the undesirable output saline hazard estimations were performed at the plot level scale in the modeling this requirement is expressed by specifying the output vector g 1 1 parameter estimates of the dodf are shown in table 2 followed by input output elasticities in table 3 and the environmental efficiency determinants in table 4 further discussion is provided after estimating the shadow price of salinity hazard 5 1 estimates of the dodf model specification and coefficients have the expected sign and an existing negative trade off relationship between grapevine production and the salinity hazard of irrigation water is confirmed hence monotonicity holds at the sample mean for all inputs except for labor where the point estimate is very small and not significantly different from zero within the sample of vineyards the ee estimation does not imply the redirection of management practices towards a more sustainable path but the relative measure of environmental burden in relation with the economic activity at the sample mean for the undesirable output bstar sal haz θ i g b both coefficients were significant the coefficient of the bstar 2 0 076 confirms a concave function that allows for the trade off interpretation with respect to the desirable output due to the translation property namely the acknowledgment that saline hazard is inherent to grapevine production in this context the first order coefficient for labor has a positive sign 0 03 which affirms that increasing the labor hours at the plot level will reduce production although the value of the second order estimate for labor 0 01 is insignificant the interpretation assumes that adding more labor hours at the plot level would improve the productivity as mentioned earlier this interpretation is feasible considering the quality focus in wine grape production in the region but also incomplete without considering the estimation of the elasticities four of the additional shifter variables were statistically significantly different from zero the binary variables for soil drainage have a rather small estimate 0 2 and 0 03 whereas the electro conductivity ec estimator indicates lower distances to the frontier upon increments in the saline content of water although surprising this result is still interpretable because the quality indicator is the value considered for the saline hazard estimation while the mean ec values are within an acceptable range for viticulture higher saline content in water for irrigation might affect the performance in order to better understand the effects of productive inputs with respect to the output in the dodf framework the elasticities were calculated the distance elasticities of the dodf measure the relative change in the output distance measure with respect to the input quantities increments of inputs with negative signs will shorten the frontier distance improving the vineyard performance conversely those inputs with positive signs would expand the frontier distance upon increasing their usage distance elasticities are listed in table 3 and they were estimated considering the performance at the frontier and assuming linear homogeneity as d o x y 1 with the exception of labor all inputs provided the expected elasticity sign at the frontier the strongest effect is attributed to the water input representing a 0 379 decrease in the distance towards the frontier with a 1 increase in water applied increasing production capital and agrochemicals by 1 would reduce the distance to the frontier by 0 03 and 0 015 respectively as explained above vineyards follow an intensive management throughout the production year and monetary expenditures in agricultural management is an alternative for evaluating input quantities when their prices are similar in the research area furthermore the elasticity of money expenditure in agrochemicals implies that farmers may be close to the optimum usage of agrochemicals the interpretation of these values should be considered with caution since several pest threats and climate contingencies have affected the vineyard performance in the last decade in particular botrytis cinerea grapevine moth and oidium the results show that grapevine production has a decreasing returns to scale in this area at the sample mean this finding is in line with the empirical evidence of wine grape production systems as increasing production inputs by two folds would increase output but at a lower rate a positive sign of the output distance function elasticity of the bstar 0 561 means that increments in the undesired output will expand the distance to the frontier and vineyards will be less productive although relevant for grapevine management as many management practices are labor intensive and crucial for vine quality development the labor factor was not significant in the estimated functional form given the scarcity of qualified labor in the region van den bosch 2008 some vineyards are exploring the mechanization of certain tasks to substitute labor while other farmers are labor intensive and may retain qualified human resources if their enological quality focus requires a greater share of hand crafts activities therefore the relationship between labor and output may belong to the second stage of production where marginal returns start to decrease 5 2 efficiency determinants in addition to the efficiency measure the dodf gives the maximum unit expansion of the desired output and the unit contraction of the undesired output färe et al 2005 efficiency scores are reported in the direction of the output vector g 1 1 which implies that the measure of efficiency reflects the vineyards capacity to improve grapevine production while reducing the salinity hazard given the normalization and directional vector the results report a mean estimate ee of 0 877 corresponding to a mean inefficiency of 0 123 the interpretation is that production per hectare could potentially increase by 1 25 tons 10 16 0 123 and considering the average market price of usd 1 04 per kilogram in 2017 ova 2018 potential gains could be usd 1299 5 per hectare at the same time there is potential to reduce their saline hazard by 0 823 kg 6 71 0 12 at the sample mean fig 3 ilustrates the estimated trade off between desirable and undesirable outputs most of the exogenous variables are significant with the exception of machine technology in the inefficiency model the economic connotation of the coefficients is initially determined by the direction of the effect e g negative positive signs reduce increase inefficiency the interpretation begins with managerial variables that model the irrigation at the plot level and continues with vine management decisions similar effects are shown by the variable created of water balance whereby the inefficiency coefficient indicates that oversupplying vines with water will reduce uncertainty 0 96 at the expense of ee 1 71 as the marginal effect of further increasing irrigation by 1 would increase inefficiency by 0 21 acknowledging that farmers may be applying water beyond their optimal level water 2 0 41 and recalling that an irrigation system is a function based on the technology moving towards a more effective irrigation system would improve efficiency if the producer focus is on increasing output participation in any type of producers association has a positive pay off in terms of ee as it increases performance by 2 41 but also the variability by 0 76 however if the interest is in higher quality which implies greater sugar content and tannins per berry then moving towards more effective irrigation systems would be associated their production objectives in any case over watering the vine if the crop demand has been fulfilled would not improve efficiency but diminish stochastical noise recalling that the energy subsidy is voluntary and originally designed for farms with less than 50 ha cropland winegrowers that account with this incentive will significantly improve efficiency in production 0 74 and reduce uncertainty 0 71 focusing on the crop management aspects the technical advice of extensionists can significantly improve efficiency as receiving technical assistance improves performance by 0 69 while vine density can contribute to efficiency gains 1 34 performance variability will also increase 0 57 on average the marginal effect of increasing vine density by 1 would improve efficiency by 0 17 some underlying performance factors that may drive vineyards efficiency are summarized in table 5 starting with market orientation the sample was separated into viticulturists n 309 and wine growers n 95 the former produces exclusively for selling to wineries under contract agreements or traditional market operations and their mean ee score is 0 873 the latter elaborates wine endowed with their own grape production which could translate into greater care and higher quality standards the significant difference between these sub groups can be observed by their performance within their production possibilities and location with respect to the frontier regarding the undesired output elasticity bstar the two sub groups alternatives confirmed significant differences for their mean values market orientation p value 0 09 and water source p value 0 006 it is possible to differentiate the sample according their water source into conjoint or groundwater most of the former are located in the northern part of the research area n 280 inside the irrigation network and they may rely on wells as a complementary water source as opposed to the groundwater users n 124 these subgroups have statistically different means on ee and elasticity with respect to the salinity hazard while conjoint water users have relatively lower mean efficiency and higher elasticity of the undesired output groundwater users perform better environmentally and are less sensitive to salinity hazard altogether groundwater dependent producers perform better than their counterparts possibly due to their optimization practices adapted to the already constrained access to water resources 5 3 shadow price of saline hazard since the dodf is a differentiable function that enables estimating of technical efficiency for multiple products it is possible to estimate the shadow price of environmental externalities that do not have a market to assign prices in this case the by production of grapevine for wine production and salinity hazard average market price information of registered transactions is available per grape variety and district from ova 2018 assuming that the market price for grapevine pi j equals its shadow price the 3 3 for the shadow price was updated the shadow price describes the production output that must be foregone to reduce the saline hazard by one unit until all of the inefficiency has been eliminated and wine grape is produced at the frontier of the production possibilities the estimated value is a proxy for the environmental benefit of removing salinity hazard at the plot level in other words the avoidance of the potential environmental damage that could be caused by inefficient producers hernández sancho et al 2017 the median price for 1 kg of saline content in water is usd 4 85 with a coefficient of variation 3 75 this value is slightly higher for groundwater irrigated plots than for those that rely on conjoint irrigation sources with usd 5 76 and usd 4 5 per kilogram of saline content respectively as resource endowment varies according to vineyard location further analysis at the district scale is considered to unfold the variation of median shadow prices which could reveal additional insights for designing sector specific policies or estimating potential abatement costs if the combination of inputs and management variables x z of a grapevine plot is located at the frontier of their production possibilities of the output set p x z it is possible to affirm that this plot has fully improved its environmental technical efficiency njuki et al 2016 for this reason only observations that do not violate the monotonicity conditions are considered n 272 therefore the price ratio could be interpreted as the slope of the trade off relationship estimated curve and it reveals their approximate location in the curve simultaneously expressing the relative cost of reducing saline hazard table 6 organizes the estimated values per district according their location and water delivery order the districts of perdriel and agrelo are the first recipients of surface water and there are no vineyard plots with a negative water balance wb so the median price equals the corresponding over irrigated plots wb going down the table groundwater dependency increases the number of over irrigated plots wb decreases and ee scores improves these results are also visible in fig 4 where the relationship between environmental performance and shadow prices is shown decomposing shadow price behavior at the district level implies linking the marginal productivity ratio of bad and good output as described in 3 3 with the drivers of farmers irrigation practices as soil characteristics over irrigated plots are predominantly located over saline soils and diminishing their water balance to zero implies greater heterogeneity in the outputs productivity ratio as depicted in fig 5 higher salinity in vineyards of perdriel and agrelo conditions irrigation practices to over irrigate plots at the expense of their ee whereas districts with relatively less saline hazard seem to better balance irrigation achieving higher environmental performance narrowing the water balance could increase salinity hazard and consequently shadow prices in particular in perdriel and agrelo districts a robust ols regression followed to further disentangle shadow price behavior and regional heterogeneous effects the regression in table 7 shows two factors with opposite signs the location and the water balance of the wine grape plot a positive relationship between shadow and market prices was expected due to the formula building if the vineyard is a recipient of surface water mainly perdriel and agrelo its shadow price is positively influenced but could be compensated by its water balance the constructed water balance variable provides evidence concerning how resource quality and availability shape the irrigation practices and could further inflate the shadow price in groundwater dependent vineyards effects on the shadow price will change going south from perdriel as it implies lowering the pressure from the district variable and salinity conditions but increasing the predominance of the water balance variable location effect prevails in perdriel and ugarteche but not in el carrizal perdriel is the first recipient of surface water and it is located in the northern part of the sample here the location positively influences the shadow price 74 while the water balance weakens this effect 24 considering agrelo as a base point if a wine maker irrigates their vineyard beyond their threshold shadow prices for salinity hazard would be 18 for perdriel 26 for el carrizal and 86 lower for ugarteche the information deployed shows that when decreasing salinity is costly for the wine grape plot vineyards are less irrigated in other words underlying salinity issues increase the shadow price if the vines receive less water this explains the irrigation behavior of farmers located in el carrizal whose grapes have the lowest average value in the market and their vineyards are located on water eroded soils with the greater share having a negative water balance fig 5 therefore increasing irrigation levels would elevate production costs in the present but would have a null effect on the shadow price water balance effects are compensated vineyards in perdriel district face opposite conditions they are settled over saline soils prone to greater salinity hazard and over irrigating their grapes is an expensive practice that they are able to afford as their grapes are the most valued in the research area wine grape plots in agrelo have a positive water balance as they count with a better developed irrigation system and have greater adoption of irrigation technology greater water balance lowers the median shadow price despite the fact that they hold the highest salinity hazard 9 38 altogether this may imply that vine plots functioning in this area could be further along the frontier than the rest of the plots whereas farmers from ugarteche face greater heterogeneity in natural conditions and water sources that lowers the shadow price even if the producers over irrigate their plots the relative share of vineyard plot with a positive water balance wb is smaller in ugarteche and el carrizal which makes it less likely that farmers will over irrigate vines and ultimately shadow prices would be less deflated by the water balance although grapevine plots located in el carrizal perform relatively better in terms of efficiency it would be relatively expensive to reduce their salinity hazard in irrigation water 6 conclusions we have estimated the ee of grapevine production in mendoza in order to analyze the trade offs between the salinity hazard the environmental undesirable output and the wine grape production as a desirable output while simultaneously assessing the extent to which producers can realize improvements in the environmental and the economic dimension the trade off analysis focused on a regionally disaggregated perspective on the shadow price of salinity hazards while analysis of the drivers of environmental efficiencies enabled shedding light on the pathways to utilizing the potential for efficiency improvements in methodological terms we employed a flexible functional form for the dodf so that the patterns of shadow prices and environmental performance were revealed by the observed data the data collection was concluded in january 2017 and comprised 421 grapevine plot surveys and water quality samples our main findings show a trade off relationship between grapevine production and salinity hazard the estimated shadow price for the undesirable output is usd 4 85 and it measures at the sample median the revenue foregone from reducing the saline content in irrigation water by one kilogram the estimated average ee of 0 88 indicates that some potential for improvements still exists in economic returns while reducing the environmental burden of grape production at the sample mean we find that farmers should be able to increase the revenue per ha by usd 1426 75 and simultaneously reduce the environmental burden in terms of saline hazard by 0 82 kg per ha turning to the variables used in the variance related part of the model we find that the water balance exerts a strong negative effect on the level of inefficiency while negatively correlating with production uncertainty the vine density variable also shows substantial effects albeit with an opposite sign this indicates that decisions on water are decisive for both production variability and ee farmers decisions on extensions and organizational membership are positively correlated with ee while only technical advice reduces the production uncertainty the functional form and location specific characteristics are decisive in the determinants of environmental performance and therefore relevant policy implications for this region can be derived first economic tools contribute to reducing the variability of production while leading vineyards to significant efficiency improvements second redirecting efforts towards technology adoption supported by professional technical advice would ultimately have stronger effects in reducing output variability while simultaneously optimizing irrigation practices and introducing mechanization while the hypothesis of greater vine quality at the expense of foregone output is valid these technical advice would ultimately have a stronger effect in diminishing uncertainty but improving output quality third groundwater dependent producers perform better than their counterparts possibly due to their optimization practices adapted to the already constrained resource similarly farmers that sell their output to wineries have better output performance than vineyards that produce their own wine both classifications have higher sensitivity to salinity hazard and lower elasticity to scale upon changes in the zoning restrictions these subgroups should be promoted accordingly the results show that economic tools can significantly improve environmental performance and reduce uncertainty in a water scarcity context farmers are prone to irrigate whenever possible ignoring the vine water threshold this represents an intervention point that an agricultural extensionists could address and where their input significantly translates into efficiency gains the exact reasons for the aforementioned behavior towards irrigation may be beyond this research but it is possible to point to some potential scenarios in a extreme case for example higher vine density under ineffective irrigation systems would imply a compensation of effects since wasted water could be watering the roots of neighboring vines our detailed analysis of the shadow price of salinity hazards reveals that all the factors with negative signs would indeed facilitate to reduce the salinity hazard at a lower opportunity costs technified irrigation systems positive water balance and non saline soils would lower the shadow price for salinity hazard perdriel and agrelo are the first surface water recipients and produce the most valued wine grapes in the region these preconditions their ability to modernize irrigation technology and ensure irrigation needs are fulfilled despite the operational costs and their vineyard s salinity hazard vineyards in ugarteche and el carrizal have fewer tools to effectively lower salinity but pre existing district characteristics can deflate shadow prices only a small share of plots achieved a positive water balance in this districts overall efficiency improvement can be a major motivation for establishing environmental practices in this sector and this research shows that low efficiency scores can be positively influenced there is evidence that vineyard associations and viticulturist cooperatives have increasing interest in the environmental performance of farmers targeted programs on technology adoption for agricultural irrigation through extensionists would improve the overall understanding of the causes and effects of diffuse pollution and could steer farmers away from over exploitation of natural resources in the direction of more sustainable practices the environmental efficiency assessment is not exempt from data limitations of the cross sectional context in this line several aspects of weather forecasts stakeholder behavior and their interactions with wine grape production remain limited additional information on labor availability agronomic treatment and the relation of grape variety with soil characteristics is desired shadow price estimations for non existing markets acknowledge the existing opportunity costs of current performance but shall find ways to optimize the environmental trade off in the long run future research would integrate more information and extend to a panel data that could construct meaningful dynamic models to analyze the environmental and economic performance to capture important

of capital services vineyards are usually productive for several decades thus the flow of services from a given vineyard is based on the area planted and on the capital embedded in the vines we calculate this flow of services via the perpetual inventory approach which is frequently employed in agricultural economics coelli and sanders 2013 as market prices do not always reflect the economic value of capital employed on the farm this methodology assesses the annual services provided by the stock which is priced according to their own characteristics ball et al 2004 taking into account the

9674,the natural characteristics are a valuable asset for the production of wine grapes but the availability of quality water and the composition of the soil are decisive in semi arid areas the province of mendoza is a prestigious region for the production of wine that is going through a period of water scarcity which implies a greater use of groundwater that could compromise the availability of resources and trigger salinity levels this paper evaluates the environmental performance of winegrowers in the face of a productive threat such as the saline content in irrigation water we estimate environmental efficiency based on a directional output distance function using the salinity hazard of irrigation as an undesirable output the average environmental performance is 0 88 and it can be reduced by participating in producer groups receiving technical assistance increasing the density of the vineyard and receiving an energy subsidy for irrigation in addition the shadow price of the salinity hazard reveals that higher salinity content in irrigation water and soil characteristics cause excessive irrigation at the expense of environmental and economic performance furthermore the pre existing market price relationship water balance and district characteristics can deflate shadow prices but only vineyards with joint water sources can benefit from this keywords environmental efficiency directional distance functions salinity hazard shadow price wine grape production 1 introduction irrespective of the intention any production process will have an effect on the environment in the agricultural sector this bond is direct due to the interaction with natural resources where the agro ecosystems could suffer the collateral effects of agricultural activities the region on the right bank of the mendoza river is a prestigious enological area where vineyards have uneven access to water depending on their location and infrastructure the quality of surface and groundwater sources is influenced by the stakeholders and their exploitation practices increased pumping of groundwater is expected during periods of scarcity which may lead to diffuse pollution caused by the overdraft pressure on the carrizal aquifer in the past serious pollution threats unfolded from local and diffuse sources which significantly affected agricultural activity foster and garduño 2005 lohn et al 2000 under the current water scarcity conditions the demand for groundwater is likely to increase ceteris paribus confined aquifers could experience significant pumping pressures which may affect their hydrogeological characteristics and the quality of irrigation water through salinization álvarez and fasciolo 2011 in the research area soils are relatively saline which would require additional irrigation to induce salt percolation and subsequently increase the saline content of soil and the aquifer to date parametric techniques have not been sufficiently used to investigate this situation and shed light on these critical issues azad et al 2015 bravo ureta et al 2015 this paper analyzes the environmental efficiency of grapevine producers in mendoza accounting for the grapevine production and the salinity hazard of irrigation water where the former represents the desired output and the latter acts as the undesired output the use of the directional output distance functions dodf in an efficiency model enables efficiency estimation that accounts for desirable and undesirable outputs given the production technology of each producer azad and ancev 2014 the selected framework is a suitable approach to evaluate the detrimental effects of diffuse pollution while improving the production performance under water scarcity given the quasi fixed access to land and water in particular the research questions to be addressed are i what is the performance of vineyards in the underlying trade off function between grapevine production and the saline content of irrigation water ii what is the estimation of the shadow price for undesirable output the paper proceeds by describing the theoretical approach and the data employed followed by the econometric analysis and a discussion of the environmental implications finally it concludes with recommendations and policy implications for grapevine producers in this region of mendoza 2 literature review the literature on efficiency and environmental adjustment is a promising line of research in productivity analysis since 1990s the analysis of the relationship between economic and environmental performance has grew substantially and currently modeling technology and the measurement of inefficiency in the presence of undesired outputs is not a trivial issue ancev et al 2017b parmeter 2014 initial efforts to model good output and bad output were carried out by using inputs good and bad outputs as arguments in a by production function this approach embedded the bad output as an input in the production function and imposed the regularity conditions to separate the good from the bad hailu and veeman 2001 reinhard et al 1999 generally inputs are freely combined by agents and the model indirectly assumes output disposability which led to the main criticism of this approach subsequently the measurement of inefficiency envisaged two methodological issues namely how to jointly model technical and environmental efficiency and whether their effects can be separated on the one hand the consideration of different technologies are considered for the two outputs acknowledging the bad output as a production process itself fernández et al 2002 along these lines the estimation of technical and environmental efficiency is carried out under the separability assumptions which implies two different technologies a regular production function and an environmental production function on the other hand a joint production process that emphasizes the relationship between simultaneously producing the good and bad output but assuming the inherence of the externality to the existing technology the assessment of a by production process under one functional form that accounts for strong disposability can be performed with the ddf approach färe et al 2005 which also assumes the null jointness to treat both outputs as by products suitability and techniques are relevant in integrating technical efficiency and environmental performance measures färe et al 2007 acknowledge the shortcomings of the environmental production function this approach overcame the limitation of the environmental production function that only credits the producer for expanding good output production as the directional environmental distance function would also acknowledge the reduction of the bad output several approaches have been developed with the objective of measuring environmentally adjusted productivity and efficiency this integration depends on the suitability of employed techniques suitability can be focused on the analysis of deterministic or stochastic processes the former can be estimated using parametric and non parametric techniques while the latter employs exclusively parametric estimation the evidence shows a greater share of applications of the non parametric techniques such as data envelopment analysis dea rather than parametric techniques as stochastic frontier analysis sfa ancev et al 2017a in general the non parametric techniques estimate maximal output and attribute all differences from this as inefficiency while the parametric techniques acknowledge stochastic noise allowing output variation due to shocks measurement errors and inefficiency also as the directional vector determines the trajectory to the frontier in non parametric techniques this may affect the peer observations färe et al 2014 parametric techniques acknowledge a functional form for the production process that entails results for interpretation directional distance functions ddf measure the breach in a given orientation from a specific point towards the boundary within a set of production possibilities including desired outputs and environmental externalities or undesired outputs in a by production process the method was introduced by chung et al 1997 and färe and grosskopf 2000 as a variation of the luenberger shortage function given a quantity of inputs in a production environment färe and primont 1995 shephard 1970 and it overcame the limitation of parametric approaches to study multi output technologies while environmental threats have continuously stimulated the focus on natural resources and competition for water growth across economic sectors the complex characteristics of the resource undermines the planning potential for storage distribution and quantification in economic activities the average demand of 70 of water for agricultural use can increase up to 90 in semi arid areas while technology progress aimed for more effective application to relieve water pressure in agricultural systems the consumption continued to growth compromising the resource quality and availability grafton et al 2018 although empirical applications in the agricultural sector following ddf have increased over time huang et al 2016 njuki and bravo ureta 2015 njuki et al 2016 evidence is still scarce on the application of parametric techniques the hyperbolic distance functions cuesta and zofío 2005 have also been employed for eco efficiency analysis in agriculture rosano peña et al 2018 estimated a 32 of eco inefficiency in degraded lands by agricultural practices in brazil song et al 2018 found a reversed u shape between economic development and water resource efficiency in china following a ddf approach their analysis acknowledged that regions with higher agricultural participation report lower water resource efficiency considering the increasing interest for optimal water resource management in the agricultural sector the evidence is scant on including water resources measurement and estimation of their effects azad and ancev 2014 by employing parametric techniques that jointly model agricultural goods and environmental externalities devoting little attention to these critical issues azad et al 2015 bravo ureta et al 2015 3 methods and materials 3 1 theoretical model the modeling of a production technology that accommodates the production of undesirable outputs requires a representing of the functional relationship between inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs where the latter are not strongly disposable a suitable candidate is the ddf where an individual production unit i that employs a k dimensional vector of inputs x x 1 x 2 x k ℜ k to produce an m dimensional vector of desirable outputs y y 1 y 2 y m ℜ m while also producing an n dimensional vector of undesirable outputs b b 1 b 2 b n ℜ n the ddf is defined as follows for each individual observation k 1 d 0 x k y k b k g y g b max β β y k β g y b k β g b p x k in this specification β is the maximum feasible expansion of good outputs along the g y vector and the contraction of bad outputs along the g b vector so that the resulting vector y g y b g b remains in the feasible production set p x k chung et al 1997 färe et al 2005 the ddf also satisfies the translation property which states that with the addition of a non negative θ to the directional vector the desired output will expand by θg y and the undesired output will contract by θg b intuitively this means that if the directional vector is e g doubled in size ceteris paribus the resulting value of the distance function will be halved the translation property allows the econometric estimation of the ddf with a suitable choice of θ färe et al 2008 and is similar to the homogeneity property by shephard 1970 2 θ d 0 x y θ g y b θ g b g y g b u i ν i as the ddf is differentiable it is possible to estimate the shadow price for the bad output a desired calculation to value outputs where market prices are non existent traditional productivity models can employ quantity and price information for the estimation whereas direction function based models only require quantity information unlike other production inputs environmental externalities are not tradable and there is a lack of market prices therefore the estimation of shadow price is key to exposing the existing link between the standard productivity of the distance function framework for correct economic interpretation the shadow price of the bad output is calculated at the frontier which means that the value of the distance function with respect to the good output equals to zero fare et al 1993 3 p b p y d 0 x y b g y g b b d 0 x y b g y g b y at least one output price must be known and equal to its shadow price the shadow price describes the good output production that must be foregone in order to reduce the bad output by one unit for all of the production units along the efficiency frontier färe et al 2005 here only production units with the monotonicity conditions are considered 3 2 empirical specification estimation of environmental efficiency ee is based on a dodf the preference for this framework relies on the multiple output nature of grapevine production with the presence of an undesirable output i e the pressure on water quality we chose an output orientation because the inputs employed in the production process are quasi fixed in the short run due to either high adjustment costs or legal restrictions in order to account for sampling and measurement errors using sfa seems preferable in our context whereby a parametric specification of the frontier is required the quadratic functional form allows for full flexible specification that does not impose any a priori restrictions on the substitution possibilities between inputs additionally this functional form is relatively more stable in concave functional form technologies as it is assumed in this paper and holds the flexible characteristics of the technology färe and vardanyan 2016 4 d 0 x i y i b i g α 0 k 1 k α k x i k m 1 m β

selected at the district level based on the official records of the national viticulture institution data was collected between november 2016 and february 2017 in four districts of luján de cuyo mendoza as shown in fig 1 following a structured questionnaire farmers provided quantitative information on their grapevine production systems water management practices market orientation and technology assessment there are several reasons for heterogeneous crop management within the vineyard whereby agronomic and enological characteristics market requirements and different sources of water are among the most common driving forces water application at the plot level was estimated following reported values of irrigation with surface and groundwater sources details of surface water volumes were provided by the watershed inspection and estimated for groundwater users based on consumed energy depth of the aquifer and pumping equipment characteristics regarding water quality farmers voluntarily provided a sample of irrigation water for the analysis 1 1 a sensor hi98129 was employed to obtain temperature adjusted values of ec total dissolved solids tds and acidic levels ph the description of the data in table 1 shows values per hectare to facilitate comparison with other wine regions and interpretation by interested parties however the empirical analysis is carried out with the information scaled in the decision making unit of the farmers which is the grape plot for winemaking on average each vineyard has 7 7 plots and produces 10 2 tons of grapes per hectare main white varieties are chardonnay sauvignon blanc and pedro giménez their average yield is 14 485 ton ha while red varieties are predominantly malbec 55 the average mean of red varieties is 9 837 ton ha average yield per color are significantly different p value 0 most of the surveyed plots irrigate with a dual source of water 68 while a considerable share rely solely on groundwater 30 and only a small proportion irrigate with surface water only 2 as for irrigation systems at the plot level furrow is the most common in the region 68 followed by drip irrigation 28 and flooding 4 in light of the recent pollution threats water quality for irrigation is certainly important for this area the mean acidity values in the sample were 6 9 ph and average electro conductivity ec values 966 9 were acceptable according to international standards and reference values for the region fao and iwmi 2018 with a considerable standard deviation 524 2 4 1 variables selection the capital variable represents the annual economic value of services provided by production infrastructure including land ball et al 2004 given the sample heterogeneity in infrastructure and operational machinery with respect to size economic prices and depreciation this approach contributes to the value interpretation of capital services of existing production infrastructure since water rights are not tradable and they are inherent to the piece of land main reason why land prices are strongly associated with water rights regarding the other input variables the total number of working hours was considered at the plot level seasonal workers are commonly employed for management practices mainly for harvesting and pruning given the high dependence on agricultural income the greater share of permanent labor over seasonal labor was expected while intensive management of wine grape production systems is generalized there is no general consensus for a detailed records of crop management expenditures but farmers do consider the average expenditure per vineyard hectare as the technical analysis seeks to unveil the unobserved heterogeneity in wine grape management detailed information on agrochemical usage and instructions was collected at the plot level also controlling for input prices in the research area exposed a common constant prices across the vineyards while some quality differences were not captured with the exception of explicit organic or low input management practices then considering that farms buy in large similar combinations of agrochemicals the monetary expenditures captures the input quantity and total expenses in agrochemicals at the plot level derived as the constructed variable for crop management all prices were adjusted at the us dollar value at the time the data was collected all variables were normalized by their means concerning the level variables white varieties and pergola trained grapevines are production alternatives that aim for relatively higher yields than red varieties or an espalier training system the depth of the water table measured in meters was also selected as a production shifter acknowledging the difficulties in pumping water with reliable quality for irrigation foster and garduño 2005 a categorical variable of soil characteristics was introduced in the production function in the research area the soil variable has three categories based on their main component superficial texture and drainage finally the level variable of ec was included in the analysis which represents the measured value in micro siemens per centimeter µs cm reported from the water quality analysis 4 2 undesirable output the research area has been subject to salinity threats for the past two decades which has led to farmers pumping water from deeper sources increasing the risk of further damage to the aquifer by saline intrusion foster and garduño 2005 wine grapes yield and quality are sensitive to the saline content of irrigation water zhang et al 2002 and depend on the grape variety soil characteristics and irrigation practices irrigation with saline water diminishes the osmotic potential of soil and excessive concentrations could cause salt accumulation in the wooden tissue and leaves of vines jackson 2008 excess irrigation could stimulate the rise of phreatic levels and further increase soil salinity provoking radicular suffocation and thus substantially affecting vine development and yields substantially the term of salinity hazard is commonly employed in viticulture to acknowledge the grapevine yield sensibility threshold with respect to the kilograms of saline content in the water applied for irrigation 8 sh kg plot 640 ψ e c i b w a t e r m 3 p l o t the salinityhazard sh was estimated according to the standard calculation of salt concentrations in irrigation water and adapted according to the grapevine sensitivity in the research area miyamoto et al 2010 where ψ is a scale volume conversion from micro siemens per centimeter to kilograms per cubic meter 10 6 and the standard conversion value is 640 for the calculation evidence has shown that the relationship between grapevine yields and salinity content is not linear and can be adjusted to the salt concentration levels by varying the values of b according to certain thresholds that acknowledge the crop sensitivity to increments of ec values ayers and westcot 1994 maas 1990 romero et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 the threshold for ec values for grapevines is 1000 micro siemens per centimeter µs cm in this region de lorenzi et al 2009 4 3 noise and inefficiency determinants external variables were selected based on their potential contribution to better explain the production decisions along with plot characteristics that could have some influence on the undesirable output to some degree these variables rely on management decision and enological production objectives the membership variable controls whether the wine grape producers belongs to any farmer association whereas technical assistance received through extension programs or paid consultants is captured by the extensionist dummy vine density is the number of plants per plot and energy subsidy is a dummy variable acknowledging that the producer pays a lower rate for pumping water on account of technological improvements and facing the difficulty in employing qualified labor in the area some vineyards are adopting technology to substitute labor for some tasks whereby the technical dummy acknowledges these improvements the water balance variable is the difference between the water supplied by the farmer and the resource demanded by the vine in cubic meters within the production year for the water supply the volume estimations considered the reported irrigation practices by the farmer adapted to their irrigation system water source and pumping equipment 9 w a t e r b a l a n c e i w a t e r s u p p l y i w a t e r d e m a n d i i r r i g

the formula for available water is aw i cr i h i it i ca i ss i the variables and their values in the carrizal ecosystem are as follows cr i represents the soil retention capacity 0 12 0 17 mm h i the

evapotranspiration et 0 plant transpiration k c soil percolation requirements and the use of hail protection nets for grapevines the calculated variable is a reliable approximation of the water usage and consumption relationship based on the available information 5 results and discussion following a viable treatment for the environmental externality higher efficiency levels are embraced in the direction of augmenting the desirable output grapevines while reducing the undesirable output saline hazard estimations were performed at the plot level scale in the modeling this requirement is expressed by specifying the output vector g 1 1 parameter estimates of the dodf are shown in table 2 followed by input output elasticities in table 3 and the environmental efficiency determinants in table 4 further discussion is provided after estimating the shadow price of salinity hazard 5 1 estimates of the dodf model specification and coefficients have the expected sign and an existing negative trade off relationship between grapevine production and the salinity hazard of irrigation water is confirmed hence monotonicity holds at the sample mean for all inputs except for labor where the point estimate is very small and not significantly different from zero within the sample of vineyards the ee estimation does not imply the redirection of management practices towards a more sustainable path but the relative measure of environmental burden in relation with the economic activity at the sample mean for the undesirable output bstar sal haz θ i g b both coefficients were significant the coefficient of the bstar 2 0 076 confirms a concave function that allows for the trade off interpretation with respect to the desirable output due to the translation property namely the acknowledgment that saline hazard is inherent to grapevine production in this context the first order coefficient for labor has a positive sign 0 03 which affirms that increasing the labor hours at the plot level will reduce production although the value of the second order estimate for labor 0 01 is insignificant the interpretation assumes that adding more labor hours at the plot level would improve the productivity as mentioned earlier this interpretation is feasible considering the quality focus in wine grape production in the region but also incomplete without considering the estimation of the elasticities four of the additional shifter variables were statistically significantly different from zero the binary variables for soil drainage have a rather small estimate 0 2 and 0 03 whereas the electro conductivity ec estimator indicates lower distances to the frontier upon increments in the saline content of water although surprising this result is still interpretable because the quality indicator is the value considered for the saline hazard estimation while the mean ec values are within an acceptable range for viticulture higher saline content in water for irrigation might affect the performance in order to better understand the effects of productive inputs with respect to the output in the dodf framework the elasticities were calculated the distance elasticities of the dodf measure the relative change in the output distance measure with respect to the input quantities increments of inputs with negative signs will shorten the frontier distance improving the vineyard performance conversely those inputs with positive signs would expand the frontier distance upon increasing their usage distance elasticities are listed in table 3 and they were estimated considering the performance at the frontier and assuming linear homogeneity as d o x y 1 with the exception of labor all inputs provided the expected elasticity sign at the frontier the strongest effect is attributed to the water input representing a 0 379 decrease in the distance towards the frontier with a 1 increase in water applied increasing production capital and agrochemicals by 1 would reduce the distance to the frontier by 0 03 and 0 015 respectively as explained above vineyards follow an intensive management throughout the production year and monetary expenditures in agricultural management is an alternative for evaluating input quantities when their prices are similar in the research area furthermore the elasticity of money expenditure in agrochemicals implies that farmers may be close to the optimum usage of agrochemicals the interpretation of these values should be considered with caution since several pest threats and climate contingencies have affected the vineyard performance in the last decade in particular botrytis cinerea grapevine moth and oidium the results show that grapevine production has a decreasing returns to scale in this area at the sample mean this finding is in line with the empirical evidence of wine grape production systems as increasing production inputs by two folds would increase output but at a lower rate a positive sign of the output distance function elasticity of the bstar 0 561 means that increments in the undesired output will expand the distance to the frontier and vineyards will be less productive although relevant for grapevine management as many management practices are labor intensive and crucial for vine quality development the labor factor was not significant in the estimated functional form given the scarcity of qualified labor in the region van den bosch 2008 some vineyards are exploring the mechanization of certain tasks to substitute labor while other farmers are labor intensive and may retain qualified human resources if their enological quality focus requires a greater share of hand crafts activities therefore the relationship between labor and output may belong to the second stage of production where marginal returns start to decrease 5 2 efficiency determinants in addition to the efficiency measure the dodf gives the maximum unit expansion of the desired output and the unit contraction of the undesired output färe et al 2005 efficiency scores are reported in the direction of the output vector g 1 1 which implies that the measure of efficiency reflects the vineyards capacity to improve grapevine production while reducing the salinity hazard given the normalization and directional vector the results report a mean estimate ee of 0 877 corresponding to a mean inefficiency of 0 123 the interpretation is that production per hectare could potentially increase by 1 25 tons 10 16 0 123 and considering the average market price of usd 1 04 per kilogram in 2017 ova 2018 potential gains could be usd 1299 5 per hectare at the same time there is potential to reduce their saline hazard by 0 823 kg 6 71 0 12 at the sample mean fig 3 ilustrates the estimated trade off between desirable and undesirable outputs most of the exogenous variables are significant with the exception of machine technology in the inefficiency model the economic connotation of the coefficients is initially determined by the direction of the effect e g negative positive signs reduce increase inefficiency the interpretation begins with managerial variables that model the irrigation at the plot level and continues with vine management decisions similar effects are shown by the variable created of water balance whereby the inefficiency coefficient indicates that oversupplying vines with water will reduce uncertainty 0 96 at the expense of ee 1 71 as the marginal effect of further increasing irrigation by 1 would increase inefficiency by 0 21 acknowledging that farmers may be applying water beyond their optimal level water 2 0 41 and recalling that an irrigation system is a function based on the technology moving towards a more effective irrigation system would improve efficiency if the producer focus is on increasing output participation in any type of producers association has a positive pay off in terms of ee as it increases performance by 2 41 but also the variability by 0 76 however if the interest is in higher quality which implies greater sugar content and tannins per berry then moving towards more effective irrigation systems would be associated their production objectives in any case over watering the vine if the crop demand has been fulfilled would not improve efficiency but diminish stochastical noise recalling that the energy subsidy is voluntary and originally designed for farms with less than 50 ha cropland winegrowers that account with this incentive will significantly improve efficiency in production 0 74 and reduce uncertainty 0 71 focusing on the crop management aspects the technical advice of extensionists can significantly improve efficiency as receiving technical assistance improves performance by 0 69 while vine density can contribute to efficiency gains 1 34 performance variability will also increase 0 57 on average the marginal effect of increasing vine density by 1 would improve efficiency by 0 17 some underlying performance factors that may drive vineyards efficiency are summarized in table 5 starting with market orientation the sample was separated into viticulturists n 309 and wine growers n 95 the former produces exclusively for selling to wineries under contract agreements or traditional market operations and their mean ee score is 0 873 the latter elaborates wine endowed with their own grape production which could translate into greater care and higher quality standards the significant difference between these sub groups can be observed by their performance within their production possibilities and location with respect to the frontier regarding the undesired output elasticity bstar the two sub groups alternatives confirmed significant differences for their mean values market orientation p value 0 09 and water source p value 0 006 it is possible to differentiate the sample according their water source into conjoint or groundwater most of the former are located in the northern part of the research area n 280 inside the irrigation network and they may rely on wells as a complementary water source as opposed to the groundwater users n 124 these subgroups have statistically different means on ee and elasticity with respect to the salinity hazard while conjoint water users have relatively lower mean efficiency and higher elasticity of the undesired output groundwater users perform better environmentally and are less sensitive to salinity hazard altogether groundwater dependent producers perform better than their counterparts possibly due to their optimization practices adapted to the already constrained access to water resources 5 3 shadow price of saline hazard since the dodf is a differentiable function that enables estimating of technical efficiency for multiple products it is possible to estimate the shadow price of environmental externalities that do not have a market to assign prices in this case the by production of grapevine for wine production and salinity hazard average market price information of registered transactions is available per grape variety and district from ova 2018 assuming that the market price for grapevine pi j equals its shadow price the 3 3 for the shadow price was updated the shadow price describes the production output that must be foregone to reduce the saline hazard by one unit until all of the inefficiency has been eliminated and wine grape is produced at the frontier of the production possibilities the estimated value is a proxy for the environmental benefit of removing salinity hazard at the plot level in other words the avoidance of the potential environmental damage that could be caused by inefficient producers hernández sancho et al 2017 the median price for 1 kg of saline content in water is usd 4 85 with a coefficient of variation 3 75 this value is slightly higher for groundwater irrigated plots than for those that rely on conjoint irrigation sources with usd 5 76 and usd 4 5 per kilogram of saline content respectively as resource endowment varies according to vineyard location further analysis at the district scale is considered to unfold the variation of median shadow prices which could reveal additional insights for designing sector specific policies or estimating potential abatement costs if the combination of inputs and management variables x z of a grapevine plot is located at the frontier of their production possibilities of the output set p x z it is possible to affirm that this plot has fully improved its environmental technical efficiency njuki et al 2016 for this reason only observations that do not violate the monotonicity conditions are considered n 272 therefore the price ratio could be interpreted as the slope of the trade off relationship estimated curve and it reveals their approximate location in the curve simultaneously expressing the relative cost of reducing saline hazard table 6 organizes the estimated values per district according their location and water delivery order the districts of perdriel and agrelo are the first recipients of surface water and there are no vineyard plots with a negative water balance wb so the median price equals the corresponding over irrigated plots wb going down the table groundwater dependency increases the number of over irrigated plots wb decreases and ee scores improves these results are also visible in fig 4 where the relationship between environmental performance and shadow prices is shown decomposing shadow price behavior at the district level implies linking the marginal productivity ratio of bad and good output as described in 3 3 with the drivers of farmers irrigation practices as soil characteristics over irrigated plots are predominantly located over saline soils and diminishing their water balance to zero implies greater heterogeneity in the outputs productivity ratio as depicted in fig 5 higher salinity in vineyards of perdriel and agrelo conditions irrigation practices to over irrigate plots at the expense of their ee whereas districts with relatively less saline hazard seem to better balance irrigation achieving higher environmental performance narrowing the water balance could increase salinity hazard and consequently shadow prices in particular in perdriel and agrelo districts a robust ols regression followed to further disentangle shadow price behavior and regional heterogeneous effects the regression in table 7 shows two factors with opposite signs the location and the water balance of the wine grape plot a positive relationship between shadow and market prices was expected due to the formula building if the vineyard is a recipient of surface water mainly perdriel and agrelo its shadow price is positively influenced but could be compensated by its water balance the constructed water balance variable provides evidence concerning how resource quality and availability shape the irrigation practices and could further inflate the shadow price in groundwater dependent vineyards effects on the shadow price will change going south from perdriel as it implies lowering the pressure from the district variable and salinity conditions but increasing the predominance of the water balance variable location effect prevails in perdriel and ugarteche but not in el carrizal perdriel is the first recipient of surface water and it is located in the northern part of the sample here the location positively influences the shadow price 74 while the water balance weakens this effect 24 considering agrelo as a base point if a wine maker irrigates their vineyard beyond their threshold shadow prices for salinity hazard would be 18 for perdriel 26 for el carrizal and 86 lower for ugarteche the information deployed shows that when decreasing salinity is costly for the wine grape plot vineyards are less irrigated in other words underlying salinity issues increase the shadow price if the vines receive less water this explains the irrigation behavior of farmers located in el carrizal whose grapes have the lowest average value in the market and their vineyards are located on water eroded soils with the greater share having a negative water balance fig 5 therefore increasing irrigation levels would elevate production costs in the present but would have a null effect on the shadow price water balance effects are compensated vineyards in perdriel district face opposite conditions they are settled over saline soils prone to greater salinity hazard and over irrigating their grapes is an expensive practice that they are able to afford as their grapes are the most valued in the research area wine grape plots in agrelo have a positive water balance as they count with a better developed irrigation system and have greater adoption of irrigation technology greater water balance lowers the median shadow price despite the fact that they hold the highest salinity hazard 9 38 altogether this may imply that vine plots functioning in this area could be further along the frontier than the rest of the plots whereas farmers from ugarteche face greater heterogeneity in natural conditions and water sources that lowers the shadow price even if the producers over irrigate their plots the relative share of vineyard plot with a positive water balance wb is smaller in ugarteche and el carrizal which makes it less likely that farmers will over irrigate vines and ultimately shadow prices would be less deflated by the water balance although grapevine plots located in el carrizal perform relatively better in terms of efficiency it would be relatively expensive to reduce their salinity hazard in irrigation water 6 conclusions we have estimated the ee of grapevine production in mendoza in order to analyze the trade offs between the salinity hazard the environmental undesirable output and the wine grape production as a desirable output while simultaneously assessing the extent to which producers can realize improvements in the environmental and the economic dimension the trade off analysis focused on a regionally disaggregated perspective on the shadow price of salinity hazards while analysis of the drivers of environmental efficiencies enabled shedding light on the pathways to utilizing the potential for efficiency improvements in methodological terms we employed a flexible functional form for the dodf so that the patterns of shadow prices and environmental performance were revealed by the observed data the data collection was concluded in january 2017 and comprised 421 grapevine plot surveys and water quality samples our main findings show a trade off relationship between grapevine production and salinity hazard the estimated shadow price for the undesirable output is usd 4 85 and it measures at the sample median the revenue foregone from reducing the saline content in irrigation water by one kilogram the estimated average ee of 0 88 indicates that some potential for improvements still exists in economic returns while reducing the environmental burden of grape production at the sample mean we find that farmers should be able to increase the revenue per ha by usd 1426 75 and simultaneously reduce the environmental burden in terms of saline hazard by 0 82 kg per ha turning to the variables used in the variance related part of the model we find that the water balance exerts a strong negative effect on the level of inefficiency while negatively correlating with production uncertainty the vine density variable also shows substantial effects albeit with an opposite sign this indicates that decisions on water are decisive for both production variability and ee farmers decisions on extensions and organizational membership are positively correlated with ee while only technical advice reduces the production uncertainty the functional form and location specific characteristics are decisive in the determinants of environmental performance and therefore relevant policy implications for this region can be derived first economic tools contribute to reducing the variability of production while leading vineyards to significant efficiency improvements second redirecting efforts towards technology adoption supported by professional technical advice would ultimately have stronger effects in reducing output variability while simultaneously optimizing irrigation practices and introducing mechanization while the hypothesis of greater vine quality at the expense of foregone output is valid these technical advice would ultimately have a stronger effect in diminishing uncertainty but improving output quality third groundwater dependent producers perform better than their counterparts possibly due to their optimization practices adapted to the already constrained resource similarly farmers that sell their output to wineries have better output performance than vineyards that produce their own wine both classifications have higher sensitivity to salinity hazard and lower elasticity to scale upon changes in the zoning restrictions these subgroups should be promoted accordingly the results show that economic tools can significantly improve environmental performance and reduce uncertainty in a water scarcity context farmers are prone to irrigate whenever possible ignoring the vine water threshold this represents an intervention point that an agricultural extensionists could address and where their input significantly translates into efficiency gains the exact reasons for the aforementioned behavior towards irrigation may be beyond this research but it is possible to point to some potential scenarios in a extreme case for example higher vine density under ineffective irrigation systems would imply a compensation of effects since wasted water could be watering the roots of neighboring vines our detailed analysis of the shadow price of salinity hazards reveals that all the factors with negative signs would indeed facilitate to reduce the salinity hazard at a lower opportunity costs technified irrigation systems positive water balance and non saline soils would lower the shadow price for salinity hazard perdriel and agrelo are the first surface water recipients and produce the most valued wine grapes in the region these preconditions their ability to modernize irrigation technology and ensure irrigation needs are fulfilled despite the operational costs and their vineyard s salinity hazard vineyards in ugarteche and el carrizal have fewer tools to effectively lower salinity but pre existing district characteristics can deflate shadow prices only a small share of plots achieved a positive water balance in this districts overall efficiency improvement can be a major motivation for establishing environmental practices in this sector and this research shows that low efficiency scores can be positively influenced there is evidence that vineyard associations and viticulturist cooperatives have increasing interest in the environmental performance of farmers targeted programs on technology adoption for agricultural irrigation through extensionists would improve the overall understanding of the causes and effects of diffuse pollution and could steer farmers away from over exploitation of natural resources in the direction of more sustainable practices the environmental efficiency assessment is not exempt from data limitations of the cross sectional context in this line several aspects of weather forecasts stakeholder behavior and their interactions with wine grape production remain limited additional information on labor availability agronomic treatment and the relation of grape variety with soil characteristics is desired shadow price estimations for non existing markets acknowledge the existing opportunity costs of current performance but shall find ways to optimize the environmental trade off in the long run future research would integrate more information and extend to a panel data that could construct meaningful dynamic models to analyze the environmental and economic performance to capture important

of capital services vineyards are usually productive for several decades thus the flow of services from a given vineyard is based on the area planted and on the capital embedded in the vines we calculate this flow of services via the perpetual inventory approach which is frequently employed in agricultural economics coelli and sanders 2013 as market prices do not always reflect the economic value of capital employed on the farm this methodology assesses the annual services provided by the stock which is priced according to their own characteristics ball et al 2004 taking into account the
