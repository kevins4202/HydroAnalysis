1290,after accidental release of pollutants in rivers the release estimation of the pollutant is necessary for the dealing of this accident with the increase of people s attention to river pollution the monitoring data of river pollution will become more and more abundant and diversified at this point data assimilation approaches will be more advantageous in this paper a new model called variational analysis inverse model vaim based on the variational data assimilation is proposed to solve the pollutant release estimation problem in the framework of the variational analysis the conjugate gradient method and one dimensional imprecise line search wolfe powell conditions are combined to solve this problem the implicit finite difference scheme is adopted to solve the one dimensional advection dispersion equation some synthetic cases are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model under the effect of the observational error and the effect of initial estimates for release rates in the iteration results show that vaim successfully recovers the accurate release there are only slight differences among estimated releases by vaim under different initial estimates field tracer experiments are used to evaluate the practicability of vaim results show that the relative error between the estimated release and the real release in the field tracer experiment is only 1 2 in conclusion vaim is a release estimation method with high accuracy and will play an important role in river pollution management keywords release estimation source identification problem variational analysis river pollution 1 introduction the accidental release of pollutants into rivers such as nutrients and heavy metals may cause the biodiversity loss the environmental degradation and the human health hazard treseder 2008 azizullah et al 2011 li et al 2011 therefore some remedies must be taken to mitigate the damage to the ecosystem after an accidental release event occurs during this process some information is required for decision makers and the total release mass with the release history may be the most useful one gzyl et al 2014 ayaz 2021 thus how to estimate the release of the pollutant becomes the key to solving this problem usually we can obtain the data of hydrology the topography of river and measurements of the pollutant concentration via the measurement station estimating the release of the pollutant from these data is what we next to do and this is a typical source identification problem as well as an inverse problem atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 boano et al 2005 sun et al 2006 the inverse problem is often ill posed groetsch 1993 aster et al 2013 due to the error in concentration observations in the hydrology and topography data for rivers and in the computing model the source identification problem in rivers is a more complex problem atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 jiang et al 2018 barajas solano et al 2019 the source identification problem in groundwater has already been proposed and studied gorelick et al 1983 various methods can be found in literatures for the source identification problem in groundwater including the least squares gorelick et al 1983 the tikhonov regularization skaggs and kabala 1994 the random walk method bagtzoglou et al 1992 the minimum relative entropy woodbury and ulrych 1996 the quasi reversibility skaggs and kabala 1995 the genetic algorithm aral and liao 1996 the artificial neural network singh et al 2004 the backward probability method neupauer and wilson 1999 and so on the source identification problem in rivers differs from that in groundwater for rivers have characteristics that distinguish them from groundwater mazaheri and samani 2015 jiang et al 2018 recently the source identification problem in rivers has attracted much attention jiang et al 2018 there are several methods can be found in literatures and they can be divided into two groups deterministic algorithms and uncertainty analysis algorithms deterministic algorithms use deterministic parameters to obtain deterministic results commonly used deterministic algorithms are as follows the least squares method jing et al 2019 the moment based method tong and deng 2015 the radial basis collocation method li et al 2016 the evolutionary computing methods yang et al 2016 zhang and xin 2017 the backward probability method cheng and jia 2010 ghane et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and mathematical methods for special cases badia et al 2005 hamdi 2012 mazaheri and samani 2015 hamdi 2016 while uncertainty analysis algorithms use the probability distribution of parameters to output the probability distribution of possible results uncertainty analysis algorithms used in the river pollution source identification problem include the geostatistical approach boano et al 2005 the bayesian approach guozhen et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 and the ensemble kalman filter zhang and huang 2017 wang et al 2019 as a particular source identification problem singh and singh 2019 the release estimation problem has its own characters firstly the pollution source release location is assumed to be known secondly the release that needs to be estimated is a function of time which means a large number of variables release rates at different moments these characters lead to the release estimation problem becoming a complex problem compared with the common source identification problem the release estimation problem in rivers is less studied there are few methods have been used in the field of the river pollutant release estimation problem the geostatistical approach boano et al 2005 the mathematical method mazaheri and samani 2015 the space time radial basis collocation method li et al 2016 and the ensemble kalman filter method zhang and huang 2017 with the development of information technology and the improvement of people s attention to river pollution the monitoring of river pollution will be stricter and the means of monitoring such as unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite remote sensing will be more diversified that means more river pollution monitoring data will be available at this point data assimilation approaches will be more advantageous among the existing studies on the release estimation problem in rivers only the enkf method is a data assimilation approach however enkf has some unsolved issues that limit its use 1 each time the monitoring data is added only the release intensity at the current time point is adjusted which excludes the contribution of the release intensity at previous moments to these monitoring data and ignores the continuity of the diffusion process 2 the estimated release intensities have a certain lag in time sequence especially in the early stage 3 because of its ensemble based characteristics it takes up more computing resources this give us the inspiration to use another kind of data assimilation method variational data assimilation vda vda with adjoint equations first appeared in the work of penenko and obraztsov penenko 1976 vda is the data assimilation approach based on the lagrange multiplier method dimet and talagrand 1986 as a continuous data assimilation method daley 1993 the vda can use and balance all monitoring data in the whole research domain and period to get the global optimal result vda has been already widely used in the meteorology dimet and talagrand 1986 an et al 2016 the oceanography shutyaev and parmuzin 2009 agoshkov et al 2010 chen et al 2012 shutyaev and parmuzin 2021 and the hydrodynamics yoshida and maeno 2014 which demonstrated its performance the variational approach to the source identification problem in parabolic equations is well developed in recent works geng geng and lin 2009 adopted the variational iteration method to inverse heat source problems zheng use it to recover the source and initial value zheng and wei 2014 zhou zhou and wu 2014 use the variational iteration method to identify a time dependent heat source with nonlocal boundary and overdetermination conditions sun sun et al 2017 use the variation adjoint method to discuss the conditional well posedness for an inverse source problem in the diffusion equation vasil vasil ev et al 2019 use it to solve the right hand side identification problem which is a product of two functions kaltenbacher kaltenbacher and rundell 2019 use it to recovering the reaction term in a reaction diffusion equation hao hao et al 2021 use variational approach to identify a source term depending on both spatial and time variables in a parabolic equation from single cauchy data on a part of the boundary however these works mainly focused on the mathematical field and lacks practical applications evaluations are still required for the potential application of variational approach in the real world river system pollution source release estimation problem especially in rivers with strong spatial variability this paper attempts to propose a deterministic algorithm model called the variational analysis inverse model vaim based on the vda to estimate the release of the river pollutant in this model the one dimensional advection dispersion equation is adopted to describe the transport of the pollutant in rivers and the release information is assumed to be unknown except the release location it can be used in a practical scenario where the pollutant release needs to be obtained for the emergency response when an accident release occurs at a plant with the known location the methodology is given in section 2 including the description of the pollutant transport model the variational analysis the numerical scheme the control variables optimization scheme and the flow chart of the vaim in section 3 some synthetic cases are used to evaluate the effect of the error in observations and the effect of initial estimates for the release rates in the iteration to estimation results as well as the vaim s applicability in real world systems a field tracer experiment is analyzed and discussed in section 4 finally a discussion is given in section 5 and a conclusion is given in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 pollutant transport model in river considering the biogeochemical processes the one dimensional pollutant transport model in rivers is the one dimensional advection dispersion equation it is given in the following form mazaheri and samani 2015 1 ac t qc x x ae c x akc q t δ x x 0 where c is the concentration of the pollutant a is the area of the river cross section q is the flow discharge e is the dispersion coefficient in the flow direction k is the first order reaction coefficient q t is the release rate function of the pollutant x 0 is the source location x is the coordinate value along the river t is the diffusion time after the release and δ is the dirac delta function a and q can be obtained by solving saint venant equations 2 a t q x 0 q t x q 2 a ga z x gas f 0 where g is the acceleration of gravity z is the water level and s f is the energy slope the dispersion coefficient ecan be obtained by the well known fischer s model 3 e 0 011 u 2 b 2 hu where u is the mean flow velocity b is the flow width and u is the shear velocity the dispersion coefficient also can be obtained from calibration the flow field a and q and the dispersion coefficient e of eq 1 should be known before the release estimation process the eq 1 satisfies following boundary conditions and initial conditions 4 c 0 t 0 t 0 c x t x 0 x l t 0 c x 0 0 0 x l where l is the coordinate value at the end of the river 2 2 variational analysis the principle of variational analysis is minimizing the cost function under the condition of model equations serving as constraints yu and o brien 1991 the cost function measures the misfit between model simulations and observations in the whole time and space domain the cost function can be defined as 5 j q t c 1 2 t x c c obs 2 δ x x m dxdt where cis model results c is also the function of q t which means thatj is the functional of q t c obs is the observation of the pollutant concentration x m is the coordinate value of the mth concentration measurement point t is the time domain x is the space domain and j is the cost function value by minimizing the cost function we can find the model solution that will best agree with observations as mentioned earlier the pollutant transport model equation will be treated as the strong constraint and this can be realized by the introduction of the lagrange function the lagrange function is defined as 6 l q t λ c j t x λ ac t qc x x ae c x kac q t δ x x 0 d xdt where λ is the lagrange multiplier is the inner product of two vectors then the constrained optimization problem become the unconstrained problem with respect to the variable q t thus we can solve the problem of minimizing the cost function by finding stationary points of the lagrange function this leads to the following equations 7 l q t λ c c 0 8 l q t λ c q t 0 9 l q t λ c λ 0 the eq 7 leads to the adjoint equation using the integration by parts it also can be derived by the perturbation theory it can be derived as 10 a λ t q λ x x ae λ x kaλ c c obs δ x x m the driving factor for the adjoint equation is the data misfit of model simulations and observations in fact the essence of the adjoint equation is that the data misfit information is carried and conveyed by the lagrange multiplier back to the initial time to influence the reconstruction of the model state yu and o brien 1991 note that the following boundary and initial conditions have been used when deriving the adjoint equation 11 λ l t 0 t 0 λ x t x 0 x 0 and l t 0 λ x t 0 0 x l the eq 10 will be solved back in time and these boundary and initial conditions will be used in this process the eq 8 leads to the gradient of the cost function with respect to q t in the process of deriving the eq 12 the properties of the dirac delta function are used 12 j q t c q t λ x 0 t then we can use the gradient to adjust the q t to obtain the optimal q t how to adjust the q t will be described in section 2 4 the eq 9 leads to the pollutant transport model eq 1 2 3 numerical scheme the pollutant transport model eq 1 as well as the adjoint eq 10 will be solved by the implicit finite difference scheme in section 2 2 the release of the pollutant is a continuous function of time however we usually discretize the continuous release curve into a series of small duration releases under this condition eq 12 can be written as 13 j q t i c q t i 1 δt t i t i δt λ x 0 t dt where δt is the value of the small duration q t i is the release rate during the ith small duration i 1 2 3 n n is the number of small durations this integration can be solved by using the trapezoidal rule 2 4 control variables optimization scheme in section 2 3 we get the gradient of the cost function with respect to q q q t1 q t2 q t n tby the eq 13 then iterative optimization algorithms need to be used to adjust the initial estimate of q the formula for adjusting q is defined as 14 q k 1 q k α k d k where q k is the release rates q in the kth iteration d k is the adjustment direction for q k α k is the optimal adjustment step size to obtain the adjustment direction d k the conjugate gradient algorithm fletcher 1964 is adopted in this paper if we define 15 g k j q k j q t 1 j q t 2 j q t n k t where g k denotes the gradient of the cost function j with respect to q k then the adjustment direction for q k can be defined as 16 d k 1 g k g k 1 2 g k 2 d k d 1 g 1 where g 1 is the gradient of j with respect to q 1 q 1 is the initial estimate of q g k means the norm of g k now we have the adjustment direction of the control variables q k we still need the optimal adjustment step size this problem can be described by the mathematical language as 17 j q k α k d k min α 0 j q k α d k α is the only variable in the eq 17 for q k and d k are known at this point line search algorithms need to be used to obtain the optimal adjustment step size α k wolfe powell conditions powell 1975 are adopted in this paper they can be written as 18 j q k α k d k j q k ρα k g k t d k g k 1 t d k σ g k t d k 0 ρ σ 1 where ρ and σ are given as constants before computing in this paper ρ 0 1 σ 0 5 then an inexact one dimensional line search algorithm under the wolfe powell conditions can be given as 2 4 1 the wolfe powell line search algorithm a give the adjustment step size search range 0 α max give constants ρ 0 1 σ 0 5 set α 1 0 α 2 α max φ 1 j q k φ 1 g k t d k give α α 1 α 2 b compute the φ φ α j q k α d k if φ φ 1 ραφ 1 the first equation of eq 18 go to c else compute the α by 19 α α 1 α α 1 2 1 φ 1 φ α α 1 φ 1 then set α 2 α α α go to b c compute φ φ α g k 1 t d k if φ σφ 1 the second equation of eq 18 set α k α output the α k and stop else compute the α by eq 19 then set α 1 α φ 1 φ φ 1 φ α α go to b now that we have obtained d k andα k then the eq 14 can be used to adjust q k 2 5 the procedure of vaim following we summarize the method step 0 set k 1 give the initial estimate of release rate q k step 1 use q k to obtain model simulations by the eq 1 and the eq 4 then calculate the cost function j k by eq 5 for k 2 if j k 1 j k j k 1 1 e 3 stop step 2 obtain the gradient g k of the cost function j k with respect to q kby eqs 10 11 and 13 then obtain the adjustment direction d k by eq 16 step 3 obtain the optimal adjustment step size α k by the wolfe powell line search algorithm step 4 adjust the control variable q k by eq 14 note that if q ti 0 then q ti 0 i 1 2 n then set k k 1 go to step 1 3 the synthetic case 3 1 uniform flow case 3 1 1 case description synthetic cases are used to test the performance of the vaim in the release estimation problem in rivers supposing an accidental release of the pollutant occurs from a plant at a known location with coordinates 400 m upstream of a straight river with the length of 1000 m there are four measurement points cs1 cs2 cs3 cs4 downstream of the river with coordinates 520 m 657 m 756 m 940 m respectively see fig 1 the simulated current field of this river is steady with the water flow of 0 54 m3 s the flow velocity of 0 57 m s the dispersion coefficient of 1 76 m2 s and the first order decay coefficient of 0 s 1 the pollutant transport model and the adjoint equation are simulated by the implicit finite difference scheme with the spatial step of 1 m temporal step of 1 s number of space steps of 1000 and number of time steps of 1800 the release function of the pollutant is given by a sinusoidal curve eq 20 20 q t i 10 sin π 10 t i 1 i 1 2 11 0 i 11 where i is the ith small duration i 1 2 11 the small duration δt is 1 min observations of the pollutant in this synthetic case are obtained by simulating the pollutant transport model then the vaim is applied to this synthetic case to evaluate the effect of the observational error and the effect of initial estimates for release rates to release estimation results some statistics are used for evaluating model performances the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the root mean square error rmse are evaluation index for the fitting degree between the original release and the estimated release as well as for the fitting degree of the pollutant concentration between observations and simulations of estimated release the relative error is the index for the difference between the total release mass of the original release and the estimated release 3 1 2 the effect of observational error observations are usually accompanied by the error and error will inevitably affect the result of the release estimation therefore the effect of the observation error to release estimation results is evaluated in this synthetic case after obtaining observations by simulating the pollutant transport model we add the data noise into the observations data noise is added as follow cheng and jia 2010 jing et al 2020 21 c obs c sim rc sim where c sim is the concentration simulations r is the random number between the given range for example 0 05 and 0 05 for 5 noise following a gaussian distribution c obs is the observation used in the synthetic case in this paper 5 10 15 and 20 noise are considered observations with different noise are plotted in fig 2 then vaim is applied to this synthetic case to investigate the effect of the error in observation results are described in figs 3 4 and 5 fig 3 show estimated releases under different data noise we can find that estimated releases fluctuate around the original release moreover amplitude of the fluctuation increases with the observation error fig 4 gives comparisons of the original release and estimated releases under different data noise this figure indicates that nse between the two sequences decreases with the increase of the observation error although the observation error is 20 nse is still greater than 0 95 which suggests a good fitness between the original release and the estimated release comparison of simulation concentration and observation concentration at four measurement points is shown in fig 5 and the similar law to fig 3 is found in this figure from table 1 we can find that the total release mass difference between the original release and the estimated release grows as the expanding of the observation error as above we can conclude that results of estimated releases by vaim will deteriorate with the rise of the observation error results are still reliable even if error is 20 3 1 3 the effect of initial estimates for release rates in the iteration initial estimates for release rates in the iteration may affect the result in this section the effect of initial estimates to the release estimation result by vaim is conducted case conditions are described in section 3 1 1 and 20 noise in observation is adopted run the vaim model repeatedly to get the output of the model when initial estimates for release rates in the iteration are given as 1 q 1 0 0 0 2 q 1 5 5 5 3 q 1 10 10 10 4 q 1 15 15 15 5 q 1 20 20 20 results are given in fig 6 in fig 6 we can find that estimated releases under different initial estimates are similar to each other fig 7 gives comparisons of the original release and estimated releases although there are differences in estimated releases nses of all the results are greater than 0 95 fig 8 is the comparison of the simulation concentration and the observation concentration at four measurement points table 1 shows that the relative errors of estimated releases are at the same level and this suggests that initial estimates in the iteration almost have no effect to the total release mass estimation according to the above analysis we can draw a conclusion that although the initial estimate does have effect to the release estimation result this effect is slight and negligible this means that estimated releases obtained by vaim under different initial estimates are all reliable the slight effect may be caused by rounding error in the iterative process 3 2 non uniform flow case for the purpose of further demonstrating the advantages of this model a synthetic case study with real world river topography is used in this section this river named xiangxi river a tributary of the yangtze river located in hubei province china as shown in fig 9 this is a river with strong spatial variability for large variation in flow area along the flow direction therefore the analytical solution for pollutant transport in our previous study jing et al 2020 is not applicable in this scenario topographic data of this river is given in fig 9 c the flow discharge of the study period of this river is assumed to be 500 m3 s which is regarded as the upstream boundary there is the three gorges dam downstream the yangtze river due to the proximity of the xiangxi river to the yangtze river section where the three gorges dam is located the water level of the xiangxi river is affected by the opening of the gates of the three gorges dam in this synthetic case for ease of calculation it is assumed that the downstream boundary water level is 120 m elevations are based on the national height datum 1985 he et al 2016 at a certain opening of the three gorges dam gates roughness coefficient of this river is 0 03 the calibration longitudinal dispersion coefficient is 1 73 m2 s a total of 87 river cross sections were intercepted at 50 m intervals based on the measured topographic scatter data of the xiangxi river fig 10 shows the typical cross section of the xiangxi river according to these river cross sections upstream boundary and downstream boundary we can get the flow field after the calculation of the saint venant equations eq 2 fig 9 d shows the longitudinal profile of cross section area for xiangxi river under the above condition the potential pollution source is located in 200 m in fig 9 c the release discharge is 1 m3 s which is is negligible compared to the flow discharge 500 m3 s of the study period of this river release concentration of this pollution source is given in table 2 there are three concentration measurement sites located in 1000 m 1500 m 2000 m after the simulation of eq 1 we can get the pollutant concentration simulations at three sites following the same way as the section 3 1 we added 10 data noise to concentration simulations then we obtained the pollutant concentration measurements which are given in fig 11 estimation results of this synthetic case study are shown in fig 12 fig 12 b shows good agreement between concentration simulations and concentration observations fig 12 a shows that estimated release fluctuates up and down from actual release the estimated release rate tends to be large in the middle and small on both sides even though the actual release rate is constant the relative error of the total release mass for the estimated is 3 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient should vary along the river in real world river however it is given as a constant in this synthetic case therefore it is necessary to study the sensitivity of pollution source release estimation result with respect to it to study estimation sensitivity with respect to the coupling of measurement errors and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient uncertainty we firstly assume that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of this study river obeys a normal distribution n 1 73 0 5 which is given in fig 13 the red line then we use the latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 to sample from this distribution the ensemble size 100 of longitudinal dispersion coefficient is given in fig 13 the blue columns in this paper lhs is performed by matlab function lhsnorm m next we use the observations with data noise and the longitudinal dispersion coefficients obtained from the sampling to estimate the source release finally we extract the statistical information of the result ensemble such as the mean and variance to analyze the impact of the uncertainty in the longitudinal dispersion coefficients on the estimation results joint distribution of longitudinal dispersion coefficient and relative error of estimated total mass is given in fig 14 from this figure we can find that relative error of estimated total mass increases as the deviation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient from its true value increases under the condition of 15 observation error and a normal distribution n 1 74 0 69 for longitudinal dispersion coefficient the relative error of estimated total mass is almost within the 10 interval the mean relative error of estimated total mass is 3 which is a very good result 4 the real case 4 1 case description a tracer experiment is used as a case study to investigate the performance of the vaim in practical applications this tracer experiment is the experiment 24 one of the tracer experiments performed on the murray burn which is a small river through the heriot watt university campus ani et al 2009 the tracer used for this experiment is the rhodamine wt which is considered as a conservative tracer in this paper the tracer with known mass 250 mg is injected instantaneously discharged into the middle of the stream and the monitoring of concentration in time is performed downstream of the source at four sites cs1 cs2 cs3 cs4 it is assumed that the tracer is released into the stream at a constant rate of 4 17 mg s 250 mg in total in 1 min during a small duration 1 min the flow rate of murray burn at that time is 0 535m3 s tracer injection site and monitoring sites divide the river into four reaches physical characteristics ani et al 2009 of each reach for the numerical model are given in table 3 4 2 result observations obtained by four monitoring sites piotrowski 2007 are used in vaim model the model is integrated for 1680 s with a time step of 1 s the space domain is 1000 m with the space step of 1 m the small duration δt is 1 min initial estimate for the real release is q 1 0 0 0 the variation of the cost function the total release of pollutant with the number of the iteration are plotted in fig 15 a the cost function reduces to about 10 of its initial value after 4 iterations and then it reaches a steady state correspondingly the total release mass starts from 0 and reaches a stable state after 4 iterations fig 15 b is the comparison of real release and the estimated release the estimated release agrees well with the real release which confirmed that the release history of this tracer experiment is successfully recovered by the vaim model the estimated release rate in the first minute is 4 22 mg s a little overestimated than the real condition 4 17 mg s the retrieved release rates for other periods are at the magnitude of 10 8 mg s which are negligible the total retrieved release is 253 mg 1 2 higher than the real value 250 mg this result is better than the result of zhang s work zhang and huang 2017 fig 15 c shows the comparison of breakthrough curves between the observations and the model simulations by the vaim model the peak of the two breakthrough curves and the time of reaching the peak agree well indicating a perfect simulation of the vaim however there are slight differences between these two breakthrough curve profiles these differences may be caused by the inaccurate dispersion coefficient fig 15 d illustrates these differences in details points composed of observations and simulations are evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line the nse value is 0 885 close to 0 9 indicating a good performance of the vaim 5 discussion this paper developed a variational analysis inverse model based on the implicit finite difference method of the one dimensional advection dispersion model to estimation the temporal release of the pollutant in river compared to our previous study jing et al 2020 this model has the following advancements 1 since this model adopt the numerical solution rather than an analytical solution it can be used in real world river system which has the the strong spatial variability 2 this model can obtain the time varying release process of the river pollutant rather than the simple uniform emission or instantaneous release 3 the flow discharge and the flow area of river cross section obtained by saint venant equations the longitudinal dispersion coefficient obtained by some empirical formulas fisher 1968 seo and cheong 1998 are used in this model rather than the mean flow velocity and the mean longitudinal dispersion coefficient of course the new model has its own conditions of application known hydrodynamic parameters of the river flow discharge flow area and longitudinal dispersion coefficients known release location of the pollutant source there are some limitations or deficiencies in this paper firstly the pollutant transport model adopted in this study is the one dimensional advection dispersion model the two dimensional model and the influence of vegetation and dead zone model are not covered in this paper secondly the flow velocity and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient used in the real case are constants rather than considering the uncertainty of them however vaim has the potential to consider velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficients as control variables optimize them along with the release history thus it will be conducted in our future studies despite of these limitations and deficiencies results of synthetic cases and the real case give us the confidence for the vaim in practice 6 conclusion in this paper a new deterministic algorithm model called vaim based on the variational data assimilation is proposed to recover the release history of the pollutant source the proposed vaim model can use all the data in the study period to obtain the global optimal solution which may play a very important role in the field of the pollutant release estimation problem in the future for its ability to process big data detailed analysis of the performance for vaim under conditions we are concerned is conducted by using some synthetic cases and a real case firstly the effect of observation error is evaluated results show that the estimated release by the vaim will deteriorate with the increase of data error even if the observation error reach to 20 nse between original release and the estimated release is still higher than 0 95 meanwhile the relative error of the total release mass between the estimated release and the original release is lower than 1 5 secondly the effect of the initial estimate for the release rates in the iteration is evaluated results show that although there are differences among estimated releases under different initial estimates the statistics evaluation index suggests that differences are slight nses between the original release and estimated releases are all higher than 0 95 correspondingly relative errors of total release mass between estimated releases and the original release are all at the level of 1 5 these statistics indexes suggest reliable results of estimated releases by vaim under different initial estimates for the release rates in the iteration a synthetic case study with real world river topography and its sensitivity analysis shows vaim s superiority in natural river case a tracer experiment is used as a real case to evaluate the performance for vaim in practice total release mass of retrieved release is 1 2 higher than that of the real release suggesting the good performance of the vaim in practical applications vaim s ability to process all the data in the whole study period and its good performance make it a potential model in the pollutant release estimation problem we will use the vaim in the next step to optimize the flow velocity the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the release rate at the same time to eliminate the uncertainty of these two parameters vaim also can be used in the field of the pollution control which may be another study of us in the future

identification problem variational analysis river pollution 1 introduction the accidental release of pollutants into rivers such as nutrients and heavy metals may cause the biodiversity loss the environmental degradation and the human health hazard treseder 2008 azizullah et al 2011 li et al 2011 therefore some remedies must be taken to mitigate the damage to the ecosystem after an accidental release event occurs during this process some information is required for decision makers and the total release mass with the release history may be the most useful one gzyl et al 2014 ayaz 2021 thus how to estimate the release of the pollutant becomes the key to solving this problem usually we can obtain the data of hydrology the topography of river and measurements of the pollutant concentration via the measurement station estimating the release of the pollutant from these data is what we next to do and this is a typical source identification problem as well as an inverse problem atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 boano et al 2005 sun et al 2006 the inverse problem is often ill posed groetsch 1993 aster et al 2013 due to the error in concentration observations in the hydrology and topography data for rivers and in the computing model the source identification problem in rivers is a more complex problem atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 jiang et al 2018 barajas solano et al 2019 the source identification problem in groundwater has already been proposed and studied gorelick et al 1983 various methods can be found in literatures for the source identification problem in groundwater including the least squares gorelick et al 1983 the tikhonov regularization skaggs and kabala 1994 the random walk method bagtzoglou et al 1992 the minimum relative entropy woodbury and ulrych 1996 the quasi reversibility skaggs and kabala 1995 the genetic algorithm aral and liao 1996 the artificial neural network singh et al 2004 the backward probability method neupauer and wilson 1999 and so on the source identification problem in rivers differs from that in groundwater for rivers have characteristics that distinguish them from groundwater mazaheri and samani 2015 jiang et al 2018 recently the source identification problem in rivers has attracted much attention jiang et al 2018 there are several methods can be found in literatures and they can be divided into two groups deterministic algorithms and uncertainty analysis algorithms deterministic algorithms use deterministic parameters to obtain deterministic results commonly used deterministic algorithms are as follows the least squares method jing et al 2019 the moment based method tong and deng 2015 the radial basis collocation method li et al 2016 the evolutionary computing methods yang et al 2016 zhang and xin 2017 the backward probability method cheng and jia 2010 ghane et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and mathematical methods for special cases badia et al 2005 hamdi 2012 mazaheri and samani 2015 hamdi 2016 while uncertainty analysis algorithms use the probability distribution of parameters to output the probability distribution of possible results uncertainty analysis algorithms used in the river pollution source identification problem include the geostatistical approach boano et al 2005 the bayesian approach guozhen et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 and the ensemble kalman filter zhang and huang 2017 wang et al 2019 as a particular source identification problem singh and singh 2019 the release estimation problem has its own characters firstly the pollution source release location is assumed to be known secondly the release that needs to be estimated is a function of time which means a large number of variables release rates at different moments these characters lead to the release estimation problem becoming a complex problem compared with the common source identification problem the release estimation problem in rivers is less studied there are few methods have been used in the field of the river pollutant release estimation problem the geostatistical approach boano et al 2005 the mathematical method mazaheri and samani 2015 the space time radial basis collocation method li et al 2016 and the ensemble kalman filter method zhang and huang 2017 with the development of information technology and the improvement of people s attention to river pollution the monitoring of river pollution will be stricter and the means of monitoring such as unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite remote sensing will be more diversified that means more river pollution monitoring data will be available at this point data assimilation approaches will be more advantageous among the existing studies on the release estimation problem in rivers only the enkf method is a data assimilation approach however enkf has some unsolved issues that limit its use 1 each time the monitoring data is added only the release intensity at the current time point is adjusted which excludes the contribution of the release intensity at previous moments to these monitoring data and ignores the continuity of the diffusion process 2 the estimated release intensities have a certain lag in time sequence especially in the early stage 3 because of its ensemble based characteristics it takes up more computing resources this give us the inspiration to use another kind of data assimilation method variational data assimilation vda vda with adjoint equations first appeared in the work of penenko and obraztsov penenko 1976 vda is the data assimilation approach based on the lagrange multiplier method dimet and talagrand 1986 as a continuous data assimilation method daley 1993 the vda can use and balance all monitoring data in the whole research domain and period to get the global optimal result vda has been already widely used in the meteorology dimet and talagrand 1986 an et al 2016 the oceanography shutyaev and parmuzin 2009 agoshkov et al 2010 chen et al 2012 shutyaev and parmuzin 2021 and the hydrodynamics yoshida and maeno 2014 which demonstrated its performance the variational approach to the source identification problem in parabolic equations is well developed in recent works geng geng and lin 2009 adopted the variational iteration method to inverse heat source problems zheng use it to recover the source and initial value zheng and wei 2014 zhou zhou and wu 2014 use the variational iteration method to identify a time dependent heat source with nonlocal boundary and overdetermination conditions sun sun et al 2017 use the variation adjoint method to discuss the conditional well posedness for an inverse source problem in the diffusion equation vasil vasil ev et al 2019 use it to solve the right hand side identification problem which is a product of two functions kaltenbacher kaltenbacher and rundell 2019 use it to recovering the reaction term in a reaction diffusion equation hao hao et al 2021 use variational approach to identify a source term depending on both spatial and time variables in a parabolic equation from single cauchy data on a part of the boundary however these works mainly focused on the mathematical field and lacks practical applications evaluations are still required for the potential application of variational approach in the real world river system pollution source release estimation problem especially in rivers with strong spatial variability this paper attempts to propose a deterministic algorithm model called the variational analysis inverse model vaim based on the vda to estimate the release of the river pollutant in this model the one dimensional advection dispersion equation is adopted to describe the transport of the pollutant in rivers and the release information is assumed to be unknown except the release location it can be used in a practical scenario where the pollutant release needs to be obtained for the emergency response when an accident release occurs at a plant with the known location the methodology is given in section 2 including the description of the pollutant transport model the variational analysis the numerical scheme the control variables optimization scheme and the flow chart of the vaim in section 3 some synthetic cases are used to evaluate the effect of the error in observations and the effect of initial estimates for the release rates in the iteration to estimation results as well as the vaim s applicability in real world systems a field tracer experiment is analyzed and discussed in section 4 finally a discussion is given in section 5 and a conclusion is given in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 pollutant transport model in river considering the biogeochemical processes the one dimensional pollutant transport model in rivers is the one dimensional advection dispersion equation it is given in the following form mazaheri and samani 2015 1 ac t qc x x ae c x akc q t δ x x 0 where c is the concentration of the pollutant a is the area of the river cross section q is the flow discharge e is the dispersion coefficient in the flow direction k is the first order reaction coefficient q t is the release rate function of the pollutant x 0 is the source location x is the coordinate value along the river t is the diffusion time after the release and δ is the dirac delta function a and q can be obtained by solving saint venant equations 2 a t q x 0 q t x q 2 a ga z x gas f 0 where g is the acceleration of gravity z is the water level and s f is the energy slope the dispersion coefficient ecan be obtained by the well known fischer s model 3 e 0 011 u 2 b 2 hu where u is the mean flow velocity b is the flow width and u is the shear velocity the dispersion coefficient also can be obtained from calibration the flow field a and q and the dispersion coefficient e of eq 1 should be known before the release estimation process the eq 1 satisfies following boundary conditions and initial conditions 4 c 0 t 0 t 0 c x t x 0 x l t 0 c x 0 0 0 x l where l is the coordinate value at the end of the river 2 2 variational analysis the principle of variational analysis is minimizing the cost function under the condition of model equations serving as constraints yu and o brien 1991 the cost function measures the misfit between model simulations and observations in the whole time and space domain the cost function can be defined as 5 j q t c 1 2 t x c c obs 2 δ x x m dxdt where cis model results c is also the function of q t which means thatj is the functional of q t c obs is the observation of the pollutant concentration x m is the coordinate value of the mth concentration measurement point t is the time domain x is the space domain and j is the cost function value by minimizing the cost function we can find the model solution that will best agree with observations as mentioned earlier the pollutant transport model equation will be treated as the strong constraint and this can be realized by the introduction of the lagrange function the lagrange function is defined as 6 l q t λ c j t x λ ac t qc x x ae c x kac q t δ x x 0 d xdt where λ is the lagrange multiplier is the inner product of two vectors then the constrained optimization problem become the unconstrained problem with respect to the variable q t thus we can solve the problem of minimizing the cost function by finding stationary points of the lagrange function this leads to the following equations 7 l q t λ c c 0 8 l q t λ c q t 0 9 l q t λ c λ 0 the eq 7 leads to the adjoint equation using the integration by parts it also can be derived by the perturbation theory it can be derived as 10 a λ t q λ x x ae λ x kaλ c c obs δ x x m the driving factor for the adjoint equation is the data misfit of model simulations and observations in fact the essence of the adjoint equation is that the data misfit information is carried and conveyed by the lagrange multiplier back to the initial time to influence the reconstruction of the model state yu and o brien 1991 note that the following boundary and initial conditions have been used when deriving the adjoint equation 11 λ l t 0 t 0 λ x t x 0 x 0 and l t 0 λ x t 0 0 x l the eq 10 will be solved back in time and these boundary and initial conditions will be used in this process the eq 8 leads to the gradient of the cost function with respect to q t in the process of deriving the eq 12 the properties of the dirac delta function are used 12 j q t c q t λ x 0 t then we can use the gradient to adjust the q t to obtain the optimal q t how to adjust the q t will be described in section 2 4 the eq 9 leads to the pollutant transport model eq 1 2 3 numerical scheme the pollutant transport model eq 1 as well as the adjoint eq 10 will be solved by the implicit finite difference scheme in section 2 2 the release of the pollutant is a continuous function of time however we usually discretize the continuous release curve into a series of small duration releases under this condition eq 12 can be written as 13 j q t i c q t i 1 δt t i t i δt λ x 0 t dt where δt is the value of the small duration q t i is the release rate during the ith small duration i 1 2 3 n n is the number of small durations this integration can be solved by using the trapezoidal rule 2 4 control variables optimization scheme in section 2 3 we get the gradient of the cost function with respect to q q q t1 q t2 q t n tby the eq 13 then iterative optimization algorithms need to be used to adjust the initial estimate of q the formula for adjusting q is defined as 14 q k 1 q k α k d k where q k is the release rates q in the kth iteration d k is the adjustment direction for q k α k is the optimal adjustment step size to obtain the adjustment direction d k the conjugate gradient algorithm fletcher 1964 is adopted in this paper if we define 15 g k j q k j q t 1 j q t 2 j q t n k t where g k denotes the gradient of the cost function j with respect to q k then the adjustment direction for q k can be defined as 16 d k 1 g k g k 1 2 g k 2 d k d 1 g 1 where g 1 is the gradient of j with respect to q 1 q 1 is the initial estimate of q g k means the norm of g k now we have the adjustment direction of the control variables q k we still need the optimal adjustment step size this problem can be described by the mathematical language as 17 j q k α k d k min α 0 j q k α d k α is the only variable in the eq 17 for q k and d k are known at this point line search algorithms need to be used to obtain the optimal adjustment step size α k wolfe powell conditions powell 1975 are adopted in this paper they can be written as 18 j q k α k d k j q k ρα k g k t d k g k 1 t d k σ g k t d k 0 ρ σ 1 where ρ and σ are given as constants before computing in this paper ρ 0 1 σ 0 5 then an inexact one dimensional line search algorithm under the wolfe powell conditions can be given as 2 4 1 the wolfe powell line search algorithm a give the adjustment step size search range 0 α max give constants ρ 0 1 σ 0 5 set α 1 0 α 2 α max φ 1 j q k φ 1 g k t d k give α α 1 α 2 b compute the φ φ α j q k α d k if φ φ 1 ραφ 1 the first equation of eq 18 go to c else compute the α by 19 α α 1 α α 1 2 1 φ 1 φ α α 1 φ 1 then set α 2 α α α go to b c compute φ φ α g k 1 t d k if φ σφ 1 the second equation of eq 18 set α k α output the α k and stop else compute the α by eq 19 then set α 1 α φ 1 φ φ 1 φ α α go to b now that we have obtained d k andα k then the eq 14 can be used to adjust q k 2 5 the procedure of vaim following we summarize the method step 0 set k 1 give the initial estimate of release rate q k step 1 use q k to obtain model simulations by the eq 1 and the eq 4 then calculate the cost function j k by eq 5 for k 2 if j k 1 j k j k 1 1 e 3 stop step 2 obtain the gradient g k of the cost function j k with respect to q kby eqs 10 11 and 13 then obtain the adjustment direction d k by eq 16 step 3 obtain the optimal adjustment step size α k by the wolfe powell line search algorithm step 4 adjust the control variable q k by eq 14 note that if q ti 0 then q ti 0 i 1 2 n then set k k 1 go to step 1 3 the synthetic case 3 1 uniform flow case 3 1 1 case description synthetic cases are used to test the performance of the vaim in the release estimation problem in rivers supposing an accidental release of the pollutant occurs from a plant at a known location with coordinates 400 m upstream of a straight river with the length of 1000 m there are four measurement points cs1 cs2 cs3 cs4 downstream of the river with coordinates 520 m 657 m 756 m 940 m respectively see fig 1 the simulated current field of this river is steady with the water flow of 0 54 m3 s the flow velocity of 0 57 m s the dispersion coefficient of 1 76 m2 s and the first order decay coefficient of 0 s 1 the pollutant transport model and the adjoint equation are simulated by the implicit finite difference scheme with the spatial step of 1 m temporal step of 1 s number of space steps of 1000 and number of time steps of 1800 the release function of the pollutant is given by a sinusoidal curve eq 20 20 q t i 10 sin π 10 t i 1 i 1 2 11 0 i 11 where i is the ith small duration i 1 2 11 the small duration δt is 1 min observations of the pollutant in this synthetic case are obtained by simulating the pollutant transport model then the vaim is applied to this synthetic case to evaluate the effect of the observational error and the effect of initial estimates for release rates to release estimation results some statistics are used for evaluating model performances the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the root mean square error rmse are evaluation index for the fitting degree between the original release and the estimated release as well as for the fitting degree of the pollutant concentration between observations and simulations of estimated release the relative error is the index for the difference between the total release mass of the original release and the estimated release 3 1 2 the effect of observational error observations are usually accompanied by the error and error will inevitably affect the result of the release estimation therefore the effect of the observation error to release estimation results is evaluated in this synthetic case after obtaining observations by simulating the pollutant transport model we add the data noise into the observations data noise is added as follow cheng and jia 2010 jing et al 2020 21 c obs c sim rc sim where c sim is the concentration simulations r is the random number between the given range for example 0 05 and 0 05 for 5 noise following a gaussian distribution c obs is the observation used in the synthetic case in this paper 5 10 15 and 20 noise are considered observations with different noise are plotted in fig 2 then vaim is applied to this synthetic case to investigate the effect of the error in observation results are described in figs 3 4 and 5 fig 3 show estimated releases under different data noise we can find that estimated releases fluctuate around the original release moreover amplitude of the fluctuation increases with the observation error fig 4 gives comparisons of the original release and estimated releases under different data noise this figure indicates that nse between the two sequences decreases with the increase of the observation error although the observation error is 20 nse is still greater than 0 95 which suggests a good fitness between the original release and the estimated release comparison of simulation concentration and observation concentration at four measurement points is shown in fig 5 and the similar law to fig 3 is found in this figure from table 1 we can find that the total release mass difference between the original release and the estimated release grows as the expanding of the observation error as above we can conclude that results of estimated releases by vaim will deteriorate with the rise of the observation error results are still reliable even if error is 20 3 1 3 the effect of initial estimates for release rates in the iteration initial estimates for release rates in the iteration may affect the result in this section the effect of initial estimates to the release estimation result by vaim is conducted case conditions are described in section 3 1 1 and 20 noise in observation is adopted run the vaim model repeatedly to get the output of the model when initial estimates for release rates in the iteration are given as 1 q 1 0 0 0 2 q 1 5 5 5 3 q 1 10 10 10 4 q 1 15 15 15 5 q 1 20 20 20 results are given in fig 6 in fig 6 we can find that estimated releases under different initial estimates are similar to each other fig 7 gives comparisons of the original release and estimated releases although there are differences in estimated releases nses of all the results are greater than 0 95 fig 8 is the comparison of the simulation concentration and the observation concentration at four measurement points table 1 shows that the relative errors of estimated releases are at the same level and this suggests that initial estimates in the iteration almost have no effect to the total release mass estimation according to the above analysis we can draw a conclusion that although the initial estimate does have effect to the release estimation result this effect is slight and negligible this means that estimated releases obtained by vaim under different initial estimates are all reliable the slight effect may be caused by rounding error in the iterative process 3 2 non uniform flow case for the purpose of further demonstrating the advantages of this model a synthetic case study with real world river topography is used in this section this river named xiangxi river a tributary of the yangtze river located in hubei province china as shown in fig 9 this is a river with strong spatial variability for large variation in flow area along the flow direction therefore the analytical solution for pollutant transport in our previous study jing et al 2020 is not applicable in this scenario topographic data of this river is given in fig 9 c the flow discharge of the study period of this river is assumed to be 500 m3 s which is regarded as the upstream boundary there is the three gorges dam downstream the yangtze river due to the proximity of the xiangxi river to the yangtze river section where the three gorges dam is located the water level of the xiangxi river is affected by the opening of the gates of the three gorges dam in this synthetic case for ease of calculation it is assumed that the downstream boundary water level is 120 m elevations are based on the national height datum 1985 he et al 2016 at a certain opening of the three gorges dam gates roughness coefficient of this river is 0 03 the calibration longitudinal dispersion coefficient is 1 73 m2 s a total of 87 river cross sections were intercepted at 50 m intervals based on the measured topographic scatter data of the xiangxi river fig 10 shows the typical cross section of the xiangxi river according to these river cross sections upstream boundary and downstream boundary we can get the flow field after the calculation of the saint venant equations eq 2 fig 9 d shows the longitudinal profile of cross section area for xiangxi river under the above condition the potential pollution source is located in 200 m in fig 9 c the release discharge is 1 m3 s which is is negligible compared to the flow discharge 500 m3 s of the study period of this river release concentration of this pollution source is given in table 2 there are three concentration measurement sites located in 1000 m 1500 m 2000 m after the simulation of eq 1 we can get the pollutant concentration simulations at three sites following the same way as the section 3 1 we added 10 data noise to concentration simulations then we obtained the pollutant concentration measurements which are given in fig 11 estimation results of this synthetic case study are shown in fig 12 fig 12 b shows good agreement between concentration simulations and concentration observations fig 12 a shows that estimated release fluctuates up and down from actual release the estimated release rate tends to be large in the middle and small on both sides even though the actual release rate is constant the relative error of the total release mass for the estimated is 3 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient should vary along the river in real world river however it is given as a constant in this synthetic case therefore it is necessary to study the sensitivity of pollution source release estimation result with respect to it to study estimation sensitivity with respect to the coupling of measurement errors and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient uncertainty we firstly assume that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of this study river obeys a normal distribution n 1 73 0 5 which is given in fig 13 the red line then we use the latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 to sample from this distribution the ensemble size 100 of longitudinal dispersion coefficient is given in fig 13 the blue columns in this paper lhs is performed by matlab function lhsnorm m next we use the observations with data noise and the longitudinal dispersion coefficients obtained from the sampling to estimate the source release finally we extract the statistical information of the result ensemble such as the mean and variance to analyze the impact of the uncertainty in the longitudinal dispersion coefficients on the estimation results joint distribution of longitudinal dispersion coefficient and relative error of estimated total mass is given in fig 14 from this figure we can find that relative error of estimated total mass increases as the deviation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient from its true value increases under the condition of 15 observation error and a normal distribution n 1 74 0 69 for longitudinal dispersion coefficient the relative error of estimated total mass is almost within the 10 interval the mean relative error of estimated total mass is 3 which is a very good result 4 the real case 4 1 case description a tracer experiment is used as a case study to investigate the performance of the vaim in practical applications this tracer experiment is the experiment 24 one of the tracer experiments performed on the murray burn which is a small river through the heriot watt university campus ani et al 2009 the tracer used for this experiment is the rhodamine wt which is considered as a conservative tracer in this paper the tracer with known mass 250 mg is injected instantaneously discharged into the middle of the stream and the monitoring of concentration in time is performed downstream of the source at four sites cs1 cs2 cs3 cs4 it is assumed that the tracer is released into the stream at a constant rate of 4 17 mg s 250 mg in total in 1 min during a small duration 1 min the flow rate of murray burn at that time is 0 535m3 s tracer injection site and monitoring sites divide the river into four reaches physical characteristics ani et al 2009 of each reach for the numerical model are given in table 3 4 2 result observations obtained by four monitoring sites piotrowski 2007 are used in vaim model the model is integrated for 1680 s with a time step of 1 s the space domain is 1000 m with the space step of 1 m the small duration δt is 1 min initial estimate for the real release is q 1 0 0 0 the variation of the cost function the total release of pollutant with the number of the iteration are plotted in fig 15 a the cost function reduces to about 10 of its initial value after 4 iterations and then it reaches a steady state correspondingly the total release mass starts from 0 and reaches a stable state after 4 iterations fig 15 b is the comparison of real release and the estimated release the estimated release agrees well with the real release which confirmed that the release history of this tracer experiment is successfully recovered by the vaim model the estimated release rate in the first minute is 4 22 mg s a little overestimated than the real condition 4 17 mg s the retrieved release rates for other periods are at the magnitude of 10 8 mg s which are negligible the total retrieved release is 253 mg 1 2 higher than the real value 250 mg this result is better than the result of zhang s work zhang and huang 2017 fig 15 c shows the comparison of breakthrough curves between the observations and the model simulations by the vaim model the peak of the two breakthrough curves and the time of reaching the peak agree well indicating a perfect simulation of the vaim however there are slight differences between these two breakthrough curve profiles these differences may be caused by the inaccurate dispersion coefficient fig 15 d illustrates these differences in details points composed of observations and simulations are evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line the nse value is 0 885 close to 0 9 indicating a good performance of the vaim 5 discussion this paper developed a variational analysis inverse model based on the implicit finite difference method of the one dimensional advection dispersion model to estimation the temporal release of the pollutant in river compared to our previous study jing et al 2020 this model has the following advancements 1 since this model adopt the numerical solution rather than an analytical solution it can be used in real world river system which has the the strong spatial variability 2 this model can obtain the time varying release process of the river pollutant rather than the simple uniform emission or instantaneous release 3 the flow discharge and the flow area of river cross section obtained by saint venant equations the longitudinal dispersion coefficient obtained by some empirical formulas fisher 1968 seo and cheong 1998 are used in this model rather than the mean flow velocity and the mean longitudinal dispersion coefficient of course the new model has its own conditions of application known hydrodynamic parameters of the river flow discharge flow area and longitudinal dispersion coefficients known release location of the pollutant source there are some limitations or deficiencies in this paper firstly the pollutant transport model adopted in this study is the one dimensional advection dispersion model the two dimensional model and the influence of vegetation and dead zone model are not covered in this paper secondly the flow velocity and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient used in the real case are constants rather than considering the uncertainty of them however vaim has the potential to consider velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficients as control variables optimize them along with the release history thus it will be conducted in our future studies despite of these limitations and deficiencies results of synthetic cases and the real case give us the confidence for the vaim in practice 6 conclusion in this paper a new deterministic algorithm model called vaim based on the variational data assimilation is proposed to recover the release history of the pollutant source the proposed vaim model can use all the data in the study period to obtain the global optimal solution which may play a very important role in the field of the pollutant release estimation problem in the future for its ability to process big data detailed analysis of the performance for vaim under conditions we are concerned is conducted by using some synthetic cases and a real case firstly the effect of observation error is evaluated results show that the estimated release by the vaim will deteriorate with the increase of data error even if the observation error reach to 20 nse between original release and the estimated release is still higher than 0 95 meanwhile the relative error of the total release mass between the estimated release and the original release is lower than 1 5 secondly the effect of the initial estimate for the release rates in the iteration is evaluated results show that although there are differences among estimated releases under different initial estimates the statistics evaluation index suggests that differences are slight nses between the original release and estimated releases are all higher than 0 95 correspondingly relative errors of total release mass between estimated releases and the original release are all at the level of 1 5 these statistics indexes suggest reliable results of estimated releases by vaim under different initial estimates for the release rates in the iteration a synthetic case study with real world river topography and its sensitivity analysis shows vaim s superiority in natural river case a tracer experiment is used as a real case to evaluate the performance for vaim in practice total release mass of retrieved release is 1 2 higher than that of the real release suggesting the good performance of the vaim in practical applications vaim s ability to process all the data in the whole study period and its good performance make it a potential model in the pollutant release estimation problem we will use the vaim in the next step to optimize the flow velocity the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the release rate at the same time to eliminate the uncertainty of these two parameters vaim also can be used in the field of the pollution control which may be another study of us in the future

1291,field deployed lysimeters were used to measure the concentrations of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in soil porewater at a site historically impacted with aqueous film forming foam afff samples collected over a 49 day period showed that perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs were the pfass with the highest concentrations in porewater with concentrations of approximately 10 000 and 25 000 ng l 1 respectively the corresponding average mass flux to underlying groundwater observed for pfos and pfhxs was 28 000 11 000 and 92 000 32 000 ng m 2 d 1 respectively employing the use of batch desorption isotherms soil water slurries to determine desorption kd values resulted in an overestimation of pfas porewater concentrations by a factor for 1 4 to 4 however using the desorption kd values from the batch desorption isotherms in combination with a pfas mass balance that incorporated pfas sorption at the air water interface resulted in improved predictions of the pfas porewater concentrations this improvement was most notable for pfos where inclusion of air water interfacial sorption resulted in a 58 reduction in the predicted pfos porewater concentration and predicted pfos porewater concentrations that were identical within the 95 confidence interval to the lysimeter measured pfos porewater concentration overall these results highlight

demonstrated significant vertical pfos attenuation with estimated pfos retardation factors through the unsaturated zone ranging from 16 to 42 both of these studies demonstrate substantial retention of

anderson 2021 demonstrating and quantifying the role of air water interfacial sorption on pfas migration at the field scale is a high priority for advancing mechanistic understanding and supporting

validated at the bench scale lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019b and to demonstrate the role of air water interfacial sorption on pfas porewater concentrations and ultimately pfas mass flux to groundwater 2 methods 2 1 test site an afff impacted site in the northeastern united state that was used for foam formulation testing not actual firefighting with fuels was selected for testing the depth to water at the site typically ranges from approximately 1 8 to 2 7 m below ground surface bgs as previously described schaefer et al 2021 unsaturated soil cores from this site were collected for laboratory testing in january 2019 approximately 22 years after the last known afff application these soil cores were used to determine pfas concentration at the site and to determine pfas desorption isotherms pfas soil properties are provided in table s1 soil pfas concentrations have been previously reported schaefer et al 2022 for the shallow homogenized interval from 0 03 to 0 9 m below ground surface and for the deep homogenized interval from 0 9 to 2 4 m below ground surface these data are provided in table s2 approximately 1 5 years after these soil cores were collected a network of lysimeters were installed to facilitate in situ porewater collection lysimeters were installed in a 4 3 m 4 3 m area of undisturbed soil referred to as the test cell that was hydraulically isolated using sheet piling several ceramic porous cup suction lysimeters were installed along with electrical resistance based moisture probes at various depths within the vadose zone the test cell and lysimeters are shown in fig s1 fig 1 details the installed sampling equipment and instrumentation lysimeter depths are summarized in table 1 a conceptual cross section also is provided in fig s2 porous cup suction lysimeters were purchased from soil moisture equipment corp goleta ca the lysimeters used were constructed of pvc and had a diameter of 4 8 cm the ceramic porous cup was 3 8 cm long with a 2 bar bubbling pressure lysimeter lengths ranged from 0 3 m to1 5 m lysimeters were installed using hand augers a silica flour 200 mesh slurry was used in the lysimeter boreholes such that the annular space was filled with the silica flour several centimeters above the porous cup a few centimeters of coarse sand was layered on top of the silica flour and the remaining annular space was filled with medium size bentonite chips to the ground surface lysimeters were connected to a vacuum manifold system for sample collection a bromide tracer was included with the silica flour slurry after collecting an initial round of porewater samples to flush the system the initial round of samples for pfas analysis was collected this initial round of samples for pfas analysis also was analyzed for bromide these measured bromide concentrations were less than 10 of initial bromide concentrations indicating that the water captured in the lysimeters was representative of natural porewater that was not artificially diluted by the slurry water parallel laboratory testing with both the lysimeters and silica fluor showed that pfos sorption to the silica flour and lysimeter was negligible moisture probes pr2 6 probes manufactured by delta t devices were installed at 3 locations within the test cell the moisture probes contained multiple sensors along the vertical length of the probe that allowed for measurement of electrical potential at depths of 20 30 60 and 100 cm a rain gauge also was installed at the test site a monitoring well located in the center of the test cell was used to ensure that the water table remained below the deepest installed lysimeters 2 2 monitoring and analyses lysimeter sampling occurred using a vacuum manifold system where a vacuum of approximately 30 to 45 cb was applied over a set time interval of approximately 18 h to 5 days for each sampling event as described in the installation details purging of the initial porewater collected within each lysimeter was performed to ensure that pfas concentrations measured in the collected samples were representative of porewater and not moisture added during the lysimeter installation three rounds of sampling were performed over a 49 day period july 15 2020 to september 2 2020 where the 11 lysimeters shown in table 1 were sampled samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles for each lysimeter within the manifold system collected porewater volumes in each glass bottle typically ranged from 5 to 300 ml per sampling event collected lysimeter porewater samples were transferred to 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes for pfas analysis select samples were also analyzed for total organic carbon toc via combustion analysis ph and electrical conductivity pfas analyses on the collected aqueous porewater samples was performed using an agilent 1260 series hplc santa clara ca and a sciex qtof x500r framingham ma using positive and negative mode electrospray ionization for analysis of cationic zwitterionic and anionic zwitterionic compounds respectively via orthogonal chromatography as previously described in barzen hanson and field 2015 additional details of the pfas analyses including screening and semiquantitation of suspect analytes are described in the supplemental materials and table s3 2 3 bench scale testing to measure pfas sorption at the air water interface laboratory bench scale batch experiments were performed to determine values of the air water interfacial partition coefficient kaw cm for pfos pfhps and pfoa values of kaw were directly measured using porewater collected from the lysimeters using the film method described in detail in schaefer et al 2019 briefly this method entails filling a 25 cm diameter hdpe pan with approximately 2 2 l of the collected porewater allowing 3 days of equilibration draining the bulk water while collecting a sample of this bulk water for pfas analysis and collecting the film of water remaining in the pan approximately 0 15 l for pfas analysis pfos pfhps and pfoa concentrations measured in the bulk porewater sample collected were 9800 310 and 400 ng l 1 respectively applying a mass balance and knowing the geometric surface area of the air water interface in the film residing in the pan the pfas mass per unit area at the air water interface β in units of ng cm 2 was determined kaw was then calculated as β divided by the bulk water concentration this experiment was performed in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample collection and porewater characteristics the porewater saturations s in cm3 per cm3 and the three lysimeter temporal sampling intervals over which porewater was collected are shown in fig 2 corresponding cumulative precipitation is shown in fig s3 porewater toc conductivity and ph levels are summarized in table s4 no significant correlation p 0 05 between pfas concentrations and the geochemical parameters in table s4 was observed porewater samples were collected during a precipitation event or within 3 days of a precipitation event in all cases evidence of water flux through the vadose zone was noted during sample collection by decreases in soil moisture as a function of time it is unclear why a saturation reading of approximately 1 5 was measured at smp 2 60 cm during a severe storm event on august 11 2020 the water flux thorough the test cell was conservatively estimated for the well drained sandy soils at the site by assuming it was equal to the rainfall flux as shown in fig 2b 0 18 m of rainfall occurred over the 49 day monitoring period resulting in an average water flux of 3 8 10 3 m d 1 through the test cell 3 2 pfas porewater concentrations and mass flux detected pfas concentrations measured at each lysimeter for each of the 3 sampling events are presented in table s5 average pfas concentrations over all 3 sampling events measured among the 5 lysimeters at a depth of 0 61 m bgs and also among the 4 lysimeters at a depth of 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs are shown in fig 3 lysimeters l 2 and l 8 installed at the very shallow depth below ground surface of 0 15 m were not included in fig 3 because the shallow depth coupled with rapid water infiltration into the sandy soil likely resulted in pfas porewater concetnations that were not representative of equilibrium conditions and pfas porewaters impacting underlying groundwater average pfas concentrations in l 2 and l 8 over the 3 sampling events were approximately 4 standard deviations greater than the mean calculated among the deeper lysimeters shown in fig 3 suggesting these data were outliers compared to the lysimeter data measured at depths of 0 61 m and 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs for example the average pfos concentration at 0 15 m over the 3 sampling events was 45 000 25 000 ng l 1 which is more than 4 times greater than that measured in the deeper lysimeters shown in fig 3 in addition lysimeter l 5 from the first round of sampling was excluded because only a very limited volume of porewater 6 5 cm3 of porewater versus 60 cm3 for all other lysimeters had been initially flushed through this lysimeter prior to and including porewater collection associated with the first sampling event pfas concentrations in l 5 at the first sampling event were 5 times lower than the average observed among the other lysimeters the subsequent round of sampling in l 5 yielded greater than 200 cm3 of porewater finally for l 1 several pfas results for the second and third rounds of sampling including results for pfos pfhps and pfoa were excluded from the averages shown in fig 3 because measured pfas concentrations were at least 3 standard deviations greater than then average calculated among the other lysimeters for most of the pfass detected overall with these exceptions results show that pfas concentrations measured in the porewater at depths of at least 0 61 m bgs were generally repeatable among the lysimeters and over the 3 sampling events as indicated by 95 confidence intervals that were typically less than 50 of the average for the shallow 0 61 m bgs lysimeters and less than 40 of the average for the deep 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs lysimeters results show that the pfas concentrations measured in the shallow lysimeters located at 0 61 m bgs were typically statistically identical overlapping 95 confidence intervals to those measured at 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs indicating that pfas concentrations were at an apparent equilibrium in the percolating porewater within the interrogated depth interval of the vadose zone i e pfas concentrations in porewater were not changing with depth thus despite the comparatively higher organic carbon and pfas concentrations associated with the shallow soil tables s1 and s2 pfas concentrations in the porewater were in local equilibrium with the soil throughout the interrogated interval this apparent local equilibrium suggests that independently determined equilibrium partitioning parameters may be useful for predicting pfas porewater concentrations as discussed in the following section pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs were the pfass that showed the highest average porewater concentrations in fig 3 of approximately 10 000 and 25 000 ng l 1 respectively for the depths of 0 61 m and 1 2 1 5 m pfos and pfhxs were also the pfass that had the highest concentrations in the soil table s2 the perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa mass flux through the test cell during the 49 day monitoring period is shown in table 2 extrapolated over the course of a year the total mass of pfaas leached from the unsaturated soil within a year would be 1 3 0 43 g based on pfaa soil concentrations measured within the test cell table s2 this total annually leached pfaa mass represents only 2 of the total pfas mass present in the unsaturated zone these results suggest that pfaas will persist in the unsaturated soils for decades to come although it is currently unclear how pfaa mass flux will diminish over time due to thermodynamic and or kinetic limitations sporadic 35 of lysimeter samples detections of perfluorohexane sulfonamide fhxsa were observed but results were typically below the analytical method quantification limit of 2000 ng l 1 which was much greater than the 200 ng l 1 method quantification limit for most pfaas when detected fhxsa concentrations ranged from 5000 to 10 000 ng l 1 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 fts was only sporadically detected during the first 2 sampling events but was measured at an average concentration of approximately 2000 ng l 1 in the third round it is currently unclear why these two compounds were not detected on a more consistent level no suspect pfas analytes were detected in the porewater though this is likely due to the high degree of dilution required for aqueous analysis due to the high pfhxs and pfos levels 3 3 pfas mass balance and role of the air water interface results of the film experiments yielded kaw values of 0 18 0 029 cm 0 071 0 061 cm 0 064 0 048 cm for pfos pfhps and pfoa respectively average 95 confidence intervals provided the elevated kaw values for pfos are expected due to its increased perfluorinated chain length relative to pfhps and pfoa schaefer et al 2019 kaw values for the other pfass present in porewater were below that which could be measured using the film method the ionic strength of the porewater solution based on the average conductivity value shown in table s4 was 0 01 m fig 4 shows the measured pfos porewater kaw value compared to kaw values previously measured in electrolyte solutions all using the previously described film method except where noted the pfos kaw measured in the porewater 0 18 0 029 cm is identical to that measured in electrolyte in 0 01 m nacl 0 18 0 008 cm by schaefer et al 2019 suggesting that the porewater constituents i e total organic carbon other pfass did not have a substantial impact on pfos interfacial sorption for the porewater examined in this study in response to a recent study that suggests the film method may overpredict kaw values for pfas le et al 2021 fig 4 also shows results of a measured pfos kaw value in a 0 003 m nacl solution that was determined herein using the garrett metal screen method garrett 1965 daumas et al 1976 agogué et al 2004 details of this method are provided in the supplemental materials the consistency between the garrett metal screen method and the film method data coupled with the associated model shown in fig 4 suggests that the film method is in fact appropriate for determining kaw values for pfos fig 5 shows the average pfas porewater concentrations average of values shown in fig 3 compared to predicted values of the pfas porewater concentrations only pfass that were both consistently detected in the lysimeters samples fig 3 and also shown to be at equilibrium in the batch kinetic desorption testing schaefer et al 2021 were evaluated predicted pfas porewater concentrations are based conceptually on the pfas mass balance model developed by brusseau et al 2019b which considers pfas distribution among the soil aqueous phase and air water interface the application of the model is based on two key parameters a desorption kd value to describe pfas soil water partitioning and a pfas interfacial partition coefficient kaw to describe pfas partitioning to the air water interface the following 3 equations were used to describe pfas phase behavior among the soil aqueous and air water interfacial phases in a 10 g unit mass of shallow soil 50 saturation based on moisture probe and soil moisture data 1 k aw β c 2 k d c s b c 3 m t mass at interface mass in soil vβ a aw c s m where c is the aqueous concentration ng cm 3 cs is the sorbed soil concentration ng kg 1 mt is the total pfas mass used in a 10 10 3 kg mass of soil ng determined on a dry soil basis by multiplying the total pfas concentrations in the collected soil shown in table s2 by the 10 10 3 kg of dry soil v is the in situ soil bed volume associated with the 10 10 3 kg of dry soil 6 1 cm3 estimated assuming a dry bulk density of 1 65 g cm 3 aaw is the air water interfacial area per soil bed volume cm2 per cm3 and m is the mass of dry soil 10 10 3 kg desorption isotherms using the shallow soil described herein were previously determined using a sequential batch dilution technique to determine kd pfas soil sorption coefficient in l kg 1 and b the y intercept associated with the linear desorption isotherm in l kg 1 schaefer et al 2022 these values are provided in table 3 it is noted that eq 3 neglects the mass contribution from the aqueous phase based on the measured soil concentration and pfas porewater concentrations the pfas mass in the water accounts for less than 1 of the total mass thus justifying this simplification based on the amount of rainfall between soil collection and the time lysimeter sampling was initiated approximately 142 cm of rainfall over 18 months based on weather station data and using the leachate concentrations in fig 3 the mass of pfos and pfhps leached from the soil between the time of soil collection and the beginning of the lysimeter sample collection 18 months later is estimated at less than 1 and 2 of their mass present in the saturated zone respectively thus this small amount of mass removal was considered negligible for the model for pfoa using this same approach the mass removal over this 18 month period is estimated at 15 to account for this mt for pfoa in eqs 2 and 3 was decreased by 15 to provide a more appropriate value for the model the value for aaw was determined based on the average soil grain size using the following equation lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 4 a aw 3 9 d 1 2 1 s where d is the mean particle diameter of the shallow soil 0 04 cm and s is the pore saturation of the soil during lysimeter sample collection estimated at 0 5 cm3 cm 3 based on moisture probe data the resulting value for aaw is 93 cm 1 a discussion of the error associated with the model predictions is provided in the supplemental materials as depicted in fig 5 if pfas sorption to the air water interface is not considered the predicted pfas porewater concentrations are 1 4 to 4 times greater than the pfas concentrations measured in porewater pfos shows the greatest discrepancy in aqueous concentration between the lysimeter based and batch desorption based results among the pfass examined pfos is the most surface active among the three pfass shown in fig 5 costanza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 these observations suggest the possibility that the discrepancy between lysimeter and batch desorption results is due to pfas accumulation at air water interfaces which are present in the unsaturated soils within the test cell fig 5 also shows that including pfas retention at the air water interface results in a substantial improvement in the prediction of pfas porewater concentrations most notably for pfos where a 58 reduction in the predicted porewater concentration was observed when considering uptake at the air water interface the predicted porewater pfos concentration is within the 95 confidence interval of the measured pfos porewater concentration pfos showed a much greater measured interfacial partition coefficient kaw 0 18 cm than pfhps 0 071 cm and pfoa 0 064 cm in porewater thus inclusion of air water interfacial sorption expectedly had the most notable effect on pfos for pfhps inclusion of air water interfacial sorption also resulted in a predicted value that was within the 95 confidence interval of the measured porewater value whereas exclusion of air water interfacial sorption resulted in a significant overprediction of the measure porewater value for pfoa the relatively large uncertainty associated with the soil water partitioning kd value limited the ability to conclusively assess any improvement in porewater prediction by including sorption at the air water interface together these measured values and calculations provide a line of evidence for the relevance of pfas air water interfacial sorption in situ to our knowledge these are the first field data that demonstrate the impact of pfas air water interfacial sorption on pfas leaching thereby validating bench scale studies that suggest air water interfacial sorption is an important mechanism to consider at afff impacted sites while particularly for pfos and pfhps inclusion of the air water interfacial sorption resulted in improved predictions of in situ porewater concentration it is possible that factors besides sorption at the air water interface could have played a role in the overpredictions shown in fig 5 these factors include flow heterogeneity and other mass transfer limitations however given the similarity in pfas concentrations between the shallow and deep lysimeters which suggests mass transfer effects were limited as well as the fact that the most surface active compound examined pfos showed the greatest improvement when the model included interfacial sorption it is likely that air water interfacial sorption was the primary factor responsible for the discrepancy between the measured porewater values and the kd only partitioning model shown in fig 5 additional studies at a variety of sites are needed to further validate the role of interfacial sorption on pfas concentrations in porewater 3 4 environmental implications results presented herein show that pfas mass flux to underlying groundwater is likely being reduced by 1 5 to 4 times for pfos pfhxs and pfoa due to accumulation at the air water interface as highlighted by the impact of air water retention on pfas porewater concentrations thus consistent with previously performed unsaturated column experiments e g lyu et al 2018 air water interfacial uptake plays an important role in pfas transport through the unsaturated zone while the overall pfas mass flux from the afff impacted soils remains largely controlled by desorption from the soil accounting for pfas accumulation at the air water interface is required to estimate overall pfas mass flux further study is needed to more closely examine the impacts of variable saturation and water flux on pfas mass flux through the vadose zone further study also is needed to assess pfas mass flux under differing soil hydraulic and pfas

1291,field deployed lysimeters were used to measure the concentrations of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in soil porewater at a site historically impacted with aqueous film forming foam afff samples collected over a 49 day period showed that perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs were the pfass with the highest concentrations in porewater with concentrations of approximately 10 000 and 25 000 ng l 1 respectively the corresponding average mass flux to underlying groundwater observed for pfos and pfhxs was 28 000 11 000 and 92 000 32 000 ng m 2 d 1 respectively employing the use of batch desorption isotherms soil water slurries to determine desorption kd values resulted in an overestimation of pfas porewater concentrations by a factor for 1 4 to 4 however using the desorption kd values from the batch desorption isotherms in combination with a pfas mass balance that incorporated pfas sorption at the air water interface resulted in improved predictions of the pfas porewater concentrations this improvement was most notable for pfos where inclusion of air water interfacial sorption resulted in a 58 reduction in the predicted pfos porewater concentration and predicted pfos porewater concentrations that were identical within the 95 confidence interval to the lysimeter measured pfos porewater concentration overall these results highlight

approximately 30 to 45 cb was applied over a set time interval of approximately 18 h to 5 days for each sampling event as described in the installation details purging of the initial porewater collected within each lysimeter was performed to ensure that pfas concentrations measured in the collected samples were representative of porewater and not moisture added during the lysimeter installation three rounds of sampling were performed over a 49 day period july 15 2020 to september 2 2020 where the 11 lysimeters shown in table 1 were sampled samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles for each lysimeter within the manifold system collected porewater volumes in each glass bottle typically ranged from 5 to 300 ml per sampling event collected lysimeter porewater samples were transferred to 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes for pfas analysis select samples were also analyzed for total organic carbon toc via combustion analysis ph and electrical conductivity pfas analyses on the collected aqueous porewater samples was performed using an agilent 1260 series hplc santa clara ca and a sciex qtof x500r framingham ma using positive and negative mode electrospray ionization for analysis of cationic zwitterionic and anionic zwitterionic compounds respectively via orthogonal chromatography as previously described in barzen hanson and field 2015 additional details of the pfas analyses including screening and semiquantitation of suspect analytes are described in the supplemental materials and table s3 2 3 bench scale testing to measure pfas sorption at the air water interface laboratory bench scale batch experiments were performed to determine values of the air water interfacial partition coefficient kaw cm for pfos pfhps and pfoa values of kaw were directly measured using porewater collected from the lysimeters using the film method described in detail in schaefer et al 2019 briefly this method entails filling a 25 cm diameter hdpe pan with approximately 2 2 l of the collected porewater allowing 3 days of equilibration draining the bulk water while collecting a sample of this bulk water for pfas analysis and collecting the film of water remaining in the pan approximately 0 15 l for pfas analysis pfos pfhps and pfoa concentrations measured in the bulk porewater sample collected were 9800 310 and 400 ng l 1 respectively applying a mass balance and knowing the geometric surface area of the air water interface in the film residing in the pan the pfas mass per unit area at the air water interface β in units of ng cm 2 was determined kaw was then calculated as β divided by the bulk water concentration this experiment was performed in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample collection and porewater characteristics the porewater saturations s in cm3 per cm3 and the three lysimeter temporal sampling intervals over which porewater was collected are shown in fig 2 corresponding cumulative precipitation is shown in fig s3 porewater toc conductivity and ph levels are summarized in table s4 no significant correlation p 0 05 between pfas concentrations and the geochemical parameters in table s4 was observed porewater samples were collected during a precipitation event or within 3 days of a precipitation event in all cases evidence of water flux through the vadose zone was noted during sample collection by decreases in soil moisture as a function of time it is unclear why a saturation reading of approximately 1 5 was measured at smp 2 60 cm during a severe storm event on august 11 2020 the water flux thorough the test cell was conservatively estimated for the well drained sandy soils at the site by assuming it was equal to the rainfall flux as shown in fig 2b 0 18 m of rainfall occurred over the 49 day monitoring period resulting in an average water flux of 3 8 10 3 m d 1 through the test cell 3 2 pfas porewater concentrations and mass flux detected pfas concentrations measured at each lysimeter for each of the 3 sampling events are presented in table s5 average pfas concentrations over all 3 sampling events measured among the 5 lysimeters at a depth of 0 61 m bgs and also among the 4 lysimeters at a depth of 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs are shown in fig 3 lysimeters l 2 and l 8 installed at the very shallow depth below ground surface of 0 15 m were not included in fig 3 because the shallow depth coupled with rapid water infiltration into the sandy soil likely resulted in pfas porewater concetnations that were not representative of equilibrium conditions and pfas porewaters impacting underlying groundwater average pfas concentrations in l 2 and l 8 over the 3 sampling events were approximately 4 standard deviations greater than the mean calculated among the deeper lysimeters shown in fig 3 suggesting these data were outliers compared to the lysimeter data measured at depths of 0 61 m and 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs for example the average pfos concentration at 0 15 m over the 3 sampling events was 45 000 25 000 ng l 1 which is more than 4 times greater than that measured in the deeper lysimeters shown in fig 3 in addition lysimeter l 5 from the first round of sampling was excluded because only a very limited volume of porewater 6 5 cm3 of porewater versus 60 cm3 for all other lysimeters had been initially flushed through this lysimeter prior to and including porewater collection associated with the first sampling event pfas concentrations in l 5 at the first sampling event were 5 times lower than the average observed among the other lysimeters the subsequent round of sampling in l 5 yielded greater than 200 cm3 of porewater finally for l 1 several pfas results for the second and third rounds of sampling including results for pfos pfhps and pfoa were excluded from the averages shown in fig 3 because measured pfas concentrations were at least 3 standard deviations greater than then average calculated among the other lysimeters for most of the pfass detected overall with these exceptions results show that pfas concentrations measured in the porewater at depths of at least 0 61 m bgs were generally repeatable among the lysimeters and over the 3 sampling events as indicated by 95 confidence intervals that were typically less than 50 of the average for the shallow 0 61 m bgs lysimeters and less than 40 of the average for the deep 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs lysimeters results show that the pfas concentrations measured in the shallow lysimeters located at 0 61 m bgs were typically statistically identical overlapping 95 confidence intervals to those measured at 1 2 to 1 5 m bgs indicating that pfas concentrations were at an apparent equilibrium in the percolating porewater within the interrogated depth interval of the vadose zone i e pfas concentrations in porewater were not changing with depth thus despite the comparatively higher organic carbon and pfas concentrations associated with the shallow soil tables s1 and s2 pfas concentrations in the porewater were in local equilibrium with the soil throughout the interrogated interval this apparent local equilibrium suggests that independently determined equilibrium partitioning parameters may be useful for predicting pfas porewater concentrations as discussed in the following section pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs were the pfass that showed the highest average porewater concentrations in fig 3 of approximately 10 000 and 25 000 ng l 1 respectively for the depths of 0 61 m and 1 2 1 5 m pfos and pfhxs were also the pfass that had the highest concentrations in the soil table s2 the perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa mass flux through the test cell during the 49 day monitoring period is shown in table 2 extrapolated over the course of a year the total mass of pfaas leached from the unsaturated soil within a year would be 1 3 0 43 g based on pfaa soil concentrations measured within the test cell table s2 this total annually leached pfaa mass represents only 2 of the total pfas mass present in the unsaturated zone these results suggest that pfaas will persist in the unsaturated soils for decades to come although it is currently unclear how pfaa mass flux will diminish over time due to thermodynamic and or kinetic limitations sporadic 35 of lysimeter samples detections of perfluorohexane sulfonamide fhxsa were observed but results were typically below the analytical method quantification limit of 2000 ng l 1 which was much greater than the 200 ng l 1 method quantification limit for most pfaas when detected fhxsa concentrations ranged from 5000 to 10 000 ng l 1 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 fts was only sporadically detected during the first 2 sampling events but was measured at an average concentration of approximately 2000 ng l 1 in the third round it is currently unclear why these two compounds were not detected on a more consistent level no suspect pfas analytes were detected in the porewater though this is likely due to the high degree of dilution required for aqueous analysis due to the high pfhxs and pfos levels 3 3 pfas mass balance and role of the air water interface results of the film experiments yielded kaw values of 0 18 0 029 cm 0 071 0 061 cm 0 064 0 048 cm for pfos pfhps and pfoa respectively average 95 confidence intervals provided the elevated kaw values for pfos are expected due to its increased perfluorinated chain length relative to pfhps and pfoa schaefer et al 2019 kaw values for the other pfass present in porewater were below that which could be measured using the film method the ionic strength of the porewater solution based on the average conductivity value shown in table s4 was 0 01 m fig 4 shows the measured pfos porewater kaw value compared to kaw values previously measured in electrolyte solutions all using the previously described film method except where noted the pfos kaw measured in the porewater 0 18 0 029 cm is identical to that measured in electrolyte in 0 01 m nacl 0 18 0 008 cm by schaefer et al 2019 suggesting that the porewater constituents i e total organic carbon other pfass did not have a substantial impact on pfos interfacial sorption for the porewater examined in this study in response to a recent study that suggests the film method may overpredict kaw values for pfas le et al 2021 fig 4 also shows results of a measured pfos kaw value in a 0 003 m nacl solution that was determined herein using the garrett metal screen method garrett 1965 daumas et al 1976 agogué et al 2004 details of this method are provided in the supplemental materials the consistency between the garrett metal screen method and the film method data coupled with the associated model shown in fig 4 suggests that the film method is in fact appropriate for determining kaw values for pfos fig 5 shows the average pfas porewater concentrations average of values shown in fig 3 compared to predicted values of the pfas porewater concentrations only pfass that were both consistently detected in the lysimeters samples fig 3 and also shown to be at equilibrium in the batch kinetic desorption testing schaefer et al 2021 were evaluated predicted pfas porewater concentrations are based conceptually on the pfas mass balance model developed by brusseau et al 2019b which considers pfas distribution among the soil aqueous phase and air water interface the application of the model is based on two key parameters a desorption kd value to describe pfas soil water partitioning and a pfas interfacial partition coefficient kaw to describe pfas partitioning to the air water interface the following 3 equations were used to describe pfas phase behavior among the soil aqueous and air water interfacial phases in a 10 g unit mass of shallow soil 50 saturation based on moisture probe and soil moisture data 1 k aw β c 2 k d c s b c 3 m t mass at interface mass in soil vβ a aw c s m where c is the aqueous concentration ng cm 3 cs is the sorbed soil concentration ng kg 1 mt is the total pfas mass used in a 10 10 3 kg mass of soil ng determined on a dry soil basis by multiplying the total pfas concentrations in the collected soil shown in table s2 by the 10 10 3 kg of dry soil v is the in situ soil bed volume associated with the 10 10 3 kg of dry soil 6 1 cm3 estimated assuming a dry bulk density of 1 65 g cm 3 aaw is the air water interfacial area per soil bed volume cm2 per cm3 and m is the mass of dry soil 10 10 3 kg desorption isotherms using the shallow soil described herein were previously determined using a sequential batch dilution technique to determine kd pfas soil sorption coefficient in l kg 1 and b the y intercept associated with the linear desorption isotherm in l kg 1 schaefer et al 2022 these values are provided in table 3 it is noted that eq 3 neglects the mass contribution from the aqueous phase based on the measured soil concentration and pfas porewater concentrations the pfas mass in the water accounts for less than 1 of the total mass thus justifying this simplification based on the amount of rainfall between soil collection and the time lysimeter sampling was initiated approximately 142 cm of rainfall over 18 months based on weather station data and using the leachate concentrations in fig 3 the mass of pfos and pfhps leached from the soil between the time of soil collection and the beginning of the lysimeter sample collection 18 months later is estimated at less than 1 and 2 of their mass present in the saturated zone respectively thus this small amount of mass removal was considered negligible for the model for pfoa using this same approach the mass removal over this 18 month period is estimated at 15 to account for this mt for pfoa in eqs 2 and 3 was decreased by 15 to provide a more appropriate value for the model the value for aaw was determined based on the average soil grain size using the following equation lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 4 a aw 3 9 d 1 2 1 s where d is the mean particle diameter of the shallow soil 0 04 cm and s is the pore saturation of the soil during lysimeter sample collection estimated at 0 5 cm3 cm 3 based on moisture probe data the resulting value for aaw is 93 cm 1 a discussion of the error associated with the model predictions is provided in the supplemental materials as depicted in fig 5 if pfas sorption to the air water interface is not considered the predicted pfas porewater concentrations are 1 4 to 4 times greater than the pfas concentrations measured in porewater pfos shows the greatest discrepancy in aqueous concentration between the lysimeter based and batch desorption based results among the pfass examined pfos is the most surface active among the three pfass shown in fig 5 costanza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 these observations suggest the possibility that the discrepancy between lysimeter and batch desorption results is due to pfas accumulation at air water interfaces which are present in the unsaturated soils within the test cell fig 5 also shows that including pfas retention at the air water interface results in a substantial improvement in the prediction of pfas porewater concentrations most notably for pfos where a 58 reduction in the predicted porewater concentration was observed when considering uptake at the air water interface the predicted porewater pfos concentration is within the 95 confidence interval of the measured pfos porewater concentration pfos showed a much greater measured interfacial partition coefficient kaw 0 18 cm than pfhps 0 071 cm and pfoa 0 064 cm in porewater thus inclusion of air water interfacial sorption expectedly had the most notable effect on pfos for pfhps inclusion of air water interfacial sorption also resulted in a predicted value that was within the 95 confidence interval of the measured porewater value whereas exclusion of air water interfacial sorption resulted in a significant overprediction of the measure porewater value for pfoa the relatively large uncertainty associated with the soil water partitioning kd value limited the ability to conclusively assess any improvement in porewater prediction by including sorption at the air water interface together these measured values and calculations provide a line of evidence for the relevance of pfas air water interfacial sorption in situ to our knowledge these are the first field data that demonstrate the impact of pfas air water interfacial sorption on pfas leaching thereby validating bench scale studies that suggest air water interfacial sorption is an important mechanism to consider at afff impacted sites while particularly for pfos and pfhps inclusion of the air water interfacial sorption resulted in improved predictions of in situ porewater concentration it is possible that factors besides sorption at the air water interface could have played a role in the overpredictions shown in fig 5 these factors include flow heterogeneity and other mass transfer limitations however given the similarity in pfas concentrations between the shallow and deep lysimeters which suggests mass transfer effects were limited as well as the fact that the most surface active compound examined pfos showed the greatest improvement when the model included interfacial sorption it is likely that air water interfacial sorption was the primary factor responsible for the discrepancy between the measured porewater values and the kd only partitioning model shown in fig 5 additional studies at a variety of sites are needed to further validate the role of interfacial sorption on pfas concentrations in porewater 3 4 environmental implications results presented herein show that pfas mass flux to underlying groundwater is likely being reduced by 1 5 to 4 times for pfos pfhxs and pfoa due to accumulation at the air water interface as highlighted by the impact of air water retention on pfas porewater concentrations thus consistent with previously performed unsaturated column experiments e g lyu et al 2018 air water interfacial uptake plays an important role in pfas transport through the unsaturated zone while the overall pfas mass flux from the afff impacted soils remains largely controlled by desorption from the soil accounting for pfas accumulation at the air water interface is required to estimate overall pfas mass flux further study is needed to more closely examine the impacts of variable saturation and water flux on pfas mass flux through the vadose zone further study also is needed to assess pfas mass flux under differing soil hydraulic and pfas

1292,the surfactant enhanced gas sparging process designed to specifically target the source zone of an organic contaminant in an aquifer with minimal usage of injected additives was investigated using a physical model aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzne sulfonate sdbs and or the thickener sodium carboxymethylcellulose scmc were applied in a contaminated horizontal layer in the simulated laboratory aquifer model followed by gas sparging fluorescein sodium salt fss was added to the sdbs scmc solutions and represented the organic contaminant air and ozone were injected to generate gas sparging a modified surfactant enhanced ozone sparging method was also tested by applying additional air venting ports installed in the aquifer above the gas injection zone both non aqueous phase liquid napl and water dissolved tca were applied to the sdbs applied region to evaluate the removal of contaminants during gas sparging a significant expansion of the de saturated zone for the sdbs applied region was observed during air sparging during ozone sparging the fluorescence by fss in the sdbs applied layer disappeared over a much wider range than that of the control experiment scmc application enhanced the performance of the sdbs applied gas sparging process the tca mass removed by volatilization during air sparging from the sdbs applied layer was 2 3 times the application in the absence of sdbs among five regions of injected napl contamination located above the single gas injection port and during 2 h of ozone sparging with sdbs applied more than 50 of fluorescence in the napl was removed whereas under the same conditions with no sdbs applied less than 30 was removed diverted gas flow through the venting ports installed in the aquifer model induced a horizontally expanded oxidative reaction zone during ozone sparging this study demonstrates enhanced gas sparging performance for the removal of contaminants from the aquifer with limited usage of additives applied specifically to the source zone keywords contamination ozone aquifer surfactant remediation source zone 1 introduction air sparging as is used to remove volatile organic contaminants from an aquifer bass et al 2000 usepa 2001 2010 zhou et al 2013 water dissolved contaminants in the aquifer are transferred to the gaseous phase and removed from the plume either into the vadose zone or to the atmosphere during the as process most dissolved volatile organic compounds vocs frequently found in the aquifer have been subject to this process aromatic compounds including benzene and xylene and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethene pce and 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca adams and reddy 2000 chen et al 2012 the as process has been applied for the removal of non aqueous phase liquid napl from the aquifer as well heron et al 2002 reddy and tekola 2004 rogers and ong 2000 the physicochemical properties of the contaminants are the key control factors that influence the performance of the as process for water dissolved contaminants the magnitude of the henry s law constant determines the mass transfer rate across the water gas interface and the removal efficiency of the contaminant braida and ong 1998 chao et al 2008 the overall mass transfer of aqueous contaminants to the gas phase is also affected by the specific water gas interfacial area which is related to the air saturation in the case of porous media kim et al 2005 with such low water solubility and high vapor pressure for most common organic contaminants e g benzene pce the as process has proven successful for transferring vocs to the gaseous phase the as process is also effective for the removal of volatile constituents residing in a napl mohamed et al 2007 the napl in direct contact with the mobile gas phase thus resulting in vaporization is considered more effective for mass transfer to the gas phase than that encapsulated in the aqueous phase this direct contact of napl with the mobile gas needs sufficient de saturation by the sparging gas kim et al 2007 which under normal circumstances may not be the case major drawbacks associated with the as process include the limited extent of the sparging influence zone around the gas injection point mccray and falta 1996 1997 and insufficient de saturation in the sparging zone of influence zoi a variety of engineering modifications have been attempted to improve the performance of the as process intermittent air injection or pulsed injection and air pressure changes during sparging were proven to be effective heron et al 2002 johnson et al 1999 neriah and paster 2016 yang et al 2005 optimization of the spacing between injection points and the effect of multiple injection points on the performance of as have also been investigated rogers and ong 2000 introducing a water soluble surfactant into the aquifer prior to initiating the as process surfactant enhanced air sparging seas was found to be effective for expanding the sparging zoi as well as for decreasing the water saturation in the zoi kim et al 2004 qin et al 2014 both aqueous phase vocs e g toluene and napl e g pce in the aquifer were removed successfully by the seas process in bench scale experiments kim et al 2009 qin et al 2013 for organic contaminants with both low vapor pressure and volatility oxidative degradation using ozone containing gas was reported to be effective during surfactant applied gas sparging surfactant enhanced ozone sparging seos kim et al 2013 in previous seas studies the groundwater in the aquifer was displaced with a surfactant solution prior to as which consumes a large amount of chemical additive moreover the surfactant solution was applied to un contaminated regions of the aquifer which causes unwanted secondary contamination by the surfactant hence it is desirable to take advantage of the suppressed surface tension due to surfactant application targeted specifically to the contaminant source zone during the seas process the main objective of this study was to evaluate focusing of the injected gas during gas sparging process into the contaminated source zone within the aquifer the groundwater in the aquifer layer where the contaminants e g napl reside is replaced with the surfactant solution prior to gas sparging the expansion of the sparging zoi in the source zone was estimated and compared with that of a control no surfactant applied the effect of gas focusing on the target source layer was estimated by monitoring the decay of fluorescence due to the oxidative degradation of fluorescein sodium salt fss applied in the porous media the removal rate of dissolved tca in the source aquifer layer was measured under conditions with and without horizontally applied surfactant solution the oxidative removal of a napl constituent fluorescence emitting compound was also investigated an alternate option for focusing the injected gas ozone onto the source zone included the effect of diverted sparging gas flow through additional gas extraction ports during the seos process on the oxidative decay of contaminant fss was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1

valves v d during sparging experiment air sparging continued until the de saturated zone was stabilized with no further changes in the size of the sparging zoi the gas was switched to ozone gas ozone containing oxygen gas implemented at the same air flow rate 134 1 ml min ozone containing oxygen gas did not pass through the humidification flask because ozone is fairly soluble in water which may alter the ozone content in the influent gas the loss of water from the model during gas sparging experiment was estimated to be negligible 0 4 ml compared to the total water volume 2 1 l photos were taken using a digital camera nikon model d500 under the uv lamps to monitor changes in fluorescence over time the gas sparging experiment continued for 120 min 16 2 l of gas consumed the final sparging zoi the de saturated region after 120 min gas sparging was visually inspected and the perimeter of the de saturated zone was drawn on a transparent film attached to the model the transparent film was scanned and the image was overlaid on the flow domain of the model the observed size and distribution of the de saturated zone were confirmed by observations on the other side of the model upon completion of the sparging experiment the sparging gas was switched to co2 at the same flow rate to displace the resident gas the model was then flushed using de gassed di water for sufficient

the sparging influence zone the model was repacked using the same media and the experiments were repeated a wider scmc layer for exp 1b replicate was used to evaluate whether the thickness of the scmc layer affects the extent of zoi 2 3 2 experiment 2 exp 2 tca removal seas on the source zone for the voc removal experiment exp 2 tca saturated aqueous solution was prepared 1140 mg l and then fss 100 mg l exp 2a control or the mixture of sdbs 100 mg l and fss 101 mg l exp 2b was added to the tca stock solution a sufficient amount of neat tca was added to di water and was stirred for 24 h and the supernatant was used for tca stock solution the injection method was the same as described in the previous section exp 1a the volume of the tca solution introduced to the model was 236 ml and the total tca mass was estimated to be 269 mg when exp 2a control was completed the model was regenerated using the same method described in section 2 3 1 before exp 2b started for seas air was injected into the model at a flow rate of 134 ml min using the same protocol described in the previous section the effluent gas was analyzed for tca using a gc until the tca concentration dropped below 1 of the highest concentration observed in the effluent gas the mass removed from the model during seas was estimated based on the tca concentration and gas flow rate and then compared to that of the tca introduced 2 3 3 experiment 3 exp 3 reaction of napl with ozone during seos a mixture of n hexane and pce was injected into the model through the injection ports p 1 p 5 in fig 1b the mass ratio of n hexane and pce was 45 55 so that the napl mixture was neutrally buoyant the napl was spiked 21 mg l with the oil soluble fluorescence agent dfsb k43 this fluorescence agent reacts with ozone in a similar manner to fss losing the fluorescence at a reasonable rate when exposed to ozone after small aliquots of the napl 7 0 ml per injection port were injected into the model the ozone sparging experiment exp 3a was conducted using the same procedure as previously described exp 1a the change in fluorescence was monitored under uv lamps the de saturated zone was also estimated based on the observations on the transparent film as described for exp 1 after the sparging process was completed for exp 3b the model was re packed using the same sand and the seos experiment was conducted with the sdbs solution applied as a layer shown in fig 2 the size and location of sdbs layer was identical to that described in previous section exp 1a 2 3 4 experiment 4 exp 4 additional air extraction ports during seos two additional gas extraction ports p 1 and p 5 in fig 1b in addition to the main gas outlet were used to vent about 52 of the sparging gas during seos the whole domain was filled with fss solution table 1 the total air injection rate was 135 ml min when the zoi was stabilized during air sparging only the main gas outlet was used up to this point the cover lid of the model was removed the additional venting ports were opened and the gas was extracted from the ports at the flow rate of 35 ml min each port using peristaltic pumps model no 7553 85 cole parmer instrument co the outlet tubes from the peristaltic pumps were connected to the wells p 1 to injection well p 5 to extraction well to re inject the aqueous solution to maintain the water table level possibly produced from p 1 and p 5 while the peristaltic pump was in operation at this point the sparging gas was switched to ozone the change in fluorescence was monitored under uv lamps three experiments were conducted in the order of exp 4a 4b and 4c 1 exp 4a in which sdbs with 100 mg l fss solution was applied to the entire model with only the main gas outlet being used 2 exp 4b in which sdbs solution with 100 mg l fss was applied to the entire model and additional gas outlets were used as described above and 3 exp 4c in which sdbs solution with 100 mg l fss was applied as a layer as described in exp 1a with the rest of the model being filled with fss 100 mg l solution and the additional gas outlets were used the gas flow rates at the main gas outlet and at the outlet tubes from the peristaltic pumps were measured using a bubble flow meter after the experiments were completed with the system cover lid re installed 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 exp 1 fluorescence decay seos on a targeted layer fig 3 shows the zoi and de saturated pattern in the zoi observed on the transparent film attached on the outer wall of the model when the air sparging process was stabilized it took about ten minutes following the start of air sparging for the zoi to reach the maximum extent and the size of the zoi remained constant until the end of ozone sparging experiment note that only the boundary between saturated black area and de saturated regions white area was shown in fig 3 and the spatial variations of gas saturation in the de saturated zone were not taken into account with no additives sdbs or scmc applied dominantly upward air flow was observed during air sparging fig 3a based on the pattern of disconnected de saturated regions observed on the surface of the physical model sparging air flowed through air channels for exp 1a no additive applied and exp 1b scmc thickener solution layer applied fig 3a and b the shape of zoi shown in fig 3a is typical for the conventional air sparging process as shown by modeling e g macray and falta 1996 when the scmc solution was targeted to a layer the de saturated zone tended to expand horizontally below the layer during the initial stage of air sparging suppressed hydraulic conductivity due to the scmc solution likely slowed down the water displacement and thus the air flow rate resulting in more air accumulated under the layer however little difference in the de saturation tendency in the zoi for the scmc applied condition fig 3b was shown with respect to the control fig 3a this is due to the instantaneous pressure drop as the air breaks through the initially saturated zone although the air entry pressure increases the air pressure necessary for the air to intrude smaller pores also increases resulting in de saturation of larger pores kim et al 2022 the sparging zoi formed for exp 1c sdbs solution applied as the layer fig 3c was significantly wider than that of control fig 3a the horizontal widths of zoi measured at 19 0 cm from the bottom of the model were 34 mean of two measurements including replicate fig s1 supplementary information 30 and 38 and 90 mean of two measurements 89 and 91 of the inner width of the model 70 0 cm for exp 1a fig 1a and exp 1c fig 1c respectively in the largest de saturated region no isolated water saturated area was observed fig 3c which may imply higher air saturation as reported in previous studies kim et al 2004 2013 the vertical thickness of the largest de saturated region was larger than that of the initial sdbs layer the cause of increased de saturation can be explained by the foam formation in the sdbs solution applied region the additional pressure build up due to foam displacement during sparging is considered to be responsible for expanding the sparging zoi and thus the expansion is limited to the region with sdbs solution as shown in the previous work by kim et al 2022 the sparging air displaced the sdbs solution upward resulting in the expansion of the de saturated region to be wider than the initial sdbs layer due to the finite physical length of the model the zois formed in exp 1c 1d 1e was also confined with a wider model width larger than 70 cm or with no boundaries more horizontal expansion is expected with the mixture of scmc and sdbs solution set exp 1d at the same location as exp 1c sdbs applied the sparging zoi was similar to that of exp 1c only with a wider de saturated zone fig 3d it is known that the thickener stabilizes the foam by increasing the foam viscosity kim et al 2022 the area of the de saturated region observed through the model wall for exp 1d was 49 of the initially saturated domain whereas only 15 was de saturated for the control exp 1a fig 4 at the same time no water saturated patch was observed in the largest de saturated zone fig 3d which implies that the degree of air saturation is higher in the zoi as well as in the full flow domain for exp 1d compared to the those of the control experiment exp 1a as for exp 1b the increased viscosity table 1 of scmc containing solution suppresses the hydraulic conductivity in the additive solution region with slower water displacement in the solution applied region sparging air was likely to be accumulated under the high viscosity region resulting in the protuberant shape of the de saturated zone the high viscosity layer set separately above the sdbs layer exp 1e was also found to enhance the de saturation in the sdbs applied layer compared to that without scmc the reduced hydraulic conductivity in the scmc layer expanded the de saturation zone horizontally fig 3e the ratio of the de saturated area observed with respect to the total initially saturated flow domain is shown in fig 4 all the surfactant applied exp 1c 1e experiments showed significant increase in the de saturated region compared to those without surfactant exp 1a and 1b the de saturated area formed right above the gas diffuser for exp 1c 1d and 1e due to surfactant addition is responsible for the increase in the expansion of zoi the zois of replicate experiments fig s1 were in fairly good agreement with those shown in fig 3 the ratio of largest de saturated zone formed right above the gas diffuser to the initially saturated domain is provided in table s1 supplementary information confirming that the extent of the de saturated domain estimated under the same experimental condition was consistent for the replicate experiment little change in the zoi pattern fig s1 b for exp 1b replicate experiment with a wider scmc layer was found compared to that shown in fig 3b fig 5 shows the photos of the model under uv lamps taken at 120 min since the start of the ozone sparging reflecting the decay in fluorescence applied in the injected solution exp 1 fluorescence emission by fss displayed a bright green color in fig 5 and other dim anomalies colored other than green are simple reflections of lab equipment with no additives sdbs or scmc applied the fluorescence disappeared through the air channels formed in the sparging zoi fig 5a although mostly discrete black dots appeared on the surface of the model also see fig s2 a it is obvious that there were air channels and only de saturated parts in contact with the model wall were observed the change in the fluorescence emission for the scmc applied condition fig 5b exp 1b was similar to the control exp 1a the width of the ozone reaction zone for the scmc applied experiment fig 5b is slightly narrower than that of the control which corresponds to the width of the zois shown in fig 3a and b for the ozone sparging experiments with sdbs solution applied as a layer exps 1c e a significantly larger region was affected by ozone sparging figs 5c 5e compared to the control fig 5a however the size of the fluorescence decayed region was only a fraction of the de saturated region shown in fig 3 the expansion of the de saturated zone takes place during the transient i e initial stage of the air sparging process after the sparging air completely penetrated the saturated domain to the vadose zone only small additional changes in the de saturated zone were observed when the air sparging process was stabilized the air flux was considered to be the highest at the middle of the de saturated region and lower air flowrate was expected at the edge of the flow domain it is very likely that there was little gas flow at the far left and right sides of the de saturated zone resulting in the fss solution remaining unreacted with ozone until 120 min from the beginning of the experiments with lower advective gas flow at the edges of the de saturated zone there might be diffusive ozone flux to the farthest regions of the zoi which possibly induced more oxidative reaction for the long term application of ozone in the model when the scmc solution layer was set above the sdbs layer the removal of fluorescence was most efficient largest area that lost fluorescence emission fig 5e this result may be due to higher air saturation or more ozone flux over a wider range for exp 1e regardless of the viscosity control the sdbs applied layer lost a significantly larger amount of fluorescence emission than the control experiment no evidence of gas channels was observed in the region of fluorescence decay for the sdbs applied region implying sufficiently high air saturation in the zoi fig 6 shows the changes in the fluorescence emission during ozone sparging for exp 1c and 1e the sdbs applied layer was expanded significantly during air sparging prior to ozone sparging 0 min fig 6 whereas little change was observed for the control not shown refer fig 5a the reaction front where the fluorescence emission disappears advanced at a slower rate for exp 1e scmc layer on the top of the sdbs layer than for exp 1c this implies that the scmc layer became a water flow barrier during the transient stage of air sparging inducing more air accumulation in the sdbs layer thus the larger specific contact area due to higher air saturation between the ozone gas and the aqueous phase for exp 1e resulted in more oxidative reaction of fss in the zoi and slower upward advance of the reaction front higher air saturations in the sdbs layer may also have expanded the de saturated region with gas flow horizontally fig s2 shows the changes in the fluorescence domain during air ozone sparging with the entire model being flooded with fss solution for comparison to the changes shown in fig 5 3 2 experiment 2 exp 2 tca removal seas on the source zone observation of changes in the fluorescence emission due to the oxidative reaction of fss with ozone may be a good metric to evaluate the removal of water dissolved contaminants during seos however it does not provide direct information on the removal of solubilized contaminant by vaporization which is an important aspect of the air sparging process the size and shape of the de saturated zone fig s3 during air sparging for the sdbs and tca solution applied as the layer exp 2b and the control exp 2a were nearly identical to those for exps 1c and exp 1a fig 3c and a the tca concentration in the gas effluent from the model reached the highest concentration immediately after the air sparging process was initiated fig 7 the highest concentrations of tca in the gas effluent were 12 2 mg l and 26 7 mg l for the control and the sdbs applied experiments respectively after the peak concentration was reached it decreased exponentially for the first 75 min 10 0 l of cumulative sparging gas volume and only gradually after 75 min the cumulative mass removal profile fig 7 showed rapid vaporization from the aqueous phase at the initial phase of air sparging the tca mass removed at 90 l of air sparged was close to 70 and 30 of those introduced in the model for the sdbs solution applied condition exp 2b and the control no sdbs applied exp 2a respectively the expanded de saturated zone as well as the higher air saturation in the sparging zoi achieved by using the sdbs solution layer exp 2b is considered responsible for the improved tca mass removal the water table was maintained at a constant level using drain valves v d fig 1b during air sparging this was to simulate the field case where the hydraulic conductivity is high enough to recover the water table quickly after its temporal rise due to air injection this however may not be the case for an aquifer with relatively low hydraulic conductivity the water table may rise for a substantial period of time causing migration of the contaminant plume which is not the case considered in this study and care must be taken when interpreting observations reported in this study 3 3 experiment 3 exp 3 reaction of napl with ozone during seos fig 8 shows the location of napl source zones and the loss of fluorescence emission from the napl after 120 min 16 l of ozone sparging overlapped on the de saturated region slight difference in the pattern of de saturation for the control experiment exp 3a no sdbs applied fig 8c was observed from that without napl exp 1a fig 3a a large patch of de saturated region fig 8c which did not appear for the control exp 1a was formed in the middle of the domain where the napl was introduced p 3 in fig 1b due to the hydrophobic nature of napl this observation implies that the distribution of napl in the aquifer may affect the distribution of the de saturated zone during the air sparging process however since the napl does not change the chemical properties including surface tension of the pore water increases in the air saturation due to napl may be confined in the zoi as shown in fig 8 the fluorescence emission by the napl solubilized agent indicated the location and extent of the napl contaminated region the fluorescence reagent dfsb k43 risk reactor co when dissolved in hydrocarbon liquid emits fluorescence under uv lamp and loses fluorescence emitting capability at reasonably fast rate similar to that of fss in contact with ozone the napl was placed at five locations in symmetric configuration in the model fig 8a and b the fluorescence from the napl in the middle disappeared completely after 180 min 24 3 l of ozone sparging for both the control fig 8c exp 3a and the sdbs applied experiment fig 8d exp 3b note that the disappearance of fluorescence does not necessarily mean the complete degradation of napl it should rather be considered as an indicator that the napl is under oxidative condition being exposed by ozone and napl components susceptible to high redox potential by ozone may start to react due to the expanded sparging zoi for the sdbs solution applied condition exp 3b more napl was under the influence of ozone gas and the loss of fluorescence was notable more than 50 of the fluorescence disappeared for exp 3b fig 8d whereas less than 30 of the napl was affected by ozone sparging in the control exp 3a fig 8c although the de saturated zone encompassed all the napl injection regions the fluorescence from the napl regions at the far left and right sides of the model was not affected by ozone fig 8d this indicates that during the ozone gas sparging the edge of the de saturated zone which was formed at the initial stage of the sparging was not in contact with the mobile gas 3 4 experiment 4 exp 4 effect of additional air extraction ports on the seos in addition to the main gas outlet at the center top of the model additional gas outlets p 1 and p 5 fig 1b in the flow domain were installed and used to divert the sparging gas horizontally maintaining the total gas flowrate constant with the entire domain saturated with sdbs solution and only the main gas outlet being used exp 4a the region of fluorescence decay was formed mainly in the middle of the domain after 120 min 16 2 l of ozone sparging fig 9a when two additional gas extraction ports were used to withdraw part of the sparging gas about 26 of the total gas flow for each port from the domain completely saturated with sdbs solution exp 4b a fraction of the ozone did flow to the extraction ports reacted with fss and thus the disappearance of fluorescence was observed fig 9b when the sdbs solution was applied as a layer exp 4c as for exp 1c a similar effect to that observed for exp 4b was observed fig 9c when the sdbs solution layer was applied exp 4c with two additional gas extraction ports the reaction zone was further confined to the location where sdbs solution was applied because of the relatively high air saturation in the sdbs layer compared to the rest of the flow domain with additional gas extraction ports p 1 and p 5 set in the middle of the gas flow domain the horizontal expansion of oxidative reaction was confirmed in this study fig 9 the use of these extra gas outlets may further enhance the remedial performance of seos with surfactant solution applied in the target zone exp 1 for ozone sparging with the sdsb solution applied as a layer the use of addition gas outlets thus diverting gas flow direction increased the oxidative reaction in the sdbs applied region e g contamination source zone suppressing the vertical gas flow fig s4 while the gas flow was artificially diverted to the ports p 1 and p 5 intermittent foam flow was observed through the peristaltic pumps to the wells the effect of extracted solution on the gas ozone flow pattern was not evaluated in this study since the total volume of extracted aqueous solution was considered not significant with respect to the total water volume in the model however substantial liquid flow from the zoi through gas extraction ports installed in the zoi may affect the gas flow rate and flow direction which requires more investigation for field application of the experimental procedure proposed in this study engineering configurations for soil vapor extraction system need to be modified for gas extraction from the de saturated zone during the seos process 4 conclusion targeted application of surfactant and or thickener solution specifically to a contaminant source zone layer in an aquifer may be beneficial to enhance the performance of the gas sparging process with the minimal usage of additives during air sparging the surfactant solution applied to a specific depth region in the aquifer was found to expand the sparging zoi horizontally along with the surfactant solution the expansion of the oxidative reaction in the aquifer when surfactant solution was applied to the source zone was also confirmed using a fluorescence emitting agent increased viscosity of the surfactant solution by adding a thickener further extended the sparging zoi during air sparging when the surfactant solution was applied to the target zone faster vaporization of the dissolved contaminant tca from the source zone of the aquifer was also confirmed more napl was subject to the influence of oxidative conditions during ozone sparging with a surfactant solution targeted to the source zone extracting a portion of the sparging gas through additional gas extraction ports installed in the sparging zoi was found to further confine the gaseous oxidative agent ozone within the source ozone possibly enhancing the removal of contaminant from the source in this study it is proposed that introducing a small amount of surfactant enough to cover the contaminant source zone will enhance the remedial performance of the air ozone sparging process author statement moon young cho

1292,the surfactant enhanced gas sparging process designed to specifically target the source zone of an organic contaminant in an aquifer with minimal usage of injected additives was investigated using a physical model aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzne sulfonate sdbs and or the thickener sodium carboxymethylcellulose scmc were applied in a contaminated horizontal layer in the simulated laboratory aquifer model followed by gas sparging fluorescein sodium salt fss was added to the sdbs scmc solutions and represented the organic contaminant air and ozone were injected to generate gas sparging a modified surfactant enhanced ozone sparging method was also tested by applying additional air venting ports installed in the aquifer above the gas injection zone both non aqueous phase liquid napl and water dissolved tca were applied to the sdbs applied region to evaluate the removal of contaminants during gas sparging a significant expansion of the de saturated zone for the sdbs applied region was observed during air sparging during ozone sparging the fluorescence by fss in the sdbs applied layer disappeared over a much wider range than that of the control experiment scmc application enhanced the performance of the sdbs applied gas sparging process the tca mass removed by volatilization during air sparging from the sdbs applied layer was 2 3 times the application in the absence of sdbs among five regions of injected napl contamination located above the single gas injection port and during 2 h of ozone sparging with sdbs applied more than 50 of fluorescence in the napl was removed whereas under the same conditions with no sdbs applied less than 30 was removed diverted gas flow through the venting ports installed in the aquifer model induced a horizontally expanded oxidative reaction zone during ozone sparging this study demonstrates enhanced gas sparging performance for the removal of contaminants from the aquifer with limited usage of additives applied specifically to the source zone keywords contamination ozone aquifer surfactant remediation source zone 1 introduction air sparging as is used to remove volatile organic contaminants from an aquifer bass et al 2000 usepa 2001 2010 zhou et al 2013 water dissolved contaminants in the aquifer are transferred to the gaseous phase and removed from the plume either into the vadose zone or to the atmosphere during the as process most dissolved volatile organic compounds vocs frequently found in the aquifer have been subject to this process aromatic compounds including benzene and xylene and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethene pce and 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca adams and reddy 2000 chen et al 2012 the as process has been applied for the removal of non aqueous phase liquid napl from the aquifer as well heron et al 2002 reddy and tekola 2004 rogers and ong 2000 the physicochemical properties of the contaminants are the key control factors that influence the performance of the as process for water dissolved contaminants the magnitude of the henry s law constant determines the mass transfer rate across the water gas interface and the removal efficiency of the contaminant braida and ong 1998 chao et al 2008 the overall mass transfer of aqueous contaminants to the gas phase is also affected by the specific water gas interfacial area which is related to the air saturation in the case of porous media kim et al 2005 with such low water solubility and high vapor pressure for most common organic contaminants e g benzene pce the as process has proven successful for transferring vocs to the gaseous phase the as process is also effective for the removal of volatile constituents residing in a napl mohamed et al 2007 the napl in direct contact with the mobile gas phase thus resulting in vaporization is considered more effective for mass transfer to the gas phase than that encapsulated in the aqueous phase this direct contact of napl with the mobile gas needs sufficient de saturation by the sparging gas kim et al 2007 which under normal circumstances may not be the case major drawbacks associated with the as process include the limited extent of the sparging influence zone around the gas injection point mccray and falta 1996 1997 and insufficient de saturation in the sparging zone of influence zoi a variety of engineering modifications have been attempted to improve the performance of the as process intermittent air injection or pulsed injection and air pressure changes during sparging were proven to be effective heron et al 2002 johnson et al 1999 neriah and paster 2016 yang et al 2005 optimization of the spacing between injection points and the effect of multiple injection points on the performance of as have also been investigated rogers and ong 2000 introducing a water soluble surfactant into the aquifer prior to initiating the as process surfactant enhanced air sparging seas was found to be effective for expanding the sparging zoi as well as for decreasing the water saturation in the zoi kim et al 2004 qin et al 2014 both aqueous phase vocs e g toluene and napl e g pce in the aquifer were removed successfully by the seas process in bench scale experiments kim et al 2009 qin et al 2013 for organic contaminants with both low vapor pressure and volatility oxidative degradation using ozone containing gas was reported to be effective during surfactant applied gas sparging surfactant enhanced ozone sparging seos kim et al 2013 in previous seas studies the groundwater in the aquifer was displaced with a surfactant solution prior to as which consumes a large amount of chemical additive moreover the surfactant solution was applied to un contaminated regions of the aquifer which causes unwanted secondary contamination by the surfactant hence it is desirable to take advantage of the suppressed surface tension due to surfactant application targeted specifically to the contaminant source zone during the seas process the main objective of this study was to evaluate focusing of the injected gas during gas sparging process into the contaminated source zone within the aquifer the groundwater in the aquifer layer where the contaminants e g napl reside is replaced with the surfactant solution prior to gas sparging the expansion of the sparging zoi in the source zone was estimated and compared with that of a control no surfactant applied the effect of gas focusing on the target source layer was estimated by monitoring the decay of fluorescence due to the oxidative degradation of fluorescein sodium salt fss applied in the porous media the removal rate of dissolved tca in the source aquifer layer was measured under conditions with and without horizontally applied surfactant solution the oxidative removal of a napl constituent fluorescence emitting compound was also investigated an alternate option for focusing the injected gas ozone onto the source zone included the effect of diverted sparging gas flow through additional gas extraction ports during the seos process on the oxidative decay of contaminant fss was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1

containing oxygen gas implemented at the same air flow rate 134 1 ml min ozone containing oxygen gas did not pass through the humidification flask because ozone is fairly soluble in water which may alter the ozone content in the influent gas the loss of water from the model during gas sparging experiment was estimated to be negligible 0 4 ml compared to the total water volume 2 1 l photos were taken using a digital camera nikon model d500 under the uv lamps to monitor changes in fluorescence over time the gas sparging experiment continued for 120 min 16 2 l of gas consumed the final sparging zoi the de saturated region after 120 min gas sparging was visually inspected and the perimeter of the de saturated zone was drawn on a transparent film attached to the model the transparent film was scanned and the image was overlaid on the flow domain of the model the observed size and distribution of the de saturated zone were confirmed by observations on the other side of the model upon completion of the sparging experiment the sparging gas was switched to co2 at the same flow rate to displace the resident gas the model was then flushed using de gassed di water for sufficient time 24 h water flow rate 20 ml min to remove the resident gas and aqueous solution from the model the re saturated model was then used for the next experiment the order of exp 1 was exp 1a 1c 1d 1b and 1e experiments without scmc was performed prior to those with scmc to avoid possible scmc carry over different aqueous solutions of the surfactant and or the thickener were injected into the model for exp 1c 1d and 1e the experimental procedure for the experiments using additives sdbs and scmc was identical to that of the control experiment for exp 1c sdbs solution 101 mg l was injected into the model fss 102 mg l was added to the sdbs solution for exp 1d the aqueous mixture of sdbs 104 mg l and scmc 0 10 w v was injected into the model for exp 1e the scmc solution was injected above the scmc layer fig 2 to evaluate the effect of a viscous layer on the scmc layer the width from the top to the bottom of scmc plume of the scmc solution was about 20 cm the gas sparging process and data acquisition method for exp 1c 1d and 1e were the same as those of the control descried earlier the experiments exp 1a 1c 1e were replicated to confirm the effect of aqueous additives on the size of the sparging influence zone the model was repacked using the same media and the experiments were repeated a wider scmc layer for exp 1b replicate was used to evaluate whether the thickness of the scmc layer affects the extent of zoi 2 3 2 experiment 2 exp 2 tca removal seas on the source zone for the voc removal experiment exp 2 tca saturated aqueous solution was prepared 1140 mg l and then fss 100 mg l exp 2a control or the mixture of sdbs 100 mg l and fss 101 mg l exp 2b was added to the tca stock solution a sufficient amount of neat tca was added to di water and was stirred for 24 h and the supernatant was used for tca stock solution the injection method was the same as described in the previous section exp 1a the volume of the tca solution introduced to the model was 236 ml and the total tca mass was estimated to be 269 mg when exp 2a control was completed the model was regenerated using the same method described in section 2 3 1 before exp 2b started for seas air was injected into the model at a flow rate of 134 ml min using the same protocol described in the previous section the effluent gas was analyzed for tca using a gc until the tca concentration dropped below 1 of the highest concentration observed in the effluent gas the mass removed from the model during seas was estimated based on the tca concentration and gas flow rate and then compared to that of the tca introduced 2 3 3 experiment 3 exp 3 reaction of napl with ozone during seos a mixture of n hexane and pce was injected into the model through the injection ports p 1 p 5 in fig 1b the mass ratio of n hexane and pce was 45 55 so that the napl mixture was neutrally buoyant the napl was spiked 21 mg l with the oil soluble fluorescence agent dfsb k43 this fluorescence agent reacts with ozone in a similar manner to fss losing the fluorescence at a reasonable rate when exposed to ozone after small aliquots of the napl 7 0 ml per injection port were injected into the model the ozone sparging experiment exp 3a was conducted using the same procedure as previously described exp 1a the change in fluorescence was monitored under uv lamps the de saturated zone was also estimated based on the observations on the transparent film as described for exp 1 after the sparging process was completed for exp 3b the model was re packed using the same sand and the seos experiment was conducted with the sdbs solution applied as a layer shown in fig 2 the size and location of sdbs layer was identical to that described in previous section exp 1a 2 3 4 experiment 4 exp 4 additional air extraction ports during seos two additional gas extraction ports p 1 and p 5 in fig 1b in addition to the main gas outlet were used to vent about 52 of the sparging gas during seos the whole domain was filled with fss solution table 1 the total air injection rate was 135 ml min when the zoi was stabilized during air sparging only the main gas outlet was used up to this point the cover lid of the model was removed the additional venting ports were opened and the gas was extracted from the ports at the flow rate of 35 ml min each port using peristaltic pumps model no 7553 85 cole parmer instrument co the outlet tubes from the peristaltic pumps were connected to the wells p 1 to injection well p 5 to extraction well to re inject the aqueous solution to maintain the water table level possibly produced from p 1 and p 5 while the peristaltic pump was in operation at this point the sparging gas was switched to ozone the change in fluorescence was monitored under uv lamps three experiments were conducted in the order of exp 4a 4b and 4c 1 exp 4a in which sdbs with 100 mg l fss solution was applied to the entire model with only the main gas outlet being used 2 exp 4b in which sdbs solution with 100 mg l fss was applied to the entire model and additional gas outlets were used as described above and 3 exp 4c in which sdbs solution with 100 mg l fss was applied as a layer as described in exp 1a with the rest of the model being filled with fss 100 mg l solution and the additional gas outlets were used the gas flow rates at the main gas outlet and at the outlet tubes from the peristaltic pumps were measured using a bubble flow meter after the experiments were completed with the system cover lid re installed 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 exp 1 fluorescence decay seos on a targeted layer fig 3 shows the zoi and de saturated pattern in the zoi observed on the transparent film attached on the outer wall of the model when the air sparging process was stabilized it took about ten minutes following the start of air sparging for the zoi to reach the maximum extent and the size of the zoi remained constant until the end of ozone sparging experiment note that only the boundary between saturated black area and de saturated regions white area was shown in fig 3 and the spatial variations of gas saturation in the de saturated zone were not taken into account with no additives sdbs or scmc applied dominantly upward air flow was observed during air sparging fig 3a based on the pattern of disconnected de saturated regions observed on the surface of the physical model sparging air flowed through air channels for exp 1a no additive applied and exp 1b scmc thickener solution layer applied fig 3a and b the shape of zoi shown in fig 3a is typical for the conventional air sparging process as shown by modeling e g macray and falta 1996 when the scmc solution was targeted to a layer the de saturated zone tended to expand horizontally below the layer during the initial stage of air sparging suppressed hydraulic conductivity due to the scmc solution likely slowed down the water displacement and thus the air flow rate resulting in more air accumulated under the layer however little difference in the de saturation tendency in the zoi for the scmc applied condition fig 3b was shown with respect to the control fig 3a this is due to the instantaneous pressure drop as the air breaks through the initially saturated zone although the air entry pressure increases the air pressure necessary for the air to intrude smaller pores also increases resulting in de saturation of larger pores kim et al 2022 the sparging zoi formed for exp 1c sdbs solution applied as the layer fig 3c was significantly wider than that of control fig 3a the horizontal widths of zoi measured at 19 0 cm from the bottom of the model were 34 mean of two measurements including replicate fig s1 supplementary information 30 and 38 and 90 mean of two measurements 89 and 91 of the inner width of the model 70 0 cm for exp 1a fig 1a and exp 1c fig 1c respectively in the largest de saturated region no isolated water saturated area was observed fig 3c which may imply higher air saturation as reported in previous studies kim et al 2004 2013 the vertical thickness of the largest de saturated region was larger than that of the initial sdbs layer the cause of increased de saturation can be explained by the foam formation in the sdbs solution applied region the additional pressure build up due to foam displacement during sparging is considered to be responsible for expanding the sparging zoi and thus the expansion is limited to the region with sdbs solution as shown in the previous work by kim et al 2022 the sparging air displaced the sdbs solution upward resulting in the expansion of the de saturated region to be wider than the initial sdbs layer due to the finite physical length of the model the zois formed in exp 1c 1d 1e was also confined with a wider model width larger than 70 cm or with no boundaries more horizontal expansion is expected with the mixture of scmc and sdbs solution set exp 1d at the same location as exp 1c sdbs applied the sparging zoi was similar to that of exp 1c only with a wider de saturated zone fig 3d it is known that the thickener stabilizes the foam by increasing the foam viscosity kim et al 2022 the area of the de saturated region observed through the model wall for exp 1d was 49 of the initially saturated domain whereas only 15 was de saturated for the control exp 1a fig 4 at the same time no water saturated patch was observed in the largest de saturated zone fig 3d which implies that the degree of air saturation is higher in the zoi as well as in the full flow domain for exp 1d compared to the those of the control experiment exp 1a as for exp 1b the increased viscosity table 1 of scmc containing solution suppresses the hydraulic conductivity in the additive solution region with slower water displacement in the solution applied region sparging air was likely to be accumulated under the high viscosity region resulting in the protuberant shape of the de saturated zone the high viscosity layer set separately above the sdbs layer exp 1e was also found to enhance the de saturation in the sdbs applied layer compared to that without scmc the reduced hydraulic conductivity in the scmc layer expanded the de saturation zone horizontally fig 3e the ratio of the de saturated area observed with respect to the total initially saturated flow domain is shown in fig 4 all the surfactant applied exp 1c 1e experiments showed significant increase in the de saturated region compared to those without surfactant exp 1a and 1b the de saturated area formed right above the gas diffuser for exp 1c 1d and 1e due to surfactant addition is responsible for the increase in the expansion of zoi the zois of replicate experiments fig s1 were in fairly good agreement with those shown in fig 3 the ratio of largest de saturated zone formed right above the gas diffuser to the initially saturated domain is provided in table s1 supplementary information confirming that the extent of the de saturated domain estimated under the same experimental condition was consistent for the replicate experiment little change in the zoi pattern fig s1 b for exp 1b replicate experiment with a wider scmc layer was found compared to that shown in fig 3b fig 5 shows the photos of the model under uv lamps taken at 120 min since the start of the ozone sparging reflecting the decay in fluorescence applied in the injected solution exp 1 fluorescence emission by fss displayed a bright green color in fig 5 and other dim anomalies colored other than green are simple reflections of lab equipment with no additives sdbs or scmc applied the fluorescence disappeared through the air channels formed in the sparging zoi fig 5a although mostly discrete black dots appeared on the surface of the model also see fig s2 a it is obvious that there were air channels and only de saturated parts in contact with the model wall were observed the change in the fluorescence emission for the scmc applied condition fig 5b exp 1b was similar to the control exp 1a the width of the ozone reaction zone for the scmc applied experiment fig 5b is slightly narrower than that of the control which corresponds to the width of the zois shown in fig 3a and b for the ozone sparging experiments with sdbs solution applied as a layer exps 1c e a significantly larger region was affected by ozone sparging figs 5c 5e compared to the control fig 5a however the size of the fluorescence decayed region was only a fraction of the de saturated region shown in fig 3 the expansion of the de saturated zone takes place during the transient i e initial stage of the air sparging process after the sparging air completely penetrated the saturated domain to the vadose zone only small additional changes in the de saturated zone were observed when the air sparging process was stabilized the air flux was considered to be the highest at the middle of the de saturated region and lower air flowrate was expected at the edge of the flow domain it is very likely that there was little gas flow at the far left and right sides of the de saturated zone resulting in the fss solution remaining unreacted with ozone until 120 min from the beginning of the experiments with lower advective gas flow at the edges of the de saturated zone there might be diffusive ozone flux to the farthest regions of the zoi which possibly induced more oxidative reaction for the long term application of ozone in the model when the scmc solution layer was set above the sdbs layer the removal of fluorescence was most efficient largest area that lost fluorescence emission fig 5e this result may be due to higher air saturation or more ozone flux over a wider range for exp 1e regardless of the viscosity control the sdbs applied layer lost a significantly larger amount of fluorescence emission than the control experiment no evidence of gas channels was observed in the region of fluorescence decay for the sdbs applied region implying sufficiently high air saturation in the zoi fig 6 shows the changes in the fluorescence emission during ozone sparging for exp 1c and 1e the sdbs applied layer was expanded significantly during air sparging prior to ozone sparging 0 min fig 6 whereas little change was observed for the control not shown refer fig 5a the reaction front where the fluorescence emission disappears advanced at a slower rate for exp 1e scmc layer on the top of the sdbs layer than for exp 1c this implies that the scmc layer became a water flow barrier during the transient stage of air sparging inducing more air accumulation in the sdbs layer thus the larger specific contact area due to higher air saturation between the ozone gas and the aqueous phase for exp 1e resulted in more oxidative reaction of fss in the zoi and slower upward advance of the reaction front higher air saturations in the sdbs layer may also have expanded the de saturated region with gas flow horizontally fig s2 shows the changes in the fluorescence domain during air ozone sparging with the entire model being flooded with fss solution for comparison to the changes shown in fig 5 3 2 experiment 2 exp 2 tca removal seas on the source zone observation of changes in the fluorescence emission due to the oxidative reaction of fss with ozone may be a good metric to evaluate the removal of water dissolved contaminants during seos however it does not provide direct information on the removal of solubilized contaminant by vaporization which is an important aspect of the air sparging process the size and shape of the de saturated zone fig s3 during air sparging for the sdbs and tca solution applied as the layer exp 2b and the control exp 2a were nearly identical to those for exps 1c and exp 1a fig 3c and a the tca concentration in the gas effluent from the model reached the highest concentration immediately after the air sparging process was initiated fig 7 the highest concentrations of tca in the gas effluent were 12 2 mg l and 26 7 mg l for the control and the sdbs applied experiments respectively after the peak concentration was reached it decreased exponentially for the first 75 min 10 0 l of cumulative sparging gas volume and only gradually after 75 min the cumulative mass removal profile fig 7 showed rapid vaporization from the aqueous phase at the initial phase of air sparging the tca mass removed at 90 l of air sparged was close to 70 and 30 of those introduced in the model for the sdbs solution applied condition exp 2b and the control no sdbs applied exp 2a respectively the expanded de saturated zone as well as the higher air saturation in the sparging zoi achieved by using the sdbs solution layer exp 2b is considered responsible for the improved tca mass removal the water table was maintained at a constant level using drain valves v d fig 1b during air sparging this was to simulate the field case where the hydraulic conductivity is high enough to recover the water table quickly after its temporal rise due to air injection this however may not be the case for an aquifer with relatively low hydraulic conductivity the water table may rise for a substantial period of time causing migration of the contaminant plume which is not the case considered in this study and care must be taken when interpreting observations reported in this study 3 3 experiment 3 exp 3 reaction of napl with ozone during seos fig 8 shows the location of napl source zones and the loss of fluorescence emission from the napl after 120 min 16 l of ozone sparging overlapped on the de saturated region slight difference in the pattern of de saturation for the control experiment exp 3a no sdbs applied fig 8c was observed from that without napl exp 1a fig 3a a large patch of de saturated region fig 8c which did not appear for the control exp 1a was formed in the middle of the domain where the napl was introduced p 3 in fig 1b due to the hydrophobic nature of napl this observation implies that the distribution of napl in the aquifer may affect the distribution of the de saturated zone during the air sparging process however since the napl does not change the chemical properties including surface tension of the pore water increases in the air saturation due to napl may be confined in the zoi as shown in fig 8 the fluorescence emission by the napl solubilized agent indicated the location and extent of the napl contaminated region the fluorescence reagent dfsb k43 risk reactor co when dissolved in hydrocarbon liquid emits fluorescence under uv lamp and loses fluorescence emitting capability at reasonably fast rate similar to that of fss in contact with ozone the napl was placed at five locations in symmetric configuration in the model fig 8a and b the fluorescence from the napl in the middle disappeared completely after 180 min 24 3 l of ozone sparging for both the control fig 8c exp 3a and the sdbs applied experiment fig 8d exp 3b note that the disappearance of fluorescence does not necessarily mean the complete degradation of napl it should rather be considered as an indicator that the napl is under oxidative condition being exposed by ozone and napl components susceptible to high redox potential by ozone may start to react due to the expanded sparging zoi for the sdbs solution applied condition exp 3b more napl was under the influence of ozone gas and the loss of fluorescence was notable more than 50 of the fluorescence disappeared for exp 3b fig 8d whereas less than 30 of the napl was affected by ozone sparging in the control exp 3a fig 8c although the de saturated zone encompassed all the napl injection regions the fluorescence from the napl regions at the far left and right sides of the model was not affected by ozone fig 8d this indicates that during the ozone gas sparging the edge of the de saturated zone which was formed at the initial stage of the sparging was not in contact with the mobile gas 3 4 experiment 4 exp 4 effect of additional air extraction ports on the seos in addition to the main gas outlet at the center top of the model additional gas outlets p 1 and p 5 fig 1b in the flow domain were installed and used to divert the sparging gas horizontally maintaining the total gas flowrate constant with the entire domain saturated with sdbs solution and only the main gas outlet being used exp 4a the region of fluorescence decay was formed mainly in the middle of the domain after 120 min 16 2 l of ozone sparging fig 9a when two additional gas extraction ports were used to withdraw part of the sparging gas about 26 of the total gas flow for each port from the domain completely saturated with sdbs solution exp 4b a fraction of the ozone did flow to the extraction ports reacted with fss and thus the disappearance of fluorescence was observed fig 9b when the sdbs solution was applied as a layer exp 4c as for exp 1c a similar effect to that observed for exp 4b was observed fig 9c when the sdbs solution layer was applied exp 4c with two additional gas extraction ports the reaction zone was further confined to the location where sdbs solution was applied because of the relatively high air saturation in the sdbs layer compared to the rest of the flow domain with additional gas extraction ports p 1 and p 5 set in the middle of the gas flow domain the horizontal expansion of oxidative reaction was confirmed in this study fig 9 the use of these extra gas outlets may further enhance the remedial performance of seos with surfactant solution applied in the target zone exp 1 for ozone sparging with the sdsb solution applied as a layer the use of addition gas outlets thus diverting gas flow direction increased the oxidative reaction in the sdbs applied region e g contamination source zone suppressing the vertical gas flow fig s4 while the gas flow was artificially diverted to the ports p 1 and p 5 intermittent foam flow was observed through the peristaltic pumps to the wells the effect of extracted solution on the gas ozone flow pattern was not evaluated in this study since the total volume of extracted aqueous solution was considered not significant with respect to the total water volume in the model however substantial liquid flow from the zoi through gas extraction ports installed in the zoi may affect the gas flow rate and flow direction which requires more investigation for field application of the experimental procedure proposed in this study engineering configurations for soil vapor extraction system need to be modified for gas extraction from the de saturated zone during the seos process 4 conclusion targeted application of surfactant and or thickener solution specifically to a contaminant source zone layer in an aquifer may be beneficial to enhance the performance of the gas sparging process with the minimal usage of additives during air sparging the surfactant solution applied to a specific depth region in the aquifer was found to expand the sparging zoi horizontally along with the surfactant solution the expansion of the oxidative reaction in the aquifer when surfactant solution was applied to the source zone was also confirmed using a fluorescence emitting agent increased viscosity of the surfactant solution by adding a thickener further extended the sparging zoi during air sparging when the surfactant solution was applied to the target zone faster vaporization of the dissolved contaminant tca from the source zone of the aquifer was also confirmed more napl was subject to the influence of oxidative conditions during ozone sparging with a surfactant solution targeted to the source zone extracting a portion of the sparging gas through additional gas extraction ports installed in the sparging zoi was found to further confine the gaseous oxidative agent ozone within the source ozone possibly enhancing the removal of contaminant from the source in this study it is proposed that introducing a small amount of surfactant enough to cover the contaminant source zone will enhance the remedial performance of the air ozone sparging process author statement moon young cho

1293,induced polarization ip is a non intrusive geophysical method to monitor dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination and remediation processes underground in this study an advanced numerical code simulating dnapl flow and complex electrical resistivity is presented the model was validated against existing ip results and image measurements that were carried out previously in a series of 2d tank experiment multiphase flow modeling in porous media is coupled with electrical current modeling to simulate the process of dnapl migration and the associated ip response this brings a broader view of the contamination in space and time compared to surface and borehole measurements especially when the results are supported by field measurements or laboratory experiments the simulations are developed in 3d and are performed in comsol multiphysics the simulations using petrophysical relationships for in phase and quadrature resistivity and the results of the experiments are in complete accordance with each other in the parts of the tank where the saturation of dnapl is relatively low i e especially in the cone of depression in the pumping scenario however the parts associated with high saturation of dnapl show high errors between the in phase resistivity simulations and the results from experiments the present work can be regarded as a preliminary study toward further applications of coupled ip multiphase flow for more accurate detection and monitoring of dnapls it is suggested that the choice of tool approach in this study be extended to larger scale studies for further investigation keywords comsol multiphysics dense non aqueous phase liquid induced polarization two phase flow in porous media 1 introduction soils sediments and groundwater are increasingly endangered by anthropogenic contamination especially industrial pollutants from accidental spills leaks or improper management song et al 2017 among persistent organic pollutants dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls including chlorinated solvents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are commonly present in contaminated sites dnapls are known to be toxic and carcinogenic for humans and their contamination of soils and aquifers is of great environmental concern khan et al 2004 they are also among the most difficult pollutants to treat in site remediation due to their high density leading them to migrate below the water table kram et al 2001 their rate limited dissolution and resulting mass transfer limitations can lead to long term aquifer persistence for even small volumetric fractions qin et al 2007 the effective remediation of fields contaminated with dnapls requires proper mapping of the contaminant plume and release rate geoelectrical methods e g electrical resistivity tomography ert induced polarization ip categorized as non invasive geophysical methods have considerable potentials to be applied on dnapl site assessment and remediation monitoring both on preliminary studies and post treatment brewster et al 1995 minsley et al 2007 cardarelli and di filippo 2009 chambers et al 2010 naudet et al 2014 orlando and palladini 2018 steelman et al 2017 time lapse ert and ip are very sensitive to the displacement of charge carriers associated with dnapl presence and can give an estimate of the spatial distribution of the contaminant in real time which is of paramount importance for the monitoring however the exclusive use of time lapse ert is not a reliable technique for monitoring field contamination and remediation due to specific issues such as the heterogeneity of the subsurface e g in terms of mineralogy including clays pore water chemistry porosity and pore space distribution the uncertainty associated with the source of contamination the long term temporal nature of the dnapl flow and release rate and the level of reliability of the resistivity image interpretation power et al 2014 the ip method sensitive to conduction processes interfacial polarization processes occurring at the pore scale noel et al 2016a noel et al 2016b leroy et al 2019 can bring complementary information on dnapl presence underground compared to ert johansson et al 2019 iravani et al 2020a however the ert and ip measured responses associated with dnapl migration in the subsurface are not quantitatively understood due to multiple sources and a lack of numerical modeling explaining the geophysical signal multiphase flow numerical modeling can be coupled with electrical current numerical modeling in porous media both for forward or inverse modeling of induced polarization to deliver a more detailed and thorough interpretation of resistivity profiles for imaging and characterizing dnapl migration and saturation underground the use of resistivity measurement linked to multiphysics modeling could help to clarify some of the mentioned ambiguity and to optimize the sampling location and frequency improve the ert and ip image interpretation and deliver a more detailed view of dnapl migration pattern over larger ranges of space and time compared with the sole use of time lapse ert there have been limited studies in the literature on the coupled simulation of dnapl transport and ert power et al 2013 developed and tested a dnapl ert model on the simulation of a theoretical test case of site contamination their model is based on implicit finite difference discretization for phase transport and forwards finite element scheme to predict the outcome resistivity they have studied and tested the accuracy and the performance of this model on a series of laboratory experiments power et al 2014 audebert et al 2016 simulated the leachate from landfills by combining time lapse ert and phase transport their work addresses more rigorously the temporal aspect of the flow on the evolution of resistivity the mentioned studies provide invaluable insights and discussions about the coupled dnapl flow and ert simulation the process of adding newly coupled physics e g heat transfer evaporation chemical reactions and their validation on in house codes are time consuming also these works do not use complementary information from ip imaginary resistivity one of the highlights of the present study is that it investigates for the first time the coupling process of multiphase flow for napl contaminations and complex resistivity evolution i e both the real part resistivity and imaginary part resistivity using a globally known numerical simulation package the numerical simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is a conceptual and mathematical challenge ataie ashtiani et al 2001 2002 the difficulty stems partly because of the nonlinear nature of the partial differential equations and the poorly defined constitutive relations of the multiphase flow in porous media ataie ashtiani and raeesi ardekani 2010 as well as the choice of the numerical discretization method helmig and huber 1998 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 the numerical modeling challenge is augmented when the set of partial differential equations associated with the electric current the poisson nernst planck equations is added to the governing equations pimenta and alves 2019 therefore coupling simulation of multiphase flow and electrical current in porous media is a challenging task and the existing tool for handling such objective efficiently is limited it is indeed more appreciable when possible to apply and examine the applicability of the existing simulation software packages for the coupling of multiphase flow and electrical current in porous media comsol is a finite element method that has gained the attention of geoscientists in the past years the main advantages of comsol are the multiple choices of different physical modules and the facility of coupling these modules with different physics and geometry involved colombano et al 2020 koohbor et al 2019 mozafari et al 2018 comsol has been especially attractive to geophysicists lately working in the field of electromagnetics making them able to couple different physical processes involved in the simulation butler and sinha 2012 butler and zhang 2016 qi et al 2019 this work attempts an examination of the coupling of dnapl migration and electrical current in porous media through established complex resistivity petrophysical relationships coupled forward numerical modeling of two phase flow and complex electrical resistivity in 3d at the laboratory scale is examined by using comsol first the governing equations for two phase fluid flow i e water and dnapl and electrical current in porous media and petrophysical relationships i e coupling equations are presented then laboratory dnapl migration experiments corresponding to dnapl tests are simulated and validated through the study partial sensitivity analyses and parameter optimization have been consicely performed to give insights mainly on complex electrical resistivity evolution in porous media the main value of the present work in the opinion of the authors is by combining and giving a more general view of the coupled simulation of dnapl migration and complex electrical resistivity in porous media compared with the previously published in the literature the presented study gives insights not only on the implementation of coupling multiphase flow and electrical current in porous media in general it attempts to interpret some of the previously published experimental results in a more inclusive view it also opens a new perspective into the use of a versatile practical and available commercial package i e comsol for this objective 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical approach and process criteria before proceeding to the mathematical models and governing equations the process of simulations and parameter estimation are briefly explained the fluid flow and electrical resistivity are coupled to be simulated simultaneously however the criteria for the parameter estimation and proceeding to the next step is not simultaneous when simulating the fluid flow and complex electrical resistivity evolution the phase saturation and fluid flow parameters are optimized until the results of the simulations and the experiments are comparable and the difference is lower than the desired tolerance the hypothesis behind this step is the fact that the current injection does not influence the two phase flow properties when the tolerance criteria for fluid flow is satisfied the phase transports for each node are translated into in phase and quadrature resistivity through the petrophysical model the electrical current is simulated until the potential difference in the desired points is obtained the results debit and complex resistivity are then compared against the experimental results if the desired tolerance is not reached the petrophysical exponents are optimized using the parameter estimation module of comsol and based on the new parameters new simulation results are obtained the same process is repeated until the desired tolerance is reached fig 1 is a flowchart showing schematically the process and the approaching algorithm used in our study 2 2 governing equations for fluid flow the fluid flow velocity of two incompressible and immiscible fluids in porous media is governed by the generalized darcy s law eq 1 and the mass balance equation eq 2 for each phase as following bear 1988 1 v α ρ α k ij k r α μ α p α ρ α g z α w n 2 ø ρ α s α t v α 0 α w n where α denotes the fluid

and waxman 1984 donaldson and siddiqui 1989 cook and waite 2018 in water wet rocks a n value around 2 can be considered for different values of s w donaldson and siddiqui 1989 the cementation exponent m is aparameter that depends on the shape and distribution of the grains mendelson and cohen 1982 it can vary from 1 2 for unconsolidated sediments to 4 for crystalline rocks and shales and is equal to values around 2 for most consolidated sandy grains and to 1 5 for spherical grains mendelson and cohen 1982 leroy et al 2008 schmutz et al 2012 in eq 19 the parameter p denotes the quadrature conductivity exponent it has been proposed in previous works that p n 1 vinegar and waxman 1984 revil 2013 however schmutz et al 2012 have shown that p can take a wider range and can be negative or positive based on the properties of the napl deng et al 2018 also have shown that p n 1 fits well when cec is low however is limited and cannot be generalized the assumption of schmutz et al 2012 is applied in this study to be able to optimize p exponent based on the results of the experimental study in eqs 18 and 20 the quantities b and λ m2 s 1 v 1 are the effective mobilities of the ions in the electrical double layer edl contributing to conduction and polarization respectively and q v is the excess of charge per unit pore volume c m 3 revil and leroy 2004 which is written as 22 q v ρ g 1 cec where ρ g is the grain density kg m 3 ρ g 2650 kg m 3 for silica materials and cec is the cation exchange capacity meq g 1 1 meq g 1 96320 c kg 1 the cec is usually used to measure the adsorption capabilities of clays such as montmorillonite and illite presenting a permanent negative surface charge due to isomorphic substitutions e g the replacement of al3 by mg2 or fe2 ions in the octahedral sheets leroy et al 2007 however the cec measurement is not convenient for silica materials such as glass beads that have a low specific surface area ss typically below 1 m2 g 1 okay et al 2014 and a negative surface charge density q 0 strongly increasing with ph and salinity leroy et al 2013 according to okay et al 2014 a more convenient way to consider the adsorption capabilities of silica materials is to express the cec as the minus of the product of the specific surface area with the surface charge density of the mineral which both can be measured sverjensky 2005 i e 23 cec s s q 0 in our study eq 18 for the in phase conductivity resumes archie s second law archie 1942 because the cec of glass beads is very low hence q v is very low eq 22 and therefore σ w s w bq v 24 σ s w σ w f s w n however q v can still be used to explain quadrature conductivity measurements eqs 19 and 20 it should be noted that almpanis et al 2021 used the petrophysical model developed by revil and co workers we named it the r model to explain their complex resistivity measurements on rocks contaminated by dnapl both the r model and ours are based on the model of vinegar and waxman 1984 our models differ by the fact that the r model considers the separated contribution of the stern and diffuse layers to surface conductivity whereas our model doesn t distinguish the stern layer from the diffuse layer contribution to surface conductivity by considering the electrical double layer as a whole we simplified the r model to decrease the number of parameters because most of the parameter values e g the ion mobilities and concentrations are not accurately known 2 4 experimental set ups for validation and parameter estimation purposes experiments performed by colombano et al 2021a 2021b were simulated in the present study a series of fill up pumping experiments in a rectangular tank with a low thickness i e 2d tank packed with glass beads gb were performed the name 2d comes from the 2d dimensional character of flow in this tank previous experiments using imaging time domain reflectometer sensors and mass balance analysis showed a 2d flow behavior except for a minor 3d effect near the pumping point in the middle center of the tank philippe et al 2021 however the character of the electric field can be in 3d a 3d geometry is used to simulate the flow and electrical fields the 2d tank 50 cm 30 cm 7 cm made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is used for performing the experiments the front face of the 2d tank is made from a 1 cm thick glass allowing the process of the fluid flow to be directly photographed the photos are later analyzed to give the phase saturation evolution through the experiment five injection pumping nozzles located at the bottom side of the central reservoir allow for imposing various flow boundary conditions the x z plane dimensions i e profile view and the positions of the injection pumping nozzles are shown in fig 2a and the x y plane dimensions i e plan view are shown in fig 2b the full description of the 2d tank experiments can be found in colombano et al 2021a 2021b colombano et al 2021a took photographs taken from the set up in gradual time steps of the experiments and analyzed and processed the raw photographs to convert them to optical density maps the obtained images were used to see the water and dnapl saturation at each time step of the experiment as well as the location of the interface between the two phases electrical resistivity was monitored simultaneously throughout the experiments in total 30 non polarizable potential cu cuso4 electrodes and 30 rods of stainless steel current electrodes were arranged and embedded in the 2d tank for the course of experiments for azimuthal and square configurations see fig 3a and b see colombano et al 2021b for a detailed description of electrode configuration and positioning the results of the fluid flow simulation in this study is compared with some of the photo taken by colombano et al 2021a 3 numerical simulation tool and scenarios the system of partial differential equations eqs 1 and 2 and eqs 10 to 13 is discretized using the finite element method and solved in comsol software package the models are constructed as an abstraction of the experimental set ups in three dimensions with identical geometry and boundary conditions i e a cuboid of 50 cm 30 cm 7 cm in respectively x z and y directions three modular physics phase transport in porous media darcy s law and electric current are included and coupled to simulate the experiments the phase transport equations and darcy s law are coupled and discretized with pressure saturation formulation the pressure from one phase e g water and the saturation from the other phase e g dnapl are chosen as the primary variables throughout the solution the parameters used in the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships for the two phase transport are listed in table 1 two consecutive scenarios mimicking the two different parts of the experiments are introduced and shortly explained in the following 1 the fill up scenario initially the 2d tank is filled with water saturated gb dnapl is injected from the bottom of the tank uniformly until the dnapl level reaches the midpoint of the tank z 15 cm see fig 4a the fluid boundary and initial conditions used for the fluid flow are depicted in fig 5a for this scenario 2 the pumping scenario initially the 2d tank is filled halfway down with dnapl saturated gb s n 1 s rw where s n is dnapl saturation and s rw is water residual saturation and halfway up with water saturated gb dnapl is pumped from the midpoint at the bottom of the tank z 0 and x 0 25 see fig 4b the fluid boundary and initial conditions used for the fluid flow are depicted in fig 5c for this scenario for coupling the phase transport and the electrical current the petrophysical relationships introduced earlier in the governing equations are applied in the current conservation submodule the constitutive relations between electrical current density and electrical field offer predefined choices including the generalized archie s laws eqs 21 and 24 however for flexibility of the simulations and the calibration of the results eqs 24 and 19 to 23 were applied for the porous medium in phase conductivity σ and quadrature conductivity σ respectively the schematic boundary and initial conditions used for the simulation of the two phase flow and electrical current in both parts of the simulations are depicted in fig 5a and c and fig 5b and d for the fill up test and the pumping test respectively among the several resistivity configurations used throughout the experiment originally stated 47 configurations in the work of colombano et al 2021b 5 configurations were selected for simulations and parameter estimation in this work the main criteria for choosing these configurations were first brevity in the representation of similar configurations and second to choose the adjacent configurations with the least reported errors that occurred during the experiments the selected configurations are shown in fig 5e approximately 145 k tetrahedron elements were used for the simulations the mesh gridding in 3d can be seen in fig 5f 4 results and discussions 4 1 validation of the multiphase flow model different approaches have been developed to solve the two phase flow partial differential equations these approaches are chosen and applied depending on the formulation of the problems and the boundary conditions the desired accuracy computation effort and the available tools e g the capabilities of the numerical solver in this work the pressure saturation formulation was used for the phase transport the pressure from the non wetting phase dnapl and saturation from the wetting phase water are chosen as the independent variables and the problem is discretized and solved based on these two variables the two dependent variables i e the remaining pressure and saturation are obtained from mass balance and capillary pressure relationships eqs 3 and 4 the pressure saturation formulation of the phase transport module in comsol has the advantage of increasing the number of phases in the model by expressing the relative permeability vs saturation behavior for each phase without the much complications moreover the coupling of the phase transport and the electrical resistivity is directly possible hence it is efficient to use this approach comparing with other approaches that can be formulated into comsol the validation of the fluid flow simulations for the pumping scenario is done by comparing the results of the simulations and the experiments in steady state conditions see fig 6a b and c as for the time dependent results see fig 6d the retrieved volume of the dnapl pumping out dnapl from the bottom nozzle i e what is called vdnapl is compared between the model and the see colombano et al 2021a for more description regarding vdnapl the results of the simulations are quite aligned and compatible with the experiments giving confidence regarding the validity of the simulation assumptions there is a relatively small oscillation observed for simulated dnapl saturation which can be due to the insufficiency of the mesh refinement in the 3d simulations normally by refining the mesh and by imposing numerical diffusion for stabilization of the solution the dnapl waterfront would be smoothed out however oscillations are inherent when solving an advection problem with conventional standard finite element discretization the compatibility of the simulations and the experiments give confidence in the validity of our fluid flow simulation using the multiphase transport module in comsol 4 2 parameter estimation and validation of the electrical resistivity model in fill up test the potential of comsol for parameter estimation and optimization tool is aimed to be used for calibrating the petrophysical parameters and estimation of complex conductivity in the process of the simulations water saturation values from the two phase flow simulations are input parameter values to the complex conductivity model table 2 shows the estimated petrophysical parameter values in eqs 19 and 24 based on the results of the parameter estimation of in phase σ and quadrature σ conductivities a frequency of 1 46 hz is chosen to minimize the noises due to potential electrode polarization contact impedance and electromagnetic coupling effects mendieta et al 2021 and to be consistent with field measurements colombano et al 2020 iravani et al 2020a 2020b the not fitted electrical formation factor f is equal to 4 26 according to the measured porosity of the glass bead pack 0 38 and the cementation exponent of 1 5 for spherical glass beads eq 21 and the measured water conductivity σ w is 0 035 s m 1 the quadrature conductivity at full saturation table 2 is explained using the modified vinegar and waxman 1984 model eqs 20 22 and 23 as well as a value of 5 10 8 m2 s 1 v 1 for the mean counter ion mobility in the edl leroy et al 2008 a cec of 6 10 6 meq g 1 was obtained which corresponds to a surface charge density q 0 of 0 127c m 2 considering a calculated mean specific surface area of 0 00453 m2 g 1 for the 0 5 mm gb assuming them perfectly smooth this q 0 value is an upper bound of the surface charge density values commonly reported in the literature for silica materials sverjensky 2005 leroy et al 2008 however in our specific surface area calculations we considered perfectly smooth glass beads and rougher glass beads have a higher specific surface area implying a lower surface charge density magnitude for the same cec eq 23 the results of the fill up test simulations for the complex resistivity after the parameter estimation for configurations a b c and d fig 5e are shown in fig 7 ρ ρ iρ 1 σ 1 σ iσ the results for configuration e showed significantly high resistivity values and high values of oscillation which the resistivity profiles of this configuration had adverse effects on the optimization process of parameter estimation and the validation of the other configurations the authors think these high oscillations might have been due to the failure of the injection electrodes or the highly resistive dnapl coating around the electrodes for the fore mentioned reason it was decided that this point be exempt from the parameter estimation module and the validation process the model predictions were compared to the 16 measurements regarding the different dnapl heights in the 2d tank which is called dnapl level from this point forward i e z value of the water and dnapl interface the results show consistent agreement and validate the general approach and the choice of the petrophysical model for configurations a dipole dipole array and c wenner alpha array figs 7a b e f since the potential electrodes are located in water saturated parts of the tank i e on the top half throughout the experiment no significant variation of resistivity i e real part and imaginary part is observed and except some minor numerical oscillations the resistivity values are fixed at those of gb saturated with water for configuration b fig 7c and d it is seen that at the moment that the dnapl front passes both potential electrodes and approaches the first current injection electrode the values of the resistivity start to increase sharply meaning that the electrical field distribution is affected by the resistivity contrast of more resistive dnapl as soon as the dnapl front passes the first injection electrode i e dnapl front located between the two injection electrodes the increasing resistivity values reach a constant value associated with the resistivity of the porous medium residually saturated with water i e when s n 1 s rw 0 75 in configuration d fig 7g and h an analogous behavior to configuration b is observed however because the dnapl front does not pass the second potential electrode the resistivity only increases and does not reach the resistivity values associated with dnapl saturated state i e when s n 1 s rw it is interesting to notice that the real and imaginary resistivity follow the same behavior associated with the decrease of water saturation due to the dnapl rise validating the assumption of the petrophysical model that water saturation is the most important parameter controling complex resistivity of non wetting napl as emphasized by revil et al 2011 for demonstration of the sensitivity of resistivity values to the petrophysical exponents fig 8a represents the variation of the real part of the modeled resistivity for configuration d when the second archie s law eq 24 is applied the range of values for this brief sensitivity assessment is based on the calculated values of the standard deviation for exponents n and p through the simulation and optimization process the sensitivity of the modeled resistivity to the water saturation exponent n is augmented when the water saturation around the current and potential electrodes is low and approaching the residual value in other words when the dnapl is approaching the points of current injection and measured voltage it is observed that for the range shown a slight error in the proper estimation of water exponent can lead to relative errors as large as 400 locally in the estimation of resistivity for better quantification of the error table 3 shows the values of mean average error mae over the full coarse of the fill up test simulation for a specific value of saturation and quadrature exponent it is seen that the mae is least when the values are the exponents are close to those of reported by parameter estimation in table 2 which is expected this calibration process can be extended to the fluid flow and phase transport properties for further refinement of the uncertainty results and increasing the accuracy of the simulations in the remediation process on the other hand the sensitivity of the quadrature resistivity ρ to p see eq 19 is not quite high in the range of interest see fig 8b thus a rough estimation of this parameter would suffice the process of simulations for this problem it is proposed that a brief sensitivity analysis should be performed in preliminary studies in field measurements to state which parameters need to be refined in the process of measurement 4 3 the results of the pumping test the estimated parameters obtained from the previous section are applied to the simulation of the electrical response of the pumping test on 2d tank for the pumping flow rate of 220 ml min 1 for the sake of brevity and conciseness only one configuration of current injection is considered in the 2d tank which corresponds to the configuration d stated earlier in fig 4e this configuration is subject to strong variation compared to other configurations fig 9 simultaneously shows the simulated spatial distribution of the dnapl saturation in phase resistivity and quadrature resistivity in the tank in 3d for three time frames the first column in the matrix format of fig 9 shows the beginning of the simulation at t 0 s when the dnapl front is exactly located in the mid point between the injection electrodes the second column shows the results at t 100 s and when the dnapl front is approaching the second injection electrode finally the third column shows the simulated dnapl depression cone at t 500 s it would be interesting to compare the results of these simulations of the complex resistivity resulting from dnapl pumping to corresponding electrical impedance tomography measurements such as those shown by chambers et al 2004 simulating electrical impedance from surface location of the electrodes as usually performed on the field would be of particular interest the spatial distribution figures though giving invaluable insights regarding the qualitative behavior of the complex resistivity in the domain are not sufficient for the quantitative investigation of the resistivity and comparison with the actual results of the experiments reported by colombano et al 2021b for this purpose resistivity evolution is depicted for the three configurations c d and e corresponding to the top of the tank just below the middle of the tank and close to the bottom respectively the results of the in phase and quadrature resistivity evolution are depicted in fig 10a and b respectively in fig 10a and b the dnapl migration does not affect the evolution of ρ and ρ on configuration c as this configuration is located in the water saturated parts of the 2d tank throughout the experiment s w 1 for the d and e configurations initially there is an underestimation of the resistivity for the models the distribution between wetting and non wetting fluid in the experiment generates a strong resistivity gradient with the consequence of channeling the current and underestimating the resistivity jougnot et al 2018 in the models for the d and e configurations and during pumping however a sharp decrease of resistivities is observed at the point that the dnapl front passes through the injection electrodes for each of these configurations the resistivities i e both real part and imaginary parts do not converge to the resistivity of configuration c though the reason for this is the residual saturation of the dnapl that remains in the cone of depression of retrieved dnapl i e s rn 0 1 thus s w 0 9 the results are compatible with those obtained by colombano et al 2021b however it seems that the slope of the evolution is sharper in the simulations in this work than those obtained by them using image analysis interpretation aside from the graphical representation i e colombano et al 2021b used logarithmic scale on the vertical axis and in this work a real scale is used the main reason is the way they have interpreted the bulk resistivity in each cell the mean saturation in a 5 cm 5 cm is translated into resistivity and that smoothen the resistivity front however in this work the resistivity discretization accuracy depends on the mesh grid size used for the finite element simulation and can catch local evolutions better than a bulk averaging aside from this generally the results are in accordance giving confidence in the results obtained by colombano et al 2021b and this work 5 conclusions the finite element software comsol is used to simulate in 3d dnapl flow and the resulting complex resistivity in a 2d tank for that purpose the phase transport module with the pressure saturation formulation was coupled with the electrical current module via petrophysical relationships describing complex resistivity the main advantage of the pressure saturation formulation is the flexibility of the phase transport module in adding more phases e g gas or light non aqueous phase liquid without significant complications of constitutive relationships the petrophysical relationships that were used to link the water saturation and complex electrical conductivity or resistivity considering interfacial properties are based on the vinegar and waxman 1984 model the domain of the simulations is identical to the dnapl filling up and pumping test experiments performed in colombano et al 2021a 2021b parameter estimation is performed by matching measured to computed in phase and quadrature resistivities during the filling up experiment to further refine the range of variability and the value of the parameters of the petrophysical relationships the results of the simulations of the two phase flow are validated against the image and complex resistivity measurements reported in colombano et al 2021a 2021b further supporting their results and the novelty of their work and also giving a broader view of what happens in the 2d tank through the experiment 3d complex resistivity profiles of dnapl migration during pumping are simulated and validated against the experimental results this work further supports the idea of coupling multiphase flow and electrical current simulation in porous media as an effective numerical tool for the study of dnapl migration and remediation underground comsol is evaluated for this purpose and proposed to be an invaluable tool for such purpose having a user friendly interface with moderate abilities to extend the physics associated with the problem of interest both at the preliminary study level and at post processing it is suggested that the abilities of this artifact in more realistic simulations of field scale dnapl contamination studies it is also suggested that further investigation regarding multiphase flow with more immiscible phases simulations be coupled with electrical current simulations in porous media as well as using electrical impedance tomography to check the results of the simulations in future studies credit authorship contribution statement

1293,induced polarization ip is a non intrusive geophysical method to monitor dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination and remediation processes underground in this study an advanced numerical code simulating dnapl flow and complex electrical resistivity is presented the model was validated against existing ip results and image measurements that were carried out previously in a series of 2d tank experiment multiphase flow modeling in porous media is coupled with electrical current modeling to simulate the process of dnapl migration and the associated ip response this brings a broader view of the contamination in space and time compared to surface and borehole measurements especially when the results are supported by field measurements or laboratory experiments the simulations are developed in 3d and are performed in comsol multiphysics the simulations using petrophysical relationships for in phase and quadrature resistivity and the results of the experiments are in complete accordance with each other in the parts of the tank where the saturation of dnapl is relatively low i e especially in the cone of depression in the pumping scenario however the parts associated with high saturation of dnapl show high errors between the in phase resistivity simulations and the results from experiments the present work can be regarded as a preliminary study toward further applications of coupled ip multiphase flow for more accurate detection and monitoring of dnapls it is suggested that the choice of tool approach in this study be extended to larger scale studies for further investigation keywords comsol multiphysics dense non aqueous phase liquid induced polarization two phase flow in porous media 1 introduction soils sediments and groundwater are increasingly endangered by anthropogenic contamination especially industrial pollutants from accidental spills leaks or improper management song et al 2017 among persistent organic pollutants dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls including chlorinated solvents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are commonly present in contaminated sites dnapls are known to be toxic and carcinogenic for humans and their contamination of soils and aquifers is of great environmental concern khan et al 2004 they are also among the most difficult pollutants to treat in site remediation due to their high density leading them to migrate below the water table kram et al 2001 their rate limited dissolution and resulting mass transfer limitations can lead to long term aquifer persistence for even small volumetric fractions qin et al 2007 the effective remediation of fields contaminated with dnapls requires proper mapping of the contaminant plume and release rate geoelectrical methods e g electrical resistivity tomography ert induced polarization ip categorized as non invasive geophysical methods have considerable potentials to be applied on dnapl site assessment and remediation monitoring both on preliminary studies and post treatment brewster et al 1995 minsley et al 2007 cardarelli and di filippo 2009 chambers et al 2010 naudet et al 2014 orlando and palladini 2018 steelman et al 2017 time lapse ert and ip are very sensitive to the displacement of charge carriers associated with dnapl presence and can give an estimate of the spatial distribution of the contaminant in real time which is of paramount importance for the monitoring however the exclusive use of time lapse ert is not a reliable technique for monitoring field contamination and remediation due to specific issues such as the heterogeneity of the subsurface e g in terms of mineralogy including clays pore water chemistry porosity and pore space distribution the uncertainty associated with the source of contamination the long term temporal nature of the dnapl flow and release rate and the level of reliability of the resistivity image interpretation power et al 2014 the ip method sensitive to conduction processes interfacial polarization processes occurring at the pore scale noel et al 2016a noel et al 2016b leroy et al 2019 can bring complementary information on dnapl presence underground compared to ert johansson et al 2019 iravani et al 2020a however the ert and ip measured responses associated with dnapl migration in the subsurface are not quantitatively understood due to multiple sources and a lack of numerical modeling explaining the geophysical signal multiphase flow numerical modeling can be coupled with electrical current numerical modeling in porous media both for forward or inverse modeling of induced polarization to deliver a more detailed and thorough interpretation of resistivity profiles for imaging and characterizing dnapl migration and saturation underground the use of resistivity measurement linked to multiphysics modeling could help to clarify some of the mentioned ambiguity and to optimize the sampling location and frequency improve the ert and ip image interpretation and deliver a more detailed view of dnapl migration pattern over larger ranges of space and time compared with the sole use of time lapse ert there have been limited studies in the literature on the coupled simulation of dnapl transport and ert power et al 2013 developed and tested a dnapl ert model on the simulation of a theoretical test case of site contamination their model is based on implicit finite difference discretization for phase transport and forwards finite element scheme to predict the outcome resistivity they have studied and tested the accuracy and the performance of this model on a series of laboratory experiments power et al 2014 audebert et al 2016 simulated the leachate from landfills by combining time lapse ert and phase transport their work addresses more rigorously the temporal aspect of the flow on the evolution of resistivity the mentioned studies provide invaluable insights and discussions about the coupled dnapl flow and ert simulation the process of adding newly coupled physics e g heat transfer evaporation chemical reactions and their validation on in house codes are time consuming also these works do not use complementary information from ip imaginary resistivity one of the highlights of the present study is that it investigates for the first time the coupling process of multiphase flow for napl contaminations and complex resistivity evolution i e both the real part resistivity and imaginary part resistivity using a globally known numerical simulation package the numerical simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is a conceptual and mathematical challenge ataie ashtiani et al 2001 2002 the difficulty stems partly because of the nonlinear nature of the partial differential equations and the poorly defined constitutive relations of the multiphase flow in porous media ataie ashtiani and raeesi ardekani 2010 as well as the choice of the numerical discretization method helmig and huber 1998 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 the numerical modeling challenge is augmented when the set of partial differential equations associated with the electric current the poisson nernst planck equations is added to the governing equations pimenta and alves 2019 therefore coupling simulation of multiphase flow and electrical current in porous media is a challenging task and the existing tool for handling such objective efficiently is limited it is indeed more appreciable when possible to apply and examine the applicability of the existing simulation software packages for the coupling of multiphase flow and electrical current in porous media comsol is a finite element method that has gained the attention of geoscientists in the past years the main advantages of comsol are the multiple choices of different physical modules and the facility of coupling these modules with different physics and geometry involved colombano et al 2020 koohbor et al 2019 mozafari et al 2018 comsol has been especially attractive to geophysicists lately working in the field of electromagnetics making them able to couple different physical processes involved in the simulation butler and sinha 2012 butler and zhang 2016 qi et al 2019 this work attempts an examination of the coupling of dnapl migration and electrical current in porous media through established complex resistivity petrophysical relationships coupled forward numerical modeling of two phase flow and complex electrical resistivity in 3d at the laboratory scale is examined by using comsol first the governing equations for two phase fluid flow i e water and dnapl and electrical current in porous media and petrophysical relationships i e coupling equations are presented then laboratory dnapl migration experiments corresponding to dnapl tests are simulated and validated through the study partial sensitivity analyses and parameter optimization have been consicely performed to give insights mainly on complex electrical resistivity evolution in porous media the main value of the present work in the opinion of the authors is by combining and giving a more general view of the coupled simulation of dnapl migration and complex electrical resistivity in porous media compared with the previously published in the literature the presented study gives insights not only on the implementation of coupling multiphase flow and electrical current in porous media in general it attempts to interpret some of the previously published experimental results in a more inclusive view it also opens a new perspective into the use of a versatile practical and available commercial package i e comsol for this objective 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical approach and process criteria before proceeding to the mathematical models and governing equations the process of simulations and parameter estimation are briefly explained the fluid flow and electrical resistivity are coupled to be simulated simultaneously however the criteria for the parameter estimation and proceeding to the next step is not simultaneous when simulating the fluid flow and complex electrical resistivity evolution the phase saturation and fluid flow parameters are optimized until the results of the simulations and the experiments are comparable and the difference is lower than the desired tolerance the hypothesis behind this step is the fact that the current injection does not influence the two phase flow properties when the tolerance criteria for fluid flow is satisfied the phase transports for each node are translated into in phase and quadrature resistivity through the petrophysical model the electrical current is simulated until the potential difference in the desired points is obtained the results debit and complex resistivity are then compared against the experimental results if the desired tolerance is not reached the petrophysical exponents are optimized using the parameter estimation module of comsol and based on the new parameters new simulation results are obtained the same process is repeated until the desired tolerance is reached fig 1 is a flowchart showing schematically the process and the approaching algorithm used in our study 2 2 governing equations for fluid flow the fluid flow velocity of two incompressible and immiscible fluids in porous media is governed by the generalized darcy s law eq 1 and the mass balance equation eq 2 for each phase as following bear 1988 1 v α ρ α k ij k r α μ α p α ρ α g z α w n 2 ø ρ α s α t v α 0 α w n where α denotes the fluid phase w for the wetting phase e g water and n for the non wetting phase e g dnapl ø is the porosity s is the saturation of the fluid k ij m2 is the tensor of intrinsic permeability k r is the relative permeability ρ kg m 3 is the density of the fluid not to be confused with the electrical resistance μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity p pa is the pressure g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration vector and z is the direction of gravity assuming there is no gas phase the sum of the fluid phase saturations is equal to one 3 s w s n 1 phase pressures are linked through the capillary pressure as follows 4 p c s w p n p w where p c pa is the capillary pressure and p n pa and p w pa are the pressure of dnapl and water phases respectively in this work van genuchten mualem vgm equations mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 were used to relate the capillary pressure to the phase saturations 5 p c p d s ew 1 m vg 1 1 n vg 6 m vg 1 1 n vg 7 s ew s w s rw 1 s rw s rn 8 k rw s ew 0 5 1 1 s ew 1 m vg m

are respectively the residual saturations of wetting phase e g water and dnapl ataie ashtiani and raeesi ardekani 2010 2 3 electrical current and petrophysical relationships the system of partial differential equations of electrical current ohm s law reads nabighian 1988 10 j q j v 11 j σ e 12 e v 13 σ σ iσ where j is the electrical current density a m 2 q j v is the current source intensity a

resistivity ρ is the quadrature or out of phase resistivity ohm m i e the imaginary part of resistivity and φ is the out phasing angle rad the system of partial differential equations that describes the fluid flow eqs 1 to 9 should be linked to the system of partial differential equations that describe the electric current eqs 10 to 13 through petrophysical relationships the petrophysical model of vinegar and waxman 1984 is used to compute the in phase and quadrature conductivities of the porous medium as a function of water saturation and interfacial properties 18 σ s w s w n f σ w b q v s

exponent and m is the cementation exponent the saturation exponent n expresses the effect on the conductivity of desaturating the sample or replacing water with a non conductive fluid archie n values are generally calibrated in a laboratory by measuring conductivity on a sample at multiple oil or gas saturations n values are related to saturation wettability microporosity and clay content vinegar and waxman 1984 donaldson and siddiqui 1989 cook and waite 2018 in water wet rocks a n value around 2 can be considered for different values of s w donaldson and siddiqui 1989 the cementation exponent m is aparameter that depends on the shape and distribution of the grains mendelson and cohen 1982 it can vary from 1 2 for unconsolidated sediments to 4 for crystalline rocks and shales and is equal to values around 2 for most consolidated sandy grains and to 1 5 for spherical grains mendelson and cohen 1982 leroy et al 2008 schmutz et al 2012 in eq 19 the parameter p denotes the quadrature conductivity exponent it has been proposed in previous works that p n 1 vinegar and waxman 1984 revil 2013 however schmutz et al 2012 have shown that p can take a wider range and can be negative or positive based on the properties of the napl deng et al 2018 also have shown that p n 1 fits well when cec is low however is limited and cannot be generalized the assumption of schmutz et al 2012 is applied in this study to be able to optimize p exponent based on the results of the experimental study in eqs 18 and 20 the quantities b and λ m2 s 1 v 1 are the effective mobilities of the ions in the electrical double layer edl contributing to conduction and polarization respectively and q v is the excess of charge per unit pore volume c m 3 revil and leroy 2004 which is written as 22 q v ρ g 1 cec where ρ g is the grain density kg m 3 ρ g 2650 kg m 3 for silica materials and cec is the cation exchange capacity meq g 1 1 meq g 1 96320 c kg 1 the cec is usually used to measure the adsorption capabilities of clays such as montmorillonite and illite presenting a permanent negative surface charge due to isomorphic substitutions e g the replacement of al3 by mg2 or fe2 ions in the octahedral sheets leroy et al 2007 however the cec measurement is not convenient for silica materials such as glass beads that have a low specific surface area ss typically below 1 m2 g 1 okay et al 2014 and a negative surface charge density q 0 strongly increasing with ph and salinity leroy et al 2013 according to okay et al 2014 a more convenient way to consider the adsorption capabilities of silica materials is to express the cec as the minus of the product of the specific surface area with the surface charge density of the mineral which both can be measured sverjensky 2005 i e 23 cec s s q 0 in our study eq 18 for the in phase conductivity resumes archie s second law archie 1942 because the cec of glass beads is very low hence q v is very low eq 22 and therefore σ w s w bq v 24 σ s w σ w f s w n however q v can still be used to explain quadrature conductivity measurements eqs 19 and 20 it should be noted that almpanis et al 2021 used the petrophysical model developed by revil and co workers we named it the r model to explain their complex resistivity measurements on rocks contaminated by dnapl both the r model and ours are based on the model of vinegar and waxman 1984 our models differ by the fact that the r model considers the separated contribution of the stern and diffuse layers to surface conductivity whereas our model doesn t distinguish the stern layer from the diffuse layer contribution to surface conductivity by considering the electrical double layer as a whole we simplified the r model to decrease the number of parameters because most of the parameter values e g the ion mobilities and concentrations are not accurately known 2 4 experimental set ups for validation and parameter estimation purposes experiments performed by colombano et al 2021a 2021b were simulated in the present study a series of fill up pumping experiments in a rectangular tank with a low thickness i e 2d tank packed with glass beads gb were performed the name 2d comes from the 2d dimensional character of flow in this tank previous experiments using imaging time domain reflectometer sensors and mass balance analysis showed a 2d flow behavior except for a minor 3d effect near the pumping point in the middle center of the tank philippe et al 2021 however the character of the electric field can be in 3d a 3d geometry is used to simulate the flow and electrical fields the 2d tank 50 cm 30 cm 7 cm made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is used for performing the experiments the front face of the 2d tank is made from a 1 cm thick glass allowing the process of the fluid flow to be directly photographed the photos are later analyzed to give the phase saturation evolution through the experiment five injection pumping nozzles located at the bottom side of the central reservoir allow for imposing various flow boundary conditions the x z plane dimensions i e profile view and the positions of the injection pumping nozzles are shown in fig 2a and the x y plane dimensions i e plan view are shown in fig 2b the full description of the 2d tank experiments can be found in colombano et al 2021a 2021b colombano et al 2021a took photographs taken from the set up in gradual time steps of the experiments and analyzed and processed the raw photographs to convert them to optical density maps the obtained images were used to see the water and dnapl saturation at each time step of the experiment as well as the location of the interface between the two phases electrical resistivity was monitored simultaneously throughout the experiments in total 30 non polarizable potential cu cuso4 electrodes and 30 rods of stainless steel current electrodes were arranged and embedded in the 2d tank for the course of experiments for azimuthal and square configurations see fig 3a and b see colombano et al 2021b for a detailed description of electrode configuration and positioning the results of the fluid flow simulation in this study is compared with some of the photo taken by colombano et al 2021a 3 numerical simulation tool and scenarios the system of partial differential equations eqs 1 and 2 and eqs 10 to 13 is discretized using the finite element method and solved in comsol software package the models are constructed as an abstraction of the experimental set ups in three dimensions with identical geometry and boundary conditions i e a cuboid of 50 cm 30 cm 7 cm in respectively x z and y directions three modular physics phase transport in porous media darcy s law and electric current are included and coupled to simulate the experiments the phase transport equations and darcy s law are coupled and discretized with pressure saturation formulation the pressure from one phase e g water and the saturation from the other phase e g dnapl are chosen as the primary variables throughout the solution the parameters used in the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships for the two phase transport are listed in table 1 two consecutive scenarios mimicking the two different parts of the experiments are introduced and shortly explained in the following 1 the fill up scenario initially the 2d tank is filled with water saturated gb dnapl is injected from the bottom of the tank uniformly until the dnapl level reaches the midpoint of the tank z 15 cm see fig 4a the fluid boundary and initial conditions used for the fluid flow are depicted in fig 5a for this scenario 2 the pumping scenario initially the 2d tank is filled halfway down with dnapl saturated gb s n 1 s rw where s n is dnapl saturation and s rw is water residual saturation and halfway up with water saturated gb dnapl is pumped from the midpoint at the bottom of the tank z 0 and x 0 25 see fig 4b the fluid boundary and initial conditions used for the fluid flow are depicted in fig 5c for this scenario for coupling the phase transport and the electrical current the petrophysical relationships introduced earlier in the governing equations are applied in the current conservation submodule the constitutive relations between electrical current density and electrical field offer predefined choices including the generalized archie s laws eqs 21 and 24 however for flexibility of the simulations and the calibration of the results eqs 24 and 19 to 23 were applied for the porous medium in phase conductivity σ and quadrature conductivity σ respectively the schematic boundary and initial conditions used for the simulation of the two phase flow and electrical current in both parts of the simulations are depicted in fig 5a and c and fig 5b and d for the fill up test and the pumping test respectively among the several resistivity configurations used throughout the experiment originally stated 47 configurations in the work of colombano et al 2021b 5 configurations were selected for simulations and parameter estimation in this work the main criteria for choosing these configurations were first brevity in the representation of similar configurations and second to choose the adjacent configurations with the least reported errors that occurred during the experiments the selected configurations are shown in fig 5e approximately 145 k tetrahedron elements were used for the simulations the mesh gridding in 3d can be seen in fig 5f 4 results and discussions 4 1 validation of the multiphase flow model different approaches have been developed to solve the two phase flow partial differential equations these approaches are chosen and applied depending on the formulation of the problems and the boundary conditions the desired accuracy computation effort and the available tools e g the capabilities of the numerical solver in this work the pressure saturation formulation was used for the phase transport the pressure from the non wetting phase dnapl and saturation from the wetting phase water are chosen as the independent variables and the problem is discretized and solved based on these two variables the two dependent variables i e the remaining pressure and saturation are obtained from mass balance and capillary pressure relationships eqs 3 and 4 the pressure saturation formulation of the phase transport module in comsol has the advantage of increasing the number of phases in the model by expressing the relative permeability vs saturation behavior for each phase without the much complications moreover the coupling of the phase transport and the electrical resistivity is directly possible hence it is efficient to use this approach comparing with other approaches that can be formulated into comsol the validation of the fluid flow simulations for the pumping scenario is done by comparing the results of the simulations and the experiments in steady state conditions see fig 6a b and c as for the time dependent results see fig 6d the retrieved volume of the dnapl pumping out dnapl from the bottom nozzle i e what is called vdnapl is compared between the model and the see colombano et al 2021a for more description regarding vdnapl the results of the simulations are quite aligned and compatible with the experiments giving confidence regarding the validity of the simulation assumptions there is a relatively small oscillation observed for simulated dnapl saturation which can be due to the insufficiency of the mesh refinement in the 3d simulations normally by refining the mesh and by imposing numerical diffusion for stabilization of the solution the dnapl waterfront would be smoothed out however oscillations are inherent when solving an advection problem with conventional standard finite element discretization the compatibility of the simulations and the experiments give confidence in the validity of our fluid flow simulation using the multiphase transport module in comsol 4 2 parameter estimation and validation of the electrical resistivity model in fill up test the potential of comsol for parameter estimation and optimization tool is aimed to be used for calibrating the petrophysical parameters and estimation of complex conductivity in the process of the simulations water saturation values from the two phase flow simulations are input parameter values to the complex conductivity model table 2 shows the estimated petrophysical parameter values in eqs 19 and 24 based on the results of the parameter estimation of in phase σ and quadrature σ conductivities a frequency of 1 46 hz is chosen to minimize the noises due to potential electrode polarization contact impedance and electromagnetic coupling effects mendieta et al 2021 and to be consistent with field measurements colombano et al 2020 iravani et al 2020a 2020b the not fitted electrical formation factor f is equal to 4 26 according to the measured porosity of the glass bead pack 0 38 and the cementation exponent of 1 5 for spherical glass beads eq 21 and the measured water conductivity σ w is 0 035 s m 1 the quadrature conductivity at full saturation table 2 is explained using the modified vinegar and waxman 1984 model eqs 20 22 and 23 as well as a value of 5 10 8 m2 s 1 v 1 for the mean counter ion mobility in the edl leroy et al 2008 a cec of 6 10 6 meq g 1 was obtained which corresponds to a surface charge density q 0 of 0 127c m 2 considering a calculated mean specific surface area of 0 00453 m2 g 1 for the 0 5 mm gb assuming them perfectly smooth this q 0 value is an upper bound of the surface charge density values commonly reported in the literature for silica materials sverjensky 2005 leroy et al 2008 however in our specific surface area calculations we considered perfectly smooth glass beads and rougher glass beads have a higher specific surface area implying a lower surface charge density magnitude for the same cec eq 23 the results of the fill up test simulations for the complex resistivity after the parameter estimation for configurations a b c and d fig 5e are shown in fig 7 ρ ρ iρ 1 σ 1 σ iσ the results for configuration e showed significantly high resistivity values and high values of oscillation which the resistivity profiles of this configuration had adverse effects on the optimization process of parameter estimation and the validation of the other configurations the authors think these high oscillations might have been due to the failure of the injection electrodes or the highly resistive dnapl coating around the electrodes for the fore mentioned reason it was decided that this point be exempt from the parameter estimation module and the validation process the model predictions were compared to the 16 measurements regarding the different dnapl heights in the 2d tank which is called dnapl level from this point forward i e z value of the water and dnapl interface the results show consistent agreement and validate the general approach and the choice of the petrophysical model for configurations a dipole dipole array and c wenner alpha array figs 7a b e f since the potential electrodes are located in water saturated parts of the tank i e on the top half throughout the experiment no significant variation of resistivity i e real part and imaginary part is observed and except some minor numerical oscillations the resistivity values are fixed at those of gb saturated with water for configuration b fig 7c and d it is seen that at the moment that the dnapl front passes both potential electrodes and approaches the first current injection electrode the values of the resistivity start to increase sharply meaning that the electrical field distribution is affected by the resistivity contrast of more resistive dnapl as soon as the dnapl front passes the first injection electrode i e dnapl front located between the two injection electrodes the increasing resistivity values reach a constant value associated with the resistivity of the porous medium residually saturated with water i e when s n 1 s rw 0 75 in configuration d fig 7g and h an analogous behavior to configuration b is observed however because the dnapl front does not pass the second potential electrode the resistivity only increases and does not reach the resistivity values associated with dnapl saturated state i e when s n 1 s rw it is interesting to notice that the real and imaginary resistivity follow the same behavior associated with the decrease of water saturation due to the dnapl rise validating the assumption of the petrophysical model that water saturation is the most important parameter controling complex resistivity of non wetting napl as emphasized by revil et al 2011 for demonstration of the sensitivity of resistivity values to the petrophysical exponents fig 8a represents the variation of the real part of the modeled resistivity for configuration d when the second archie s law eq 24 is applied the range of values for this brief sensitivity assessment is based on the calculated values of the standard deviation for exponents n and p through the simulation and optimization process the sensitivity of the modeled resistivity to the water saturation exponent n is augmented when the water saturation around the current and potential electrodes is low and approaching the residual value in other words when the dnapl is approaching the points of current injection and measured voltage it is observed that for the range shown a slight error in the proper estimation of water exponent can lead to relative errors as large as 400 locally in the estimation of resistivity for better quantification of the error table 3 shows the values of mean average error mae over the full coarse of the fill up test simulation for a specific value of saturation and quadrature exponent it is seen that the mae is least when the values are the exponents are close to those of reported by parameter estimation in table 2 which is expected this calibration process can be extended to the fluid flow and phase transport properties for further refinement of the uncertainty results and increasing the accuracy of the simulations in the remediation process on the other hand the sensitivity of the quadrature resistivity ρ to p see eq 19 is not quite high in the range of interest see fig 8b thus a rough estimation of this parameter would suffice the process of simulations for this problem it is proposed that a brief sensitivity analysis should be performed in preliminary studies in field measurements to state which parameters need to be refined in the process of measurement 4 3 the results of the pumping test the estimated parameters obtained from the previous section are applied to the simulation of the electrical response of the pumping test on 2d tank for the pumping flow rate of 220 ml min 1 for the sake of brevity and conciseness only one configuration of current injection is considered in the 2d tank which corresponds to the configuration d stated earlier in fig 4e this configuration is subject to strong variation compared to other configurations fig 9 simultaneously shows the simulated spatial distribution of the dnapl saturation in phase resistivity and quadrature resistivity in the tank in 3d for three time frames the first column in the matrix format of fig 9 shows the beginning of the simulation at t 0 s when the dnapl front is exactly located in the mid point between the injection electrodes the second column shows the results at t 100 s and when the dnapl front is approaching the second injection electrode finally the third column shows the simulated dnapl depression cone at t 500 s it would be interesting to compare the results of these simulations of the complex resistivity resulting from dnapl pumping to corresponding electrical impedance tomography measurements such as those shown by chambers et al 2004 simulating electrical impedance from surface location of the electrodes as usually performed on the field would be of particular interest the spatial distribution figures though giving invaluable insights regarding the qualitative behavior of the complex resistivity in the domain are not sufficient for the quantitative investigation of the resistivity and comparison with the actual results of the experiments reported by colombano et al 2021b for this purpose resistivity evolution is depicted for the three configurations c d and e corresponding to the top of the tank just below the middle of the tank and close to the bottom respectively the results of the in phase and quadrature resistivity evolution are depicted in fig 10a and b respectively in fig 10a and b the dnapl migration does not affect the evolution of ρ and ρ on configuration c as this configuration is located in the water saturated parts of the 2d tank throughout the experiment s w 1 for the d and e configurations initially there is an underestimation of the resistivity for the models the distribution between wetting and non wetting fluid in the experiment generates a strong resistivity gradient with the consequence of channeling the current and underestimating the resistivity jougnot et al 2018 in the models for the d and e configurations and during pumping however a sharp decrease of resistivities is observed at the point that the dnapl front passes through the injection electrodes for each of these configurations the resistivities i e both real part and imaginary parts do not converge to the resistivity of configuration c though the reason for this is the residual saturation of the dnapl that remains in the cone of depression of retrieved dnapl i e s rn 0 1 thus s w 0 9 the results are compatible with those obtained by colombano et al 2021b however it seems that the slope of the evolution is sharper in the simulations in this work than those obtained by them using image analysis interpretation aside from the graphical representation i e colombano et al 2021b used logarithmic scale on the vertical axis and in this work a real scale is used the main reason is the way they have interpreted the bulk resistivity in each cell the mean saturation in a 5 cm 5 cm is translated into resistivity and that smoothen the resistivity front however in this work the resistivity discretization accuracy depends on the mesh grid size used for the finite element simulation and can catch local evolutions better than a bulk averaging aside from this generally the results are in accordance giving confidence in the results obtained by colombano et al 2021b and this work 5 conclusions the finite element software comsol is used to simulate in 3d dnapl flow and the resulting complex resistivity in a 2d tank for that purpose the phase transport module with the pressure saturation formulation was coupled with the electrical current module via petrophysical relationships describing complex resistivity the main advantage of the pressure saturation formulation is the flexibility of the phase transport module in adding more phases e g gas or light non aqueous phase liquid without significant complications of constitutive relationships the petrophysical relationships that were used to link the water saturation and complex electrical conductivity or resistivity considering interfacial properties are based on the vinegar and waxman 1984 model the domain of the simulations is identical to the dnapl filling up and pumping test experiments performed in colombano et al 2021a 2021b parameter estimation is performed by matching measured to computed in phase and quadrature resistivities during the filling up experiment to further refine the range of variability and the value of the parameters of the petrophysical relationships the results of the simulations of the two phase flow are validated against the image and complex resistivity measurements reported in colombano et al 2021a 2021b further supporting their results and the novelty of their work and also giving a broader view of what happens in the 2d tank through the experiment 3d complex resistivity profiles of dnapl migration during pumping are simulated and validated against the experimental results this work further supports the idea of coupling multiphase flow and electrical current simulation in porous media as an effective numerical tool for the study of dnapl migration and remediation underground comsol is evaluated for this purpose and proposed to be an invaluable tool for such purpose having a user friendly interface with moderate abilities to extend the physics associated with the problem of interest both at the preliminary study level and at post processing it is suggested that the abilities of this artifact in more realistic simulations of field scale dnapl contamination studies it is also suggested that further investigation regarding multiphase flow with more immiscible phases simulations be coupled with electrical current simulations in porous media as well as using electrical impedance tomography to check the results of the simulations in future studies credit authorship contribution statement

1294,novel methods for water quality indexing increase insight into the fitness of water bodies for different uses we hypothesized that integrating multivariate statistical analysis msa with the analytical hierarchical process ahp may provide a reliable estimation of water quality status hence twenty water samples from canals and drains in the northern nile delta egypt were collected during summer autumn winter and spring and analyzed data were subjected to msa including correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and hierarchal cluster analysis hca the ahp was applied to derive weights of parameters implied in developing water quality indices for irrigation iwqi and fish farming ffwqi human health risks due to exposure to potentially toxic elements ptes via dermal contact were also considered the average concentrations of water constituents were acceptable for irrigation except sodium adsorption ratio sar and cl the dissolved oxygen total dissolved solids cl no2 n no3 n nh3 and ptes except zn did not meet standard limits for fish production the msa revealed that water contamination resulted from human activities agriculture industry and domestic wastes and hydrochemical processes the pca indicated that sar cu and ph could adequately represent water quality for irrigation while temperature no2 n cr and zn could reflect fish farming requirements the ahp provided consistent weights for the original and shortlisted parameters the water quality varied from good to poor for irrigation and from excellent to low for fish farming the minimum iwqi could adequately represent the iwqi r2 0 83 and thus reduce the time effort and cost for monitoring water quality however the minimum ffwqi showed moderate consistency r2 0 51 with ffwqi implying that increasing the sampling size is essential for better performance the hazard quotient of all ptes was below 1 0 for both adults and children indicating a safe limit the potential cancer risk was acceptable 1 36e 06 for adults and safe 8 03e 07 for children results of this work would be a start point for efficient quality control programs in arid regions keywords water quality index principal component analysis hierarchical cluster analysis analytical hierarchical process health risk dermal contact 1 introduction surface water quality is of worldwide concern due to its important role in various aspects of human and natural ecosystems aziz et al 2021 surface resources support millions of people by water for agriculture industry and municipal uses hence securing water quality is essential for human well being and ecosystem health ullah et al 2018 in fact protecting or improving the status of surface water quality is usually faced by major challenges in both developing and developed countries uddin et al 2021 in arid and semi arid regions water quality is interactively affected by natural processes and human activities xiao et al 2022 the scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems in these regions aggravate this situation intensive evaporation rates result in significant surface water groundwater interactions that considerably affect the surface water quality chen et al 2021 chen et al 2020 hence water quality control in arid ecosystems entails collecting and analyzing large datasets that cannot be easy to evaluate and synthesize noori et al 2019 this leads to ambiguity and makes water quality appraisal a very tedious task akhtar et al 2021 the multi criteria decision making mcdm and multivariate statistical analysis msa have been adopted to resolve problems related to water management dash and kalamdhad 2021 sutadian et al 2016 the analytical hierarchical process ahp is a mcdm tool applied to refine multiple attributes shi 2022 the ahp is a theory of measurement through pairwise comparisons based on expert judgment to define a priority number within a 1 9 scale saaty 2008 it supports the possibility of choosing various criteria in the presentation of proposed alternatives abuzaid et al 2021 although the ahp is easy it is biased and subjective due to individual judgment akhtar et al 2021 thus the msa has been recently used for data analysis in survey based studies to reduce prejudice mat roni and djajadikerta 2021 the correlation analysis ca hierarchal cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca are the most statistics applied in environmental studies abuzaid et al 2022 abuzaid and jahin 2019 sutadian et al 2017 they build associations among variables rendering the interpretations of complex datasets more convenient uddin et al 2021 the ca reveals hidden relations among variables and reduces their numbers by excluding correlated ones sutadian et al 2016 the pca and hca categorize variables with similar properties or common origin and thus specify potential contamination sources xiao et al 2019 comprehensive water quality control programs entail collecting and analyzing huge number of physical chemical and biological indicators abuzaid and jahin 2021 traditionally these indicators were compared against standard limits to appraise the fitness of a water body for drinking irrigation or aquatic life this approach is simple but cannot give insight into water quality status noori et al 2019 hence the concept of water quality index wqi has been initiated to represent the suitability of water bodies for different uses akhtar et al 2021 the wqi is a mathematical tool that significantly reduces the complex water quality datasets and provides a single value reflecting the water quality status dash and kalamdhad 2021 this concept has wide acceptance among policymakers and stakeholders as it gives a clear and comprehensive picture of the pollution status of a water body uddin et al 2021 developing a wqi includes four steps selecting parameters obtaining sub index values weighting and combining weighted sub index values akhtar et al 2021 classical methods encompass errors due to protracted analyses of water quality data this is in addition to great efforts high costs and much time for gathering and analyzing water samples and interpreting the results ho et al 2019 thus msa has been adopted in recent water quality studies to reduce the dimensionality of datasets akhtar et al 2021 dash and kalamdhad 2021 the msa can minimize complex datasets to few combinations of uncorrelated variables without disturbing the original structure jahin et al 2020 the significance of msa in defining key indicators for surface water quality has been reported for the dongjiang river china sun et al 2016 and ganga river india tripathi and singal 2019 weighting procedures based on msa have been also applied for the ganga wqi tripathi and singal 2019 and irrigation wqi in kafr el sheikh governorate egypt jahin et al 2020 although the msa provides objective weights data availability is of great concern since at least 150 300 cases are required to obtain reliable results tripathi and singal 2019 in the case of a lower number of cases the ahp weighting method is the most appropriate approach sutadian et al 2017 the ahp has several advantages like allocating weights through easy and simple procedures quantifying both local experts objective and subjective judgments identifying weights of either individual or grouped criteria and applicability of various fields of environmental studies akhtar et al 2021 the ahp weights have been implemented in previous wqi studies such as in west java province indonesia sutadian et al 2018 eagle creek watershed usa jabbar et al 2019 and west bengal india saha and paul 2021 in arid and semi arid regions combinations of msa and ahp in water quality indexing have been limited studied nevertheless based on the above mentioned details the combined use of such advanced techniques would provide a deeper view of surface water dynamics hence this work provides a new methodology for a comprehensive assessment of surface water quality for irrigation and fish farming purposes through integrating msa with ahp this depends mainly on 1 applying msa to water quality data to identify the most informative indicators and 2 employing the ahp through expert opinions to prioritize the original and key indicators to be included in developing novel wqis furthermore health risks due to human exposure to potentially toxic elements ptes via dermal content with water were also investigated the study was then applied in an arid area in northern nile delta egypt for water management and human health protection strategies in similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study included canals and drains in kafr el sheik one of the main governorates in the northern nile delta of egypt latitudes 31 02 03 and 31 36 24 longitudes 30 18 17 and 31 26 28 e fig 1 this governorate has a total cultivated area of 256 000 ha and contributes 21 of the total domestic production of rice 9 of wheat and 4 of maize jahin et al 2020 fish farms occupy 53 302 ha representing 41 of the total area of fish farms in egypt ghanem et al 2020 surface water of canals and drains is the main source for agricultural activities irrigation and fish farming with little contribution of groundwater owing to salinization resulted from mediterranean seawater intrusion the nile freshwater rosetta branch is conveyed through a network of irrigation canals the nile freshwater is also mixed with agricultural drainage water to be conveyed through a network of branch and main drains arid climate dominates the area with an average temperature of 12 c during the winter and 28 c during the summer the total annual rainfall ranges from 56 to 228 mm and occurs during the winter season 2 2 water sampling and analyses twenty locations were marked using the global positioning system gps fig 1 selection of these sites based on the intensity of agricultural industrial urbanization and fish farming activities from june 2019 to may 2020 the sampling was conducted in summer autumn winter and spring in situ data measurements using a portable hach instrument hq 40d multi usa were done for water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do at each site composite water samples with three subsamples were collected in four portions they included 1 l polypropylene vials for major ions 0 50 l acidified polypropylene vials ph 2 for ptes 0 50 l sterilized dark glass vials for microbiological analysis and 0 25 l acidified brown glass bottle ph 2 for organic contaminants the collected samples were transported in iceboxes 4 c to the laboratory within 24 h of collection time and analyzed all laboratory analyses were performed according to apha 2017in the central laboratory for environmental quality monitoring cleqm national water research center nwrc egypt iso 17025 2017 microbiological analyses including the counts of total coliform tc and fecal coliform fc were done using method 9221 b for the former and method 9221 e for the latter organic contamination indicators i e chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod were determined the cod was determined using method 5210 b open reflux method while the bod was determined using method 5210 b 5 day bod test total suspended solids tss were measured gravimetrically after evaporating 100 ml aliquot dried at 105 c the concentrations of na and k were measured using the sherwood model 410 england flame photometer ions ca2 mg2 cl co3 hco3 and so4 2 were determined by standard titration methods the po4 p was determined using the phospho molybdate vanadate method and measured by uv vis spectroscopy dr3900 hach lange gmbh berlin the no2 n and no3 n were measured using ics5000 dionex usa ion chromatography system the nh3 n was measured using ion selective electrode orion 9512bnwp usa the ptes were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer perkin elmer optima 5300 usa all laboratory analyses were performed in triplicate and the measurements were given as a mean value to ensure accuracy and to obtain unbiased data double deionized water milli q millipore 18 mω cm at 25 c was used throughout the study reagent solutions were prepared using analytical grade reagents merck germany blank reagents were used for correcting the readings of instruments the detection limits mg l 1 were as follows na and k 0 2 no2 n 0 001 no3 n 0 02 nh3 n 0 01 po4 p 0 2 cr 0 001 cu 0 006 fe 0 02 pb 0 001 mn 0 006 zn 0 001 to ensure accuracy the ion balance error percentage ibe was calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 ibe cations anions cations anions 100 the most acceptable range for ibe is 5 jahin et al 2020 and samples outside this range were re measured 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 software ibm usa initially the entire data set was subjected to normalization by calculating the z scores this transformation step is essential for analyzing ecological data because the variables have different units and thus this renders no sense to compile values with different units tripathi and singal 2019 thereafter pearson s correlation was applied to the generated z scores to reveal linear relationships among different variables the factor analysis was then done on the correlation matrix using pca method with kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure of sampling adequacy bartlett s test of sphericity and varimax rotation to identify potential contamination sources wendler and gröttrup 2021 the kmo and bartlett s tests determine the applicability of pca since values above 0 6 and below 0 05 respectively are considered acceptable to proceed with pca backhaus et al 2021 the pcs with eigenvalues 1 0 were only considered and highly loaded variables having absolute values 0 6 were retained under each pc abuzaid and bassouny 2018 finally the hca using ward s linkage method and squared euclidean distance sed was applied to measure similarities between variables todorović et al 2016 and results were displayed in the form of a dendrogram all variables with sed below the phenon line were compiled in one cluster wei et al 2018 2 4 development of water quality indices wqis 2 4 1 indicator selections the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations 29 guidelines set by ayers and westcot 1994 were adopted to select parameters defining irrigation water quality index iwqi the four problem categories related to salinity sodicity toxicity and miscellaneous effects were considered the tds sodium adsorption ratio sar specific ions na cl and ptes and other parameters no3 n ph hco3 and tss were implied to quantify these potential problems the sar was calculated based on ion concentrations in mmolc l 1 using eq 2 luo et al 2021 as follows 2 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 due to lack of national guidelines for fish farming requirements widely accepted standards set by the canadian council of ministers of the environment for protecting aquatic life ccme 2007 were adopted to develop fish farming water quality index ffwqi they include water temperature ph do tds cl no2 n no3 n nh3 n and ptes the pca was applied to all datasets used for iwqi and ffwqi to build minimum datasets mds tripathi and singal 2019 when more than one variable was retained under a pc the correlation coefficient was considered to verify the representative one if they were not correlated each one was considered critical and was included in the mds jahin et al 2020 the minimum iwqi iwqimin and ffwqi ffwqimin were generated based on mds 2 4 2 calculating sub index values values of both original and crucial parameters were transformed to a unitless scale or score si ranging from 0 to 100 using eq 3 jahin et al 2020 as follows 3 s i 1 v a v i v s v i 100 where va is the actual value of parameter obtained by laboratory analysis vs is the standard value and vi is the ideal value in pure water which was considered 7 0 for ph 6 0 for do and zero for other parameters 2 4 3 establishment of parameter weights the sample size in this work n 80 was below the optimal range 150 300 for applying the msa in weight allocation and thus the ahp procedure described by saaty 2008 was considered firstly two pairwise comparison matrixes pcms were established for the two groups of original variables determining water quality for irrigation and fish farming uses the comparison of each criterion to one another was accomplished with a rating scale 1 9 prioritizing the criteria based on their importance occurred through questionnaires completed by ten local stockholders government officials academics researchers and consultants and authors experiences similarly two pcms were also developed for the two groups of shortlisted indicators mds finally a weight for each criterion could be estimated using the ahp software package expert choice the consistency ratio cr was considered to check the reality of the developed pcms and the established weights values of cr below 0 10 indicate an acceptable matrix while higher values require a revised judgment 2 4 4 final index and classes the final indices were calculated using eq 4 set by the national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi as follows 4 wqi i 1 n s i w i where si is the indicator score wi is the weight derived from ahp and n is the number of indicators the water quality could be classified into five grades excellent 91 100 good 71 90 moderate 51 70 low 26 50 and poor 0 25 2 5 human health risk assessment 2 5 1 non carcinogenic risk ncr the estimated daily dose edd of ncr exposure to ptes i e cr cu fe pb mn and zn via dermal contact mg kg 1 day 1 were estimated using eq 5 us epa 2004 as follows 5 edd c sa k p et ed ef cf bw at where c is a metal content in water sa is the skin surface area kp is the dermal permeability coefficient et is the exposure time ed is the exposure duration ef is the exposure frequency cf is the correction factor bw is the average body weight and at is the average time of exposure the exposure factors presented in table 1 were cited from us epa 2004 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 the hazard quotient hq for each pte was then estimated based on the reference dose rfd using eq 6 as follows 6 hq edd rfd the rfd represents the maximum permissible level of metals without health deterioration which is estimated by 3 00e 03 scientific notation equal to 1 10 3 4 02e 02 1 40e 01 5 25e 04 2 33e 02 and 6 00e 02 mg kg 1 day 1 for cr cu fe pb mn and zn respectively chen et al 2019 the ncr occurs when the edd exceeds the rfd the total hazard quotient thq is the sum of the hq for all metals eq 7 as follows 7 thq hq cr hq cu hq fe hq pb hq mn hq zn according to xiao et al 2021 the human health risk can be classified into three categories where the thq values of 1 1 4 and 4 indicate negligible medium and high human health risks respectively 2 5 2 carcinogenic risk cr the probability of cr due to exposure to carcinogenic ptes cr and pb was estimated the cr depends on the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr and total incremental lifetime cancer risk tilcr us epa 2004 the ilcr was calculated eq 8 considering cancer slope factor csf for a single metal as follows 8 ilcr edd csf the csf is estimated by 0 5 and 0 0085 for cr and pb respectively chen et al 2019 the tilcr was estimated eq 9 as follows chen et al 2019 9 tilcr cr cr cr pb generally for ilcr and tilcr the u s epa 2011 considered values below 1 00e 06 to pose no obvious risks on the other hand values ranging between 1 00e0 6 and 1 00e 04 are considered acceptable while values exceeding 1 00e 04 indicate a more significant risk 3 results 3 1 water composition results in table 2 show that temperature fell within the proper range for aquatic life as set by ccme 2007 water was neutral to moderately alkaline however ph values were within the normal range for irrigation ayers and westcot 1994 and aquatic life ccme 2007 on average the concentration of do was below the desirable range for aquatic life the tds met the normal range for irrigation but surpassed that limit for aquatic life the tss was below the maximum permissible limit mpl for localized drip irrigation the sodium adsorption ratio sar was below the mpl for surface irrigation but above that limit for sprinkler irrigation concentrations of soluble ions showed acceptable limits for irrigation except cl that exceed the mpl for surface and sprinkler irrigation on the other hand concentrations of cl no2 n and no3 n and nh3 were beyond the mpl for aquatic life concentrations of ptes were below the mpl for irrigation but surpassed that limit for fish farming except zn the cod and bod surpassed the mpl in surface water which was estimated by 10 0 mg l 1 for the former hussein et al 2021 and 4 0 mg l 1 for the latter vasistha and ganguly 2020 total counts of tc and fc were above the desirable limits in surface water i e 1 7 and 0 log cfu 100 ml 1 respectively vasistha and ganguly 2020 to identify water hydrochemical types the average concentrations of cations anions and tds in the four seasons were plotted in piper trilinear diagram as shown in fig 2 most of the canal water samples were situated in the hco3 ca zone of the diagram however all samples from drains were situated in the clna zone of the diagram according to luo et al 2021 waters with tds mg l 1 of 1000 1000 3000 3000 10 000 and 10 000 are considered fresh slightly saline moderately saline and highly saline respectively hence all canal water samples were freshwater while the drain water samples were slightly saline eight sites and moderately saline two sites waters the dominant major cations in the canal waters were ca2 and na while the drain waters were dominated by na the dominant major anions were hco3 and cl in the canal and drain waters respectively 3 2 multivariate statistical analysis pearson s correlation matrix table 3 indicates significant p 0 05 and highly significant p 0 01 correlations among water constituents temperature displayed positive correlations with tds ca2 and no3 mg2 na and cl but negative correlations with do and nh3 the ph showed positive correlations with tss k nh3 cr cod and bod the do showed positive correlations with nh3 and fc but negative correlations with mg2 na cl and no3 the tds showed positive correlations with ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 po4 2 cr mn cod and bod but negative correlations with tc and fc the tss showed positive correlations with cr cod and bod positive correlations occurred among ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 and hco3 nh3 showed positive correlations with cr pb cod bod and coliform bacteria the ptes including cu mn pb and zn correlated positively with fe while cr correlated positively with mn results of pca for all water datasets are presented in table 4 the kmo and the significance of bartlett s test of sphericity were 0 71 and zero respectively results reveal that the first seven pcs had eigenvalues 1 and explained 85 44 of the total variance the pc1 was responsible for 23 16 of the total variance with high positive loadings of tds mg2 na k cl and po4 p the pc2 accounted for 15 12 of the total variance and included ca2 hco3 so4 2 cod and bod the pc3 included cu fe pb mn and zn and represented 13 79 of the total variance the pc4 included tss ph and cr and represented 10 62 of the total variance the pc5 accounted for 9 08 of the total variance and was dominated by temperature and no3 n positive and do negative the pc6 was dominated by the tc and fc and represented 8 13 of the total variance the pc7 was dominated only by no2 n and accounted for 5 53 of the total variance results of the hca of the studied samples are shown in the dendogram presented in fig 3 based on visual interpretation the phenon line at sed of 25 divided the variables into two main groups drawing the phenon line across a sed 5 yielded seven clusters c1 to c7 group a included three clusters where tds na cl k mg2 and po4 p formed c1 temperature and no3 n represented c2 while c3 included cod bod ca2 so4 2 and hco3 group b included four clusters i e c4 cu zn pb fe and mn c5 ph tss and cr c6 tc and fc and c7 do nh3 and no2 n 3 3 water quality index wqi the weight values for the original indicators included in developing iwqi and ffwqi are shown in table 5 according to propriety derived from the ahp weight values for indicators delineated iwqi varied from 0 02 ph to 0 22 tds the corresponding values for ffwqi varied from 0 019 mn and zn to 0 207 temperature results of pca applied to all datasets defining iwqi and ffwqi for building mds are shown in table 6 the pca yielded three critical indicators i e sar ph and cu to be representative for irrigation water quality through ahp table 7 they were assigned weight values of 0 701 0 193 and 0 106 respectively the mds for fish farming had four indicators including temperature no2 n cr and zn as shown in table 7 these variables were assigned weight values of 0 535 0 270 0 120 and 0 075 respectively as shown in fig 4 values of iwqi ranged from 26 48 to 88 81 indicating low to good water quality the distribution of quality classes presented in fig 5 shows that 42 47 of samples were classified as good 32 88 as moderate and 24 66 as low on the other hand iwqimin indicated poor to good quality with values ranging from 22 37 to 88 34 under this index 31 51 32 88 34 25 and 1 37 of samples had good moderate low and poor quality respectively as shown in fig 6 results of iwqimin displayed high consistency with iwqi r2 0 83 and p 0 0001 the ffwqi ranged from 35 10 to 71 83 indicating low to good water quality the distribution of quality grades fig 5 shows that 1 37 of samples were classified as good 64 38 as moderate and 34 25 as low values of ffwqi min ranged from 44 51 to 91 11 indicating low to excellent water quality the index values quantified four classes i e excellent good moderate and low that accounted for 17 81 50 68 28 77 and 2 74 of total samples respectively results of ffwqimin were moderately consistent with ffwqi fig 6 r2 0 51 p 0 0001 3 4 human health risk assessment results in table 8 show that ranges of hq of all ptes for both adults and children were below 1 0 this indicates that the potential individual ncr of these elements in water remained within the tolerable range on average the hq of the ptes decreased in the order cr mn pb cu fe zn and this trend occurred for both adults and children ranges of thq for both adults and children were also lower than 1 0 this demonstrates that the overall ncr from dermal contact with water was safe for residents the hq and thq for adults were almost 3 folds those of children the carcinogenic analysis shows that mean values of ilcr for cr were below 1 00e 04 for adults and below 1 00e 06 for children this indicates that the potential risk associated with cr was acceptable for adults and safe for children the ranges of ilcr for pb were below 1 00e 06 for both adults and children indicating a safe limit on average the tilcr from dermal contact with water could be acceptable for adults and safe for children the ilcr and tilcr for adults were almost double those of children 4 discussion water composition quantifies its suitability to a specific use and simplifies the complexity of water dynamics and relevant control mechanisms chhabra 2021 several indicators for the investigated water samples surpassed the desirable standards for surface water quality this in turn reflects the degree of chemical and biological contamination in the studied area giao et al 2021 these findings confirm those obtained by gad et al 2020 who reported that the northern nile delta region is affected by medium to high chemical contamination in developing countries surface water is vulnerable to human interventions leong et al 2018 this is due to lack of sufficient sanitation systems particularly in rural areas that increases the magnitude of waste disposal into surface water bodies abbas et al 2020 the discharge of brackish agricultural and industrial effluents into irrigation networks might increase the soluble ions and thus tds abuzaid 2018 jahin et al 2020 the increments in cod and bod levels indicate contamination with organic substances abbas et al 2020 hence the do depletion might occur during the decomposition of organic substances and oxidation of inorganic chemicals sutadian et al 2018 the presence of coliform bacteria confirms the discharge of animal and human faces leong et al 2018 the piper s classification revealed that alkaline earth ca2 and weak acid hco3 were superior to alkalis na and k and strong acids so4 2 and cl in the canal waters as a result the hco3 ca was the predominant water type for these waters these findings are rather similar to those obtained by gad et al 2020 who reported that ca mg alkalinity was the predominant water type for canals waters in the northern nile delta region in general the prevalence of hco3 ca refers to water rock interaction as the dominant hydrogeochemical process controlling chemical composition of the canals waters xiao et al 2022 on the other hand na and cl were the predominant ions in the drain water samples indicating a clna water type both na and cl are major ions for surface waters in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2020 they are originated from human inputs besides natural origins including na feldspar weathering for na chen et al 2020 and halite dissolution for cl luo et al 2021 however in the investigated water samples the two ions showed positive relations with no3 n and po4 p this implies the similar source of these ions from the agricultural activities agrochemicals the ca revealed significant correlations among variables indicating consistency between the results jahin et al 2020 increased temperate led to high evaporation rates and promoted mineral dissolutions increasing the soluble ions and tds akter et al 2020 however this rise decreased the do and nh3 due to reducing molecular forces of attraction between gas molecules vasistha and ganguly 2020 the present conditions suggest that tss could be derived from flow disturbance phytoplankton organic wastes and industrial effluents giao et al 2021 during the photosynthesis process phytoplankton consumes co2 and thus the ph increased hussein et al 2021 the ph rise might enhance the decomposition of organic substances and dissolution of metal complexing anions yan et al 2022 and subsequently increments in cod bod k and cr occurred the ph rise also might promote nh3 accumulation probably due to inhibiting ammonia oxidizing microbes lu et al 2019 domestic wastes increased fc and free ammonia however the do range might not be suitable for complete ammonia oxidation and hence nitrate accumulation decreased sui et al 2016 the soluble mineral ions and dissolved organic carbon might contribute to tds that depended chiefly on combinations of ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 and hco3 jahin et al 2020 increasing water salinity might adversely affect the survival of coliform bacteria leong et al 2018 elements fe mn zn cu and pb might be from a similar source or had comparable characteristics jahin et al 2020 cr might be derived from a different origin however it displayed chemical behavior similar to mn kükrer and mutlu 2019 results of the ca indicate interrelations among the studied variable assuming that the pca would perform well tripathi and singal 2019 this could be confirmed by the kmo and bartlett s sphericity statistics wendler and gröttrup 2021 the kmo statistic measures the robustness of partial correlation how variables explain each other where values above 0 6 indicate a strong relation and thus it is plausible to proceed with factor analysis backhaus et al 2021 bartlett s test is applied to test the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix is identical no correlation among variables or not wendler and gröttrup 2021 the significance associated with bartlett s test lesser than 0 05 reveals that the null hypothesis is rejected and thus the factor analysis is applicable backhaus et al 2021 the studied water variables occurred in seven pcs reflecting possible origins and controlling factors the pc1 could denote the contribution of soluble ions leached from agricultural fields jahin et al 2020 the pc2 was dominated by organic pollution indicators cod and bod suggesting the possible contribution of organic fertilizers hussein et al 2021 the pc3 was representative for weathering rocks involved in ptes since fe and mn are major elements in the earth s crust and rarely originate from anthropic sources xiao et al 2019 the pc4 could be considered as the contribution of suspended solids derived from agricultural and industrial activities giao et al 2021 the pc5 could verify the significant effects of temperature fluctuations on the process of oxygen exchange in water vasistha and ganguly 2020 the pc6 could be considered as the contribution of domestic sewage runoff abbas et al 2020 the pc7 was representative for nutrients derived from fish farming effluents the hca revealed two major groups of clusters connected at a great distance this indicates that water composition was controlled by different factors todorović et al 2016 moving the phenon line to a sed of 5 led to a higher number of clusters generally no specific rule governs the linkage distance at which the phenon line should be drawn yidana and yidana 2010 and hence widely accepted sed 5 was considered todorović et al 2016 wei et al 2018 accordingly group a could represent the combined effects of agricultural inputs and hydrochemical processes for instance agrochemicals supplied water with soluble ions linked in c1 at a slightly higher sed c1 and c2 were connected confirming that temperature affected water mineral composition in c3 constituents related to oxidation of organic matter occurred they were linked to c2 and c1 but at a relatively higher sed supporting the hypothesis that water salinity was from inorganic and organic sources group b could verify combinations of different natural processes and human interventions weathering of metallic minerals contributed to ptes that occurred in c4 a further natural process flow disturbance besides industrial wastes was representative for c5 on the other hand biological indicators related to domestic wastes represented c6 water constituents associated with fish farming effluents occurred in c7 they might play significant roles in the nutrition and survival of coliform bacteria which could explain the linkage between c6 and c7 at a slightly higher sed results of the ahp provided in this study could be accepted as the crs for all pairwise comparison matrixes were below the critical limit of 0 10 this confirms that the local experts were consistent in their judgments saaty 2008 the indicators implied in developing wqis had different priorities in assessing water quality for irrigation and fish farming thus they were assigned different specific weights according to their relative importance sutadian et al 2017 the pca could minimize the number of variables having high loadings 0 6 in the same pc abuzaid and bassouny 2018 the analysis of water quality variables yielded three pcs for irrigation use and four pcs for fish farming use each pc had two or more well correlated variables and hence the highest loaded ones were only selected to represent mds jahin et al 2020 this is because highly correlated variables are considered redundant and such a discard reduces dimensions of multivariate datasets tripathi and singal 2019 the iwqi and iwqimin revealed a wide range good to poor of surface water suitability for irrigation these findings are rather similar to those of jahin et al 2020 who implemented various iwqis in kafr el sheikh governorate and reported that water quality ranged from excellent to poor such variations could be a result of wide ranges of water constituents that affects water suitability for a specific use chhabra 2021 uncontrolled waste disposal and hydrochemical processes might increase the water contaminants and deteriorate the overall quality abuzaid 2018 jahin et al 2020 according to chhabra 2021 good quality water can be used for irrigating a wide range of crops moderate quality water should be used under certain percussions while water of low and poor qualities can be used only for salt tolerant species the mds could adequately represent irrigation water quality since the iwqimin could explain 83 of the variations of iwqi this affirms the applicability of pca and ahp in designing a cost effective and time saving strategy to monitor spatio temporal changes in water quality these findings are in line with previous studies that adopted the pca for building mds for irrigation jahin et al 2020 and applied the ahp weighing procedure in case of small sample sizes sutadian et al 2017 the ffwqi indicates that the majority of water samples 98 63 were in moderate and low classes this points to potential drastic effects that may lead to poor growth of fish and high fish mortality therefore sufficient water treatments should be considered before using this water in fish cultures zaynab et al 2022 yu et al 2019 recommended an effective water treatment system for fish habitats through combinations of mechanical chemical and biological filters on the other hand the ffwqimin displayed a different trend in explaining water quality under this index nearly 70 of water samples fell in excellent and good grades this might be due to excluding several parameters that affected the final index jahin et al 2020 as a result the ffwqimin could explain only 51 of the variations of the ffwqi hence it is essential to increase the sampling size to obtain better performance the health risks usually result from human exposure to ptes in surface water through oral ingestion or dermal contact imran et al 2021 however the studied water bodies were used only for agricultural activities irrigation and fish farming therefore dermal contact with water is the primary pathway for ptes generally adults were more vulnerable to potential dermal related health risks than children this is logic because adults have a higher skin surface area compared with children us epa 2004 however the hq and thq indicated that human health risks due to exposure to metal contaminants in surface water are still safe in addition the probability of developing cancer over a lifetime is acceptable for adults and safe for children usually dermal contact with surface water poses little hazards as reported by earlier cases studies in arid environments such as in the chinese loess plateau xiao et al 2019 and manchar lake in pakistan imran et al 2021 consequently residents would use surface water for bathing or washing however future management and regulation should focus on cr to avoid potential cancer risks abuzaid and jahin 2021 5 conclusion in this work physicochemical and biological qualities of surface waters canals and drains in an area of the northern nile delta egypt typical for arid ecosystems were investigated advanced data analysis techniques including ca pca and hca were jointly applied with ahp through expert judgments to develop novel wqis for irrigation and fish farming uses the water quality was deteriorated by chemical and biological contaminants posing potential restrictions for irrigation and higher threats for fish production the msa revealed that water contamination was due to human activities agrochemicals industry domestic wastes and fish farming effluents and hydrochemical processes evaporation weathering and flow disturbance based on the pca sar cu and ph could efficiently represent irrigation water quality while temperature no2 n cr and zn could reflect fish farming requirements the ahp could provide reliable weights for the original and shortlisted water quality indicators the integration of pca and ahp could yield novel minimum wqis the iwqimin could adequately represent iwqi r2 0 83 showing high potentiality for cost effective and time saving monitoring of the irrigation water quality further verifications are needed to develop a better ffwqimin that was moderately consistent r2 0 51 with ffwqi the health risk analysis indicated that human exposure to ptes in water remained safe moreover the probability of developing cancer risk over a lifetime was acceptable for adults and safe for children however further attention should be paid to cr to avoid potential carcinogenic risks the study recommends more stringent environmental legislation to stop waste disposal into surface water bodies in addition using water treatment filter systems are necessary in fish ponds results of this work would be a base for comprehensive water quality control scenarios in the studied area and similar regions author statement none declaration of competing interest none 
1294,novel methods for water quality indexing increase insight into the fitness of water bodies for different uses we hypothesized that integrating multivariate statistical analysis msa with the analytical hierarchical process ahp may provide a reliable estimation of water quality status hence twenty water samples from canals and drains in the northern nile delta egypt were collected during summer autumn winter and spring and analyzed data were subjected to msa including correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and hierarchal cluster analysis hca the ahp was applied to derive weights of parameters implied in developing water quality indices for irrigation iwqi and fish farming ffwqi human health risks due to exposure to potentially toxic elements ptes via dermal contact were also considered the average concentrations of water constituents were acceptable for irrigation except sodium adsorption ratio sar and cl the dissolved oxygen total dissolved solids cl no2 n no3 n nh3 and ptes except zn did not meet standard limits for fish production the msa revealed that water contamination resulted from human activities agriculture industry and domestic wastes and hydrochemical processes the pca indicated that sar cu and ph could adequately represent water quality for irrigation while temperature no2 n cr and zn could reflect fish farming requirements the ahp provided consistent weights for the original and shortlisted parameters the water quality varied from good to poor for irrigation and from excellent to low for fish farming the minimum iwqi could adequately represent the iwqi r2 0 83 and thus reduce the time effort and cost for monitoring water quality however the minimum ffwqi showed moderate consistency r2 0 51 with ffwqi implying that increasing the sampling size is essential for better performance the hazard quotient of all ptes was below 1 0 for both adults and children indicating a safe limit the potential cancer risk was acceptable 1 36e 06 for adults and safe 8 03e 07 for children results of this work would be a start point for efficient quality control programs in arid regions keywords water quality index principal component analysis hierarchical cluster analysis analytical hierarchical process health risk dermal contact 1 introduction surface water quality is of worldwide concern due to its important role in various aspects of human and natural ecosystems aziz et al 2021 surface resources support millions of people by water for agriculture industry and municipal uses hence securing water quality is essential for human well being and ecosystem health ullah et al 2018 in fact protecting or improving the status of surface water quality is usually faced by major challenges in both developing and developed countries uddin et al 2021 in arid and semi arid regions water quality is interactively affected by natural processes and human activities xiao et al 2022 the scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems in these regions aggravate this situation intensive evaporation rates result in significant surface water groundwater interactions that considerably affect the surface water quality chen et al 2021 chen et al 2020 hence water quality control in arid ecosystems entails collecting and analyzing large datasets that cannot be easy to evaluate and synthesize noori et al 2019 this leads to ambiguity and makes water quality appraisal a very tedious task akhtar et al 2021 the multi criteria decision making mcdm and multivariate statistical analysis msa have been adopted to resolve problems related to water management dash and kalamdhad 2021 sutadian et al 2016 the analytical hierarchical process ahp is a mcdm tool applied to refine multiple attributes shi 2022 the ahp is a theory of measurement through pairwise comparisons based on expert judgment to define a priority number within a 1 9 scale saaty 2008 it supports the possibility of choosing various criteria in the presentation of proposed alternatives abuzaid et al 2021 although the ahp is easy it is biased and subjective due to individual judgment akhtar et al 2021 thus the msa has been recently used for data analysis in survey based studies to reduce prejudice mat roni and djajadikerta 2021 the correlation analysis ca hierarchal cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca are the most statistics applied in environmental studies abuzaid et al 2022 abuzaid and jahin 2019 sutadian et al 2017 they build associations among variables rendering the interpretations of complex datasets more convenient uddin et al 2021 the ca reveals hidden relations among variables and reduces their numbers by excluding correlated ones sutadian et al 2016 the pca and hca categorize variables with similar properties or common origin and thus specify potential contamination sources xiao et al 2019 comprehensive water quality control programs entail collecting and analyzing huge number of physical chemical and biological indicators abuzaid and jahin 2021 traditionally these indicators were compared against standard limits to appraise the fitness of a water body for drinking irrigation or aquatic life this approach is simple but cannot give insight into water quality status noori et al 2019 hence the concept of water quality index wqi has been initiated to represent the suitability of water bodies for different uses akhtar et al 2021 the wqi is a mathematical tool that significantly reduces the complex water quality datasets and provides a single value reflecting the water quality status dash and kalamdhad 2021 this concept has wide acceptance among policymakers and stakeholders as it gives a clear and comprehensive picture of the pollution status of a water body uddin et al 2021 developing a wqi includes four steps selecting parameters obtaining sub index values weighting and combining weighted sub index values akhtar et al 2021 classical methods encompass errors due to protracted analyses of water quality data this is in addition to great efforts high costs and much time for gathering and analyzing water samples and interpreting the results ho et al 2019 thus msa has been adopted in recent water quality studies to reduce the dimensionality of datasets akhtar et al 2021 dash and kalamdhad 2021 the msa can minimize complex datasets to few combinations of uncorrelated variables without disturbing the original structure jahin et al 2020 the significance of msa in defining key indicators for surface water quality has been reported for the dongjiang river china sun et al 2016 and ganga river india tripathi and singal 2019 weighting procedures based on msa have been also applied for the ganga wqi tripathi and singal 2019 and irrigation wqi in kafr el sheikh governorate egypt jahin et al 2020 although the msa provides objective weights data availability is of great concern since at least 150 300 cases are required to obtain reliable results tripathi and singal 2019 in the case of a lower number of cases the ahp weighting method is the most appropriate approach sutadian et al 2017 the ahp has several advantages like allocating weights through easy and simple procedures quantifying both local experts objective and subjective judgments identifying weights of either individual or grouped criteria and applicability of various fields of environmental studies akhtar et al 2021 the ahp weights have been implemented in previous wqi studies such as in west java province indonesia sutadian et al 2018 eagle creek watershed usa jabbar et al 2019 and west bengal india saha and paul 2021 in arid and semi arid regions combinations of msa and ahp in water quality indexing have been limited studied nevertheless based on the above mentioned details the combined use of such advanced techniques would provide a deeper view of surface water dynamics hence this work provides a new methodology for a comprehensive assessment of surface water quality for irrigation and fish farming purposes through integrating msa with ahp this depends mainly on 1 applying msa to water quality data to identify the most informative indicators and 2 employing the ahp through expert opinions to prioritize the original and key indicators to be included in developing novel wqis furthermore health risks due to human exposure to potentially toxic elements ptes via dermal content with water were also investigated the study was then applied in an arid area in northern nile delta egypt for water management and human health protection strategies in similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study included canals and drains in kafr el sheik one of the main governorates in the northern nile delta of egypt latitudes 31 02 03 and 31 36 24 longitudes 30 18 17 and 31 26 28 e fig 1 this governorate has a total cultivated area of 256 000 ha and contributes 21 of the total domestic production of rice 9 of wheat and 4 of maize jahin et al 2020 fish farms occupy 53 302 ha representing 41 of the total area of fish farms in egypt ghanem et al 2020 surface water of canals and drains is the main source for agricultural activities irrigation and fish farming with little contribution of groundwater owing to salinization resulted from mediterranean seawater intrusion the nile freshwater rosetta branch is conveyed through a network of irrigation canals the nile freshwater is also mixed with agricultural drainage water to be conveyed through a network of branch and main drains arid climate dominates the area with an average temperature of 12 c during the winter and 28 c during the summer the total annual rainfall ranges from 56 to 228 mm and occurs during the winter season 2 2 water sampling and analyses twenty locations were marked using the global positioning system gps fig 1 selection of these sites based on the intensity of agricultural industrial urbanization and fish farming activities from june 2019 to may 2020 the sampling was conducted in summer autumn winter and spring in situ data measurements using a portable hach instrument hq 40d multi usa were done for water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do at each site composite water samples with three subsamples were collected in four portions they included 1 l polypropylene vials for major ions 0 50 l acidified polypropylene vials ph 2 for ptes 0 50 l sterilized dark glass vials for microbiological analysis and 0 25 l acidified brown glass bottle ph 2 for organic contaminants the collected samples were transported in iceboxes 4 c to the laboratory within 24 h of collection time and analyzed all laboratory analyses were performed according to apha 2017in the central laboratory for environmental quality monitoring cleqm national water research center nwrc egypt iso 17025 2017 microbiological analyses including the counts of total coliform tc and fecal coliform fc were done using method 9221 b for the former and method 9221 e for the latter organic contamination indicators i e chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod were determined the cod was determined using method 5210 b open reflux method while the bod was determined using method 5210 b 5 day bod test total suspended solids tss were measured gravimetrically after evaporating 100 ml aliquot dried at 105 c the concentrations of na and k were measured using the sherwood model 410 england flame photometer ions ca2 mg2 cl co3 hco3 and so4 2 were determined by standard titration methods the po4 p was determined using the phospho molybdate vanadate method and measured by uv vis spectroscopy dr3900 hach lange gmbh berlin the no2 n and no3 n were measured using ics5000 dionex usa ion chromatography system the nh3 n was measured using ion selective electrode orion 9512bnwp usa the ptes were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer perkin elmer optima 5300 usa all laboratory analyses were performed in triplicate and the measurements were given as a mean value to ensure accuracy and to obtain unbiased data double deionized water milli q millipore 18 mω cm at 25 c was used throughout the study reagent solutions were prepared using analytical grade reagents merck germany blank reagents were used for correcting the readings of instruments the detection limits mg l 1 were as follows na and k 0 2 no2 n 0 001 no3 n 0 02 nh3 n 0 01 po4 p 0 2 cr 0 001 cu 0 006 fe 0 02 pb 0 001 mn 0 006 zn 0 001 to ensure accuracy the ion balance error percentage ibe was calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 ibe cations anions cations anions 100 the most acceptable range for ibe is 5 jahin et al 2020 and samples outside this range were re measured 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 software ibm usa initially the entire data set was subjected to normalization by calculating the z scores this transformation step is essential for analyzing ecological data because the variables have different units and thus this renders no sense to compile values with different units tripathi and singal 2019 thereafter pearson s correlation was applied to the generated z scores to reveal linear relationships among different variables the factor analysis was then done on the correlation matrix using pca method with kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure of sampling adequacy bartlett s test of sphericity and varimax rotation to identify potential contamination sources wendler and gröttrup 2021 the kmo and bartlett s tests determine the applicability of pca since values above 0 6 and below 0 05 respectively are considered acceptable to proceed with pca backhaus et al 2021 the pcs with eigenvalues 1 0 were only considered and highly loaded variables having absolute values 0 6 were retained under each pc abuzaid and bassouny 2018 finally the hca using ward s linkage method and squared euclidean distance sed was applied to measure similarities between variables todorović et al 2016 and results were displayed in the form of a dendrogram all variables with sed below the phenon line were compiled in one cluster wei et al 2018 2 4 development of water quality indices wqis 2 4 1 indicator selections the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations 29 guidelines set by ayers and westcot 1994 were adopted to select parameters defining irrigation water quality index iwqi the four problem categories related to salinity sodicity toxicity and miscellaneous effects were considered the tds sodium adsorption ratio sar specific ions na cl and ptes and other parameters no3 n ph hco3 and tss were implied to quantify these potential problems the sar was calculated based on ion concentrations in mmolc l 1 using eq 2 luo et al 2021 as follows 2 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 due to lack of national guidelines for fish farming requirements widely accepted standards set by the canadian council of ministers of the environment for protecting aquatic life ccme 2007 were adopted to develop fish farming water quality index ffwqi they include water temperature ph do tds cl no2 n no3 n nh3 n and ptes the pca was applied to all datasets used for iwqi and ffwqi to build minimum datasets mds tripathi and singal 2019 when more than one variable was retained under a pc the correlation coefficient was considered to verify the representative one if they were not correlated each one was considered critical and was included in the mds jahin et al 2020 the minimum iwqi iwqimin and ffwqi ffwqimin were generated based on mds 2 4 2 calculating sub index values values of both original and crucial parameters were transformed to a unitless scale or score si ranging from 0 to 100 using eq 3 jahin et al 2020 as follows 3 s i 1 v a v i v s v i 100 where va is the actual value of parameter obtained by laboratory analysis vs is the standard value and vi is the ideal value in pure water which was considered 7 0 for ph 6 0 for do and zero for other parameters 2 4 3 establishment of parameter weights the sample size in this work n 80 was below the optimal range 150 300 for applying the msa in weight allocation and thus the ahp procedure described by saaty 2008 was considered firstly two pairwise comparison matrixes pcms were established for the two groups of original variables determining water quality for irrigation and fish farming uses the comparison of each criterion to one another was accomplished with a rating scale 1 9 prioritizing the criteria based on their importance occurred through questionnaires completed by ten local stockholders government officials academics researchers and consultants and authors experiences similarly two pcms were also developed for the two groups of shortlisted indicators mds finally a weight for each criterion could be estimated using the ahp software package expert choice the consistency ratio cr was considered to check the reality of the developed pcms and the established weights values of cr below 0 10 indicate an acceptable matrix while higher values require a revised judgment 2 4 4 final index and classes the final indices were calculated using eq 4 set by the national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi as follows 4 wqi i 1 n s i w i where si is the indicator score wi is the weight derived from ahp and n is the number of indicators the water quality could be classified into five grades excellent 91 100 good 71 90 moderate 51 70 low 26 50 and poor 0 25 2 5 human health risk assessment 2 5 1 non carcinogenic risk ncr the estimated daily dose edd of ncr exposure to ptes i e cr cu fe pb mn and zn via dermal contact mg kg 1 day 1 were estimated using eq 5 us epa 2004 as follows 5 edd c sa k p et ed ef cf bw at where c is a metal content in water sa is the skin surface area kp is the dermal permeability coefficient et is the exposure time ed is the exposure duration ef is the exposure frequency cf is the correction factor bw is the average body weight and at is the average time of exposure the exposure factors presented in table 1 were cited from us epa 2004 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 the hazard quotient hq for each pte was then estimated based on the reference dose rfd using eq 6 as follows 6 hq edd rfd the rfd represents the maximum permissible level of metals without health deterioration which is estimated by 3 00e 03 scientific notation equal to 1 10 3 4 02e 02 1 40e 01 5 25e 04 2 33e 02 and 6 00e 02 mg kg 1 day 1 for cr cu fe pb mn and zn respectively chen et al 2019 the ncr occurs when the edd exceeds the rfd the total hazard quotient thq is the sum of the hq for all metals eq 7 as follows 7 thq hq cr hq cu hq fe hq pb hq mn hq zn according to xiao et al 2021 the human health risk can be classified into three categories where the thq values of 1 1 4 and 4 indicate negligible medium and high human health risks respectively 2 5 2 carcinogenic risk cr the probability of cr due to exposure to carcinogenic ptes cr and pb was estimated the cr depends on the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr and total incremental lifetime cancer risk tilcr us epa 2004 the ilcr was calculated eq 8 considering cancer slope factor csf for a single metal as follows 8 ilcr edd csf the csf is estimated by 0 5 and 0 0085 for cr and pb respectively chen et al 2019 the tilcr was estimated eq 9 as follows chen et al 2019 9 tilcr cr cr cr pb generally for ilcr and tilcr the u s epa 2011 considered values below 1 00e 06 to pose no obvious risks on the other hand values ranging between 1 00e0 6 and 1 00e 04 are considered acceptable while values exceeding 1 00e 04 indicate a more significant risk 3 results 3 1 water composition results in table 2 show that temperature fell within the proper range for aquatic life as set by ccme 2007 water was neutral to moderately alkaline however ph values were within the normal range for irrigation ayers and westcot 1994 and aquatic life ccme 2007 on average the concentration of do was below the desirable range for aquatic life the tds met the normal range for irrigation but surpassed that limit for aquatic life the tss was below the maximum permissible limit mpl for localized drip irrigation the sodium adsorption ratio sar was below the mpl for surface irrigation but above that limit for sprinkler irrigation concentrations of soluble ions showed acceptable limits for irrigation except cl that exceed the mpl for surface and sprinkler irrigation on the other hand concentrations of cl no2 n and no3 n and nh3 were beyond the mpl for aquatic life concentrations of ptes were below the mpl for irrigation but surpassed that limit for fish farming except zn the cod and bod surpassed the mpl in surface water which was estimated by 10 0 mg l 1 for the former hussein et al 2021 and 4 0 mg l 1 for the latter vasistha and ganguly 2020 total counts of tc and fc were above the desirable limits in surface water i e 1 7 and 0 log cfu 100 ml 1 respectively vasistha and ganguly 2020 to identify water hydrochemical types the average concentrations of cations anions and tds in the four seasons were plotted in piper trilinear diagram as shown in fig 2 most of the canal water samples were situated in the hco3 ca zone of the diagram however all samples from drains were situated in the clna zone of the diagram according to luo et al 2021 waters with tds mg l 1 of 1000 1000 3000 3000 10 000 and 10 000 are considered fresh slightly saline moderately saline and highly saline respectively hence all canal water samples were freshwater while the drain water samples were slightly saline eight sites and moderately saline two sites waters the dominant major cations in the canal waters were ca2 and na while the drain waters were dominated by na the dominant major anions were hco3 and cl in the canal and drain waters respectively 3 2 multivariate statistical analysis pearson s correlation matrix table 3 indicates significant p 0 05 and highly significant p 0 01 correlations among water constituents temperature displayed positive correlations with tds ca2 and no3 mg2 na and cl but negative correlations with do and nh3 the ph showed positive correlations with tss k nh3 cr cod and bod the do showed positive correlations with nh3 and fc but negative correlations with mg2 na cl and no3 the tds showed positive correlations with ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 po4 2 cr mn cod and bod but negative correlations with tc and fc the tss showed positive correlations with cr cod and bod positive correlations occurred among ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 and hco3 nh3 showed positive correlations with cr pb cod bod and coliform bacteria the ptes including cu mn pb and zn correlated positively with fe while cr correlated positively with mn results of pca for all water datasets are presented in table 4 the kmo and the significance of bartlett s test of sphericity were 0 71 and zero respectively results reveal that the first seven pcs had eigenvalues 1 and explained 85 44 of the total variance the pc1 was responsible for 23 16 of the total variance with high positive loadings of tds mg2 na k cl and po4 p the pc2 accounted for 15 12 of the total variance and included ca2 hco3 so4 2 cod and bod the pc3 included cu fe pb mn and zn and represented 13 79 of the total variance the pc4 included tss ph and cr and represented 10 62 of the total variance the pc5 accounted for 9 08 of the total variance and was dominated by temperature and no3 n positive and do negative the pc6 was dominated by the tc and fc and represented 8 13 of the total variance the pc7 was dominated only by no2 n and accounted for 5 53 of the total variance results of the hca of the studied samples are shown in the dendogram presented in fig 3 based on visual interpretation the phenon line at sed of 25 divided the variables into two main groups drawing the phenon line across a sed 5 yielded seven clusters c1 to c7 group a included three clusters where tds na cl k mg2 and po4 p formed c1 temperature and no3 n represented c2 while c3 included cod bod ca2 so4 2 and hco3 group b included four clusters i e c4 cu zn pb fe and mn c5 ph tss and cr c6 tc and fc and c7 do nh3 and no2 n 3 3 water quality index wqi the weight values for the original indicators included in developing iwqi and ffwqi are shown in table 5 according to propriety derived from the ahp weight values for indicators delineated iwqi varied from 0 02 ph to 0 22 tds the corresponding values for ffwqi varied from 0 019 mn and zn to 0 207 temperature results of pca applied to all datasets defining iwqi and ffwqi for building mds are shown in table 6 the pca yielded three critical indicators i e sar ph and cu to be representative for irrigation water quality through ahp table 7 they were assigned weight values of 0 701 0 193 and 0 106 respectively the mds for fish farming had four indicators including temperature no2 n cr and zn as shown in table 7 these variables were assigned weight values of 0 535 0 270 0 120 and 0 075 respectively as shown in fig 4 values of iwqi ranged from 26 48 to 88 81 indicating low to good water quality the distribution of quality classes presented in fig 5 shows that 42 47 of samples were classified as good 32 88 as moderate and 24 66 as low on the other hand iwqimin indicated poor to good quality with values ranging from 22 37 to 88 34 under this index 31 51 32 88 34 25 and 1 37 of samples had good moderate low and poor quality respectively as shown in fig 6 results of iwqimin displayed high consistency with iwqi r2 0 83 and p 0 0001 the ffwqi ranged from 35 10 to 71 83 indicating low to good water quality the distribution of quality grades fig 5 shows that 1 37 of samples were classified as good 64 38 as moderate and 34 25 as low values of ffwqi min ranged from 44 51 to 91 11 indicating low to excellent water quality the index values quantified four classes i e excellent good moderate and low that accounted for 17 81 50 68 28 77 and 2 74 of total samples respectively results of ffwqimin were moderately consistent with ffwqi fig 6 r2 0 51 p 0 0001 3 4 human health risk assessment results in table 8 show that ranges of hq of all ptes for both adults and children were below 1 0 this indicates that the potential individual ncr of these elements in water remained within the tolerable range on average the hq of the ptes decreased in the order cr mn pb cu fe zn and this trend occurred for both adults and children ranges of thq for both adults and children were also lower than 1 0 this demonstrates that the overall ncr from dermal contact with water was safe for residents the hq and thq for adults were almost 3 folds those of children the carcinogenic analysis shows that mean values of ilcr for cr were below 1 00e 04 for adults and below 1 00e 06 for children this indicates that the potential risk associated with cr was acceptable for adults and safe for children the ranges of ilcr for pb were below 1 00e 06 for both adults and children indicating a safe limit on average the tilcr from dermal contact with water could be acceptable for adults and safe for children the ilcr and tilcr for adults were almost double those of children 4 discussion water composition quantifies its suitability to a specific use and simplifies the complexity of water dynamics and relevant control mechanisms chhabra 2021 several indicators for the investigated water samples surpassed the desirable standards for surface water quality this in turn reflects the degree of chemical and biological contamination in the studied area giao et al 2021 these findings confirm those obtained by gad et al 2020 who reported that the northern nile delta region is affected by medium to high chemical contamination in developing countries surface water is vulnerable to human interventions leong et al 2018 this is due to lack of sufficient sanitation systems particularly in rural areas that increases the magnitude of waste disposal into surface water bodies abbas et al 2020 the discharge of brackish agricultural and industrial effluents into irrigation networks might increase the soluble ions and thus tds abuzaid 2018 jahin et al 2020 the increments in cod and bod levels indicate contamination with organic substances abbas et al 2020 hence the do depletion might occur during the decomposition of organic substances and oxidation of inorganic chemicals sutadian et al 2018 the presence of coliform bacteria confirms the discharge of animal and human faces leong et al 2018 the piper s classification revealed that alkaline earth ca2 and weak acid hco3 were superior to alkalis na and k and strong acids so4 2 and cl in the canal waters as a result the hco3 ca was the predominant water type for these waters these findings are rather similar to those obtained by gad et al 2020 who reported that ca mg alkalinity was the predominant water type for canals waters in the northern nile delta region in general the prevalence of hco3 ca refers to water rock interaction as the dominant hydrogeochemical process controlling chemical composition of the canals waters xiao et al 2022 on the other hand na and cl were the predominant ions in the drain water samples indicating a clna water type both na and cl are major ions for surface waters in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2020 they are originated from human inputs besides natural origins including na feldspar weathering for na chen et al 2020 and halite dissolution for cl luo et al 2021 however in the investigated water samples the two ions showed positive relations with no3 n and po4 p this implies the similar source of these ions from the agricultural activities agrochemicals the ca revealed significant correlations among variables indicating consistency between the results jahin et al 2020 increased temperate led to high evaporation rates and promoted mineral dissolutions increasing the soluble ions and tds akter et al 2020 however this rise decreased the do and nh3 due to reducing molecular forces of attraction between gas molecules vasistha and ganguly 2020 the present conditions suggest that tss could be derived from flow disturbance phytoplankton organic wastes and industrial effluents giao et al 2021 during the photosynthesis process phytoplankton consumes co2 and thus the ph increased hussein et al 2021 the ph rise might enhance the decomposition of organic substances and dissolution of metal complexing anions yan et al 2022 and subsequently increments in cod bod k and cr occurred the ph rise also might promote nh3 accumulation probably due to inhibiting ammonia oxidizing microbes lu et al 2019 domestic wastes increased fc and free ammonia however the do range might not be suitable for complete ammonia oxidation and hence nitrate accumulation decreased sui et al 2016 the soluble mineral ions and dissolved organic carbon might contribute to tds that depended chiefly on combinations of ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 and hco3 jahin et al 2020 increasing water salinity might adversely affect the survival of coliform bacteria leong et al 2018 elements fe mn zn cu and pb might be from a similar source or had comparable characteristics jahin et al 2020 cr might be derived from a different origin however it displayed chemical behavior similar to mn kükrer and mutlu 2019 results of the ca indicate interrelations among the studied variable assuming that the pca would perform well tripathi and singal 2019 this could be confirmed by the kmo and bartlett s sphericity statistics wendler and gröttrup 2021 the kmo statistic measures the robustness of partial correlation how variables explain each other where values above 0 6 indicate a strong relation and thus it is plausible to proceed with factor analysis backhaus et al 2021 bartlett s test is applied to test the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix is identical no correlation among variables or not wendler and gröttrup 2021 the significance associated with bartlett s test lesser than 0 05 reveals that the null hypothesis is rejected and thus the factor analysis is applicable backhaus et al 2021 the studied water variables occurred in seven pcs reflecting possible origins and controlling factors the pc1 could denote the contribution of soluble ions leached from agricultural fields jahin et al 2020 the pc2 was dominated by organic pollution indicators cod and bod suggesting the possible contribution of organic fertilizers hussein et al 2021 the pc3 was representative for weathering rocks involved in ptes since fe and mn are major elements in the earth s crust and rarely originate from anthropic sources xiao et al 2019 the pc4 could be considered as the contribution of suspended solids derived from agricultural and industrial activities giao et al 2021 the pc5 could verify the significant effects of temperature fluctuations on the process of oxygen exchange in water vasistha and ganguly 2020 the pc6 could be considered as the contribution of domestic sewage runoff abbas et al 2020 the pc7 was representative for nutrients derived from fish farming effluents the hca revealed two major groups of clusters connected at a great distance this indicates that water composition was controlled by different factors todorović et al 2016 moving the phenon line to a sed of 5 led to a higher number of clusters generally no specific rule governs the linkage distance at which the phenon line should be drawn yidana and yidana 2010 and hence widely accepted sed 5 was considered todorović et al 2016 wei et al 2018 accordingly group a could represent the combined effects of agricultural inputs and hydrochemical processes for instance agrochemicals supplied water with soluble ions linked in c1 at a slightly higher sed c1 and c2 were connected confirming that temperature affected water mineral composition in c3 constituents related to oxidation of organic matter occurred they were linked to c2 and c1 but at a relatively higher sed supporting the hypothesis that water salinity was from inorganic and organic sources group b could verify combinations of different natural processes and human interventions weathering of metallic minerals contributed to ptes that occurred in c4 a further natural process flow disturbance besides industrial wastes was representative for c5 on the other hand biological indicators related to domestic wastes represented c6 water constituents associated with fish farming effluents occurred in c7 they might play significant roles in the nutrition and survival of coliform bacteria which could explain the linkage between c6 and c7 at a slightly higher sed results of the ahp provided in this study could be accepted as the crs for all pairwise comparison matrixes were below the critical limit of 0 10 this confirms that the local experts were consistent in their judgments saaty 2008 the indicators implied in developing wqis had different priorities in assessing water quality for irrigation and fish farming thus they were assigned different specific weights according to their relative importance sutadian et al 2017 the pca could minimize the number of variables having high loadings 0 6 in the same pc abuzaid and bassouny 2018 the analysis of water quality variables yielded three pcs for irrigation use and four pcs for fish farming use each pc had two or more well correlated variables and hence the highest loaded ones were only selected to represent mds jahin et al 2020 this is because highly correlated variables are considered redundant and such a discard reduces dimensions of multivariate datasets tripathi and singal 2019 the iwqi and iwqimin revealed a wide range good to poor of surface water suitability for irrigation these findings are rather similar to those of jahin et al 2020 who implemented various iwqis in kafr el sheikh governorate and reported that water quality ranged from excellent to poor such variations could be a result of wide ranges of water constituents that affects water suitability for a specific use chhabra 2021 uncontrolled waste disposal and hydrochemical processes might increase the water contaminants and deteriorate the overall quality abuzaid 2018 jahin et al 2020 according to chhabra 2021 good quality water can be used for irrigating a wide range of crops moderate quality water should be used under certain percussions while water of low and poor qualities can be used only for salt tolerant species the mds could adequately represent irrigation water quality since the iwqimin could explain 83 of the variations of iwqi this affirms the applicability of pca and ahp in designing a cost effective and time saving strategy to monitor spatio temporal changes in water quality these findings are in line with previous studies that adopted the pca for building mds for irrigation jahin et al 2020 and applied the ahp weighing procedure in case of small sample sizes sutadian et al 2017 the ffwqi indicates that the majority of water samples 98 63 were in moderate and low classes this points to potential drastic effects that may lead to poor growth of fish and high fish mortality therefore sufficient water treatments should be considered before using this water in fish cultures zaynab et al 2022 yu et al 2019 recommended an effective water treatment system for fish habitats through combinations of mechanical chemical and biological filters on the other hand the ffwqimin displayed a different trend in explaining water quality under this index nearly 70 of water samples fell in excellent and good grades this might be due to excluding several parameters that affected the final index jahin et al 2020 as a result the ffwqimin could explain only 51 of the variations of the ffwqi hence it is essential to increase the sampling size to obtain better performance the health risks usually result from human exposure to ptes in surface water through oral ingestion or dermal contact imran et al 2021 however the studied water bodies were used only for agricultural activities irrigation and fish farming therefore dermal contact with water is the primary pathway for ptes generally adults were more vulnerable to potential dermal related health risks than children this is logic because adults have a higher skin surface area compared with children us epa 2004 however the hq and thq indicated that human health risks due to exposure to metal contaminants in surface water are still safe in addition the probability of developing cancer over a lifetime is acceptable for adults and safe for children usually dermal contact with surface water poses little hazards as reported by earlier cases studies in arid environments such as in the chinese loess plateau xiao et al 2019 and manchar lake in pakistan imran et al 2021 consequently residents would use surface water for bathing or washing however future management and regulation should focus on cr to avoid potential cancer risks abuzaid and jahin 2021 5 conclusion in this work physicochemical and biological qualities of surface waters canals and drains in an area of the northern nile delta egypt typical for arid ecosystems were investigated advanced data analysis techniques including ca pca and hca were jointly applied with ahp through expert judgments to develop novel wqis for irrigation and fish farming uses the water quality was deteriorated by chemical and biological contaminants posing potential restrictions for irrigation and higher threats for fish production the msa revealed that water contamination was due to human activities agrochemicals industry domestic wastes and fish farming effluents and hydrochemical processes evaporation weathering and flow disturbance based on the pca sar cu and ph could efficiently represent irrigation water quality while temperature no2 n cr and zn could reflect fish farming requirements the ahp could provide reliable weights for the original and shortlisted water quality indicators the integration of pca and ahp could yield novel minimum wqis the iwqimin could adequately represent iwqi r2 0 83 showing high potentiality for cost effective and time saving monitoring of the irrigation water quality further verifications are needed to develop a better ffwqimin that was moderately consistent r2 0 51 with ffwqi the health risk analysis indicated that human exposure to ptes in water remained safe moreover the probability of developing cancer risk over a lifetime was acceptable for adults and safe for children however further attention should be paid to cr to avoid potential carcinogenic risks the study recommends more stringent environmental legislation to stop waste disposal into surface water bodies in addition using water treatment filter systems are necessary in fish ponds results of this work would be a base for comprehensive water quality control scenarios in the studied area and similar regions author statement none declaration of competing interest none
