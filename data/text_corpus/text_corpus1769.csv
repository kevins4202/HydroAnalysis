8845,crop models are widely used to assist in agricultural management decision making and water productivity optimization however traditional crop models often depend on artificial and specific field management inputs posing challenges in maintaining crops within a desired stress range consequently the derived optimization schemes from these models become highly uncertain moreover the complexity of the mechanisms involved and the multitude of parameters make it challenging to apply traditional crop models uniformly across various crops and regions in this study we have developed a novel crop model called whcrop water heat driven crop model that effectively captures reflects and controls the impact of various environmental factors meteorology topography soil and management on crop growth process the whcrop model combines the simulation principles of biomass and yield from the ceres module in the dssat model along with the soil water balance from the aquacrop model to estimate the dynamics of crop growth and production processes results indicated that whcrop based simulations including canopy cover cc daily evapotranspiration et and yield matched well with ground based measurements and were better than the traditional crop model dssat and aquacrop at both field and regional scales especially under deficient irrigation conditions besides capturing the key variables associated with crop growth whcrop model could reproduce the adaptive response of these various to regional scale temperature changes notably the whcrop model could effectively minimize uncertainties resulting from individual environmental change thanks its incorporation of dynamic response mechanisms for crop growth under stress factors overall the novel and informative whcrop model offers some advantages over traditional crop models since it allows for optimal decision making to be derived from the randomly different inputs as a result the whcrop model proves instrumental in assisting decision makers in formulating critical water allocation strategies and developing effective management recommendations to enhance regional agricultural water productivity keywords dynamic crop model water heat driven evapotranspiration yield crop growth process heihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in a context of changing environments crop models are considered as valuable tools in agricultural research for simulating crop growth development and yield they provide essential information to academic community farmers and policy makers to promote sustainable agriculture worldwide chenu et al 2017 gallardo et al 2020 peng et al 2020 mialyk et al 2022 mathematical methods and computer technology are adopted in crop modeling to quantitatively evaluate the responses of crop physiological processes photosynthesis dark respiration evapotranspiration etc to the environmental variables climate soil topography etc and management practices tillage irrigation fertilization etc soltani and sinclair 2012 silvestro et al 2017 ahmed and ahmad 2020 yin et al 2021 the utilization of crop models in agricultural research is actively encouraged to support scientific and systematical decision making in agricultural management holzkämper 2017 xue et al 2020 traditionally scoping the best management practices using crop models has relied on a fixed number of parameters or scenarios as inputs which are artificially determined and subjective thereby hindering the attainment of globally optimal scenarios kadiyala et al 2015 he et al 2012 in contrast the use of dynamic adjustments in model inputs allows for the determination of more reasonable optimal management practices parker et al 2008 for instance deficit irrigation technology is widely adopted in arid and semi arid regions since its capability of reducing crop transpiration to improve water productivity however previous irrigation schemes were established through simulations using crop models considering uniform irrigation dates and rates kloss et al 2012 these irrigation schemes often fail to provide differentiated practice information such as specific irrigation levels or continuous irrigation schedules tailored to different simulation units at the regional scale therefore the realization of sustainable agriculture urgently requires an improvement in the traditional form of crop models enabling the development of stochastic and globally dynamic decision making schemes for regional field management the development of crop models has been a natural progression of scientific research since 1960 s pioneered by de wit 1965 over the years numerous models have been developed to simulate crop yield and key processes involved in crop growth and development among these models widely used simulation models include dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer apsim agricultural production system simulator stics soil plant simulation model monica model for nitrogen and carbon dynamics in agro ecosystems epic erosion productivity impact calculator and aquacrop etc these crop models can be classified into different groups or types depending on their design purposes ranging from empirical models to mechanistic models saarikko 2000 rauff and bello 2015 empirical crop models are typically constructed using statistical methods with fewer parameters these models primarily focus on quantify the relationship between inputs and outputs but do not provide information on the underlying crop growth mechanisms that drive the response liu et al 2016 in contrast mechanistic models have the ability to simulate relevant physical chemical and biological processes and they aim to explain how and why particular responses to environmental variables occurs providing a more comprehensive understanding of the crop growth dynamics however since they are being highly mechanistic these models usually require more parameters as inputs making their application at the regional scale more challenging mechanistic crop models can be broadly categorized into three main types based on their primary simulation principles light driven crop models co2 driven models and water driven models ran et al 2017 challinor and wheeler 2008 boote et al 2013 light driven crop models such as dssat model primarily focus on understanding the effects of temperature and solar radiation on crop photosynthesis as well as the accumulation processes of crop biomass and yield co2 driven crop models such as wofost and stics models mainly emphasize the effects of co2 concentration on crop photosynthesis and yield besides water driven crop models such as the aquacrop model introduced by fao take into account the changes in soil moisture changes during the crop growth season and yield simulation based on evapotranspiration steduto et al 2009 courault et al 2010 however for these crop models with a single driving mechanism the major limitation is that their modeling results can often ignore the influence of other environmental factors due to the weak correlation between the driving factors for instance while light driven crop models generally perform better in simulating crop biomass and yield they may not accurately predict evapotranspiration compared to water driven crop models lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 tolomio and casa 2020 consequently when these crop models are applied at the regional scale the spatial distribution of crop yield tends to align with the distribution of light and solar radiation in the light driven models and with soil texture in the water driven crop models the significance of mechanistic systematic and predictive crop models at the regional scale has been underscored by regional challenges arising from globalization including regional food security regional climate change etc mutanga et al 2017 mora et al 2020 most regional scale crop models built upon field scale crop models as their core modules such as epic based crop models pdssat model papsim model etc balkovič et al 2013 when applied regionally these models necessitate numerous input related assumptions such as the use of the same crop species and phenological parameters globally however many of the environmental variables crucial for crop model simulations such as meteorology soil and topography exhibit significant spatial variability in addition spatial uncertainties also exist in crop varieties field management practices and model parameters such as genetic parameters and phenological period parameters liu et al 2015 all these spatial uncertainties can directly affect various aspects of crop modeling resulting in the discrepancies between the simulated and actual crop growth as well as the poor accuracy of crop models when applied to the regional scale li et al 2017a li et al 2017b fortunately uncertainties can be avoided to some content by calibrating meteorological data investigating spatial crop planting information and other parameters at the regional scale huang et al 2015 this also means that a more complex crop model with more parameters requiring calibration will usually obtain results with higher errors in regional scale application conversely crop models with fewer parameters are relatively easier to apply at the regional scale with more reasonable results obtained finding the right balance between model complexity and calibration requirements is crucial in achieving accurate and reliable predictions at the regional level therefore the main objectives of our study are 1 to develop a novel two stage dynamic crop model named whcrop which coupling water heat driven processes throughout the crop growth season in arid region based on the principles of existing crop models and taking lower threshold of soil moisture content and irrigation level as the constraints to simulate the daily crop water stress dynamics based on the one dimension soil water balance equation and 2 to evaluate the performance of whcrop and compare its simulations with those generated by traditional field crop growth model dssat and aquacrop model and 3 to apply the whcrop model in simulating the spatial distribution of regional evapotranspiration et crop biomass and yield in heihe river basin hrb located in the northwest region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of whcrop model 2 1 1 principle of development the aquacrop model stands out for its simple and user friendly structure with easily observable parameters for model input in the field considering these advantages referring to the framework of aquacrop model we integrated the yield simulation process of ceres model for cereal crops in dssat system to develop a water heat driven model for estimating the dynamics of crop growth the schematic diagram of this model is shown in fig 1 based on that matlab programming was adopted to writing and reading grouped input spatial environment and management parameters and output files yield biomass and evapotranspiration of whcrop model for the region instead of the input and output for a specific field in that way the whcrop model capable of estimating the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop growth were developed the remarkable features of the whcrop model are summarized as follows 1 comprehensive model mechanism the whcrop model incorporates various crucial environmental factors climate topography soil and field management that significantly influence the crop growth process the crop growth stages were divided by temperature solar radiation and radiation use efficiency rue were used to simulate the crop biomass and yield besides one dimensional water balance equation was adopted in the estimation of crop water consumption 2 dynamic simulation process the dynamic regulation of the crop growth process was achieved through the use of one dimensional water balance equation which calculated the soil water deficit coefficient on daily basis this soil water deficit coefficient was then used to calibrate crop water consumption biomass and yield in real time specifically the impact of soil water deficit coefficient from the previous day was applied to determine the crop growth status for the following day 3 controllable decision making process we introduce the concept of irrigation satisfaction k p which represents the ratio of actual irrigation water to full irrigation allowing us to control irrigation levels this ensures that the field soil water content stays within an acceptable range that minimally affects crop growth by establishing the relationship between k p and key crop growth indicators like the canopy cover we can adjust the general pattern of crop growth 4 suitable for most crops we have divided the crop growth process into two phases namely vegetative growth and reproductive growth which are applicable to most annual crops stage simulation is carried out according to the different canopy growth curves and rue of crops in the two stages 5 high space adaptability we use an empirical model that considers elevation and the length of crop growth period to capture the spatial adaptation process of crop growth to temperature this enables the model to effectively account for variations on growth degree day across different geographical locations 2 1 2 calculations in main module 1 determination of crop growth stages we assume that when the average daily temperature for 5 consecutive days exceeds the minimum temperature threshold t thr lower below this temperature crops grow slowly for crop growth the fifth day is selected as the planting date of the crop theoretical optimum planting date the determination of the start date of the crop growth period is as shown in eq 1 meanwhile we assume that once the maximum temperature threshold t thr upper for crop growth is exceeded crop growth will stop as shown in table 1 1 min t t sart ijx 4 t t sart ijx t th r lower x where t th r lower x is the lower growth temperature threshold for crop x and t t s t a r t i j x and t t sart ijx 4 are temperatures on the starting date of crop growth and fourth day before the starting date respectively referring to the previous studies chenu et al 2009 we determined the relationship between crop growth length and elevation as follows 2 n i j x n base x h i j h b a s e 30 where n ijx is the length of crop grow growth for crop x d n base x is the length of crop growth for crop x at the experiment station that is any reference length of crop growth d h base is the elevation of the experiment station 1580 m h ij is the elevation of point ij m take maize as an example the whole crop growth period is divided into the vegetative stage i and reproductive stage ii as shown in fig 2 stage i and ii mainly regulate the development of crop biomass and yield respectively during the vegetative growth stage photosynthetic products mainly supply the growth of nutritional organs such as roots stems and leaves while in the reproductive growth stage they mainly support the growth of reproductive organs such as flowers fruits and seeds we used accumulated temperature to determine the timing of two growth stage specifically the crop will enter reproductive growth after the effective accumulated temperature from the starting date exceeds the temperature threshold t thr x required for the vegetative growth stage 3 t 1 t d i j x t i j t t t h r i j x 2 simulation of canopy cover the crop canopy cover cc is a crucial crop growth indicator representing the proportion of the surface covered by the vertical projection of the crop canopy lu et al 2021 and directly affects the changes in crop biomass yield and evapotranspiration according to the growth status of most annual crops we used two change curves to fit the changes of cc in two growth stages separately s curve stage ⅰ and quadratic function stage ⅱ the growth of crop canopy at stage ⅰ undergoes a slow growth stage followed by rapid growth and eventually reaches a leaf stabilization stage in stage ii since most of photosynthetic products are preferentially supplied to reproductive organs leaves tend to wilt partially due to water nutrient heat and pest stresses the crop cc at the above two stages can be calculated as follows canopy growth stage i 4 c c t ijx c c max i jx 1 e 8 85 0 17 t ijx canopy decay stage ii 5 c c t ijx k ijx t ijx t d ijx 100 2 c c max i jx where cc max ijx and k ijx are maximum canopy cover and attenuation coefficient of the crop x at ij point both of which are greatly varied with crop species and water deficit status and calibrated through field experiments 3 simulation of crop evapotranspiration as two parts of the et we calculated the soil evaporation and plant transpiration by incorporating reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 cc or leave area index lai and soil water deficit coefficient ks as shown in eqs 6 and 7 specifically et 0 calculated by penman monteith methods allen et al 1998 provides feedbacks of the meteorological effects while ks determined through one dimension water balance equation indicates soil moisture content crop growth status is reflected by lai and cc meanwhile we also considered the area percentage of mulching k m in the calculation of soil evaporation since leaf stomata which do not affect crop transpiration rate vary greatly among different crop types different crop transpiration coefficients kc are applied in this study the specific calculation process is as follows 6 e s t ijx 1 k m x e t 0 ij e ke p x la i t ijx k s t 1 ijx 7 e p t ijx k z x e t 0 ij c c t ijx k s t 1 ijx 8 e t t ijx e s t ijx e p t ijx 9 la i t ijx ln 1 c c t ijx 1 005 5

organs like the root stem and leaf to promote the biomass growth while at stage ii the photosynthetic products would be accumulated in the seeds fruits and other economic products of the crop that is the estimated crop yield equals to the cumulative biomass at stage ii detailed calculations are shown as follows 13 biomas s t ijx ru e x r s t ij 1 e k x la i t ijx 0 01 k s t ijx k p ijx 14 yiel d

performance evaluation we will provide a case study using the above mentioned new whcrop model in order to test its applicability and robustness 2 2 1 description of study area and data as a typical arid region in china heihe river basin hrb holds the second largest inland watershed and serves as a production base of commodity food fig 3 the study area is selected as the middle reaches of the hrb characterized by a flat oasis area containing 95 of the cultivated land and contributing to 80 of gdp in hrb hrb exhibits a typical temperate continental arid climate experiencing extreme dryness that causes it to evaporate nearly all received precipitation the region s average annual precipitation has remained below 150 mm over the past 60 years 1961 2020 while the annual potential evaporation ranges from less than 2000 mm in the east to 4000 mm in the west with the annual sunshine hours of about 3000 4000 h year and the accumulated temperature above 3000 the middle reaches of the hrb have sufficient light and heat resources as well as a large temperature variation between day and night these favorable conditions combined with and the region s fertile soil make the hrb an ideal region location for seed industry development the hrb boasts approximately 24 75 108 m3 of available surface water and 1 75 108 m3 of groundwater resources li et al 2017a li et al 2017b the irrigated area accounts for over 50 of the plain area and about 25 in the mountainous area with agricultural water use comprising over 85 of the total water usage in this region in this study the top three crops of hrb maize wheat and onion were taken as the research objects accounting for more than 85 of the total crop area to evaluate the performance of whcrop model measurement datasets were collected from the maize wheat and onion experiments in shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university the shiyanghe experiment station located approximately 200 km southeast of hrb exhibits climatic conditions characterized by over 3000 h year of annual sunshine hours and annual evaporation exceeding ten times the precipitation besides both regions employ the same irrigation methods and crop varieties 2 2 2 model calibration and validation to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the whcrop model we adopted measurement datasets for model calibration and validation from various experiments conducted at shiyanghe experimental station these included a two year seed maize experimental shi et al 2022 a two year wheat experiment yang et al 2018 and a one year onion experiment zheng et al 2013 conducted during specific years 2015 2016 for maize 2014 2015 for wheat and 2010 for onion in these experiments only different irrigation water amounts were set as experimental treatments for the maize experiment three irrigation treatments were established w1 as the control group with full irrigation initiated when the soil water content dropped to 75 80 of field capacity the θ fc and the irrigation amount being the difference between the soil water content and θ fc w2 and w3 as the experimental groups receiving 2 3 and 1 3 1 2 in 2016 of the full irrigation amount respectively at the same irrigation time as w1 in the wheat experiments three irrigation treatments were set w1 as the control group receiving full irrigation according to local water amounts w2 and w3 receiving 2 3 and 1 2 of full irrigation amount respectively in the onion experiments eight irrigation levels were built t4 as the full irrigation control group irrigation water amount corresponding to the crop water demand t1 t3 at 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 of full irrigation amount respectively at the same time as full irrigation t5 t8 at 0 4 of full irrigation during the seedling stage leaf growing stage bulb expansion period and mature period while the rest of the growth period received the same irrigation as full irrigation the specific irrigation amount and irrigation time can be found in the references we assume that the canopy does not experience nutrient stress throughout its growth period we only fitted the relationships between the irrigation treatment levels k p and the maximum cc cc max and canopy attenuation coefficients k respectively to enhance the applicability of the model 15 c c max i j 1 0 012 k p ij 1 0 93 16 k ij 1 4 73 k p ij 1

represent wheat and onion respectively at point ij that is the ratio of actual crop irrigation amount to full irrigation as the irrigation satisfaction increases the maximum crop cc also increases while the k decreases during the stage ii the whcrop model was calibrated by simultaneously fitting the simulated crop cc et and yield to measured data obtained from three crop experiments specifically the measured datasets from maize in 2015 wheat in 2015 and onion in 2010 under t3 t6 treatments were adopted in the model calibration the measurements of maize in 2016 wheat in 2014 and onion in 2010 under t1 t2 and t7 t8 treatments were used in the model validation besides the whcrop based simulation results were compared to dssat and aquacrop based modeling results in the maize field to further evaluate the model performance the calibrated model parameters describing crop growth and field management for the three crops are summarized in table 1 six widely used indexes including the regression coefficient b0 root mean square error rmse the normalized root means square error nrmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency factor ef the coefficient of determination r2 and willmott s consistency index d were adopted to assess the performance of the model in this study these indexes were calculated as follows ran et al 2020 21 b 0 i 1 n m i s i i 1 n m i 2 22 r 2 i 1

number of simulations s i and m i is the simulated and observed value of the ith model outputs respectively s and m is the averaged value of the simulated and observed model outputs respectively 2 2 3 spatial simulation based on the above calculation process 2 1 2 spatial simulation was realized one by one through matlab platform the length of crop growth period in each grid was determined using eq 2 various spatial datasets including the meteorological data daily mean temperature solar radiation precipitation and reference evapotranspiration elevation soil field capacity irrigation water etc as shown in fig 1 were taken as inputs since irrigation time and irrigation water volume are challenging to observe or count spatially we assumed that all units do not experience soil water deficit in other words we maintained the soil water content above 60 of field capacity the soil wilting coefficient of each unit in this study area was lower than 60 of the field capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance at the field scale good agreements were obtained by the whcrop model in simulating the crop canopy cover cc crop accumulated evapotranspiration aet and yield for three main crops maize wheat and onion in the hrb at the field scale the fitted curves during the crop growth period were shown in figs 4 6 and the corresponding performance matric were given in table 2 to assess the performance of whcrop model we used the popular dssat and aquacrop models to simulate the growth of maize as a reference the fitted curve and performance of the simulated results were shown in fig 7 and table 3 respectively our findings indicated that whcrop has an overall better performance than dssat and aquacrop which are the basis of developing the whcrop model the two stage canopy curve in whcrop model could well fit the canopy changes of the three crops in this study at the field scale especially under no water deficit treatment compared with dssat model and auqacrop model shown as table 3 in terms of simulating cc whcrop exhibited superior calibration accuracy b 0 1 01 r 2 0 98 rmse 0 06 nrmse 10 45 ef 0 97 d 0 99 while it performed slightly less accurately in validation b 0 0 95 r 2 0 90 rmse 0 11 nrmse 17 18 ef 0 88 d 0 97 than the other two crop models b 0 0 99 1 00 r 2 0 92 0 97 rmse 0 06 0 09 nrmse 9 26 13 85 ef 0 92 0 96 d 0 98 0 99 the crop canopy growth curves embedded in the whcrop model are empirical and depend on calibration data the over fitting of the phenomenon of premature aging cc drops steeply in the late growth period of maize under the severe water deficit verification treatment w3 made the attenuation trend of cc not be significantly improved by increasing the irrigation amount from 1 3 1 2 of full irrigation during model verification process more data on premature aging or more water treatment experiments could help enhance the simulation performance of whcrop model the fig 4 i and l demonstrated that the satisfactory performance whcrop model in both calibration and validation process for cc during the late growth stage of wheat under severe water deficit treatment w3 without severe premature senescence for the simulation of crop accumulated evapotranspiration aet whcrop model performed better than the other two crop models particularly in the case of maize under water deficit conditions compared with other two crop models the difference between the simulation results of whcrop model and the measured values of aet in the late growth period of maize was smaller the simulation performance of whcrop model b

for experimental groups with greater water deficit for example onion under the t1 t3 treatments fig 5 h j experienced continuous water deficit throughout the whole growth period while severe water deficit occurred during the most water sensitive growth period leaf growing stage bulb expansion period under the t5 and t6 treatments fig 5 m n in the future the whcrop model can be improved by introducing crop water sensitivity coefficient to adjust the response of different crops to water stress during various growth periods besides for the simulation of daily evapotranspiration etd the simulation results by whcrop model were most consistent with the measurement value represented by eddy covariance ec fig 8 and table 4 the whcrop model avoided the large error that the other two crop models show in the growth period which is lower than the ec value in the middle growth period and higher than the ec value in the later growth period specifically in calibration the simulated etd from whcrop model demonstrated a closer match to the ec measurements than the other two models since a higher b 0 of 0 85 and other model performance indexes did not show significant difference from one another table 4 in the validation whcrop models performed better in all good of fit indexes than the other two models b 0 0 92 r 2 0 85 rmse 0 83 mm nrmse 23 87 ef 0 84 d 0 966 since most practical applications in water resources and agricultural management require long time series of daily et at the field scale the newly developed whcrop model proved to be an efficient tool for simulating daily et and providing valuable information for optimizing irrigation management the good performance of whcrop model was also indicated by the simulation of the crop yield fig 6 in both the calibration and validation the value of b 0 was in the range of 0 95 1 03 while the values of d ranged from 0 72 to 0 99 these results indicated that the simulated values closely matched the measured values demonstrating good consistency besides the nrmse values were below 20 for all three crops the r 2 were all above 0 67 in both calibration and validation except for a relatively low r 2 of 0 32 and 0 16 in calibration and validation for wheat and a low r 2 of 0 54 in validation for onion similarly high ef values above 0 67 were calculated for maize while negative ef values were calculated for wheat and onion in both calibration and validation the negative ef values could be induced by the limited availability of yield measurement datasets in the calibration and validation for wheat and onion and measurement errors existing in one or two values could greatly reduce the r 2 and ef the simulation results comparing the three crop models for maize yield were shown in fig 9 for yield the whcrop model had a better performance for all good of fit indexes in calibration b 0 1 03 r 2 0 90 rmse 0 41 t ha nrmse 6 55 ef 0 86 d 0 97 and in validation r 2 0 67 b 0 0 98 rmse 0 62 t ha nrmse 9 55 ef 0 63 d 0 90 compared to the dssat pm and aquacrop models overall whcrop demonstrated superior performance compared to other widely used crop models in simulating crop growth and water consumption processes 3 2 whcrop based simulation at regional scale 3 2 1 the spatial distributions of whcrop results the spatial distribution of four model outputs including the length of crop growth period et biomass and yield were presented in fig 10 for maize wheat and onion under full irrigation condition respectively fig 10 a shown that the length of growth season for maize ranged from 142 to 180 d at the regional scale longer length of growth season for maize were observed in the southern gaotai county and southern ganzhou district which had higher elevations due to the slight differences in elevation the remaining areas exhibited little variations in the length of the growth season at the regional scale the spatial scale et biomass and yield of maize ranged from 371 28 to 621 06 mm from 24 00 to 31 33 t ha and from 7 19 to 9 75 t ha respectively affected by the simulation principle of whcrop model the spatial distribution patterns of maize et biomass and yield were no longer consistent with any single environmental variable this inconsistency was particularly evident in the spatial distribution of maize yields the spatial distribution of maize et and biomass exhibited higher value in the south and lower value in the north the minimum values of maize yield and biomass were located at the junction of linze and gaotai counties determined by the growth season the maximum values of yield were located at the junction of ganzhou and linze counties as well as in the southern plain area of ganzhou district and the maximum values of biomass were found in the southern ganzhou district and the southern gaotai county the maximum values of maize et were located in the southern plain area of ganzhou district and eastern gaotai county while the lowest values were found in the whole northeastern gaotai county for wheat the spatial distribution of whcrop outputs was reproduced in fig 10 b the length of growth season varied from 109 to 147d at the regional scale this variation was characterized by high values in south area with high elevation and low values in the northern and central plains which aligns with the spatial outputs of maize above this is due to the length of growth season was primarily by elevation the regional et biomass and yield of wheat were in the range of 289 69 589 54 mm 14 81 25 87 t ha and 6 51 9 26 t ha respectively additionally under the influence of the elevation and the length of crop growth season all of these variables presented high values in the south and low values in the north similar spatial distribution patterns were also detected in whcrop based outputs for onion fig 10 c specifically the growth season length for onion were in a range of 108 146 d and the regional et biomass and yield of onion varied in the range of 276 14 509 20 mm 83 80 106 97 t ha and 42 16 60 63 t ha respectively the simulated et for wheat was slightly higher than that of onion and much lower than that of maize in this study 3 2 2 the comparison of spatial outputs from whcrop and pdssat and aquacrop gis to better demonstrate the capabilities of whcrop model in simulating at the regional scale we selected regional et and yield of maize as the representative outputs and compared them to the simulation results obtained from pdssat and aquacrop gis fig 10 d and e the spatial simulation results of the energy driven dssat python model were usually more responsive to climatic factors temperature and topographic factors elevation and latitude and less responsive to soil parameters while the spatial simulation results of the water driven aquacrop gis model were more responsive to spatial variation of soil parameters and less responsive to topographic and climatic factors ran et al 2020 it is clear that the spatial distribution of length of growth season from whcrop was consistent with that in pdssat compared to pdssat 123 192 d and aquacrop gis 135 205 d whcrop simulated a shorter length of growth season within a range of 142 180 d the reason for this discrepancy was the different factors determining the length of growth season temperature and topography elevation were combined in the empirical equation in whcrop while a fixed temperature setup was the only factor in determining the length of growth season in other two crop models the biomass values simulated by whcrop were 21 97 lower than those from the dssat python model and nearly 13 81 higher than those from the aquacrop gis model besides the simulated length of growth season varied significantly among the three crop models due to the influence of elevation in this study area whcrop model exhibited fewer fluctuations in the length of growth season simulation consequently the whcrop model was less affected by the low temperatures in the southern area and the spatial variability coefficient of variation cv in table 4 of yield and biomass simulated by whcrop was much lower compared to the other two gridded crop models overall there was no significant difference in the spatial variability of maize yield simulated among these three crop models regarding the spatial distribution of maize et the average value of regional maize et based on the whcrop model was only 2 94 lower than that from the pdssat model and 7 21 higher than that from aquacrop gis in table 4 the whcrop based cv representing the spatial variability of et was higher than that of the other two crop models this indicated that the whcrop model shown a better response in simulating et to the environment factors compared to the other two crop models in the whcrop model et simulations were mainly affected by reference evapotranspiration crop canopy length of crop growth season and soil water deficit etc emphasizing the interactive coordination of et and environmental factors for the spatial distribution of yield whcrop provided comparable mapping results to dssat python with most values being nearly 50 higher than those of the aquacrop gis model overall whcrop could simulate at the regional scale and yield similar outputs to pdssat and aquacrop gis while a more significant response in spatial variability to various environmental factors compared to the other two crop models at the regional scale 4 conclusion the whcrop model a novel water heat driven model was developed to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop growth it integrated the principles of crop yield simulation based on radiation and temperature from the dssat model as well as soil moisture and et simulation based on the one dimensional soil water balance in the aquacrop model based on that the model was calibrated and validated for three main crops maize wheat and onion in hrb with results indicating good performance in this typical study area to further test the model performance whcrop based simulation results were compared with other two site based crop models dssat and aquacrop during both calibration and validation phases whcrop model demonstrated an overall superior performance compared to the other two crop models due to its inclusion of the dynamic effect of water stress soil water deficit on crop growth et and yield in addition the spatial distribution of whcrop outputs length of growth season et biomass and yield matched well with the results from gridded crop model pdssat and aquacrop gis at the regional scale by considering the dynamic response processes of crop growth to stress factors whcrop minimized the likelihood of significantly biased outputs resulting from a single environmental change the spatial variability of et simulated by whcrop was higher than what of pdssat and aquacrop gis besides whcrop was capable of simulating the crop growth adaptive process to temperature change with lower spatial variability of yield and biomass compared to pdssat and the aquacrop gis compared to pdssat and aquacrop gis the whcrop model requires fewer adjusted parameters and input datasets which are readily available from observation sites or regional datasets such as meteorological data soil water field capacity and irrigation water depth etc as it was programmed in matlab mathworks inc 2011 the whcrop model can be easily run on various operating systems and seamlessly coupled with other optimization models embedded with complex algorithms in the near future extended work on calibrating and validating the whcrop performance at the regional scale using regional monitoring datasets could be a great improvement over the current version of the whcrop model in addition incorporating the effects of soil nutrient stress and fertilizer management into the whcrop model can provide valuable insights to regional decision makers enabling them to optimize the fertilization regime and mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus pollution finally the whcrop model could be used to upgrade toolbox of key irrigation decision makers and improve the knowledge of best water management practices to enhance water productivity and yield the simplicity of the whcrop model with respect to its required fewer and readily available input data also makes it user friendly thus it can greatly benefit

8845,crop models are widely used to assist in agricultural management decision making and water productivity optimization however traditional crop models often depend on artificial and specific field management inputs posing challenges in maintaining crops within a desired stress range consequently the derived optimization schemes from these models become highly uncertain moreover the complexity of the mechanisms involved and the multitude of parameters make it challenging to apply traditional crop models uniformly across various crops and regions in this study we have developed a novel crop model called whcrop water heat driven crop model that effectively captures reflects and controls the impact of various environmental factors meteorology topography soil and management on crop growth process the whcrop model combines the simulation principles of biomass and yield from the ceres module in the dssat model along with the soil water balance from the aquacrop model to estimate the dynamics of crop growth and production processes results indicated that whcrop based simulations including canopy cover cc daily evapotranspiration et and yield matched well with ground based measurements and were better than the traditional crop model dssat and aquacrop at both field and regional scales especially under deficient irrigation conditions besides capturing the key variables associated with crop growth whcrop model could reproduce the adaptive response of these various to regional scale temperature changes notably the whcrop model could effectively minimize uncertainties resulting from individual environmental change thanks its incorporation of dynamic response mechanisms for crop growth under stress factors overall the novel and informative whcrop model offers some advantages over traditional crop models since it allows for optimal decision making to be derived from the randomly different inputs as a result the whcrop model proves instrumental in assisting decision makers in formulating critical water allocation strategies and developing effective management recommendations to enhance regional agricultural water productivity keywords dynamic crop model water heat driven evapotranspiration yield crop growth process heihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in a context of changing environments crop models are considered as valuable tools in agricultural research for simulating crop growth development and yield they provide essential information to academic community farmers and policy makers to promote sustainable agriculture worldwide chenu et al 2017 gallardo et al 2020 peng et al 2020 mialyk et al 2022 mathematical methods and computer technology are adopted in crop modeling to quantitatively evaluate the responses of crop physiological processes photosynthesis dark respiration evapotranspiration etc to the environmental variables climate soil topography etc and management practices tillage irrigation fertilization etc soltani and sinclair 2012 silvestro et al 2017 ahmed and ahmad 2020 yin et al 2021 the utilization of crop models in agricultural research is actively encouraged to support scientific and systematical decision making in agricultural management holzkämper 2017 xue et al 2020 traditionally scoping the best management practices using crop models has relied on a fixed number of parameters or scenarios as inputs which are artificially determined and subjective thereby hindering the attainment of globally optimal scenarios kadiyala et al 2015 he et al 2012 in contrast the use of dynamic adjustments in model inputs allows for the determination of more reasonable optimal management practices parker et al 2008 for instance deficit irrigation technology is widely adopted in arid and semi arid regions since its capability of reducing crop transpiration to improve water productivity however previous irrigation schemes were established through simulations using crop models considering uniform irrigation dates and rates kloss et al 2012 these irrigation schemes often fail to provide differentiated practice information such as specific irrigation levels or continuous irrigation schedules tailored to different simulation units at the regional scale therefore the realization of sustainable agriculture urgently requires an improvement in the traditional form of crop models enabling the development of stochastic and globally dynamic decision making schemes for regional field management the development of crop models has been a natural progression of scientific research since 1960 s pioneered by de wit 1965 over the years numerous models have been developed to simulate crop yield and key processes involved in crop growth and development among these models widely used simulation models include dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer apsim agricultural production system simulator stics soil plant simulation model monica model for nitrogen and carbon dynamics in agro ecosystems epic erosion productivity impact calculator and aquacrop etc these crop models can be classified into different groups or types depending on their design purposes ranging from empirical models to mechanistic models saarikko 2000 rauff and bello 2015 empirical crop models are typically constructed using statistical methods with fewer parameters these models primarily focus on quantify the relationship between inputs and outputs but do not provide information on the underlying crop growth mechanisms that drive the response liu et al 2016 in contrast mechanistic models have the ability to simulate relevant physical chemical and biological processes and they aim to explain how and why particular responses to environmental variables occurs providing a more comprehensive understanding of the crop growth dynamics however since they are being highly mechanistic these models usually require more parameters as inputs making their application at the regional scale more challenging mechanistic crop models can be broadly categorized into three main types based on their primary simulation principles light driven crop models co2 driven models and water driven models ran et al 2017 challinor and wheeler 2008 boote et al 2013 light driven crop models such as dssat model primarily focus on understanding the effects of temperature and solar radiation on crop photosynthesis as well as the accumulation processes of crop biomass and yield co2 driven crop models such as wofost and stics models mainly emphasize the effects of co2 concentration on crop photosynthesis and yield besides water driven crop models such as the aquacrop model introduced by fao take into account the changes in soil moisture changes during the crop growth season and yield simulation based on evapotranspiration steduto et al 2009 courault et al 2010 however for these crop models with a single driving mechanism the major limitation is that their modeling results can often ignore the influence of other environmental factors due to the weak correlation between the driving factors for instance while light driven crop models generally perform better in simulating crop biomass and yield they may not accurately predict evapotranspiration compared to water driven crop models lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 tolomio and casa 2020 consequently when these crop models are applied at the regional scale the spatial distribution of crop yield tends to align with the distribution of light and solar radiation in the light driven models and with soil texture in the water driven crop models the significance of mechanistic systematic and predictive crop models at the regional scale has been underscored by regional challenges arising from globalization including regional food security regional climate change etc mutanga et al 2017 mora et al 2020 most regional scale crop models built upon field scale crop models as their core modules such as epic based crop models pdssat model papsim model etc balkovič et al 2013 when applied regionally these models necessitate numerous input related assumptions such as the use of the same crop species and phenological parameters globally however many of the environmental variables crucial for crop model simulations such as meteorology soil and topography exhibit significant spatial variability in addition spatial uncertainties also exist in crop varieties field management practices and model parameters such as genetic parameters and phenological period parameters liu et al 2015 all these spatial uncertainties can directly affect various aspects of crop modeling resulting in the discrepancies between the simulated and actual crop growth as well as the poor accuracy of crop models when applied to the regional scale li et al 2017a li et al 2017b fortunately uncertainties can be avoided to some content by calibrating meteorological data investigating spatial crop planting information and other parameters at the regional scale huang et al 2015 this also means that a more complex crop model with more parameters requiring calibration will usually obtain results with higher errors in regional scale application conversely crop models with fewer parameters are relatively easier to apply at the regional scale with more reasonable results obtained finding the right balance between model complexity and calibration requirements is crucial in achieving accurate and reliable predictions at the regional level therefore the main objectives of our study are 1 to develop a novel two stage dynamic crop model named whcrop which coupling water heat driven processes throughout the crop growth season in arid region based on the principles of existing crop models and taking lower threshold of soil moisture content and irrigation level as the constraints to simulate the daily crop water stress dynamics based on the one dimension soil water balance equation and 2 to evaluate the performance of whcrop and compare its simulations with those generated by traditional field crop growth model dssat and aquacrop model and 3 to apply the whcrop model in simulating the spatial distribution of regional evapotranspiration et crop biomass and yield in heihe river basin hrb located in the northwest region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of whcrop model 2 1 1 principle of development the aquacrop model stands out for its simple and user friendly structure with easily observable parameters for model input in the field considering these advantages referring to the framework of aquacrop model we integrated the yield simulation process of ceres model for cereal crops in dssat system to develop a water heat driven model for estimating the dynamics of crop growth the schematic diagram of this model is shown in fig 1 based on that matlab programming was adopted to writing and reading grouped input spatial environment and management parameters and output files yield biomass and evapotranspiration of whcrop model for the region instead of the input and output for a specific field in that way the whcrop model capable of estimating the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop growth were developed the remarkable features of the whcrop model are summarized as follows 1 comprehensive model mechanism the whcrop model incorporates various crucial environmental factors climate topography soil and field management that significantly influence the crop growth process the crop growth stages were divided by temperature solar radiation and radiation use efficiency rue were used to simulate the crop biomass and yield besides one dimensional water balance equation was adopted in the estimation of crop water consumption 2 dynamic simulation process the dynamic regulation of the crop growth process was achieved through the use of one dimensional water balance equation which calculated the soil water deficit coefficient on daily basis this soil water deficit coefficient was then used to calibrate crop water consumption biomass and yield in real time specifically the impact of soil water deficit coefficient from the previous day was applied to determine the crop growth status for the following day 3 controllable decision making process we introduce the concept of irrigation satisfaction k p which represents the ratio of actual irrigation water to full irrigation allowing us to control irrigation levels this ensures that the field soil water content stays within an acceptable range that minimally affects crop growth by establishing the relationship between k p and key crop growth indicators like the canopy cover we can adjust the general pattern of crop growth 4 suitable for most crops we have divided the crop growth process into two phases namely vegetative growth and reproductive growth which are applicable to most annual crops stage simulation is carried out according to the different canopy growth curves and rue of crops in the two stages 5 high space adaptability we use an empirical model that considers elevation and the length of crop growth period to capture the spatial adaptation process of crop growth to temperature this enables the model to effectively account for variations on growth degree day across different geographical locations 2 1 2 calculations in main module 1 determination of crop growth stages we assume that when the average daily temperature for 5 consecutive days exceeds the minimum temperature threshold t thr lower below this temperature crops grow slowly for crop growth the fifth day is selected as the planting date of the crop theoretical optimum planting date the determination of the start date of the crop growth period is as shown in eq 1 meanwhile we assume that once the maximum temperature threshold t thr upper for crop growth is exceeded crop growth will stop as shown in table 1 1 min t t sart ijx 4 t t sart ijx t th r lower x where t th r lower x is the lower growth temperature threshold for crop x and t t s t a r t i j x and t t sart ijx 4 are temperatures on the starting date of crop growth and fourth day before the starting date respectively referring to the previous studies chenu et al 2009 we determined the relationship between crop growth length and elevation as follows 2 n i j x n base x h i j h b a s e 30 where n ijx is the length of crop grow growth for crop x d n base x is the length of crop growth for crop x at the experiment station that is any reference length of crop growth d h base is the elevation of the experiment station 1580 m h ij is the elevation of point ij m take maize as an example the whole crop growth period is divided into the vegetative stage i and reproductive stage ii as shown in fig 2 stage i and ii mainly regulate the development of crop biomass and yield respectively during the vegetative growth stage photosynthetic products mainly supply the growth of nutritional organs such as roots stems and leaves while in the reproductive growth stage they mainly support the growth of reproductive organs such as flowers fruits and seeds we used accumulated temperature to determine the timing of two growth stage specifically the crop will enter reproductive growth after the effective accumulated temperature from the starting date exceeds the temperature threshold t thr x required for the vegetative growth stage 3 t 1 t d i j x t i j t t t h r i j x 2 simulation of canopy cover the crop canopy cover cc is a crucial crop growth indicator representing the proportion of the surface covered by the vertical projection of the crop canopy lu et al 2021 and directly affects the changes in crop biomass yield and evapotranspiration according to the growth status of most annual crops we used two change curves to fit the changes of cc in two growth stages separately s curve stage ⅰ and quadratic function stage ⅱ the growth of crop canopy at stage ⅰ undergoes a slow growth stage followed by rapid growth and eventually reaches a leaf stabilization stage in stage ii since most of photosynthetic products are preferentially supplied to reproductive organs leaves tend to wilt partially due to water nutrient heat and pest stresses the crop cc at the above two stages can be calculated as follows canopy growth stage i 4 c c t ijx c c max i jx 1 e 8 85 0 17 t ijx canopy decay stage ii 5 c c t ijx k ijx t ijx t d ijx 100 2 c c max i jx where cc max ijx and k ijx are maximum canopy cover and attenuation coefficient of the crop x at ij point both of which are greatly varied with crop species and water deficit status and calibrated through field experiments 3 simulation of crop evapotranspiration as two parts of the et we calculated the soil evaporation and plant transpiration by incorporating reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 cc or leave area index lai and soil water deficit coefficient ks as shown in eqs 6 and 7 specifically et 0 calculated by penman monteith methods allen et al 1998 provides feedbacks of the meteorological effects while ks determined through one dimension water balance equation indicates soil moisture content crop growth status is reflected by lai and cc meanwhile we also considered the area percentage of mulching k m in the calculation of soil evaporation since leaf stomata which do not affect crop transpiration rate vary greatly among different crop types different crop transpiration coefficients kc are applied in this study the specific calculation process is as follows 6 e s t ijx 1 k m x e t 0 ij e ke p x la i t ijx k s t 1 ijx 7 e p t ijx k z x e t 0 ij c c t ijx k s t 1 ijx 8 e t t ijx e s t ijx e p t ijx 9 la i t ijx ln 1 c c t ijx 1 005 5

organs like the root stem and leaf to promote the biomass growth while at stage ii the photosynthetic products would be accumulated in the seeds fruits and other economic products of the crop that is the estimated crop yield equals to the cumulative biomass at stage ii detailed calculations are shown as follows 13 biomas s t ijx ru e x r s t ij 1 e k x la i t ijx 0 01 k s t ijx k p ijx 14 yiel d

performance evaluation we will provide a case study using the above mentioned new whcrop model in order to test its applicability and robustness 2 2 1 description of study area and data as a typical arid region in china heihe river basin hrb holds the second largest inland watershed and serves as a production base of commodity food fig 3 the study area is selected as the middle reaches of the hrb characterized by a flat oasis area containing 95 of the cultivated land and contributing to 80 of gdp in hrb hrb exhibits a typical temperate continental arid climate experiencing extreme dryness that causes it to evaporate nearly all received precipitation the region s average annual precipitation has remained below 150 mm over the past 60 years 1961 2020 while the annual potential evaporation ranges from less than 2000 mm in the east to 4000 mm in the west with the annual sunshine hours of about 3000 4000 h year and the accumulated temperature above 3000 the middle reaches of the hrb have sufficient light and heat resources as well as a large temperature variation between day and night these favorable conditions combined with and the region s fertile soil make the hrb an ideal region location for seed industry development the hrb boasts approximately 24 75 108 m3 of available surface water and 1 75 108 m3 of groundwater resources li et al 2017a li et al 2017b the irrigated area accounts for over 50 of the plain area and about 25 in the mountainous area with agricultural water use comprising over 85 of the total water usage in this region in this study the top three crops of hrb maize wheat and onion were taken as the research objects accounting for more than 85 of the total crop area to evaluate the performance of whcrop model measurement datasets were collected from the maize wheat and onion experiments in shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university the shiyanghe experiment station located approximately 200 km southeast of hrb exhibits climatic conditions characterized by over 3000 h year of annual sunshine hours and annual evaporation exceeding ten times the precipitation besides both regions employ the same irrigation methods and crop varieties 2 2 2 model calibration and validation to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the whcrop model we adopted measurement datasets for model calibration and validation from various experiments conducted at shiyanghe experimental station these included a two year seed maize experimental shi et al 2022 a two year wheat experiment yang et al 2018 and a one year onion experiment zheng et al 2013 conducted during specific years 2015 2016 for maize 2014 2015 for wheat and 2010 for onion in these experiments only different irrigation water amounts were set as experimental treatments for the maize experiment three irrigation treatments were established w1 as the control group with full irrigation initiated when the soil water content dropped to 75 80 of field capacity the θ fc and the irrigation amount being the difference between the soil water content and θ fc w2 and w3 as the experimental groups receiving 2 3 and 1 3 1 2 in 2016 of the full irrigation amount respectively at the same irrigation time as w1 in the wheat experiments three irrigation treatments were set w1 as the control group receiving full irrigation according to local water amounts w2 and w3 receiving 2 3 and 1 2 of full irrigation amount respectively in the onion experiments eight irrigation levels were built t4 as the full irrigation control group irrigation water amount corresponding to the crop water demand t1 t3 at 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 of full irrigation amount respectively at the same time as full irrigation t5 t8 at 0 4 of full irrigation during the seedling stage leaf growing stage bulb expansion period and mature period while the rest of the growth period received the same irrigation as full irrigation the specific irrigation amount and irrigation time can be found in the references we assume that the canopy does not experience nutrient stress throughout its growth period we only fitted the relationships between the irrigation treatment levels k p and the maximum cc cc max and canopy attenuation coefficients k respectively to enhance the applicability of the model 15 c c max i j 1 0 012 k p ij 1 0 93 16 k ij 1 4 73 k p ij 1

represent wheat and onion respectively at point ij that is the ratio of actual crop irrigation amount to full irrigation as the irrigation satisfaction increases the maximum crop cc also increases while the k decreases during the stage ii the whcrop model was calibrated by simultaneously fitting the simulated crop cc et and yield to measured data obtained from three crop experiments specifically the measured datasets from maize in 2015 wheat in 2015 and onion in 2010 under t3 t6 treatments were adopted in the model calibration the measurements of maize in 2016 wheat in 2014 and onion in 2010 under t1 t2 and t7 t8 treatments were used in the model validation besides the whcrop based simulation results were compared to dssat and aquacrop based modeling results in the maize field to further evaluate the model performance the calibrated model parameters describing crop growth and field management for the three crops are summarized in table 1 six widely used indexes including the regression coefficient b0 root mean square error rmse the normalized root means square error nrmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency factor ef the coefficient of determination r2 and willmott s consistency index d were adopted to assess the performance of the model in this study these indexes were calculated as follows ran et al 2020 21 b 0 i 1 n m i s i i 1 n m i 2 22 r 2 i 1

number of simulations s i and m i is the simulated and observed value of the ith model outputs respectively s and m is the averaged value of the simulated and observed model outputs respectively 2 2 3 spatial simulation based on the above calculation process 2 1 2 spatial simulation was realized one by one through matlab platform the length of crop growth period in each grid was determined using eq 2 various spatial datasets including the meteorological data daily mean temperature solar radiation precipitation and reference evapotranspiration elevation soil field capacity irrigation water etc as shown in fig 1 were taken as inputs since irrigation time and irrigation water volume are challenging to observe or count spatially we assumed that all units do not experience soil water deficit in other words we maintained the soil water content above 60 of field capacity the soil wilting coefficient of each unit in this study area was lower than 60 of the field capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance at the field scale good agreements were obtained by the whcrop model in simulating the crop canopy cover cc crop accumulated evapotranspiration aet and yield for three main crops maize wheat and onion in the hrb at the field scale the fitted curves during the crop growth period were shown in figs 4 6 and the corresponding performance matric were given in table 2 to assess the performance of whcrop model we used the popular dssat and aquacrop models to simulate the growth of maize as a reference the fitted curve and performance of the simulated results were shown in fig 7 and table 3 respectively our findings indicated that whcrop has an overall better performance than dssat and aquacrop which are the basis of developing the whcrop model the two stage canopy curve in whcrop model could well fit the canopy changes of the three crops in this study at the field scale especially under no water deficit treatment compared with dssat model and auqacrop model

growth curves embedded in the whcrop model are empirical and depend on calibration data the over fitting of the phenomenon of premature aging cc drops steeply in the late growth period of maize under the severe water deficit verification treatment w3 made the attenuation trend of cc not be significantly improved by increasing the irrigation amount from 1 3 1 2 of full irrigation during model verification process more data on premature aging or more water treatment experiments could help enhance the simulation performance of whcrop model the fig 4 i and l demonstrated that the satisfactory performance whcrop model in both calibration and validation process for cc during the late growth stage of wheat under severe water deficit treatment w3 without severe premature senescence for the simulation of crop accumulated evapotranspiration aet whcrop model performed better than the other two crop models particularly in the case of maize under water deficit conditions compared with other two crop models the difference between the simulation results of whcrop model and the measured values of aet in the late growth period of maize was smaller the simulation performance of whcrop model b

for experimental groups with greater water deficit for example onion under the t1 t3 treatments fig 5 h j experienced continuous water deficit throughout the whole growth period while severe water deficit occurred during the most water sensitive growth period leaf growing stage bulb expansion period under the t5 and t6 treatments fig 5 m n in the future the whcrop model can be improved by introducing crop water sensitivity coefficient to adjust the response of different crops to water stress during various growth periods besides for the simulation of daily evapotranspiration etd the simulation results by whcrop model were most consistent with the measurement value represented by eddy covariance ec fig 8 and table 4 the whcrop model avoided the large error that the other two crop models show in the growth period which is lower than the ec value in the middle growth period and higher than the ec value in the later growth period specifically in calibration the simulated etd from whcrop model demonstrated a closer match to the ec measurements than the other two models since a higher b 0 of 0 85 and other model performance indexes did not show significant difference from one

et and providing valuable information for optimizing irrigation management the good performance of whcrop model was also indicated by the simulation of the crop yield fig 6 in both the calibration and validation the value of b 0 was in the range of 0 95 1 03 while the values of d ranged from 0 72 to 0 99 these results indicated that the simulated values closely matched the measured values demonstrating good consistency besides the nrmse values were below 20 for all three crops the r 2 were all above 0 67 in both calibration and validation except for a relatively low r 2 of 0 32 and 0 16 in calibration and validation for wheat and a low r 2 of 0 54 in validation for onion similarly high ef values above 0 67 were calculated for maize while negative ef values were calculated for wheat and onion in both calibration and validation the negative ef values could be induced by the limited availability of yield measurement datasets in the calibration and validation for wheat and onion and measurement errors existing in one or two values could greatly reduce the r 2 and ef the simulation results comparing the three crop models for maize yield were shown in fig 9 for yield the whcrop model had a better performance for all good of fit indexes in calibration b 0 1 03 r 2 0 90 rmse 0 41 t ha nrmse 6 55 ef 0 86 d 0 97 and in validation r 2 0 67 b 0 0 98 rmse 0 62 t ha nrmse 9 55 ef 0 63 d 0 90 compared to the dssat pm and aquacrop models overall whcrop demonstrated superior performance compared to other widely used crop models in simulating crop growth and water consumption processes 3 2 whcrop based simulation at regional scale 3 2 1 the spatial distributions of whcrop results the spatial distribution of four model outputs including the length of crop growth period et biomass and yield were presented in fig 10 for maize wheat and onion under full irrigation condition respectively fig 10 a shown that the length of growth season for maize ranged from 142 to 180 d at the regional scale longer length of growth season for maize were observed in the southern gaotai county and southern ganzhou district which had higher elevations due to the slight differences in elevation the remaining areas exhibited little variations in the length of the growth season at the regional scale the spatial scale et biomass and yield of maize ranged from 371 28 to 621 06 mm from 24 00 to 31 33 t ha and from 7 19 to 9 75 t ha respectively affected by the simulation principle of whcrop model the spatial distribution patterns of maize et biomass and yield were no longer consistent with any single environmental variable this inconsistency was particularly evident in the spatial distribution of maize yields the spatial distribution of maize et and biomass exhibited higher value in the south and lower value in the north the minimum values of maize yield and biomass were located at the junction of linze and gaotai counties determined by the growth season the maximum values of yield were located at the junction of ganzhou and linze counties as well as in the southern plain area of ganzhou district and the maximum values of biomass were found in the southern ganzhou district and the southern gaotai county the maximum values of maize et were located in the southern plain area of ganzhou district and eastern gaotai county while the lowest values were found in the whole northeastern gaotai county for wheat the spatial distribution of whcrop outputs was reproduced in fig 10 b the length of growth season varied from 109 to 147d at the regional scale this variation was characterized by high values in south area with high elevation and low values in the northern and central plains which aligns with the spatial outputs of maize above this is due to the length of growth season was primarily by elevation the regional et biomass and yield of wheat were in the range of 289 69 589 54 mm 14 81 25 87 t ha and 6 51 9 26 t ha respectively additionally under the influence of the elevation and the length of crop growth season all of these variables presented high values in the south and low values in the north similar spatial distribution patterns were also detected in whcrop based outputs for onion fig 10 c specifically the growth season length for onion were in a range of 108 146 d and the regional et biomass and yield of onion varied in the range of 276 14 509 20 mm 83 80 106 97 t ha and 42 16 60 63 t ha respectively the simulated et for wheat was slightly higher than that of onion and much lower than that of maize in this study 3 2 2 the comparison of spatial outputs from whcrop and pdssat and aquacrop gis to better demonstrate the capabilities of whcrop model in simulating at the regional scale we selected regional et and yield of maize as the representative outputs and compared them to the simulation results obtained from pdssat and aquacrop gis fig 10 d and e the spatial simulation results of the energy driven dssat python model were usually more responsive to climatic factors temperature and topographic factors elevation and latitude and less responsive to soil parameters while the spatial simulation results of the water driven aquacrop gis model were more responsive to spatial variation of soil parameters and less responsive to topographic and climatic factors ran et al 2020 it is clear that the spatial distribution of length of growth season from whcrop was consistent with that in pdssat compared to pdssat 123 192 d and aquacrop gis 135 205 d whcrop simulated a shorter length of growth season within a range of 142 180 d the reason for this discrepancy was the different factors determining the length of growth season temperature and topography elevation were combined in the empirical equation in whcrop while a fixed temperature setup was the only factor in determining the length of growth season in other two crop models the biomass values simulated by whcrop were 21 97 lower than those from the dssat python model and nearly 13 81 higher than those from the aquacrop gis model besides the simulated length of growth season varied significantly among the three crop models due to the influence of elevation in this study area whcrop model exhibited fewer fluctuations in the length of growth season simulation consequently the whcrop model was less affected by the low temperatures in the southern area and the spatial variability coefficient of variation cv in table 4 of yield and biomass simulated by whcrop was much lower compared to the other two gridded crop models overall there was no significant difference in the spatial variability of maize yield simulated among these three crop models regarding the spatial distribution of maize et the average value of regional maize et based on the whcrop model was only 2 94 lower than that from the pdssat model and 7 21 higher than that from aquacrop gis in table 4 the whcrop based cv representing the spatial variability of et was higher than that of the other two crop models this indicated that the whcrop model shown a better response in simulating et to the environment factors compared to the other two crop models in the whcrop model et simulations were mainly affected by reference evapotranspiration crop canopy length of crop growth season and soil water deficit etc emphasizing the interactive coordination of et and environmental factors for the spatial distribution of yield whcrop provided comparable mapping results to dssat python with most values being nearly 50 higher than those of the aquacrop gis model overall whcrop could simulate at the regional scale and yield similar outputs to pdssat and aquacrop gis while a more significant response in spatial variability to various environmental factors compared to the other two crop models at the regional scale 4 conclusion the whcrop model a novel water heat driven model was developed to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop growth it integrated the principles of crop yield simulation based on radiation and temperature from the dssat model as well as soil moisture and et simulation based on the one dimensional soil water balance in the aquacrop model based on that the model was calibrated and validated for three main crops maize wheat and onion in hrb with results indicating good performance in this typical study area to further test the model performance whcrop based simulation results were compared with other two site based crop models dssat and aquacrop during both calibration and validation phases whcrop model demonstrated an overall superior performance compared to the other two crop models due to its inclusion of the dynamic effect of water stress soil water deficit on crop growth et and yield in addition the spatial distribution of whcrop outputs length of growth season et biomass and yield matched well with the results from gridded crop model pdssat and aquacrop gis at the regional scale by considering the dynamic response processes of crop growth to stress factors whcrop minimized the likelihood of significantly biased outputs resulting from a single environmental change the spatial variability of et simulated by whcrop was higher than what of pdssat and aquacrop gis besides whcrop was capable of simulating the crop growth adaptive process to temperature change with lower spatial variability of yield and biomass compared to pdssat and the aquacrop gis compared to pdssat and aquacrop gis the whcrop model requires fewer adjusted parameters and input datasets which are readily available from observation sites or regional datasets such as meteorological data soil water field capacity and irrigation water depth etc as it was programmed in matlab mathworks inc 2011 the whcrop model can be easily run on various operating systems and seamlessly coupled with other optimization models embedded with complex algorithms in the near future extended work on calibrating and validating the whcrop performance at the regional scale using regional monitoring datasets could be a great improvement over the current version of the whcrop model in addition incorporating the effects of soil nutrient stress and fertilizer management into the whcrop model can provide valuable insights to regional decision makers enabling them to optimize the fertilization regime and mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus pollution finally the whcrop model could be used to upgrade toolbox of key irrigation decision makers and improve the knowledge of best water management practices to enhance water productivity and yield the simplicity of the whcrop model with respect to its required fewer and readily available input data also makes it user friendly thus it can greatly benefit

8846,measurements of evaporation from pans have traditionally been used to represent the evaporative demand of the atmosphere when estimating the crop water requirements in china pan evaporation e pan has been observed routinely at meteorological stations since the 1950 s with d20 pans but since 2002 the pans have been replaced by e 601b to explore the effective reconstruction of missing daily d20 e pan over china from 1951 to 2020 this study employed three types of e pan models the widely used physical model penpan two popular machine learning ml models multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and random forest rf and multiple linear regression mlr daily e pan data were predicted based on the daily wind speed u atmospheric pressure ap relative humidity rh air temperature ta and sunshine hours n of 2410 meteorological stations the results showed that the mars and rf predictions were superior to those of penpan and the results of mlr were the worst the average determination coefficient for rf mars penpan and mlr values were 0 95 0 91 0 88 and 0 86 respectively and the average root mean square difference were 0 62 0 91 1 17 and 1 15 mm day 1 respectively thus the missing daily e pan were predicted using rf and the reconstructed e pan had the same probability density function as the observed e pan the annual e pan first showed a downward trend at a rate of 6 17 mm yr 1 from 1961 to 1993 and then a reverse upward trend at a rate of 1 84 mm yr 1 from 1994 to 2020 e pan predictions by penpan are limited by regional characteristics making it difficult to transfer between regions however ml methods are less affected by regional characteristics and can be used across regions furthermore ml methods can effectively reconstruct missing e pan providing support for verification of penpan which is beneficial for the study of driving factors of e pan keywords d20 pan evaporation random forest penpan model daily scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pan evaporation e pan is an observation of atmospheric evaporative demand that has been employed as a practical tool for estimating crop water requirements land evaporation and hydrological cycles stephens et al 2018 e pan is a simple measurement of complex meteorological interactions that integrates radiation temperature humidity and wind speed into a single measure of evaporative demand and is an important indicator of global warming milly and dunne 2020 wei et al 2018 drought markonis et al 2021 milly and dunne 2016 and hydrological cycles brutsaert and parlange 1998 ohmura and wild 2002 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 a decrease in e pan has been reported worldwide despite increasing air temperature ta owing to reductions in wind speed u and solar radiation mcvicar et al 2012 roderick and farquhar 2002 however many previously reported decreasing e pan trends have plateaued or reversed which is associated with an increase in global radiation and vapor pressure deficit li et al 2013 mozny et al 2020 e pan that is the evaporation rate of water from a dish located at the ground surface and refilled daily has been routinely observed at meteorological stations since the 1950 s wang and dickinson 2012 owing to their simplicity low cost and wide variety of applications stanhill 2002 wang et al 2021 observation networks have been established globally for decades brutsaert 1982 lim et al 2016 lim et al 2013 peterson et al 1995 roderick et al 2009 wang et al 2019 the d20 pans diameter 20 cm and e 601b pans diameter 61 8 cm area 3000 cm2 are the most commonly used pans in china and can be converted with class a pans fu et al 2004 the e pan of d20 is related to e pan of e601 by an empirically derived pan coefficient which is the most direct method for reconstructing the evaporation data however there were few stations observed e pan of e601 and d20 simultaneously in china from the 1950 s to 2001 the d20 pans were mainly used for evaporation observations at china s basic national meteorological stations since 2002 the d20 pans have been replaced by e 601b pans at most stations what s more when evaporation is small or water freezes in winter the e 601b pans cannot be used for observation therefore d20 pans are still used for observation from october to march of the following year at some stations especially those in the northern regions because of the two types of evaporation pans used for observation the time series of the d20 e pan is long but lacks continuous observations in recent years and the time series of the e 601b e pan is short and incomplete in winter therefore it is necessary to explore an effective reconstruction method of the missing e pan to supplement e pan over china in recent years modeling evaporation is a complex process due to the many factors that can influence its rate these factors include but are not limited to temperature solar radiation surface area of the water exposed to the air humidity of the air air pressure wind speed and presence of other substances in the air it is imperative to consider all these factors when modeling water evaporation modeling evaporation has always been a challenging atmospheric evaporative demand can be estimated using physical models such as the penman monteith recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 priestley taylor kingston et al 2009 priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves samani thompson et al 2014 furthermore e pan differs from open water evaporation because the wall of the pan intercepts additional radiation and enhances the heat exchange linacre 1994 therefore a generic physical model based on mass and energy balances called penpan was developed for the reconstruction of monthly e pan roderick et al 2007 rotstayn et al 2006 the penpan model is based on penman s combination equation penman 1948 modified for class a evaporation pan rotstayn et al 2006 and incorporates aerodynamic and radiative components based on thom et al 1981 and linacre 1994 respectively stephens et al 2018 the model has been widely used worldwide and has been effectively modified for the d20 evaporation pan in china feng et al 2018 li et al 2013 liu and sun 2016 wang et al 2018b we calibrated the wind function for the d20 pan wang et al 2018b to improve the evaporation simulation accuracy of the penpan model in china we employed empirical function to estimate the daily and monthly diffuse radiation from measurements of global solar radiation wang et al 2018a however because the model contains many empirical coefficients and parameters many researchers have committed to creating empirical coefficients including physical mechanisms or regional parameter corrections for example lim et al 2016 derived the penpan v2 model for the us class a pan and wang et al 2019 derived the penpan v3 model for the d20 pan owing to computational resources and advancements in machine learning ml methods as well as the ever increasing availability of diverse datasets ml methods have been extended from the fields of planetary science and bioinformatics to a wide range of water resources and environmental modeling studies eshete 2021 mjolsness and decoste 2001 schmidt et al 2020 the prediction of e pan is a complicated and highly non linear regression process that depends on a high input of meteorological variables whereas ml algorithms require no knowledge of internal variables can overcome data heterogeneity and offer simple solutions for nonlinear multivariable functions brown et al 2020 oh et al 2016 pun et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 therefore as a type of robust nonparametric model ml methods such as random forest rf lu et al 2018 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars ghaemi et al 2019 artificial neural networks ann goyal et al 2014 keskin et al 2009 kim et al 2012 support vector machines svm kisi 2015 relevance vector machine tuned with improved manta ray foraging optimization rvm imrfo adnan et al 2023b

regression trained with the simulated annealing integrating with the mayfly optimization algorithm svr samoa adnan et al 2022 and extended marine predators algorithm based artificial neural networks ann empa ikram et al 2022 have been extensively applied to reconstruct e pan fahimi et al 2017 yu et al 2021 runoff or streamflow for example ghaemi et al 2019 used mars and m5 model trees to predict monthly e pan from turkey s meteorological stations lu et al 2018 used three tree based ml models to estimate the daily e pan from local and cross station data of poyang lake in china compared to physical and traditional statistical models ml models are recognized as having superior predictive performance universal adaptability and flexible combinations of input variables elshorbagy et al 2010 lima et al 2015 schmidt et al 2020 despite advances of ml methods in data reconstruction a great challenge for ml method is its poor interpretability or black box phenomenon coyle and weller 2020 yu et al 2021 the primary goal of this research is to utilize ml methods mars and rf penpan model and multiple linear regression mlr to reconstruct missing daily e pan data in china based on long term accessible meteorological factors in section 2 we described the study s data and methods section 3 compared the results of e pan simulated using the four methods and attempts to reconstruct the daily e pan followed by the discussions and conclusions a flowchart of the work for reconstruction of the e pan is shown in fig 1 2 material and methods 2 1 the meteorological data fig 2 a shows the spatial locations of the meteorological stations daily surface data for 1951 2020 were obtained from 2410 meteorological stations at the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn the stations are national level surface observation stations in china placed under the same standard conditions for example the beijing and nanjing station shown in fig s1 and s2 in supplemental material the meteorological data used in this study included atmospheric pressure ap relative humidity rh sunshine hours n ta measured 2 m above ground level u measured 10 m above ground level and e pan the e pan is observed using a d20 pan with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 10 cm fig 2 b all data were strictly quality controlled availability of all elements exceeds 99 and the percentage of correct data approaches 100 owing to the influence of landforms and meteorological conditions the e pan varies greatly in time and space resulting in strong regional applicability of the e pan simulation model which may not be extended to the whole country therefore based on climatic conditions we selected four climatic zones in china fig 2 a to analyze temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz and subtropical monsoon zone smz fan et al 2016 yang et al 2021 2 2 the pan evaporation prediction models in this study we investigated three types of e pan model the penpan model ml models mars and rf and mlr model the penpan model is based on fundamental physical principles which makes it able to provide a more accurate representation of the physical processes that drive evaporation the ml models are particularly useful when there is a large amount of data available as the algorithms can learn from the data and identify patterns that may not be obvious to the human eye mlr model is a statistical technique which is relatively simple and useful when there is a limited amount of data available as it can be used to identify linear relationships between variables and make predictions based on those relationships five meteorological factors u ap rh ta and n were selected as predictor variables according to the input of penpan model preprocessing of input data can significantly reduce the risk of improper training and normalizing data can also help mitigate the risk of overfitting as it can help ensure that the model is not overly sensitive to small changes in the input data das et al 2018 it is a technique often used to transform data into a range between 0 and 1 this is done by subtracting the minimum value from the data and then dividing by the range x n x i x min x max x min all models except for the penpan model underwent input normalization as part of our study to reduce overfitting the k fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of ml and mlr algorithms fan et al 2018 wong and yeh 2020 the k fold cross validation is a resampling method that involves randomly dividing the training data into k folds of approximately equal size building the model on k 1 folds and using the remaining fold to compute model performance this process is repeated k times resulting in k estimates of the generalization error the k fold cross validation estimate is computed by averaging the k test errors providing an approximation of the error expected on unseen data the most common choices of k are 5 and 10 liu et al 2022b zhang and liu 2023 and k was set as 5 in this study 2 2 1 the penpan model the penpan model is a modified version of the penman penman 1948 for determining potential evapotranspiration it incorporates aerodynamic and radiative components based on thom et al 1981 and linacre 1994 modified for class a evaporation pan roderick et al 2007 rotstayn et al 2006 respectively the penpan model has a physical mechanism and its driving factors are meteorological data with long term measurements this model has been widely used and obtained excellent agreement between the measured and predicted monthly e pan it has also been effectively modified for the d20 evaporation pan in china li et al 2013 liu and sun 2016 sun et al 2018 and its application to the

dimensionality and is a nonparametric regression procedure proposed by professor friedman 1991 it uses a combination of linear and non linear terms to fit a model to the data it does not require assumptions about the form of the relationship between the predicted variable and predictor variables and uses two sided truncated functions as basis functions to fit separate splines and distinct intervals of the predictor variables prasad et al 2006 the general mars model equation put et al 2004 is given as 9 f ˆ x a 0 m 1 m a m b m x where f ˆ x is the predicted e pan x is the predictor variable u ap rh ta or n a 0 is the constant of the basis function b m x is the mth basis function a m is the coefficient of the mth basis function and m is the number of basis functions implementing mars involves a two step procedure that is applied successively until a desired model is found firstly we build the model i e increase its complexity by adding basis functions until a preset maximum level of complexity has been reached then we begin a backward procedure to remove the least significant basis functions from the model according the generalized cross validation gcv i e those whose removal will lead to the least reduction in the least squares goodness of fit liu et al 2022a marcoulides 2004 ramsay 2003 10 gcv mse 1 cm m 2 where mse and cm are the mean squared error and penalty factor of the evaluated model respectively 2 2 3 random forest rf the rf model developed by professor breiman of statistics 2001 is a robust nonparametric model designed to produce accurate predictions due to the law of large numbers rf model trained on large datasets are less likely to overfit provided that they are properly regularized by injecting appropriate kinds of randomness into the training process these models can achieve high levels of accuracy as both classifiers and regressors rf is a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest breiman 2001 williams et al 2020 firstly the original data sets is spited into k subsets using bootstrap sampling θ1 θi θk for the ith tree a random vector θi is generated independent of other random vectors but with the same distribution then a tree is grown using the subset and θi resulting in a precipitation or classifier h x θi where x is an input vector finally after a large number of trees and precipitations are generated the average method to merge the predicted values of all trees to obtain a more accurate prediction is f ˆ x 1 k i 1 k h x θ i fig 3 carvalho et al 2019 strobl et al 2007 and has become a major data analysis tool for performing well in comparison with many standard methods diaz uriarte and de andres 2006 heidema et al 2006 strobl et al 2007 2 2 4 multiple linear regression mlr mlr is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a predicted

a is the intercept and t is the year when b 0 e pan increases with time and when b 0 e pan decreases with time the pearson correlation coefficient r eq 17 and its statistical significance from the t test were used to judge whether the increasing or decreasing trend of annual e pan was statistically significant or not the significance level is 0 05 the r was calculated as 17 r 1 n x x y y 1 n x x 2 1 n y y 2 where y is the arithmetic mean of y traditional statistical analyses and ml algorithms were performed using spss matlab and the r programming language sigmaplot and arcgis were used to perform geostatistical analyses and produce figures 3 results 3 1 validation of the daily pan evaporation simulation over china the daily e pan values of all the meteorological stations were predicted using the penpan mars rf and mlr methods fig 4 and table s1 shows the r 2 and rmsd values between the observed and predicted daily e pan at each station the average r 2 penpan r 2 rf r 2 mars and r 2 mlr values were 0 88 0 95 0 91 and 0 86 respectively the average rmsd penpan rmsd rf rmsd mars and rmsd mlr values were 1 17 0 62 0 91 and 1 15 mm day 1 respectively overall e pan simulated using the ml methods rf and mars had the highest accuracy followed by the penpan and mlr models the rf model had the highest r 2 and lowest rmsd values between the simulated and observed e pan from the spatial distributions of r 2 and rmsd fig 4 it can be observed that the simulation performance of e pan in different zones was different for example the r 2 values between observed and simulated e pan by the penpan model are higher in northern china than in southern china with most stations showing values greater than 0 85 fig 4 a however fig 4 e shows large spatial difference in rmsd with 69 73 of stations exhibiting rmsd values greater than 1 mm d 1 therefore the simulation performances of the four models in different zones of china were analyzed fig 5 provides a concise statistical summary of the simulation performance for the daily e pan in the tcz tmz mpz and smz taylor diagrams show σ r and rmsd with observations of the total spatial and temporal variability for the daily e pan in the penpan mlr mars and rf simulations the position of each circle in the plot quantifies how closely the simulated e pan of the model matches observations it can be seen that the r values of the four zones are different they are all very high between 0 90 and 0 99 the centered rmsd between the simulated and observed e pan is proportional to the distance to the point on the x axis identified as observed the rmsd values of the four zones are significantly different among which the average values of the four methods are 1 19 1 02 0 86 and 0 90 mm day 1 in tcz tmz mpz and smz respectively although the simulation accuracies of the four methods were different the e pan predicted by rf red dot was closest to the observed e pan in each zone the r values of rf in the four zones are between 0 97 and 0 99 and the rmsd values are between 0 52 and 0 73 mm day 1 it can be seen that the rf method has the highest accuracy in modelling the daily e pan based on the stations with e pan observations of no less than 50 years among all stations we randomly selected two stations in each of the four zones fig 6 i fig 6 a and b are located in the tcz c and d are located in the tmz e and f are located in the mpz and fig 6 g and h are located in the smz fig 6 a h shows the scatter density map of the observed e pan versus the predicted e pan using the rf method at the eight selected stations as can be seen most of the data are concentrated around the 1 1 line the values of the r 2 are between 0 93 and 0 98 and the rmsd are not higher than 0 69 this indicates that the performance of the estimation of e pan using the rf method is not affected by the climatic conditions in different regions 3 2 validation of the monthly pan evaporation simulation over china the simulation accuracy of monthly e pan was further verified based on daily e pan fig 7 shows a boxplot of the r 2 and rmsd between the observed and predicted monthly e pan for all stations the average r 2 penpan r 2 rf r 2 mars and r 2 mlr values are 0 94 0 98 0 95 and 0 92 respectively the ml methods rf and mars exhibited higher average and median r 2 than the physical model penpan which had higher r 2 values than the linear regression method mlr in particular the rf method exhibited the highest r 2 value with a more concentrated distribution interval and the 25th 75th percentile range the average rmsd penpan rmsd rf rmsd mars and rmsd mlr were 20 90 9 06 14 56 and 20 15 mm month 1 respectively fig 7 b and table s2 the average and median rmsd of the ml methods rf and mars were the smallest followed by the penpan and mlr methods in the tcz tmz and mpz rmsd penpan was the largest in smz the e pan predicted by rf with the highest r 2 and lowest rmsd in each zone and was found to be most accuracy in estimating monthly e pan 3 3 the pan evaporation reconstruction and its spatiotemporal pattern in recent 60 years based on the daily and monthly validations it can be seen that e pan predicted by the rf method has the highest accuracy compared with the other three methods therefore based on the daily meteorological data u ap rh ta and n the missing daily e pan were predicted using the rf method the predicted e pan were added to the observation series to reconstruct the time series of daily e pan over china a probability density function pdf was used to analyze whether the distribution of the reconstructed data was consistent with that of the original observational data fig s3 shows the pdf of the reconstructed and observed e pan in tcz tmz mpz and smz it can be seen that the reconstructed e pan has the same pdf as the observed e pan which show that the reconstructed e pan are reliable the daily e pan of 2410 meteorological stations were reconstructed of which 969 meteorological stations had a continuous daily e pan for the last 60 years 1961 2020 fig 8 fig 8 a shows the linear trend of annual e pan from 1961 to 2020 at 969 stations the blue dots represent the stations where the e pan decreased significantly 0 05 level in the last 60 years accounting for 42 00 of the total stations the gray dots represent the stations without significant change in statistics accounting for 43 45 and the red dots represent the stations with a significant increase accounting for 14 55 the annual average e pan in china changed from downward to upward around 1993 li et al 2013 wang et al 2018b and the period from 1961 to 2020 could be divided into 1961 1993 and 1994 2020 fig 8 b shows the linear trend of annual e pan at each station from 1961 to 1993 most stations approximately 61 09 showed a significant decreasing trend 0 05 level a few stations 33 64 showed no significant change trend and only 5 26 of stations showed an increasing trend fig 8 c shows the linear trend of annual e pan from 1994 to 2020 it can be seen that the number of stations with significant decrease accounted for only 13 11 the number of stations showing significantly increase comprised 61 52 the remaining 25 08 stations exhibited non statistically significant changes therefore most stations showed significant linear decreasing trends during the first period 1961 1993 followed by an increasing or non statistically significant trend in the second period 1994 2020 this led to a slowing down of the overall trend over the last 60 years the annual average e pan of the 969 stations fig 9 a decreased significantly 0 01 level from 1961 to 2020 with a reduction rate of 1 61 mm yr 1 from 1961 1993 the annual e pan decreased significantly 0 01 level with a reduction rate of 6 17 mm yr 1 fig 9 b from 1994 2020 the annual e pan showed a significant increasing trend with an increase rate of 1 84 mm yr 1 fig 9 c shows the linear trend of the average annual e pan from 1961 to 2020 in the four zones the annual e pan showed significant decreases 0 05 level in the four zones with the fastest reduction rate of 2 60 mm yr 1 in tmz and the slowest reduction rate of 0 92 mm yr 1 in smz during 1961 1993 fig 9 d the reduction rates of the annual e pan ranged from 4 87 to 7 76 mm yr 1 in the four zones from 1994 2020 the annual e pan of smz increased significantly and there was no statistically significant change in tcz tmz and mpz the annual e pan first showed a downward trend followed by a reverse upward trend which is consistent with changes in wind speed vapor pressure deficit and radiation mozny et al 2020 roderick et al 2007 sun et al 2018 4 discussions and conclusions three types of e pan models including the physical model penpan two popular machine learning ml models mars and rf and statistical model mlr were used to predict d20 e pan the ml models had the best prediction effects especially rf ml is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed the ml models such as rf lu et al 2018 mars ghaemi et al 2019 have been extensively applied to reconstruct e pan fahimi et al 2017 malik et al 2022 yu et al 2021 because they require no knowledge of internal variables can overcome data heterogeneity and offer simple solutions for nonlinear multivariable functions brown et al 2020 oh et al 2016 pun et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the rf model had the highest r 2 0 95 0 029 0 98 0 019 and lowest rmsd 0 62 0 17 mm day 1 9 06 3 45 mm month 1 values between the predicted and observed daily monthly e pan these results were close to the results of e pan prediction using rf in other cases such as for iraq with r 2 and rmse root mean square error of 0 99 19 88 mm month 1 respectively al mukhtar 2021 poyang lake with r 2 and rmse of 0 96 0 35 mm day 1 respectively lu et al 2018 which were better than prediction by penpan with r 2 and rmse of 0 92 26 03 mm month 1 over china wang et al 2018b and r 2 and rmse of 0 94 31 mm month 1 in xinjiang li et al 2013 therefore the missing daily e pan values were predicted using the rf method based on the daily meteorological data u ap rh ta and n the annual average e pan showed a significant decrease from 1961 to 2020 at a rate of 1 61 mm yr 1 with a significant reduction at a rate of 6 17 mm yr 1 from 1961 to 1993 and a significant increase at a rate of 1 84 mm yr 1 from 1994 to 2020 at the same time other ml models also have good potential in predicting daily or monthly e pan such as novel hybrid support vector regression optimized by salp swarm algorithm in conjunction with gamma test malik et al 2021 multiple model artificial neural network and multi gene genetic programming mggp malik et al 2020 relevance vector machine tuned with improved manta ray foraging optimization rvm imrfo adnan et al 2023b although the ml method has significant advantages in data reconstruction it is important to be aware of their limitations and carefully consider how to apply them in practice such as its poor interpretability or black box phenomenon coyle and weller 2020 yu et al 2021 while understanding the overall change in evaporation is important it is equally crucial to identify the underlying factors driving this change this can help in understanding the underlying mechanisms governing evaporation and how they may be influenced by various environmental factors at the same time ml models can be overly complex and fit the training data too closely leading to poor performance on new or unseen data to mitigate this risk it is crucial to select appropriate ml models and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics one way to assess model performance is through cross validation techniques which help to estimate the model s generalization error by splitting the available data into training and validation sets cross validation helps to avoid overfitting by testing the model s performance on unseen data and identifying any potential issues with model complexity or parameter tuning fan et al 2018 wong and yeh 2020 the penpan model is based on fundamental physical principles which makes it able to provide a more accurate representation of the physical processes that drive evaporation the simulations of e pan using the penpan model were not poor particularly in northern china owing to the influence of landforms and meteorological conditions the e pan varies greatly in time and space resulting in strong regional applicability of the e pan physical simulation model which may not be extended to the whole country therefore we used the four climatic zones for analysis and comparison although the simulation accuracies were different in the four zones the ml methods especially rf not only improved r 2 but also reduced the deviation of the e pan simulations these indicate that the penpan model is limited by regional climatic and hydrological characteristics which make it difficult to transfer between regions while the machine learning method is less affected by regional characteristics and can be used among regions based on the reconstruction of the daily e pan some empirical formulas such as the wind speed function and parameters of the penpan model can be calibrated and verified more accurately lim et al 2016 wang et al 2019 for different climatic zones which may improve the simulation accuracy of the penpan model in addition the annual e pan has stopped falling or reversing in recent years in many regions worldwide leading to difficulties in constructing physical models therefore the combination of physical and ml models is a potential method for studying the attribution of e pan change physical models provide a strong scientific foundation by capturing the fundamental processes underlying environmental systems behavior but they may be limited by simplifying assumptions or uncertainties in model parameters on the other hand ml models can capture complex non linear relationships between meteorological factors and e pan and learn patterns from data to make predictions integrating physical and ml models has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of e pan and predict their responses to changing conditions more accurately declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8846,measurements of evaporation from pans have traditionally been used to represent the evaporative demand of the atmosphere when estimating the crop water requirements in china pan evaporation e pan has been observed routinely at meteorological stations since the 1950 s with d20 pans but since 2002 the pans have been replaced by e 601b to explore the effective reconstruction of missing daily d20 e pan over china from 1951 to 2020 this study employed three types of e pan models the widely used physical model penpan two popular machine learning ml models multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and random forest rf and multiple linear regression mlr daily e pan data were predicted based on the daily wind speed u atmospheric pressure ap relative humidity rh air temperature ta and sunshine hours n of 2410 meteorological stations the results showed that the mars and rf predictions were superior to those of penpan and the results of mlr were the worst the average determination coefficient for rf mars penpan and mlr values were 0 95 0 91 0 88 and 0 86 respectively and the average root mean square difference were 0 62 0 91 1 17 and 1 15 mm day 1 respectively thus the missing daily e pan were predicted using rf and the reconstructed e pan had the same probability density function as the observed e pan the annual e pan first showed a downward trend at a rate of 6 17 mm yr 1 from 1961 to 1993 and then a reverse upward trend at a rate of 1 84 mm yr 1 from 1994 to 2020 e pan predictions by penpan are limited by regional characteristics making it difficult to transfer between regions however ml methods are less affected by regional characteristics and can be used across regions furthermore ml methods can effectively reconstruct missing e pan providing support for verification of penpan which is beneficial for the study of driving factors of e pan keywords d20 pan evaporation random forest penpan model daily scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pan evaporation e pan is an observation of atmospheric evaporative demand that has been employed as a practical tool for estimating crop water requirements land evaporation and hydrological cycles stephens et al 2018 e pan is a simple measurement of complex meteorological interactions that integrates radiation temperature humidity and wind speed into a single measure of evaporative demand and is an important indicator of global warming milly and dunne 2020 wei et al 2018 drought markonis et al 2021 milly and dunne 2016 and hydrological cycles brutsaert and parlange 1998 ohmura and wild 2002 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 a decrease in e pan has been reported worldwide despite increasing air temperature ta owing to reductions in wind speed u and solar radiation mcvicar et al 2012 roderick and farquhar 2002 however many previously reported decreasing e pan trends have plateaued or reversed which is associated with an increase in global radiation and vapor pressure deficit li et al 2013 mozny et al 2020 e pan that is the evaporation rate of water from a dish located at the ground surface and refilled daily has been routinely observed at meteorological stations since the 1950 s wang and dickinson 2012 owing to their simplicity low cost and wide variety of applications stanhill 2002 wang et al 2021 observation networks have been established globally for decades brutsaert 1982 lim et al 2016 lim et al 2013 peterson et al 1995 roderick et al 2009 wang et al 2019 the d20 pans diameter 20 cm and e 601b pans diameter 61 8 cm area 3000 cm2 are the most commonly used pans in china and can be converted with class a pans fu et al 2004 the e pan of d20 is related to e pan of e601 by an empirically derived pan coefficient which is the most direct method for reconstructing the evaporation data however there were few stations observed e pan of e601 and d20 simultaneously in china from the 1950 s to 2001 the d20 pans were mainly used for evaporation observations at china s basic national meteorological stations since 2002 the d20 pans have been replaced by e 601b pans at most stations what s more when evaporation is small or water freezes in winter the e 601b pans cannot be used for observation therefore d20 pans are still used for observation from october to march of the following year at some stations especially those in the northern regions because of the two types of evaporation pans used for observation the time series of the d20 e pan is long but lacks continuous observations in recent years and the time series of the e 601b e pan is short and incomplete in winter therefore it is necessary to explore an effective reconstruction method of the missing e pan to supplement e pan over china in recent years modeling evaporation is a complex process due to the many factors that can influence its rate these factors include but are not limited to temperature solar radiation surface area of the water exposed to the air humidity of the air air pressure wind speed and presence of other substances in the air it is imperative to consider all these factors when modeling water evaporation modeling evaporation has always been a challenging atmospheric evaporative demand can be estimated using physical models such as the penman monteith recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 priestley taylor kingston et al 2009 priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves samani thompson et al 2014 furthermore e pan differs from open water evaporation because the wall of the pan intercepts additional radiation and enhances the heat exchange linacre 1994 therefore a generic physical model based on mass and energy balances called penpan was developed for the reconstruction of monthly e pan roderick et al 2007 rotstayn et al 2006 the penpan model is based on penman s combination equation penman 1948 modified for class a evaporation pan rotstayn et al 2006 and incorporates aerodynamic and radiative components based on thom et al 1981 and linacre 1994 respectively stephens et al 2018 the model has been widely used worldwide and has been effectively modified for the d20 evaporation pan in china feng et al 2018 li et al 2013 liu and sun 2016 wang et al 2018b we calibrated the wind function for the d20 pan wang et al 2018b to improve the evaporation simulation accuracy of the penpan model in china we employed empirical function to estimate the daily and monthly diffuse radiation from measurements of global solar radiation wang et al 2018a however because the model contains many empirical coefficients and parameters many researchers have committed to creating empirical coefficients including physical mechanisms or regional parameter corrections for example lim et al 2016 derived the penpan v2 model for the us class a pan and wang et al 2019 derived the penpan v3 model for the d20 pan owing to computational resources and advancements in machine learning ml methods as well as the ever increasing availability of diverse datasets ml methods have been extended from the fields of planetary science and bioinformatics to a wide range of water resources and environmental modeling studies eshete 2021 mjolsness and decoste 2001 schmidt et al 2020 the prediction of e pan is a complicated and highly non linear regression process that depends on a high input of meteorological variables whereas ml algorithms require no knowledge of internal variables can overcome data heterogeneity and offer simple solutions for nonlinear multivariable functions brown et al 2020 oh et al 2016 pun et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 therefore as a type of robust nonparametric model ml methods such as random forest rf lu et al 2018 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars ghaemi et al 2019 artificial neural networks ann goyal et al 2014 keskin et al 2009 kim et al 2012 support vector machines svm kisi 2015 relevance vector machine tuned with improved manta ray foraging optimization rvm imrfo adnan et al 2023b

ann empa ikram et al 2022 have been extensively applied to reconstruct e pan fahimi et al 2017 yu et al 2021 runoff or streamflow for example ghaemi et al 2019 used mars and m5 model trees to predict monthly e pan from turkey s meteorological stations lu et al 2018 used three tree based ml models to estimate the daily e pan from local and cross station data of poyang lake in china compared to physical and traditional statistical models ml models are recognized as having superior predictive performance universal adaptability and flexible combinations of input variables elshorbagy et al 2010 lima et al 2015 schmidt et al 2020 despite advances of ml methods in data reconstruction a great challenge for ml method is its poor interpretability or black box phenomenon coyle and weller 2020 yu et al 2021 the primary goal of this research is to utilize ml methods mars and rf penpan model and multiple linear regression mlr to reconstruct missing daily e pan data in china based on long term accessible meteorological factors in section 2 we described the study s data and methods section 3 compared the results of e pan simulated using the four methods and attempts to reconstruct the daily e pan followed by the discussions and conclusions a flowchart of the work for reconstruction of the e pan is shown in fig 1 2 material and methods 2 1 the meteorological data fig 2 a shows the spatial locations of the meteorological stations daily surface data for 1951 2020 were obtained from 2410 meteorological stations at the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn the stations are national level surface observation stations in china placed under the same standard conditions for example the beijing and nanjing station shown in fig s1 and s2 in supplemental material the meteorological data used in this study included atmospheric pressure ap relative humidity rh sunshine hours n ta measured 2 m above ground level u measured 10 m above ground level and e pan the e pan is observed using a d20 pan with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 10 cm fig 2 b all data were strictly quality controlled availability of all elements exceeds 99 and the percentage of correct data approaches 100 owing to the influence of landforms and meteorological conditions the e pan varies greatly in time and space resulting in strong regional applicability of the e pan simulation model which may not be extended to the whole country therefore based on climatic conditions we selected four climatic zones in china fig 2 a to analyze temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz and subtropical monsoon zone smz fan et al 2016 yang et al 2021 2 2 the pan evaporation prediction models in this study we investigated three types of e pan model the penpan model ml models mars and rf and mlr model the penpan model is based on fundamental physical principles which makes it able to provide a more accurate representation of the physical processes that drive evaporation the ml models are particularly useful when there is a large amount of data available as the algorithms can learn from the data and identify patterns that may not be obvious to the human eye mlr model is a statistical technique which is relatively simple and useful when there is a limited amount of data available as it can be used to identify linear relationships between variables and make predictions based on those relationships five meteorological factors u ap rh ta and n were selected as predictor variables according to the input of penpan model preprocessing of input data can significantly reduce the risk of improper training and normalizing data can also help mitigate the risk of overfitting as it can help ensure that the model is not overly sensitive to small changes in the input data das et al 2018 it is a technique often used to transform data into a range between 0 and 1 this is done by subtracting the minimum value from the data and then dividing by the range x n x i x min x max x min all models except for the penpan model underwent input normalization as part of our study to reduce overfitting the k fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of ml and mlr algorithms fan et al 2018 wong and yeh 2020 the k fold cross validation is a resampling method that involves randomly dividing the training data into k folds of approximately equal size building the model on k 1 folds and using the remaining fold to compute model performance this process is repeated k times resulting in k estimates of the generalization error the k fold cross validation estimate is computed by averaging the k test errors providing an approximation of the error expected on unseen data the most common choices of k are 5 and 10 liu et al 2022b zhang and liu 2023 and k was set as 5 in this study 2 2 1 the penpan model the penpan model is a modified version of the penman penman 1948 for determining potential evapotranspiration it incorporates aerodynamic and radiative components based on thom et al 1981 and linacre 1994 modified for class a evaporation pan roderick et al 2007 rotstayn et al 2006 respectively the penpan model has a physical mechanism and its driving factors are meteorological data with long term measurements this model has been widely used and obtained excellent agreement between the measured and predicted monthly e pan it has also been effectively modified for the d20 evaporation pan in china li et al 2013 liu and sun 2016 sun et al 2018 and its application to the

dimensionality and is a nonparametric regression procedure proposed by professor friedman 1991 it uses a combination of linear and non linear terms to fit a model to the data it does not require assumptions about the form of the relationship between the predicted variable and predictor variables and uses two sided truncated functions as basis functions to fit separate splines and distinct intervals of the predictor variables prasad et al 2006 the general mars model equation put et al 2004 is given as 9 f ˆ x a 0 m 1 m a m b m x where f ˆ x is the predicted e pan x is the predictor

level of complexity has been reached then we begin a backward procedure to remove the least significant basis functions from the model according the generalized cross validation gcv i e those whose removal will lead to the least reduction in the least squares goodness of fit liu et al 2022a marcoulides 2004 ramsay 2003 10 gcv mse 1 cm m 2 where mse and cm are the mean squared error and penalty factor of the evaluated model respectively 2 2 3 random forest rf the rf model developed by professor breiman of statistics 2001 is a robust nonparametric model designed to produce accurate predictions due to the law of large numbers rf model trained on large datasets are less likely to overfit provided that they are properly regularized by injecting appropriate kinds of randomness into the training process these models can achieve high levels of accuracy as both classifiers and regressors rf is a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest breiman 2001 williams et al 2020 firstly the original data sets is spited into k subsets using bootstrap sampling θ1 θi θk for the ith tree a random vector θi is generated independent of other random vectors but with the same distribution then a tree is grown using the subset and θi resulting in a precipitation or classifier h x θi where x is an input vector finally after a large number of trees and precipitations are generated the average method to merge the predicted values of all trees to obtain a more accurate prediction is f ˆ x 1 k i 1 k h x θ i fig 3 carvalho et al 2019 strobl et al 2007 and has become a major data analysis tool for performing well in comparison with many standard methods diaz uriarte and de andres 2006 heidema et al 2006 strobl et al 2007 2 2 4 multiple linear regression mlr mlr is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a predicted variable and predictor variables hemmings and hopkins 2006 the relationships between each of these predictor variables and predicted variable are summarized by coefficients or slopes newman and mcculloch 2012 mlr is based on ordinary least squares and the model is fitted such that the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed and predicted values is minimized the general mlr model equation is given as 11 f ˆ x β 0 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x i 2 β 1 x ip ε where f ˆ x is the predicted e pan x is the predictor variable u ap rh ta or n β 0 is the y intercept β 1 2 p is the slope

taylor diagrams taylor 2001 taylor 2005 were used to evaluate the performance of the four e pan estimation models taylor diagrams can provide a way to graphically summarize how closely the values simulated by models match observations in terms of their correlation rmsd and the ratio of their variances σ 2 taylor 2001 taylor 2005 taylor diagram is an effective evaluation method for conveying information about the similarity between the simulated values of a model and observations ipcc 2001 and has been widely used to illustrate the relative accuracy of a number of models harrison et al 2015 liu and sun 2017 the formulas for calculating r 2 rmsd and σ are as follows taylor 2001 taylor 2005 12 rmsd σ sim 2 σ obs 2 2 σ sim σ obs r 13 r 2 i 1 h x sim i x sim x obs i x obs σ sim σ obs 2 14 σ sim 1 h i 1 h x sim i x sim 15 σ obs 1 h i 1 h x obs i x obs where x sim and x obs are the simulated and observed e pan values respectively x sim and x obs are the average values of x sim and x obs respectively in addition h represents the data sample size for the ml and mlr methods algorithms the 5 folds cross validation method kohavi 1995 is used to calculate the error of each meteorological station the linear regression equation eq 16 was used to estimate the temporal linearity trend of x the annual e pan 16 y bt a where y is the formula of e pan the slope of the line is b a is the intercept and t is the year when b 0 e pan increases with time and when b 0 e pan decreases with time the pearson correlation coefficient r eq 17 and its statistical significance from the t test were used to judge whether the increasing or decreasing trend of annual e pan was statistically significant or not the significance level is 0 05 the r was calculated as 17 r 1 n x x y y 1 n x x 2 1 n y y 2 where y is the arithmetic mean of y traditional statistical analyses and ml algorithms were performed using spss matlab and the r programming language sigmaplot and arcgis were used to perform geostatistical analyses and produce figures 3 results 3 1 validation of the daily pan evaporation simulation over china the daily e pan values of all the meteorological stations were predicted using the penpan mars rf and mlr methods fig 4 and table s1 shows the r 2 and rmsd values between the observed and predicted daily e pan at each station the average r 2 penpan r 2 rf r 2 mars and r 2 mlr values were 0 88 0 95 0 91 and 0 86 respectively the average rmsd penpan rmsd rf rmsd mars and rmsd mlr values were 1 17 0 62 0 91 and 1 15 mm day 1 respectively overall e pan simulated using the ml methods rf and mars had the highest accuracy followed by the penpan and mlr models the rf model had the highest r 2 and lowest rmsd values between the simulated and observed e pan from the spatial distributions of r 2 and rmsd fig 4 it can be observed that the simulation performance of e pan in different zones was different for example the r 2 values between observed and simulated e pan by the penpan model are higher in northern china than in southern china with most stations showing values greater than 0 85 fig 4 a however fig 4 e shows large spatial difference in rmsd with 69 73 of stations exhibiting rmsd values greater than 1 mm d 1 therefore the simulation performances of the four models in different zones of china were analyzed fig 5 provides a concise statistical summary of the simulation performance for the daily e pan in the tcz tmz mpz and smz taylor diagrams show σ r and rmsd with observations of the total spatial and temporal variability for the daily e pan in the penpan mlr mars and rf simulations the position of each circle in the plot quantifies how closely the simulated e pan of the model matches observations it can be seen that the r values of the four zones are different they are all very high between 0 90 and 0 99 the centered rmsd between the simulated and observed e pan is proportional to the distance to the point on the x axis identified as observed the rmsd values of the four zones are significantly different among which the average values of the four methods are 1 19 1 02 0 86 and 0 90 mm day 1 in tcz tmz mpz and smz respectively although the simulation accuracies of the four methods were different the e pan predicted by rf red dot was closest to the observed e pan in each zone the r values of rf in the four zones are between 0 97 and 0 99 and the rmsd values are between 0 52 and 0 73 mm day 1 it can be seen that the rf method has the highest accuracy in modelling the daily e pan based on the stations with e pan observations of no less than 50 years among all stations we randomly selected two stations in each of the four zones fig 6 i fig 6 a and b are located in the tcz c and d are located in the tmz e and f are located in the mpz and fig 6 g and h are located in the smz fig 6 a h shows the scatter density map of the observed e pan versus the predicted e pan using the rf method at the eight selected stations as can be seen most of the data are concentrated around the 1 1 line the values of the r 2 are between 0 93 and 0 98 and the rmsd are not higher than 0 69 this indicates that the performance of the estimation of e pan using the rf method is not affected by the climatic conditions in different regions 3 2 validation of the monthly pan evaporation simulation over china the simulation accuracy of monthly e pan was further verified based on daily e pan fig 7 shows a boxplot of the r 2 and rmsd between the observed and predicted monthly e pan for all stations the average r 2 penpan r 2 rf r 2 mars and r 2 mlr values are 0 94 0 98 0 95 and 0 92 respectively the ml methods rf and mars exhibited higher average and median r 2 than the physical model penpan which had higher r 2 values than the linear regression method mlr in particular the rf method exhibited the highest r 2 value with a more concentrated distribution interval and the 25th 75th percentile range the average rmsd penpan rmsd rf rmsd mars and rmsd mlr were 20 90 9 06 14 56 and 20 15 mm month 1 respectively fig 7 b and table s2 the average and median rmsd of the ml methods rf and mars were the smallest followed by the penpan and mlr methods in the tcz tmz and mpz rmsd penpan was the largest in smz the e pan predicted by rf with the highest r 2 and lowest rmsd in each zone and was found to be most accuracy in estimating monthly e pan 3 3 the pan evaporation reconstruction and its spatiotemporal pattern in recent 60 years based on the daily and monthly validations it can be seen that e pan predicted by the rf method has the highest accuracy compared with the other three methods therefore based on the daily meteorological data u ap rh ta and n the missing daily e pan were predicted using the rf method the predicted e pan were added to the observation series to reconstruct the time series of daily e pan over china a probability density function pdf was used to analyze whether the distribution of the reconstructed data was consistent with that of the original observational data fig s3 shows the pdf of the reconstructed and observed e pan in tcz tmz mpz and smz it can be seen that the reconstructed e pan has the same pdf as the observed e pan which show that the reconstructed e pan are reliable the daily e pan of 2410 meteorological stations were reconstructed of which 969 meteorological stations had a continuous daily e pan for the last 60 years 1961 2020 fig 8 fig 8 a shows the linear trend of annual e pan from 1961 to 2020 at 969 stations the blue dots represent the stations where the e pan decreased significantly 0 05 level in the last 60 years accounting for 42 00 of the total stations the gray dots represent the stations without significant change in statistics accounting for 43 45 and the red dots represent the stations with a significant increase accounting for 14 55 the annual average e pan in china changed from downward to upward around 1993 li et al 2013 wang et al 2018b and the period from 1961 to 2020 could be divided into 1961 1993 and 1994 2020 fig 8 b shows the linear trend of annual e pan at each station from 1961 to 1993 most stations approximately 61 09 showed a significant decreasing trend 0 05 level a few stations 33 64 showed no significant change trend and only 5 26 of stations showed an increasing trend fig 8 c shows the linear trend of annual e pan from 1994 to 2020 it can be seen that the number of stations with significant decrease accounted for only 13 11 the number of stations showing significantly increase comprised 61 52 the remaining 25 08 stations exhibited non statistically significant changes therefore most stations showed significant linear decreasing trends during the first period 1961 1993 followed by an increasing or non statistically significant trend in the second period 1994 2020 this led to a slowing down of the overall trend over the last 60 years the annual average e pan of the 969 stations fig 9 a decreased significantly 0 01 level from 1961 to 2020 with a reduction rate of 1 61 mm yr 1 from 1961 1993 the annual e pan decreased significantly 0 01 level with a reduction rate of 6 17 mm yr 1 fig 9 b from 1994 2020 the annual e pan showed a significant increasing trend with an increase rate of 1 84 mm yr 1 fig 9 c shows the linear trend of the average annual e pan from 1961 to 2020 in the four zones the annual e pan showed significant decreases 0 05 level in the four zones with the fastest reduction rate of 2 60 mm yr 1 in tmz and the slowest reduction rate of 0 92 mm yr 1 in smz during 1961 1993 fig 9 d the reduction rates of the annual e pan ranged from 4 87 to 7 76 mm yr 1 in the four zones from 1994 2020 the annual e pan of smz increased significantly and there was no statistically significant change in tcz tmz and mpz the annual e pan first showed a downward trend followed by a reverse upward trend which is consistent with changes in wind speed vapor pressure deficit and radiation mozny et al 2020 roderick et al 2007 sun et al 2018 4 discussions and conclusions three types of e pan models including the physical model penpan two popular machine learning ml models mars and rf and statistical model mlr were used to predict d20 e pan the ml models had the best prediction effects especially rf ml is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed the ml models such as rf lu et al 2018 mars ghaemi et al 2019 have been extensively applied to reconstruct e pan fahimi et al 2017 malik et al 2022 yu et al 2021 because they require no knowledge of internal variables can overcome data heterogeneity and offer simple solutions for nonlinear multivariable functions brown et al 2020 oh et al 2016 pun et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the rf model had the highest r 2 0 95 0 029 0 98 0 019 and lowest rmsd 0 62 0 17 mm day 1 9 06 3 45 mm month 1 values between the predicted and observed daily monthly e pan these results were close to the results of e pan prediction using rf in other cases such as for iraq with r 2 and rmse root mean square error of 0 99 19 88 mm month 1 respectively al mukhtar 2021 poyang lake with r 2 and rmse of 0 96 0 35 mm day 1 respectively lu et al 2018 which were better than prediction by penpan with r 2 and rmse of 0 92 26 03 mm month 1 over china wang et al 2018b and r 2 and rmse of 0 94 31 mm month 1 in xinjiang li et al 2013 therefore the missing daily e pan values were predicted using the rf method based on the daily meteorological data u ap rh ta and n the annual average e pan showed a significant decrease from 1961 to 2020 at a rate of 1 61 mm yr 1 with a significant reduction at a rate of 6 17 mm yr 1 from 1961 to 1993 and a significant increase at a rate of 1 84 mm yr 1 from 1994 to 2020 at the same time other ml models also have good potential in predicting daily or monthly e pan such as novel hybrid support vector regression optimized by salp swarm algorithm in conjunction with gamma test malik et al 2021 multiple model artificial neural network and multi gene genetic programming mggp malik et al 2020 relevance vector machine tuned with improved manta ray foraging optimization rvm imrfo adnan et al 2023b although the ml method has significant advantages in data reconstruction it is important to be aware of their limitations and carefully consider how to apply them in practice such as its poor interpretability or black box phenomenon coyle and weller 2020 yu et al 2021 while understanding the overall change in evaporation is important it is equally crucial to identify the underlying factors driving this change this can help in understanding the underlying mechanisms governing evaporation and how they may be influenced by various environmental factors at the same time ml models can be overly complex and fit the training data too closely leading to poor performance on new or unseen data to mitigate this risk it is crucial to select appropriate ml models and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics one way to assess model performance is through cross validation techniques which help to estimate the model s generalization error by splitting the available data into training and validation sets cross validation helps to avoid overfitting by testing the model s performance on unseen data and identifying any potential issues with model complexity or parameter tuning fan et al 2018 wong and yeh 2020 the penpan model is based on fundamental physical principles which makes it able to provide a more accurate representation of the physical processes that drive evaporation the simulations of e pan using the penpan model were not poor particularly in northern china owing to the influence of landforms and meteorological conditions the e pan varies greatly in time and space resulting in strong regional applicability of the e pan physical simulation model which may not be extended to the whole country therefore we used the four climatic zones for analysis and comparison although the simulation accuracies were different in the four zones the ml methods especially rf not only improved r 2 but also reduced the deviation of the e pan simulations these indicate that the penpan model is limited by regional climatic and hydrological characteristics which make it difficult to transfer between regions while the machine learning method is less affected by regional characteristics and can be used among regions based on the reconstruction of the daily e pan some empirical formulas such as the wind speed function and parameters of the penpan model can be calibrated and verified more accurately lim et al 2016 wang et al 2019 for different climatic zones which may improve the simulation accuracy of the penpan model in addition the annual e pan has stopped falling or reversing in recent years in many regions worldwide leading to difficulties in constructing physical models therefore the combination of physical and ml models is a potential method for studying the attribution of e pan change physical models provide a strong scientific foundation by capturing the fundamental processes underlying environmental systems behavior but they may be limited by simplifying assumptions or uncertainties in model parameters on the other hand ml models can capture complex non linear relationships between meteorological factors and e pan and learn patterns from data to make predictions integrating physical and ml models has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of e pan and predict their responses to changing conditions more accurately declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8847,substrate grown crops represent approximately 10 of the cropping area of intensive greenhouse horticulture in southern spain the vast majority are free draining in that they do not collect and recirculate drainage the substantial nutrient loss in drainage contributes to contamination of water bodies this study examined the effectiveness of dynamic management approaches to appreciably reduce the large nutrient loss associated with free draining substrate grown crops for three tomato crops grown in substrate this study i compared management of n p and k based on the ratio of the concentration in drainage to that in the nutrient solution to conventional management ii derived uptake concentration values for n p and k throughout the crop cycle and iii evaluated uptake concentration as a nutrition management tool ratio based management reduced the amounts of n p and k in drainage in relation to conventional management by 58 61 65 80 and 55 77 respectively the amounts of applied n p and k were reduced by 22 28 37 43 and 28 34 compared to conventional management n p and k concentrations in the applied nutrient solution slightly below the uptake concentration were associated with much lower concentrations in the drainage solution in contrast when the applied nutrient concentration exceeded the uptake concentration this was associated with much higher drainage nutrient concentrations in conclusion the two nutritional management strategies examined ratio based management and use of uptake concentrations were both associated with reduced nutrient application and a considerable reduction of nutrient loss in drainage fruit production was maintained with the improved nutrient management practices these strategies offer approaches that can considerably reduce the substantial nutrient loss in drainage associated with free draining substrate cropping in greenhouse production in southern europe keywords fertilization nitrogen phosphorus

thompson et al 2013a in free draining substrate cropping commonly 25 30 of the applied water is drained to prevent salt accumulation in the relatively inert root medium and to ensure uniform

neocleous and savvas 2016 neocleous and vasilakakis 2007 raimondi et al 2014 the technical complexity of the management of closed substrate systems requires highly qualified and experienced personnel of whom few are available locally additionally high investment costs and a high level of technical development are required which are generally not compatible with the medium technological level and relatively lower yields of greenhouses in almeria garcía et al 2016 magán et al 2008 for these reasons closed substrate cropping is very rare in spain and other southern european countries incrocci et

based on the use of standard nutrient solutions which vary according to species and developmental stage urrestarazu 2004a this management ensures profitable production however it is associated with nutrient e g n applications that exceed crop requirements and result in large nutrient loss to the environment massa et al 2020 muñoz et al 2008 thompson et al 2013b given the appreciable area of free draining substrate cropping in se spain its environmental impact and the unnecessary costs associated with the substantial nutrient loss of these free draining cropping systems management strategies and tools are required to reduce and optimize nutrient use while maintaining production one suggested approach to improve nutrient management in free draining substrate systems is the use of ratios of nutrient concentrations in drainage to those in the applied nutrient solution casas 1999 using recommended ratios can ensure sufficient supply of nutrients to optimize production while restricting the amounts lost in drainage recommended ratios of easily absorbed nutrients such as ammonium phosphates and potassium are for the concentrations in drainage to be 50 75 of that in the applied nutrient solution casas 1999 for nutrients that are more difficult to absorb such as bivalent ions e g calcium and magnesium recommended concentrations in drainage are 100 200 of that in the nutrient solution casas 1999 another suggested approach for optimizing nutrient use in free draining substrate cropping is the use of uptake concentration to formulate optimal nutrient concentrations in applied nutrient solutions sonneveld 2000 uptake concentration is calculated as the amount of a nutrient absorbed by a crop divided by the volume of water absorbed during the same time interval and is expressed in units of concentration van noordwijk 1990 uptake concentration is a theoretical concept with no physiological basis however it is considered to be a useful practical guide for the formulation of nutrient solutions for crops grown in soilless culture sonneveld 2000 2002 sonneveld and voogt 2001 thompson et al 2013b demonstrated that continually maintaining the n applied concentration slightly lower than the n uptake concentration was associated with a very high crop n recovery in tomato crops in free draining substrate grown greenhouses no other studies have evaluated the use of uptake concentration for n in the almeria greenhouse system there have been no studies in this system examining the use of uptake concentration of p and k more information is

thompson et al 2009 facilitates the adoption of the two approaches referred to above however before these approaches can be recommended to vegetable growers further assessment is required of their suitability and effectiveness for nutrient management of vegetable crops grown in free drainage substrate systems in mediterranean greenhouses considering that most substrate grown crops in the mediterranean region use free draining systems incrocci et al 2020 massa et al 2020 their high environmental impact and the difficulty of implementing closed substrate growing systems in this region

perlite in a greenhouse to a compare management of n p and k based on the ratio of the concentration in drainage to that in the nutrient solution to conventional management b derive uptake concentration values for n p and k throughout the crop cycle and c evaluate the use of uptake concentration as a tool for nutrition management of tomato crops grown in free draining substrate this work evaluated approaches that can be used for on farm management by vegetable growers and farm advisors using on farm rapid analysis systems to measure nutrient concentrations 2 materials and methods

155 m a s l in the province of almeria in se spain the crops were grown in a multi span greenhouse with polyethylene cover and passive ventilation the greenhouse area was 960 m2 40 m x 24 m with a cropping area of 840 m2 the three tomato crops were grown sequentially in the greenhouse an autumn winter crop was grown from 9 september 2020 1 february 2021 145 days hereafter referred to as the autumn crop a spring crop was grown from 17 january 2020 30 june 2021 133 days hereafter referred to as the spring crop a long cycle tomato crop was grown from 14 september 2021 17 may 2022 245 days hereafter referred to as the long cycle crop in the three tomato crops the cv realsol rijk zwaan de lier the netherlands was used it was grafted onto cv king kong rz rijk zwaan in the spring crop and cv multiflor bayer leverkusen germany for long cycle crop the autumn crop was not grafted cropping conditions and crop management were very similar to those in commercial greenhouses in this region the crops were grown in perlite in 37 l 110 cm long x 28 cm wide x 12 cm high bags the perlite was class a having a particle size ø of 0 6 mm drainage water was not re circulated the bottom of the

and 0 5 m between bags in the same paired row the rows of perlite bags were perpendicular to the central axis of the greenhouse there was a total of 40 rows of 21 m length seedlings grown in peat cubes were transplanted into the perlite bags before the inflorescence of the first truss was visible plants were vertically supported by nylon cord guides and were regularly pruned to remove all auxiliary shoots leaving only the main stem plants were topped removal of apex at 99 97 and 197 days after transplanting dat in the autumn spring and long cycle crops respectively topping was conducted when there were respectively 7 8 and 18 trusses per plant for the three crops the plastic cover of the greenhouse was white washed application of caco3 suspension from 0 to 20 dat in the

controlled by a demand tray system gallardo et al 2013 urrestarazu 2004b the demand tray was calibrated for the conventional treatment ct to maintain a similar electrical conductivity ec in drainage to that of treatment ot therefore the drainage fraction in treatment ct varied according to drainage ec this management was used to limit differences in root zone ec between treatments considering that ec can affect nutrient uptake magán 2004 2 2 treatments and experimental design 2 2 1 nutrition treatments in each of the three crops two different nutrition treatments were applied a conventional treatment ct based on local farming practice and an optimized treatment ot for the spring and long cycle crops the management of n p and k was optimized in treatment ot in the autumn crop the management of p and k but not n was optimized in treatment ot in treatment ct which was based on local farming practice the ratios of the concentrations of n p and k in drainage to those in the applied nutrient solution were generally slightly above or close to one in treatment ot for n and k the objective was to maintain the ratios of the concentration drainage nutrient solution in the range 0 50 0 75 as recommended by casas 1999 in situ measurement described subsequently of n as no3 and k was used to assist with the management of the ot treatments for the autumn and spring crops it was not possible to measure the p concentrations in situ consequently the basis of p management in the ot treatment was to reduce the applied p concentration by 50 with respect to treatment ct the in situ measurements were made directly in the collected samples of applied nutrient solution and drainage in both treatments in the three crops weekly measurements of the no3 and k concentrations in the applied nutrient solution and in drainage were made in situ in the greenhouse with separate laquatwin sensors horiba ltd kyoto japan nitrate was measured with model no3 11 laquatwin nitrate sensor and

autumn and spring crops in the long cycle crop from 64 dat until the end of the crop the p concentration of the applied nutrient solution and drainage was measured weekly in situ using a pocket colorimeter model hi706 hanna instruments sursee switzerland 2 2 2 experimental design the lines of plants and substrate bags in the greenhouse were organized into 20 paired rows eight paired rows were used as borders three were on each side of the crop and two were within the crop the work reported here was conducted in four adjacent paired rows two of each treatment the allocation of treatments to these paired rows was randomized each row within a paired row was considered to be one replicate plot all measurements were made in each of four replicate plots that is in each row per treatment there was a border paired row alongside each side of this group of four paired rows another part of the crop was used for a separate study which involved destructive biomass sampling during the crop 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 volumes of water applied drainage and water uptake the volume of nutrient solution i e irrigation applied was measured using a water volume meter there was one water meter per treatment drainage was collected from four drainage trays 3 m long 0 4 m wide 0 1 m high one for each replication in each treatment in a 20 l container each drainage tray contained two perlite bags giving totals of six plants and 10 drippers per tray for each of the three crops at 8 00 every weekday before commencing irrigation for that day the total volume of nutrient solution i e irrigation applied in the preceding 24 h was measured by reading the water meter for each treatment the volume of drainage collected in each 20 l container for the preceding 24 h was measured with a graduated cylinder also at 8 00 every weekday the cumulative volumes of irrigation and drainage of friday saturday and sunday were measured the following monday at 8 00 the drainage fraction was calculated daily as the ratio of the total volumes of drainage and irrigation for a given day daily crop water uptake was determined as the difference between the daily volumes of applied nutrient solution and drainage 2 3 2 composition of applied nutrient solution and drainage two times per week nutrient concentrations were measured in situ in individual daily samples of nutrient solution and drainage using the rapid analysis systems described in section 2 2 1 these measurements were used to guide the on going dynamic nutrient management of the treatment ot in the three crops from the daily samples of nutrient solution and drainage representative composite samples were prepared for two weekly periods for the laboratory analysis described subsequently these composite samples were prepared by mixing representative sub samples of the daily weekend samples in relative proportions to their individual volumes for samples collected throughout the two week period in these two weekly composite samples the concentrations of anions no3 h2po4 2 and so4 2 were determined by ion chromatography model 850 professional ic cation methrom ag herisau switzerland and the concentrations of cations nh4 k ca2 mg2 by inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometry model icap 6500duo thermofisher scientific massachusetts usa average nutrient concentrations and ec and ph values of the nutrient solution and drainage for each treatment in each crop are presented in table 1 the nutrient concentration values determined by laboratory analysis on the two weekly samples were used for data analysis the values from the in situ analysis section 2 2 1 were used for guiding nutrient management 2 3 3 amounts of nutrients applied leached and taken up by the crops for each nutrient the amount applied was calculated every two weeks as the product of the measured concentration in the two weekly composite sample and the total volume of nutrient solution applied for the same two week period similarly the amount of nutrient drained in the same two week period for each replicate plot was the product of the concentration in the two weekly composite drainage sample and the total volume of drainage for the corresponding two week period the volumes and concentrations used for drainage were the means of the values from the four replicate plots for each treatment the cumulative amounts of nutrients applied and drained throughout a crop are the sequential sums of the amounts for two week periods crop uptake of a given nutrient was determined using a mass balance approach as the difference between the amounts applied and drained for each nutrient crop uptake was determined for the same two week periods as for the calculation of the amounts of applied and drained nutrients cumulative crop uptake was obtained by sequentially summing uptake for the two week periods these calculations of crop nutrient uptake using a mass balance calculation every two weeks assume there is no appreciable retention of nutrients in the perlite substrate during each two week period 2 3 4 calculation of nutrient uptake concentration for each nutrient the uptake concentration for each two week period was determined by dividing nutrient uptake by water uptake for the same two week period 2 3 5 fruit production and quality and total dry matter production total fruit production was the sum of red fruit collected in multiple harvests in the autumn spring and long cycle crops there were 6 9 and 22 separate harvests collected from the same nine plants in each replicate plot at each harvest fresh weight and fruit number of total and marketable production were determined average fresh weights of total and marketable fruit were calculated as the product of fruit weight between fruit number for each category of harvested fruit the parameters used to discriminate between marketable and non marketable fruit were blossom end rot blotchy ripening cracking immaturity non marketable size and pathogen damage fruit size was assessed for four categories large 67 mm medium 57 67 mm small 47 57 mm and very small 46 mm following the tomato fruit quality protocol of the cajamar cajamar 2014a the proportion of fruit by size was used as a quality parameter total soluble solids tss and titratable acidity were determined twice during the spring crop and three times during the long cycle crop on samples of juice extracted from samples of four red tomatoes per replicate plot the tss was determined using a digital refractometer model pal 1 atago tokyo japan as described by cajamar 2014b titratable acidity was determined by titration with 0 1 m naoh 0 1 using phenolphthalein as indicator with a mix of 50 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of extracted juice following the protocol of cajamar 2014b at the end of each crop four plants in each of the four drainage trays were removed for a final biomass sampling the removed material from each tray was divided into leaves stems and unharvest fruit and weighed dry matter dm content was determined by oven drying representative samples at 65 c for 48 h pruned material and harvested fruit were included in the final biomass determination all pruned material during each crop was collected from the same nine plants used for fruit production the dm content and amount of pruned material and harvested fruit were determined as for final biomass components the amount of dry matter in each component was the product of dm content and fresh weight total crop dry mater production was the sum of the amounts in final biomass and in accumulated harvested fruit and pruned material 2 4 climate climate parameters were continuously monitored within the greenhouse air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a ventilated psychrometer priva de lier the netherlands and solar radiation with a pyranometer model sp 110 apogee instruments logan usa the average values throughout the crops of daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures were similar for both the autumn and long cycle crops table 2 the average daily mean temperature for these two crops was 16 2 16 9 c in the spring crop average values for daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 2 0 3 9 c higher average values of the daily integral of solar radiation were also similar in autumn crop and long cycle crop being 6 1 6 4 mj m 2 d 1 table 2 that of the spring crop of 10 1 mj m 2 d 1 was substantially higher average daily mean vapor pressure deficit values were similar for the autumn and long cycle crops 0 73 0 76 kpa whereas the spring crop had a higher value 0 90 kpa 3 results 3 1 effects of ratio management on nutrient use and loss of n p k average values throughout each crop of the ratio of n p and k concentration in drainage to that in the applied nutrient solution were generally close to one for the ct treatments table 3 for p and k in the three crops and for n in the spring and long cycle crops this ratio for the ot treatments was appreciably less than in corresponding ct treatment table 3 generally for n p and k in the ot treatments the average ratio values were 0 51 0 79 average ratio values were similar for n for the two treatments in the autumn crop because a lower ratio was not applied to n management of the ot in this crop 3 2 amounts of water and nutrients applied and drained and taken up by crops where ratio management was used p and k in the three crops n in the spring and long cycle crops it resulted in appreciable reductions in the amounts of n p and k applied table 4 the amount of n applied was 22 28 less in the ot treatments in both the spring and long cycle crops where ratio management was used table 4 in the three crops ratio management in the ot treatment reduced p application by 37 43 and k application by 28 34 table 4 there were substantial reductions in the total amounts of drained nutrients where ratio management was used the reductions were 58 61 for n spring and long cycle crops 65 80 for p all crops and 57 77 for k all crops table 4 generally ratio management did not significantly affect crop nutrient uptake table 4 the amounts of n and k absorbed by the crop were not affected by ratio management treatment in any of the three crops only for p in the autumn and spring crops was there a reduction in the amount of crop nutrient uptake associated with ratio management in treatment ot generally the volumes of water applied and drained in the two treatments in each crop were similar table 4 the exception was the spring crop this was a consequence of adjusting water management to obtain similar ec in drainage to avoid ec induced differences in nutrient uptake 3 3 uptake concentrations of n p and k the uptake concentrations upc for n p and k generally were not constant during each of the three crops fig 1 also the general pattern for a given nutrient was not the same in each of the three crops in each of the three crops the values and patterns of upc for a given nutrient were generally similar in the ct and ot treatments fig 1 the upc of n was generally constant throughout the autumn crop for both the ct and ot treatments fig 1 the average values were 11 0 and 9 2 mmol l 1 for ct and ot treatments respectively table 5 in both the spring and long cycle crops there was a general tendency of a continual and shallow decline in n upc in both treatments fig 1 in both the spring and long cycle crops initial n upc values were approximately 15 mmol l 1 which declined steadily to approximately 7 and 5 mmol l 1 in the spring and long cycle crops respectively the p upc values of the autumn and spring crops were relatively constant throughout the duration of these crops but with appreciable fluctuation fig 1 in the long cycle crop there was a general tendency for p upc to steadily decline throughout the crop fig 1 initial values were approximately 1 7 mmol l 1 and final values were approximately 0 6 mmol l 1 the generally larger relative fluctuation of p upc compared to n upc and k upc is presumably attributable to the much lower numerator values of the ratio when calculating upc average p upc values for the ct and ot treatments were 1 1 1 5 mmol l 1 in the three crops table 5 phosphorus upc values were generally clearly less in the ot than ct treatments in the autumn and spring crops and were generally similar for the ct and ot treatments in the long cycle crop potassium upc values tended to be relatively constant with appreciable fluctuation in the autumn crop and to increase and then decrease in both the spring and long cycle crops fig 1 there were no consistent appreciable differences in k upc between the two treatments in the three crops the exception being 22 78 dat in the autumn crop fig 1 average values throughout the autumn crop were 6 3 and 5 4 mmol l 1 for ct and ot respectively table 5 in the spring crop initial k upc values were approximately 3 mmol l 1 for both treatments which then continually increased to values of 6 6 9 2 mmol l 1 until 63 dat and then declined to values that were generally 2 0 6 0 mmol l 1 in the latter part of the crop fig 1 in the long cycle crop initial k upc values were 5 8 mmol l 1 which increased rapidly to values of 9 0 mmol l 1 during the period 21 63 dat thereafter there was a general decline to values of 2 5 mmol l 1 at 189 dat fig 1 3 4 relationships between uptake applied and drainage concentration the average n of the applied nutrient solution for treatment ct throughout the three crops was 10 0 10 8 mmol l 1 table 5 for the corresponding ot treatments it was 8 1 8 9 mmol l 1 the reductions in the applied n being 18 19 for each crop average drainage n for the ct treatments for the autumn spring and long cycle crops were 8 6 11 2 and 10 3 mmol l 1 respectively table 5 average drainage n for the ot treatments for the autumn spring and long cycle crops were 6 6 6 3 and 5 8 mmol l 1 respectively table 5 for the autumn spring and long cycle crops the respective relative reductions in average drainage n for the ot compared to ct treatments were 23 43 and 44 where the applied n was similar to n upc the average drainage n was also similar to that of the applied n e g ct in spring and long cycle crops table 5 in contrast where the average applied n was clearly less than that of the n upc the resultant average drainage n was considerably less than the average applied n e g all ot treatments of the three crops and ct of the autumn crop table 5 this effect is clearly apparent in the much larger reductions in average drainage n concentration table 5 and the amounts of n drained table 4 with ot management in relation to ct management in the spring and long cycle crops compared to the autumn crop table 5 for the three crops for treatment ct average applied drainage and upc p were 1 5 1 7 1 6 2 0 and 1 2 1 5 mmol l 1 respectively table 5 in the ot treatments the corresponding average p values were 0 9 1 0 0 5 0 8 and 1 1 1 2 mmol l 1 table 5 the relative reductions in average drainage p for the ot compared to ct treatments were 53 70 the much lower drainage p of ot compared to ct in the three crops was associated with average applied p being less than average upc p whereas in ct the average applied p was larger than p upc table 5 for the three crops for treatment ct average applied drainage and upc k were 6 1 7 0 6 6 8 1 and 5 6 6 3 mmol l 1 table 5 in the ot treatments the corresponding average k values were 4 3 4 8 2 9 3 5 and 4 8 5 6 mmol l 1 table 5 the relative reductions in average drainage k for the ot compared to ct treatments were 48 59 the considerably lower average drainage k of ot compared to ct treatments in the three crops was associated with average applied k being less than average k upc whereas in ct treatments the average applied k was larger than k upc table 5 for n p and k in the three crops average drainage concentrations were much lower when the applied concentration was less than the upc compared to when the applied concentration exceeded the upc table 5 the very strong effect of the relationship between the applied nutrient concentration and the uptake concentration on the concentration of nutrients in drainage throughout a crop can be seen in fig 2 where data from the long cycle crop are presented for n in treatment ct the applied n concentration was similar to or greater than the n upc fig 2a and the consequent drainage n was similar to or higher than the applied n fig 2b in contrast in the ot treatment where the applied n was continually less than the n upc fig 2c the drainage n was continually appreciably less than the applied n fig 2d the drainage n in treatment ot was continually considerably less than in ct fig 2b and d in the ct treatment during the crop when the applied n exceeded n upc drainage n exceeded the applied n fig 2a and b conversely in treatment ct when the applied n was less than n upc the drainage n was less than applied n in treatment ot because the applied n was always less than n upc fig 2c drainage n was always less then applied n fig 2d very similar relationships were observed for p and k in the long cycle crop fig 2e l in the case of p in the ot treatment whenever applied p was inferior to p upc drainage p was very low fig 2 h and much lower than in the ct treatment fig 2 f similarly in the ot treatment low drainage k fig 2 l occurred when applied k was less than k upc fig 2k the drainage k in treatment ot fig 2 l was much lower throughout the crop than in treatment ct fig 2j similar relationships to those described above that occurred throughout the long cycle crop for n p and k were also observed throughout the autumn and spring crops data not presented the relationships between a nutrient concentration in drainage minus that of the applied nutrient solution and b nutrient concentration in the applied nutrient solution minus the upc for n p and k in treatments ct and ot throughout each of the three crops are shown in fig 3 these relationships demonstrate the strong and disproportionate effect on drainage concentrations of the relationship between the applied concentration and the uptake concentration in nearly all cases in fig 3 there were very strong linear relationships with r2 values of 0 81 0 99 and slopes that were appreciably larger than one fig 3 table 6 intercept values were consistently very close to zero fig 3 table 6 the exceptions to these relationships were for k in the autumn crop table 6 where r2 values were lower and where the slope was lower in treatment ct table 6 for n all r2 values were 0 90 slope values for treatment ct were 1 37 1 48 and for treatment ot were 1 96 2 22 table 6 for p r2 values were 0 81 0 97 slope values for treatment ct were 1 33 1 60 and for treatment ot were 1 33 3 38 table 6 for k except for the autumn crop r2 values were 0 93 0 98 and slope values were 1 26 2 73 table 6 these relationships indicate that the difference between applied and uptake concentrations generally had an amplified effect on drainage concentrations for n p and k however for each nutrient there were notable differences in slope between individual relationships fig 3 table 6 slope values differed between the two treatments in the same crop there were generally strong inverse relationships for n p and k between slope values fig 3 table 6 and the drainage fraction considering the two treatments in each crop fig 4 particularly for n and k the r2 values for the relationship of slope values from fig 3 to drainage fraction for n and k were 0 84 and 0 65 for p the r2 value was 0 41 fig 4 therefore the variation in slope values for a given nutrient reported in fig 3 and table 6 can be at least partly explained by differences in drainage fraction 3 5 yield fruit quality and dry matter production total and marketable yield for the ct and ot treatments were similar in each crop with no statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the two treatments table 7 similarly there were no statistically significant differences p 0 05 in fruit number and average fruit weight table 7 comparing total yields for the three crops they were 197 215 t ha 1 in the long cycle crop 114 117 t ha 1 in the spring crop and 41 43 t ha 1 in the autumn crop table 7 the differences in yield between the three crops were related to the length of the crops the prevailing climatic conditions table 2 and to the incidence of an infection of fusarium oxysporum f sp in the autumn crop which affected fruit production there were no statistically significant differences p 0 05 in total dry matter production dmp between the two treatments in each of the three crops table 7 dry matter production was approximately twice as high in the long cycle crop compared to the autumn and spring crops there were no significant difference in total soluble solids tss content between the two treatments in the spring and long cycle crops table 8 the tss for the spring crop was 5 0 brix and for long cycle crop was 4 5 brix titratable acidity in the spring crop was 0 31 0 32 and 0 33 0 37 in the long cycle crop table 8 there were significant differences between treatments in titratable acidity in the long cycle crop tss and titratable acidity were not measured in the autumn crop the relative distribution of fruit sizes were similar in both treatments in the autumn crop table 8 there were higher percentages of medium sized fruit in the ct than ot treatment in the spring and long cycle crops the respective values for ct and ot treatments were 43 6 and 35 3 in the spring crop and 26 0 and 22 3 in the long cycle crop 4 discussion reducing the ratio of the concentrations of n p and k in drainage to those applied in the nutrient solution reduced the amounts of n p and k that were applied it also substantially reduced the amounts drained without affecting fruit yield or quality or nutrient uptake additionally the derivation of upc values indicated the potential for using upc values to guide nutrient management the relationships between uptake concentration and the applied concentrations of n p and k were strongly related to the drainage concentration and therefore to the amounts drained the analysis of upc data indicated that maintaining applied nutrient concentrations slightly below uptake concentrations maintained fruit production and quality while considerably reducing nutrient loss in drainage both approaches ratios and uptake concentration are promising options for practical on farm management to appreciably improve nutrient management of free draining substrate grown crops thereby reducing nutrient application and substantially reducing nutrient loss while there are observations and recommendations of ratios of drainage to applied nutrient concentrations baixauli soria and aguilar olivert 2002 casas 1999 we are unaware of published studies evaluating this approach the results of the present study demonstrate that it is an effective approach to appreciably improve nutrient management of free draining substrate grown tomato crops the availability of reliable and relatively inexpensive systems for rapid on farm analysis of n and k concentrations in applied and drainage solutions bonachela et al 2018 peña fleitas et al 2021 2022 thompson et al 2009 enable frequent in situ measurement for the practical application of this approach in commercial farms systems are available for rapid on farm measurement of p concentration however as yet they have not been verified in published scientific studies with on farm analysis the ratio approach can be readily adopted in commercial production using suggested ratio values casas 1999 at a practical management level ratio management has to be combined with ec management and drainage fraction management to respectively avoid detrimental salinity effects on crops and to reduce spatial variability of nutrients within substrate further research work is suggested to further verify optimize ratio values for tomato and to develop values for other species uptake concentrations of n p and k were generally similar in both treatments in each crop in the spring and long cycle crops the patterns and ranges of uptake concentration were generally similar for each of n p and k the patterns upc in the autumn crop were somewhat different to those in the spring and long cycle crops which may be attributable to factors such as the appreciably shorter cropping period disease incidence fusarium oxysporum f sp and that unlike the other two crops this crop was not grafted the general tendency for n and p uptake concentration to steadily decline throughout the spring and long cycle crops was consistent with the trends reported in tomato for n uptake concentration by thompson et al 2013b and for n and p uptake concentration by voogt 1993 the different trend of the k uptake concentration in these two crops of firstly increasing and then decreasing maybe be associated with the importance of k nutrition for fruit development which becomes relatively more important later in the crop voogt 1993 whereas n and p are more strongly associated with preceding vegetative development the disproportionate effect of the difference between applied and uptake concentration of n on drainage n concentration was very similar to that reported by thompson et al 2013b similarly the results of the present study are very similar to those by thompson et al 2013b in that they strongly suggest that applying a n concentration slightly less than the uptake concentration appreciably reduces drainage n concentration while maintaining yield the results of the present study for n p and k are consistent with the general recommendation of sonneveld and voogt 2009 of applying nutrient concentrations equal to or slightly less than the uptake concentration the application of additional volume of nutrient solution as a drainage fraction ensures that the amounts of nutrients applied meet crop requirements even when the applied concentration is less than the uptake concentration nutrient uptake concentration can be simulated using simulation models as demonstrated by gallardo et al 2021 2009 modelled nutrient uptake concentration for substrate grown crops is an output of model based decision support systems dss gallardo et al 2021 for practical management simulated nutrient uptake concentration values from practical dsss can be compared to nutrient concentrations of nutrient solutions analyzed in situ on the farm using rapid analysis systems bonachela et al 2018 peña fleitas et al 2021 2022 thompson et al 2009 traditionally recommendations for the composition of applied nutrient solutions for vegetable crops grown in substrate have been based on applying concentrations that ensure maximum production mercado luna et al 2014 muñoz et al 2008 wamser et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 a consequence of this empirical approach is that the several thousand hectares of free draining substrate grown crops in greenhouses in the mediterranean region have disproportionately larger nutrient losses than soil grown crops peña fleitas et al 2013 thompson et al 2013a and are a major source of environmental contamination the two approaches examined in the current study of ratio based management and the use of uptake concentration provide methods that can appreciably reduce nutrient use their use can considerably reduce nutrient loss from free draining substrate grown crops whilst ensuring production currently only a very small proportion of substrate grown vegetable crops in the mediterranean region are collecting and recirculating drainage therefore approaches such as the two approaches assessed in the current work are very promising methods to appreciably reduce the substantial negative environmental impact of free draining substrate grown crops grown in mediterranean greenhouses in southern

8847,substrate grown crops represent approximately 10 of the cropping area of intensive greenhouse horticulture in southern spain the vast majority are free draining in that they do not collect and recirculate drainage the substantial nutrient loss in drainage contributes to contamination of water bodies this study examined the effectiveness of dynamic management approaches to appreciably reduce the large nutrient loss associated with free draining substrate grown crops for three tomato crops grown in substrate this study i compared management of n p and k based on the ratio of the concentration in drainage to that in the nutrient solution to conventional management ii derived uptake concentration values for n p and k throughout the crop cycle and iii evaluated uptake concentration as a nutrition management tool ratio based management reduced the amounts of n p and k in drainage in relation to conventional management by 58 61 65 80 and 55 77 respectively the amounts of applied n p and k were reduced by 22 28 37 43 and 28 34 compared to conventional management n p and k concentrations in the applied nutrient solution slightly below the uptake concentration were associated with much lower concentrations in the drainage solution in contrast when the applied nutrient concentration exceeded the uptake concentration this was associated with much higher drainage nutrient concentrations in conclusion the two nutritional management strategies examined ratio based management and use of uptake concentrations were both associated with reduced nutrient application and a considerable reduction of nutrient loss in drainage fruit production was maintained with the improved nutrient management practices these strategies offer approaches that can

thompson et al 2013a in free draining substrate cropping commonly 25 30 of the applied water is drained to prevent salt accumulation in the relatively inert root medium and to ensure uniform

draining substrate cropping in se spain its environmental impact and the unnecessary costs associated with the substantial nutrient loss of these free draining cropping systems management strategies and tools are required to reduce and optimize nutrient use while maintaining production one suggested approach to improve nutrient management in free draining substrate systems is the use of ratios of nutrient concentrations in drainage to those in the applied nutrient solution casas 1999 using recommended ratios can ensure sufficient supply of nutrients to optimize production while restricting the amounts lost in drainage recommended ratios of easily absorbed nutrients such as ammonium phosphates and potassium are for the concentrations in drainage to be 50 75 of that in the applied nutrient solution casas 1999 for nutrients that are more difficult to absorb such as bivalent ions e g calcium and magnesium recommended concentrations in drainage are 100 200 of that in the nutrient solution casas 1999 another suggested approach for optimizing nutrient use in free draining substrate cropping is the use of uptake concentration to formulate optimal nutrient concentrations in applied nutrient solutions sonneveld 2000 uptake concentration is calculated as the amount of a nutrient absorbed by a crop divided by the volume of water absorbed during the same time interval and is expressed in units of concentration van noordwijk 1990 uptake concentration is a theoretical concept with no physiological basis however it is considered to be a useful practical guide for the formulation of nutrient solutions for crops grown in soilless culture sonneveld 2000 2002 sonneveld and voogt 2001 thompson et al 2013b demonstrated that continually maintaining the n applied

evaluated the use of uptake concentration for n in the almeria greenhouse system there have been no studies in this system examining the use of uptake concentration of p and k more information is

thompson et al 2009 facilitates the adoption of the two approaches referred to above however before these approaches can be recommended to vegetable growers further assessment is required of their suitability and effectiveness for nutrient management of vegetable crops grown in free drainage substrate systems in mediterranean greenhouses considering that most substrate grown crops in the mediterranean region use free draining systems incrocci et al 2020 massa et al 2020 their high environmental impact and the difficulty of implementing closed substrate growing systems in this region

concentration values for n p and k throughout the crop cycle and c evaluate the use of uptake concentration as a tool for nutrition management of tomato crops grown in free draining substrate this work evaluated approaches that can be used for on farm management by vegetable growers and farm advisors using on farm rapid analysis systems to measure nutrient concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and cropping details three tomato crops solanum lycospersicum l were grown in a plastic greenhouse located at the research station of the cajamar foundation las palmerillas 2 43 w 36 48 n 155 m a s l in the province of almeria in se spain the crops were grown in a multi span greenhouse with polyethylene cover and passive ventilation the greenhouse area was 960 m2 40 m x 24 m with a cropping area of 840 m2 the three tomato crops were grown sequentially in the greenhouse an autumn winter crop was grown from 9 september 2020 1 february 2021 145 days hereafter referred to as the autumn crop a spring crop was grown from 17 january 2020 30 june 2021 133 days hereafter referred to as the spring crop a long cycle tomato crop was grown from 14 september 2021 17 may 2022 245 days hereafter referred to as the long cycle crop in the three tomato crops the cv realsol rijk zwaan de lier the netherlands was used it was grafted onto cv king kong rz rijk zwaan in the spring crop and cv multiflor bayer leverkusen germany for long cycle crop the autumn crop was not grafted cropping conditions and crop management were very similar to those in commercial greenhouses in this region the crops were grown in perlite in 37 l 110 cm long x 28 cm wide x 12 cm high bags the perlite was class a having a particle size ø of 0 6 mm drainage water was not re circulated the bottom of the substrate bags was slit open to enable drainage to the underlying soil crop density was 2 plants m 2 with 3 plants per bag 2 m between paired rows of perlite bags 0 5 m between plants within each row and 0 5 m between bags in the same paired row the rows of perlite bags were perpendicular to the central axis of the greenhouse there was a total of 40 rows of 21 m length seedlings grown in peat cubes were transplanted into the perlite bags before the inflorescence of the first truss was visible plants were vertically supported by nylon cord guides and were regularly pruned to remove all auxiliary shoots leaving only the main stem plants were topped removal of apex at 99 97 and 197 days after transplanting dat in the autumn spring and long cycle crops respectively topping was conducted when there were respectively 7 8 and 18 trusses per plant for the three crops the plastic cover of the greenhouse was white washed application of caco3 suspension from 0 to 20 dat in the autumn crop from 37 dat until the end of the crop in the spring crop and twice in the long cycle crop from 0 to 20 dat and from 154 dat until the end of the crop complete nutrient solutions table 1 were applied through a drip irrigation system 5 emitters per bag discharge rate of 2 l h 1 before adding nutrients the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity ec of 1 8 2 2 ds m 1 the nutrient solution was applied to maintain the required concentration for each nutrient in drainage to achieve the target ratio in the optimized treatment ot described in section 2 2 1 irrigation frequency was controlled by a demand tray system gallardo et al 2013 urrestarazu 2004b the demand tray was calibrated for the conventional treatment ct to maintain a similar electrical conductivity ec in drainage to that of treatment ot therefore the drainage fraction in treatment ct varied according to drainage ec this management was used to limit differences in root zone ec between treatments considering that ec can affect nutrient uptake magán 2004 2 2 treatments and experimental design 2 2 1 nutrition treatments in each of the three crops two different nutrition treatments were applied a conventional treatment ct based on local farming practice and an optimized treatment ot for the spring and long cycle crops the management of n p and k was optimized in treatment ot in the autumn crop the management of p and k but not n was optimized in treatment ot in treatment ct which was based on local farming practice the ratios of the concentrations of n p and k in drainage to those in the applied nutrient solution were generally slightly above or close to one in treatment ot for n and k the objective was to maintain the ratios of the concentration drainage nutrient solution in the range 0 50 0 75 as recommended by casas 1999 in situ measurement described subsequently of n as no3 and k was used to assist with the management of the ot treatments for the autumn and spring crops it was not possible to measure the p concentrations in situ consequently the basis of p management in the ot treatment was to reduce the applied p concentration by 50 with respect to treatment ct the in situ measurements were made directly in the collected samples of applied nutrient solution and drainage in both treatments in the three crops weekly measurements of the no3 and k concentrations in the applied nutrient solution and in drainage were made in situ in the greenhouse with separate laquatwin sensors horiba ltd kyoto japan nitrate was measured with model no3 11 laquatwin nitrate sensor and k with model k 11 laquatwin potassium sensor the accuracy of both sensors has been verified bonachela et al 2018 peña fleitas et al 2021 2022 these in situ measurements guided the management of n and k in treatment ot in the three crops additionally ec and ph in the applied nutrient solution were measured weekly ec with a laqua ec1100 conductivity meter model horiba ltd kyoto japan and ph with a laqua ph1500 ph meter horiba ltd kyoto japan the collection of the samples of nutrient solution and drainage is described in section 2 3 2 there were no in situ measurement of p concentration in the autumn and spring crops in the long cycle crop from 64 dat until the end of the crop the p concentration of the applied nutrient solution and drainage was measured weekly in situ using a pocket colorimeter model hi706 hanna instruments sursee switzerland 2 2 2 experimental design the lines of plants and substrate bags in the greenhouse were organized into 20 paired rows eight paired rows were used as borders three were on each side of the crop and two were within the crop the work reported here was conducted in four adjacent paired rows two of each treatment the allocation of treatments to these paired rows was randomized each row within a paired row was considered to be one replicate plot all measurements were made in each of four replicate plots that is in each row per treatment there was a border paired row alongside each side of this group of four paired rows another part of the crop was used for a separate study which involved destructive biomass sampling during the crop 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 volumes of water applied drainage and water uptake the volume of nutrient solution i e irrigation applied was measured using a water volume meter there was one water meter per treatment drainage was collected from four drainage trays 3 m long 0 4 m wide 0 1 m high one for each replication in each treatment in a 20 l container each drainage tray contained two perlite bags giving totals of six plants and 10 drippers per tray for each of the three crops at 8 00 every weekday before commencing irrigation for that day the total volume of nutrient solution i e irrigation applied in the preceding 24 h was measured by reading the water meter for each treatment the volume of drainage collected in each 20 l container for the preceding 24 h was measured with a graduated cylinder also at 8 00 every weekday the cumulative volumes of irrigation and drainage of friday saturday and sunday were measured the following monday at 8 00 the drainage fraction was calculated daily as the ratio of the total volumes of drainage and irrigation for a given day daily crop water uptake was determined as the difference between the daily volumes of applied nutrient solution and drainage 2 3 2 composition of applied nutrient solution and drainage two times per week nutrient concentrations were measured in situ in individual daily samples of nutrient solution and drainage using the rapid analysis systems described in section 2 2 1 these measurements were used to guide the on going dynamic nutrient management of the treatment ot in the three crops from the daily samples of nutrient solution and drainage representative composite samples were prepared for two weekly periods for the laboratory analysis described subsequently these composite samples were prepared by mixing representative sub samples of the daily weekend samples in relative proportions to their individual volumes for samples collected throughout the two week period in these two weekly composite samples the concentrations of anions no3 h2po4 2 and so4 2 were determined by ion chromatography model 850 professional ic cation methrom ag herisau switzerland and the concentrations of cations nh4 k ca2 mg2 by inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometry model icap 6500duo thermofisher scientific massachusetts usa average nutrient concentrations and ec and ph values of the nutrient solution and drainage for each treatment in each crop are presented in table 1 the nutrient concentration values determined by laboratory analysis on the two weekly samples were used for data analysis the values from the in situ analysis section 2 2 1 were used for guiding nutrient management 2 3 3 amounts of nutrients applied leached and taken up by the crops for each nutrient the amount applied was calculated every two weeks as the product of the measured concentration in the two weekly composite sample and the total volume of nutrient solution applied for the same two week period similarly the amount of nutrient drained in the same two week period for each replicate plot was the product of the concentration in the two weekly composite drainage sample and the total volume of drainage for the corresponding two week period the volumes and concentrations used for drainage were the means of the values from the four replicate plots for each treatment the cumulative amounts of nutrients applied and drained throughout a crop are the sequential sums of the amounts for two week periods crop uptake of a given nutrient was determined using a mass balance approach as the difference between the amounts applied and drained for each nutrient crop uptake was determined for the same two week periods as for the calculation of the amounts of applied and drained nutrients cumulative crop uptake was obtained by sequentially summing uptake for the two week periods these calculations of crop nutrient uptake using a mass balance calculation every two weeks assume there is no appreciable retention of nutrients in the perlite substrate during each two week period 2 3 4 calculation of nutrient uptake concentration for each nutrient the uptake concentration for each two week period was determined by dividing nutrient uptake by water uptake for the same two week period 2 3 5 fruit production and quality and total dry matter production total fruit production was the sum of red fruit collected in multiple harvests in the autumn spring and long cycle crops there were 6 9 and 22 separate harvests collected from the same nine plants in each replicate plot at each harvest fresh weight and fruit number of total and marketable production were determined average fresh weights of total and marketable fruit were calculated as the product of fruit weight between fruit number for each category of harvested fruit the parameters used to discriminate between marketable and non marketable fruit were blossom end rot blotchy ripening cracking immaturity non marketable size and pathogen damage fruit size was assessed for four categories large 67 mm medium 57 67 mm small 47 57 mm and very small 46 mm following the tomato fruit quality protocol of the cajamar cajamar 2014a the proportion of fruit by size was used as a quality parameter total soluble solids tss and titratable acidity were determined twice during the spring crop and three times during the long cycle crop on samples of juice extracted from samples of four red tomatoes per replicate plot the tss was determined using a digital refractometer model pal 1 atago tokyo japan as described by cajamar 2014b titratable acidity was determined by titration with 0 1 m naoh 0 1 using phenolphthalein as indicator with a mix of 50 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of extracted juice following the protocol of cajamar 2014b at the end of each crop four plants in each of the four drainage trays were removed for a final biomass sampling the removed material from each tray was divided into leaves stems and unharvest fruit and weighed dry matter dm content was determined by oven drying representative samples at 65 c for 48 h pruned material and harvested fruit were included in the final biomass determination all pruned material during each crop was collected from the same nine plants used for fruit production the dm content and amount of pruned material and harvested fruit were determined as for final biomass components the amount of dry matter in each component was the product of dm content and fresh weight total crop dry mater production was the sum of the amounts in final biomass and in accumulated harvested fruit and pruned material 2 4 climate climate parameters were continuously monitored within the greenhouse air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a ventilated psychrometer priva de lier the netherlands and solar radiation with a pyranometer model sp 110 apogee instruments logan usa the average values throughout the crops of daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures were similar for both the autumn and long cycle crops table 2 the average daily mean temperature for these two crops was 16 2 16 9 c in the spring crop average values for daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 2 0 3 9 c higher average values of the daily integral of solar radiation were also similar in autumn crop and long cycle crop being 6 1 6 4 mj m 2 d 1 table 2 that of the spring crop of 10 1 mj m 2 d 1 was substantially higher average daily mean vapor pressure deficit values were similar for the autumn and long cycle crops 0 73 0 76 kpa whereas the spring crop had a higher value 0 90 kpa 3 results 3 1 effects of ratio management on nutrient use and loss of n p k average values throughout each crop of the ratio of n p and k concentration in drainage to that in the applied nutrient solution were generally close to one for the ct treatments table 3 for p and k in the three crops and for n in the spring and long cycle crops this ratio for the ot treatments was appreciably less than in corresponding ct treatment table 3 generally for n p and k in the ot treatments the average ratio values were 0 51 0 79 average ratio values were similar for n for the two treatments in the autumn crop because a lower ratio was not applied to n management of the ot in this crop 3 2 amounts of water and nutrients applied and drained and taken up by crops where ratio management was used p and k in the three crops n in the spring and long cycle crops it resulted in appreciable reductions in the amounts of n p and k applied table 4 the amount of n applied was 22 28 less in the ot treatments in both the spring and long cycle crops where ratio management was used table 4 in the three crops ratio management in the ot treatment reduced p application by 37 43 and k application by 28 34 table 4 there were substantial reductions in the total amounts of drained nutrients where ratio management was used the reductions were 58 61 for n spring and long cycle crops 65 80 for p all crops and 57 77 for k all crops table 4 generally ratio management did not significantly affect crop nutrient uptake table 4 the amounts of n and k absorbed by the crop were not affected by ratio management treatment in any of the three crops only for p in the autumn and spring crops was there a reduction in the amount of crop nutrient uptake associated with ratio management in treatment ot generally the volumes of water applied and drained in the two treatments in each crop were similar table 4 the exception was the spring crop this was a consequence of adjusting water management to obtain similar ec in drainage to avoid ec induced differences in nutrient uptake 3 3 uptake concentrations of n p and k the uptake concentrations upc for n p and k generally were not constant during each of the three crops fig 1 also the general pattern for a given nutrient was not the same in each of the three crops in each of the three crops the values and patterns of upc for a given nutrient were generally similar in the ct and ot treatments fig 1 the upc of n was generally constant throughout the autumn crop for both the ct and ot treatments fig 1 the average values were 11 0 and 9 2 mmol l 1 for ct and ot treatments respectively table 5 in both the spring and long cycle crops there was a general tendency of a continual and shallow decline in n upc in both treatments fig 1 in both the spring and long cycle crops initial n upc values were approximately 15 mmol l 1 which declined steadily to approximately 7 and 5 mmol l 1 in the spring and long cycle crops respectively the p upc values of the autumn and spring crops were relatively constant throughout the duration of these crops but with appreciable fluctuation fig 1 in the long cycle crop there was a general tendency for p upc to steadily decline throughout the crop fig 1 initial values were approximately 1 7 mmol l 1 and final values were approximately 0 6 mmol l 1 the generally larger relative fluctuation of p upc compared to n upc and k upc is presumably attributable to the much lower numerator values of the ratio when calculating upc average p upc values for the ct and ot treatments were 1 1 1 5 mmol l 1 in the three crops table 5 phosphorus upc values were generally clearly less in the ot than ct treatments in the autumn and spring crops and were generally similar for the ct and ot treatments in the long cycle crop potassium upc values tended to be relatively constant with appreciable fluctuation in the autumn crop and to increase and then decrease in both the spring and long cycle crops fig 1 there were no consistent appreciable differences in k upc between the two treatments in the three crops the exception being 22 78 dat in the autumn crop fig 1 average values throughout the autumn crop were 6 3 and 5 4 mmol l 1 for ct and ot respectively table 5 in the spring crop initial k upc values were approximately 3 mmol l 1 for both treatments which then continually increased to values of 6 6 9 2 mmol l 1 until 63 dat and then declined to values that were generally 2 0 6 0 mmol l 1 in the latter part of the crop fig 1 in the long cycle crop initial k upc values were 5 8 mmol l 1 which increased rapidly to values of 9 0 mmol l 1 during the period 21 63 dat thereafter there was a general decline to values of 2 5 mmol l 1 at 189 dat fig 1 3 4 relationships between uptake applied and drainage concentration the average n of the applied nutrient solution for treatment ct throughout the three crops was 10 0 10 8 mmol l 1 table 5 for the corresponding ot treatments it was 8 1 8 9 mmol l 1 the reductions in the applied n being 18 19 for each crop average drainage n for the ct treatments for the autumn spring and long cycle crops were 8 6 11 2 and 10 3 mmol l 1 respectively table 5 average drainage n for the ot treatments for the autumn spring and long cycle crops were 6 6 6 3 and 5 8 mmol l 1 respectively table 5 for the autumn spring and long cycle crops the respective relative reductions in average drainage n for the ot compared to ct treatments were 23 43 and 44 where the applied n was similar to n upc the average drainage n was also similar to that of the applied n e g ct in spring and long cycle crops table 5 in contrast where the average applied n was clearly less than that of the n upc the resultant average drainage n was considerably less than the average applied n e g all ot treatments of the three crops and ct of the autumn crop table 5 this effect is clearly apparent in the much larger reductions in average drainage n concentration table 5 and the amounts of n drained table 4 with ot management in relation to ct management in the spring and long cycle crops compared to the autumn crop table 5 for the three crops for treatment ct average applied drainage and upc p were 1 5 1 7 1 6 2 0 and 1 2 1 5 mmol l 1 respectively table 5 in the ot treatments the corresponding average p values were 0 9 1 0 0 5 0 8 and 1 1 1 2 mmol l 1 table 5 the relative reductions in average drainage p for the ot compared to ct treatments were 53 70 the much lower drainage p of ot compared to ct in the three crops was associated with average applied p being less than average upc p whereas in ct the average applied p was larger than p upc table 5 for the three crops for treatment ct average applied drainage and upc k were 6 1 7 0 6 6 8 1 and 5 6 6 3 mmol l 1 table 5 in the ot treatments the corresponding average k values were 4 3 4 8 2 9 3 5 and 4 8 5 6 mmol l 1 table 5 the relative reductions in average drainage k for the ot compared to ct treatments were 48 59 the considerably lower average drainage k of ot compared to ct treatments in the three crops was associated with average applied k being less than average k upc whereas in ct treatments the average applied k was larger than k upc table 5 for n p and k in the three crops average drainage concentrations were much lower when the applied concentration was less than the upc compared to when the applied concentration exceeded the upc table 5 the very strong effect of the relationship between the applied nutrient concentration and the uptake concentration on the concentration of nutrients in drainage throughout a crop can be seen in fig 2 where data from the long cycle crop are presented for n in treatment ct the applied n concentration was similar to or greater than the n upc fig 2a and the consequent drainage n was similar to or higher than the applied n fig 2b in contrast in the ot treatment where the applied n was continually less than the n upc fig 2c the drainage n was continually appreciably less than the applied n fig 2d the drainage n in treatment ot was continually considerably less than in ct fig 2b and d in the ct treatment during the crop when the applied n exceeded n upc drainage n exceeded the applied n fig 2a and b conversely in treatment ct when the applied n was less than n upc the drainage n was less than applied n in treatment ot because the applied n was always less than n upc fig 2c drainage n was always less then applied n fig 2d very similar relationships were observed for p and k in the long cycle crop fig 2e l in the case of p in the ot treatment whenever applied p was inferior to p upc drainage p was very low fig 2 h and much lower than in the ct treatment fig 2 f similarly in the ot treatment low drainage k fig 2 l occurred when applied k was less than k upc fig 2k the drainage k in treatment ot fig 2 l was much lower throughout the crop than in treatment ct fig 2j similar relationships to those described above that occurred throughout the long cycle crop for n p and k were also observed throughout the autumn and spring crops data not presented the relationships between a nutrient concentration in drainage minus that of the applied nutrient solution and b nutrient concentration in the applied nutrient solution minus the upc for n p and k in treatments ct and ot throughout each of the three crops are shown in fig 3 these relationships demonstrate the strong and disproportionate effect on drainage concentrations of the relationship between the applied concentration and the uptake concentration in nearly all cases in fig 3 there were very strong linear relationships with r2 values of 0 81 0 99 and slopes that were appreciably larger than one fig 3 table 6 intercept values were consistently very close to zero fig 3 table 6 the exceptions to these relationships were for k in the autumn crop table 6 where r2 values were lower and where the slope was lower in treatment ct table 6 for n all r2 values were 0 90 slope values for treatment ct were 1 37 1 48 and for treatment ot were 1 96 2 22 table 6 for p r2 values were 0 81 0 97 slope values for treatment ct were 1 33 1 60 and for treatment ot were 1 33 3 38 table 6 for k except for the autumn crop r2 values were 0 93 0 98 and slope values were 1 26 2 73 table 6 these relationships indicate that the difference between applied and uptake concentrations generally had an amplified effect on drainage concentrations for n p and k however for each nutrient there were notable differences in slope between individual relationships fig 3 table 6 slope values differed between the two treatments in the same crop there were generally strong inverse relationships for n p and k between slope values fig 3 table 6 and the drainage fraction considering the two treatments in each crop fig 4 particularly for n and k the r2 values for the relationship of slope values from fig 3 to drainage fraction for n and k were 0 84 and 0 65 for p the r2 value was 0 41 fig 4 therefore the variation in slope values for a given nutrient reported in fig 3 and table 6 can be at least partly explained by differences in drainage fraction 3 5 yield fruit quality and dry matter production total and marketable yield for the ct and ot treatments were similar in each crop with no statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the two treatments table 7 similarly there were no statistically significant differences p 0 05 in fruit number and average fruit weight table 7 comparing total yields for the three crops they were 197 215 t ha 1 in the long cycle crop 114 117 t ha 1 in the spring crop and 41 43 t ha 1 in the autumn crop table 7 the differences in yield between the three crops were related to the length of the crops the prevailing climatic conditions table 2 and to the incidence of an infection of fusarium oxysporum f sp in the autumn crop which affected fruit production there were no statistically significant differences p 0 05 in total dry matter production dmp between the two treatments in each of the three crops table 7 dry matter production was approximately twice as high in the long cycle crop compared to the autumn and spring crops there were no significant difference in total soluble solids tss content between the two treatments in the spring and long cycle crops table 8 the tss for the spring crop was 5 0 brix and for long cycle crop was 4 5 brix titratable acidity in the spring crop was 0 31 0 32 and 0 33 0 37 in the long cycle crop table 8 there were significant differences between treatments in titratable acidity in the long cycle crop tss and titratable acidity were not measured in the autumn crop the relative distribution of fruit sizes were similar in both treatments in the autumn crop table 8 there were higher percentages of medium sized fruit in the ct than ot treatment in the spring and long cycle crops the respective values for ct and ot treatments were 43 6 and 35 3 in the spring crop and 26 0 and 22 3 in the long cycle crop 4 discussion reducing the ratio of the concentrations of n p and k in drainage to those applied in the nutrient solution reduced the amounts of n p and k that were applied it also substantially reduced the amounts drained without affecting fruit yield or quality or nutrient uptake additionally the derivation of upc values indicated the potential for using upc values to guide nutrient management the relationships between uptake concentration and the applied concentrations of n p and k were strongly related to the drainage concentration and therefore to the amounts drained the analysis of upc data indicated that maintaining applied nutrient concentrations slightly below uptake concentrations maintained fruit production and quality while considerably reducing nutrient loss in drainage both approaches ratios and uptake concentration are promising options for practical on farm management to appreciably improve nutrient management of free draining substrate grown crops thereby reducing nutrient application and substantially reducing nutrient loss while there are observations and recommendations of ratios of drainage to applied nutrient concentrations baixauli soria and aguilar olivert 2002 casas 1999 we are unaware of published studies evaluating this approach the results of the present study demonstrate that it is an effective approach to appreciably improve nutrient management of free draining substrate grown tomato crops the availability of reliable and relatively inexpensive systems for rapid on farm analysis of n and k concentrations in applied and drainage solutions bonachela et al 2018 peña fleitas et al 2021 2022 thompson et al 2009 enable frequent in situ measurement for the practical application of this approach in commercial farms systems are available for rapid on farm measurement of p concentration however as yet they have not been verified in published scientific studies with on farm analysis the ratio approach can be readily adopted in commercial production using suggested ratio values casas 1999 at a practical management level ratio management has to be combined with ec management and drainage fraction management to respectively avoid detrimental salinity effects on crops and to reduce spatial variability of nutrients within substrate further research work is suggested to further verify optimize ratio values for tomato and to develop values for other species uptake concentrations of n p and k were generally similar in both treatments in each crop in the spring and long cycle crops the patterns and ranges of uptake concentration were generally similar for each of n p and k the patterns upc in the autumn crop were somewhat different to those in the spring and long cycle crops which may be attributable to factors such as the appreciably shorter cropping period disease incidence fusarium oxysporum f sp and that unlike the other two crops this crop was not grafted the general tendency for n and p uptake concentration to steadily decline throughout the spring and long cycle crops was consistent with the trends reported in tomato for n uptake concentration by thompson et al 2013b and for n and p uptake concentration by voogt 1993 the different trend of the k uptake concentration in these two crops of firstly increasing and then decreasing maybe be associated with the importance of k nutrition for fruit development which becomes relatively more important later in the crop voogt 1993 whereas n and p are more strongly associated with preceding vegetative development the disproportionate effect of the difference between applied and uptake concentration of n on drainage n concentration was very similar to that reported by thompson et al 2013b similarly the results of the present study are very similar to those by thompson et al 2013b in that they strongly suggest that applying a n concentration slightly less than the uptake concentration appreciably reduces drainage n concentration while maintaining yield the results of the present study for n p and k are consistent with the general recommendation of sonneveld and voogt 2009 of applying nutrient concentrations equal to or slightly less than the uptake concentration the application of additional volume of nutrient solution as a drainage fraction ensures that the amounts of nutrients applied meet crop requirements even when the applied concentration is less than the uptake concentration nutrient uptake concentration can be simulated using simulation models as demonstrated by gallardo et al 2021 2009 modelled nutrient uptake concentration for substrate grown crops is an output of model based decision support systems dss gallardo et al 2021 for practical management simulated nutrient uptake concentration values from practical dsss can be compared to nutrient concentrations of nutrient solutions analyzed in situ on the farm using rapid analysis systems bonachela et al 2018 peña fleitas et al 2021 2022 thompson et al 2009 traditionally recommendations for the composition of applied nutrient solutions for vegetable crops grown in substrate have been based on applying concentrations that ensure maximum production mercado luna et al 2014 muñoz et al 2008 wamser et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 a consequence of this empirical approach is that the several thousand hectares of free draining substrate grown crops in greenhouses in the mediterranean region have disproportionately larger nutrient losses than soil grown crops peña fleitas et al 2013 thompson et al 2013a and are a major source of environmental contamination the two approaches examined in the current study of ratio based management and the use of uptake concentration provide methods that can appreciably reduce nutrient use their use can considerably reduce nutrient loss from free draining substrate grown crops whilst ensuring production currently only a very small proportion of substrate grown vegetable crops in the mediterranean region are collecting and recirculating drainage therefore approaches such as the two approaches assessed in the current work are very promising methods to appreciably reduce the substantial negative environmental impact of free draining substrate grown crops grown in mediterranean greenhouses in southern

8848,irrigation accounts for the largest consumptive water use in the united states us representing 62 of the total water consumption water supply managers and government agencies use user reported water withdrawal data for developing water management programs however many users underreport or are not in compliance with the water withdrawal reporting regulations of the state the regulations in many states also exempt users from reporting irrigation water withdrawals under a specific amount such irregularities in non reported but consumptive agricultural withdrawals result in the underestimation of water use and considerable uncertainty about the impacts of irrigation withdrawals on water supply therefore this study presents a methodology for estimation of non reported agricultural withdrawals at the county level to understand their potential effects on water supply and enhance management of agricultural water resources this study developed a data based method using usda census irrigation data usda irrigation and water management survey iwms and gridded meteorological data to develop estimates of irrigation water withdrawals from 2002 to 2017 additionally user reported withdrawal data was used to validate estimates and quantify the volume of unreported water use for small below the withdrawal reporting threshold and large farms at county level it was observed that small and large farm unreported withdrawals averaged 13 and 110 of reported withdrawals respectively notably 86 of counties in virginia with irrigation have collective small farm withdrawals of sufficient magnitude that would be subject to reporting requirements if they were from a single user small farm unreported withdrawals were consistent through time and large farm unreported withdrawals decreased between 2002 and 2017 due to lower irrigation demand and higher reporting this approach provides a practical method that can be adopted by water supply managers to better account for agricultural water use in humid climates where supplemental irrigation is not fully captured in existing permitting and reporting regulations keywords irrigation water withdrawals

withdrawals from surface water sources maupin 2018 irrigation also represented 62 of the total water consumption water not returned to the source after being withdrawn the highest consumption among all water use sectors in 2015 dieter et al 2018a 2018b even in areas where irrigation is a small percentage of water withdrawals it is likely to account for a higher percentage of water consumption for example in pennsylvania agricultural withdrawals makeup 0 4 of total withdrawals but account for 10 of the state s water consumed abdalla and blunk 2007 supplemental irrigation application in humid areas is likely to increase among the farmers to increase the food production to keep up with the increased demand by the projected population and cope with climate change over the past decade irrigation water use saw an increase for all states east of the mississippi river walton 2014 generally water demands are highest during dry periods when surface water supplies are stressed due to the higher consumption factor involved in irrigation even moderate volumes of irrigation can significantly impact the water supply especially during low flows and in localized areas for example in virginia va irrigation water withdrawals account for roughly 1 6 of the non energy withdrawals statewide but within individual counties irrigation sometimes accounts for more than 50 of total withdrawals additionally irrigation withdrawals show a more robust relationship for higher withdrawals in warmer years specially during the summer months crop growing period shortridge and dicarlo 2020 this combined with the high consumptive rate of irrigation means that withdrawals of irrigation water can have an outsize influence on water supplies particularly at local scale during dry periods sangha et al 2020a acknowledging future demand growth and climate change understanding these withdrawals is essential for water security in the region however water consumption is poorly quantified because of its limitations in data availability and the inherent challenges in measuring water consumption a key challenge in quantifying and understanding irrigation withdrawals is the limited data available on them particularly in eastern states with a history of riparian water rights many water users may withdrawal water without obtaining approval from water managers or reporting their water use for instance the virginia department of environmental quality vdeq under virginia water withdrawal regulation vwwr requires reporting of withdrawals over a million gallons in any month for crop irrigation i e irrigating 37 acres at a depth of one inch or irrigating for over 65 h with a 56 m3 per hour 250 gpm pump vdeq 2015 this means that irrigation users below this amount are not required to report their water use similar non reporting provisions exist in other states including indiana michigan south carolina below 11 356 230 m3 3 million gallons for 30 days north carolina below 37 8 m3 10 000 gallons in a day barnette et al 2020 kelley 2019 ncwater 2014 furthermore even in situations where water withdrawal reporting is required users may not always be in compliance with these reporting regulations for example in michigan an estimated 20 30 of withdrawals are not reported in accordance with the reporting regulations wuac 2014 these irregularities in non reported but consumptive agricultural withdrawals result in the underestimation of water use and considerable uncertainty about the impacts of irrigation withdrawals because these withdrawals aren t included in water supply planning purposes they can also potentially impact other permitted users lead to water shortages and negatively impact stream ecology in the absence of reported irrigation withdrawal data research has often aimed to leverage remote sensing to quantify irrigation water use e g foster et al 2020a tetteh et al 2021 2020 for instance the usgs calculated national water consumption using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model leveraging satellite based data for evapotranspiration et estimates to calculate irrigation consumption dieter et al 2018a 2018b senay et al 2013 other studies have used hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat soil and water balance models such as dssat cropwat and fao 56 methods for estimation of irrigation requirements at field and watershed scale sangha et al 2020b kannan et al 2019b schwaller et al 2021 thorp et al 2017 however these studies estimated the irrigated water use based on metrological analysis which is highly dependent on assumptions such as crop coefficients and individual field irrigation scheduling decisions calculating crop water use based on remotely sensed et products is challenging in regions with a large number of small farms and higher diversity in agriculture sishodia et al 2020 this is the case in virginia which includes irrigated row crops vegetables and nursery production and a large percentage of small farms relative to other states the accuracy and reliability of satellite based approaches to monitoring irrigation water use is also a challenge in humid regions particularly at the scales relevant to agricultural water management policy xie et al 2019 zurqani et al 2021 thus additional research is needed to characterize agricultural water use in humid regions where irrigation withdrawals may go unreported and are not well characterized by existing data sources and remote sensing methods this study presents a methodology for estimating non reported agricultural withdrawals at the county level to understand potential impacts on water supply and enhance agricultural water management in addition to metrological data this study leverages data from the usda census of agriculture and irrigation and water management survey iwms both of which are available at five year increments these data are used to quantify the percentage of irrigation subject to reporting requirements in each county and estimate the volume of irrigation withdrawals that go unreported meteorological data is then used to develop county level time series of irrigation withdrawals from 2002 to 2017 we apply this method in virginia and use vdeq reported withdrawal data to quantify non reported agricultural withdrawals and provide a contextual validation of trends in non reported withdrawals for our estimates 2 methods the methodology and equations used to generate estimates and time series of unreported irrigation withdrawals is summarized in fig 1 and table 1 this study used data from two key publicly available data sources the usda census of agriculture usda ca and usda irrigation and water management survey usda iwms to estimate irrigation withdrawals at county level in the region because this data is publicly available for the entire u s this approach can be replicated in other regions and for newer versions of these datasets once they are available these county level withdrawals were disaggregated into small and large farm withdrawals to estimate the relative proportion of irrigation associated with small farms who are likely below withdrawal reporting thresholds the irrigation withdrawal estimates derived from usda data were verified through comparison with vdeq farmer reported withdrawals and used to estimate the fraction of unreported water withdrawals in each county finally a time series of unreported water withdrawals was generated for all years between 2002 and 2017 to characterize interannual variability in irrigation withdrawals 2 1 data sources data from the usda ca provide uniform and comprehensive data on u s farms and ranches every five years 2002 2007 2012 and 2017 usda 2019a table 2 the usda defines a farm for the census as any place that produces and sells agricultural products worth at least 1000 during the census year usda ca is a large and comprehensive dataset that includes sectors crops demographics and economics commodities agricultural land crop types and market value of agricultural products sold operating arrangements and various management practices usda 2019a depending on the type of data it is classified according to farm size county state watershed agricultural district and american indian reservation in this study irrigated acreage and the number of operations were obtained at the county level from the usda ca an example of such dataset in one county of virginia va is shown in table 4 the data for irrigated acreage and the number of operations in a county are also broken down into farm size classes table 4 this data was downloaded using usdarnass package in r dinterman and eyer 2019 to protect the confidentiality of the data respondents usda ca withholds data that could allow for identification of an individual farm thus irrigated acreage size class data that could enable an accurate estimate of irrigated area on a single farm is coded with the letter d table 3 however the number of irrigated operations for such farm size classes is not considered confidential and has been reported in the usda ca usda 2019a the usda iwms data formerly known as the farm and ranch irrigation survey provide data for on farm irrigation activities to supplement the basic irrigation data collected from the usda ca these data were available for the years following the usda ca 2003 2008 2013 and 2018 usda 2019b table 2 usda iwms data are used for a wide variety of water related local programs to compare water use by application methods and to develop improved technologies economic models legislative initiatives and feasibility studies usda 2019b in this study the state level average irrigation amount was obtained for each survey year to estimate the seasonal crop water demand cwd one limitation of usda iwms data is that it is available only at the state level table 2 furthermore the usda iwms is a follow up to the usda ca and is based on surveying a sample of all farmers who have indicated in the agricultural census that they use irrigation on their farms usda 2019b thus response rates and coverage in the usda iwms is typically lower than in the usda ca irrigated volume estimates derived from the usda ca and usda iwms were compared with irrigation withdrawals reported to the virginia department of environmental quality to provide a context in terms of the scale timing and geographic distribution of these withdrawals the virginia va water withdrawal reporting regulation requires reporting annual surface water and groundwater withdrawals to vdeq by january 31 each year vdeq 2021 all withdrawals greater than one million gallons or more of surface water and or groundwater in a single month used for crop irrigation must be reported to vdeq vdeq 2016 this data is used by vdeq to prepare and plan water management programs for the state vdeq 2021 this dataset contained monthly reported withdrawals at the facility level which were aggregated to the county level for analysis irrigation withdrawals were downloaded from vahydro database maintained by vdeq for each year from 2002 to 2017 table 2 this data is certainly an underestimate of crop water use in the state due to exemptions from reporting for users below the reporting threshold as well as larger farms that are not in compliance with reporting requirements an initial comparison of vdeq irrigation withdrawals with usda ca irrigated area indicated that in 2017 a total of 94 counties in virginia had irrigation present according to usda records but only 37 of these counties had irrigation reported to vdeq fig 2 additionally 2 counties had irrigation reported to vdeq but not to usda thus it is apparent that neither the vdeq nor usda records are a complete picture of all irrigation occurring in the state nevertheless the use of both data sources in conjunction can provide a more accurate accounting of irrigation withdrawals than either source in isolation in addition to water withdrawal data meteorological data for precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism datasets at daily time step for each year from 2002 to 2017 prism 2022 the usda ca and usda iwms data doesn t contain information on precise geographical location of the farms and existence of a weather station near each farm is unlikely additionally prism datasets are also the official spatial climate data sets of usda the prism data is available at 4 by 4 km grid and was spatially aggregated to the county level in va for each digital elevation model dem grid cell prism uses climate elevation regression and weather stations entering the regression are allocated weights based on the physiographic resemblance of the station to the grid cell it also considers the location height proximity to the coast topographic facet orientation vertical atmospheric layer topographic position and orographic effectiveness of the terrain daly et al 2008 2 2 unreported withdrawal coefficients 2 2 1 usda ca data processing because the usda ca reports county level irrigated acreage for farms across different size classifications this data can be used to estimate the prevalence and magnitude of irrigation on small farms that are not included in reporting regulations however a key challenge in using usda ca size classification data is the frequency with which records are withheld to protect grower privacy for instance across our dataset in virginia a total of 1479 observations 59 of all observations of county level irrigated area within a given size classification were withheld the withheld data in usda ca is essential for water supply planning at the user or sector level marston et al 2022 therefore an estimated value of irrigated acres was assigned to such size classes in each county based on the following procedure the example of the process is detailed for shenandoah county in table 3 first for each county i and each size class j the percentage of total farm area under irrigation ip sc ij was calculated by dividing the irrigated acres in each size class ia sc ji by the number of farms in that size class f sc ji this estimate of average irrigated area per farm in each size class was then divided by the average total farm size of that size class a fa j this value represents for each size classification present in that county the average irrigated area as a percentage of total farm size table 4 1 ip scj ij i 1 n i a sc j f sc j a fa j the statewide mean irrigated percentage ip sc j was then calculated for each size class across all i counties with data reported for that size class this value represents on average the percentage of farm area under irrigation for each size class table 4 in the majority 83 of size classes irrigated percentages were relatively consistent ranging from 7 to 12 of total farm size 2 ip sc j 1 i i 1 i ip sc ji the withheld acreage ia w i for each county is calculated using the difference between the reported county level irrigated acreage and sum of size class acreage 3 ia w i ia c i j 1 j ia sc ij the estimated irrigated acreage in size classes with withheld data ia sc ji was calculated by multiplying the statewide average irrigated percentage for that size class ip sc j by the average farm size and number of farms in that size class and county and then rescaling these values so that the sum of all withheld size classes equaled the total withheld acreage ia w i 4 ia sc ij ip sc j a fa j f sc ji ia w i j 1 j i p sc j a fa j f sc ji 2 2 2 classification of small and large farms the estimates of unreported small farm sf and large farm lf withdrawals were developed in each county for usda ca years 2002 2007 2012 2017 the va water withdrawal reporting regulations require any user to report a monthly withdrawal of more than one million gallons in any month from non tidal waters for crop irrigation to vdeq vdeq 2021 a million gallons is equivalent to approximately 36 8 acres inches of water or one inch 25 4 mm of water applied to 9 2 acres of field per week of a month therefore we assume that farms irrigating below 10 acres per operation were considered as sf whereas the farms irrigating above 10 acres per operation were considered as lf thus the identification of sf and lf is based on irrigated area not total farm area irrigated area per iapf operation for each county and each size class was calculated as 5 iapf ij ia sc ij f sc ij sf acreage in county i is calculated as sum of acreage of all size classes in that county wherewith iapf less than 10 6 ia sm i j 1 j ia sc j for all j where iapf ij 10 2 2 3 unreported irrigated volume for census years after calculating the irrigated acreage in each county associated with small and large farms these estimates of irrigated area had to be converted to an estimate of irrigation volume this presents a key challenge because irrigation decisions at the farm level are influenced by numerous factors including the crop grown soil type meteorological conditions the irrigation system in use and water availability usda ca provides some data on the irrigated area associated with different crops but these estimates only cover a small percentage of the irrigated area in each county in this study we used a general approach to estimating irrigation volumes across a broad area that includes a diverse range of production systems based on precipitation p and irrigation depth obtained from prism and usda iwms data respectively daily rainfall raster data from prism were extracted and spatially averaged across each va county to create a time series of county level daily precipitation precipitation for each day was then converted to effective precipitation p eff d p eff d is calculated from months of june to august and assumes any rainfall above 38 1 mm 1 5 in in 48 h is lost as runoff and doesn t contribute to meeting cwd while irrigation can occur outside of the months of june to august vdeq records indicate that on average 75 of irrigation occurs in june july or august to avoid the confounding impact of heavy rainfall during the early or late growing season when crop water demands are lower s peff was calculated by summing the daily values between june and august 7 p eff d p d if p d p d 1 38 1 mm 8 p eff d 38 1 if p d p d 1 38 1 mm 9 s peff d 1 d p eff d d total days from june 1 to august 31 a statewide s peff value was calculated as the spatial average across all counties weighted by spatial area table 5error reference source not found for the years in usda iwms data seasonal cwd was calculated as sum of s peff and irrigation reported in iwms survey data irr survey cwd varied from 535 94 mm to 436 88 mm 21 1 17 2 in table 5 therefore cwd of 508 mm 20 in was assumed for all irrigated areas for each census year irrigation demand id for each individual county i is calculated using county specific effective rainfall data s peff i 10 id i 508 s peff i the volume of unreported irrigation on small farms is calculated as 11 v sm i ia sm i id i the large farm irrigation volume is calculated as 12 v irr lg i ia c i id i the large farm unreported withdrawals are calculated as the difference between large farm irrigation volume and irrigation withdrawals reported to vdeq 13 v lg i v irr lg i v rep i v sm i 2 3 time series of withdrawals unreported withdrawal estimates for the census years were used to obtain a monthly sequence of unreported withdrawals for each year from 2002 to 2017 the main assumption for generating a time series is that the rainfall deficit is the primary driver of irrigation water withdrawal id was calculated based on the effective precipitation for each county and year between 2002 and 2017 the sf acreage under the reporting threshold for each county was assumed to be the median ia sm i from each census year and the lf acreage was the median total acreage ia c i a limitation with the use of a constant value for irrigated acreage in each county through time is that it cannot account for long term trends in irrigated area through the expansion or removal of irrigation however an analysis of irrigated acreage reported in each county for usda ca years found that very few counties exhibited a monotonic trend of increasing or decreasing irrigation unreported withdrawals were then calculated using a procedure similar for census years 3 results 3 1 unreported withdrawals census years a statewide summary of withdrawal estimates is shown in table 6 irrigation withdrawals decreased between 2002 and 2017 driven by a combination of lower irrigated acreage and lower cwd in 2012 and 2017 however vdeq reported withdrawals remained relatively consistent over this period table 6 sf unreported withdrawals ranged from 12 to 22 of the vdeq reported withdrawals between the 2002 and 2017 census years while lf unreported ranged between 76 and 200 of vdeq reported withdrawals however these statewide totals mask considerable geographic variability fig 3 presents county level estimates of sf withdrawals across all four census years in counties where small farm withdrawals were present these volumes ranged from 1135 to 377 591 m3 0 30 99 76 mg per year to put these quantities in context this ranges from 0 0015 to 164 of reported irrigation withdrawals in counties with vdeq reported data as the threshold for reporting is withdrawals greater than 1 million gallons in any month 86 of counties have a seasonal cumulative volume of small farm withdrawals that would likely meet reporting thresholds if the volume were from a single user spatial patterns of sf withdrawal volume were relatively consistent from year to year with the highest sf withdrawals in the shenandoah and southside regions of the state fig 4 shows unreported lf withdrawals for county census years lf withdrawals were more than double vdeq reported withdrawals in 2002 due to higher irrigated acreage and lower vdeq reported withdrawals and reduced to 92 of vdeq reported withdrawals in 2017 with lower irrigation demand table 6 spatially lf unreported withdrawals existed in similar regions as sf unreported withdrawals with additional counties in the eastern parts of the state fig 4 however lf unreported withdrawals were substantially higher than sf unreported lf unreported withdrawals ranged from 1060 m3 0 28 mg per year to 8573 549 m3 2266 mg per year the lf unreported amounts ranged from 0 024 to 959 of the vdeq reported withdrawals in counties where vdeq reported withdrawals were available conversely there also existed some counties with no lf unreported withdrawals as the irrigation demand was accounted in sf unreported or the irrigation demand was less than irrigation 3 2 time series of unreported withdrawals fig 5 shows a time series of statewide total annual sf lf unreported and vdeq reported withdrawals from 2002 through 2017 year to year variability was consistent between estimated unreported withdrawals and vdeq reported withdrawals vdeq reported withdrawals and estimated unreported volumes both dropped in 2003 2004 and 2013 even though lf unreported withdrawals are calculated using precipitation deficit time series trends for lf unreported withdrawals capture the reporting trends of vdeq irrigation withdrawals fig 5 the sf unreported withdrawals vary between 8 and 19 of the vdeq reported withdrawals between 2002 and 2017 fig 5 the lf unreported varied substantially over the years ranging from 76 to 200 of vdeq reported withdrawals with an average of 110 of vdeq reported withdrawals at the county level lf the highest volumes of unreported withdrawals primarily stemmed from the total irrigated acreage of the county and lower vdeq reported irrigation withdrawals on the other end lower lf unreported withdrawals were attributed to multiple reasons lf unreported withdrawals were zero in some counties with large irrigated areas due to high vdeq reported withdrawals additionally lower lf unreported withdrawals were observed in counties with less irrigated acreage indicating lower number of lfs to further investigate the spatial variability in time series of unreported withdrawals we selected three counties that encompassed a range of irrigated acreage northampton county is located on virginia s eastern shore a region with some of the highest rates of irrigation in the state 7810 median irrigated acreage sm estimates were significantly lower than lf and vdeq reported estimates in this county due to the prevalence of large irrigated farms shenandoah county is in virginia s shenandoah valley a region with expansive and relatively high value agriculture where irrigation is becoming more prevalent 824 median irrigated acreage powhatan county is located in central virginia in greater richmond metropolitan area 81 median irrigated acreage in shenandoah and powhatan counties small farm withdrawals were a larger portion of total withdrawals due to a high percentage of farms that appear to be below the vdeq reporting threshold county level temporal patterns demonstrate how unreported withdrawal estimates are influenced by a both vdeq reported withdrawal and precipitation variability in northampton county the 2002 unreported withdrawals are due to high irrigation demand combined with relatively low reported withdrawal volume fig 6 however the peak in 2010 unreported withdrawals is due to a temporary decline in vdeq reported irrigation withdrawals combined with a relatively high irrigation demand on the other hand the lower unreported withdrawal of 2003 and 2004 is due to high precipitation and 2011 decline in unreported withdrawals due to high reported vdeq withdrawals unreported withdrawals are consistent in shenandoah due to relatively consistent vdeq reported withdrawals fig 6 the one exception to this is in 2010 and 2011 when reported irrigation withdrawals increased dramatically without a commiserate increase in large farm withdrawals in shenandoah 2010 and 2011 were the two driest years resulting in high irrigation demand this was reflected in vdeq reported withdrawals which were 263 and 230 higher than the long term mean reported withdrawal in 2010 and 2011 respectively however irrigation demand in 2010 and 2011was only 48 and 28 higher than the long term average resulting in a decline in unreported lf withdrawals this points to potential limitations in our estimation process for id which will not capture short term dry periods if they do not influence total effective precipitation at the seasonal scale in the lower irrigated acreage powhatan county volume of unreported withdrawals was lower than other two counties in certain years 2008 2014 high unreported withdrawals appear driven by strong declines in reported withdrawals further demonstrating the degree to which unreported withdrawal estimates are influenced by variability in both irrigation demand and reported withdrawals to verify consistency between spatial and temporal patterns estimated irrigation withdrawals the unreported irrigation withdrawal in each county and year were compared with vdeq reported withdrawals in the subset of counties where reported withdrawals were available overall it was observed that unreported withdrawals generally corresponded to vdeq reported withdrawals fig 7 unreported withdrawals increased in counties with higher vdeq reported withdrawals indicating that farms underreported their use however in a few counties there was a substantial difference between vdeq reported withdrawals and estimated irrigation withdrawals this was because of the very low vdeq reported withdrawals in these counties interestingly in a few counties vdeq reported withdrawals were higher than estimated irrigation withdrawals fig 7 this was generally observed during years of low id in the county this also indicates that crops with an id higher than 508 mm 20 in might be grown in the area 4 discussion this study presents a new approach for calculating irrigation water withdrawals using publicly available data sources in humid regions where supplemental irrigation is underreported irrigation water withdrawals were then compared with user reported withdrawals in the va to generate unreported irrigation water withdrawals at the county level many previous studies have used remote sensing to monitor irrigation water use through estimates of irrigated acreage and irrigation demand brocca et al 2018 deines et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c however the efficiency of such data at a regional scale with diverse landscapes remains a challenge because of the coarse resolution gaps in image acquisition uncertainties in the key inputs of energy balance models and choice of algorithms and models for calculating et biggs et al 2016 fan et al 2022 fisher et al 2008 foster et al 2020 senay et al 2016 zhang et al 2022a recent studies argue that simpler models using irrigated withdrawals as function of irrigated areas may result in more robust method of irrigated withdrawals estimation puy et al 2021 there exists a potential for the simplification of methods to calculate irrigation water withdrawals especially for larger scales puy et al 2021 thompson and smith 2019 therefore this study developed survey based irrigated acreage method to obtain irrigated water withdrawals our results indicate that a simple method based on publicly reported data results in reasonable estimates of unreported irrigation withdrawals that are consistent with the spatial and temporal patterns exhibited in reported data usda ca contains results accumulated from bottom up primary surveys of water users led by national and state entities statistical and census agencies these primary surveys and observations are the foundation of water use data this data collection process is more time consuming and expensive than modeled estimates of water usage but is generally considered a more accurate primary observations of water use ruddell 2018 however the irrigated acreage from usda ca used in this study to calculate the irrigation withdrawals is not error free studies suggest the irrigated withdrawals using usda ca could potentially be an underestimation for instance dickens et al 2011 found that irrigation acreage in usda ca was lower than usgs water use compilations it is important to emphasize that precipitation patterns and irrigated acreage of a county influence the outcomes of the proposed approach of calculating irrigation water use conceptually irrigation and precipitation are negatively correlated however many other meteorological parameters such as temperature influence irrigation demand which are not accounted for in the irrigation demand the relationship between evaporative demand and irrigation application is more complex nie et al 2021 additionally the calculation of p eff d is governed by the soil type while the soil water holding capacity was considered constant in this study it would vary in practice regions with fine textured soils would result in higher surface runoff under same precipitation and initial conditions than sandy soils thus reducing the effective precipitation thus more spatially and temporally refined representation of soil and meteorological conditions would likely be a valuable area for additional research the decline in irrigated acreage observed in our study could result from a number of meteorological and economic factors it was found that the proportion of irrigated corn acreage relative to rainfed acreage has declined in the eastern us because growing season precipitation is found to be adequate under normal rainfall conditions hrozencik 2021 however crop specific trends may be counteracted by broader trends in agricultural production such as incentive programs that encourage the production of high value specialty crops that are often more water sensitive majsztrik et al 2019 trends in irrigation will also interact with trends in agricultural land use more broadly for example small to medium sized farms in va were reported to have financial difficulties due to lack of flexibility in responding to changing commodity and consumer markets leading to the conversion of 104 000 acres of farmland to other land use between 2002 and 2007 bendfeldt 2012 overall variability in precipitation availability of irrigation water and financial goals and status together may impact producers decisions at the farm level in general a 38 reduction in irrigating farms was observed between 2002 and 2017 in va however the number of irrigating small farms 1 9 acres increased between the same time period this indicates more small farms added to va s agriculture therefore studies like these are essential to develop the estimates of water use at such farms because regulations in va require reporting of irrigation withdrawals above a certain volume this provided an opportunity to contextualize our irrigation withdrawal estimates and quantify the volume of unreported withdrawals at county level in va most states in the mid atlantic region of the us have similar reporting requirements that require reporting irrigation water withdrawals above a certain threshold allowing for replication of our approach however none of these states require metering of irrigation water current estimates of reported irrigation withdrawals are generally based on pumping rates and runtimes user reported data may include errors and inconsistencies that have been noted in other research dunham et al 2022 mccarthy et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 while the vdeq screens data to remove duplicate and leads outreach efforts to involve all users the user reported data used to calculate unreported withdrawals impacts the interpretation of unreported withdrawals trends in vdeq reported data are highly influenced by the availability of resources and staff for outreach to increase participation in such programs in a particular year these trends may also be influenced by changes in the rate of reporting farms through time our methodology and findings can help support practical management of water used for supplemental irrigation in humid climates in several ways this approach provides a necessary framework for estimation of irrigation withdrawals in regions with diverse agriculture small farms and regions with hard to distinguish between irrigated and non irrigated fields the use of reported withdrawal data to develop irrigation water management plans and permits may lack the holistic view due to incomplete reporting and therefore missing an important opportunity to reduce water stress and conflicts one of the key benefits of this study was its ability to isolate withdrawals below and above the reporting threshold existing water management and planning efforts typically rely on reported withdrawals from individual users above the reporting threshold however many small users existing in one location may have a substantial cumulative withdrawal in the region particularly as irrigation withdrawals may occur at the same time due to meteorological conditions our results found that 86 of the sf withdrawals would have been reported if withdrawn by a single user indicating a large cumulative volume bringing all individual small users under permit would likely be a challenge for permitting authorities and subject to push back from users our proposed methodology can assist in filling this gap by providing estimates of water use that is not captured by existing reporting requirements additionally our results suggest that even when reporting requirements are in place significant quantities of withdrawn water are likely unaccounted for in reported water use data exclusion of these withdrawals in water management efforts would likely lead to overestimates of available water supply creating a risk of shortages and conflict the spatial analysis of unreported withdrawals allows the water management planners to identify the counties with higher unreported irrigation withdrawals which could be reflected in water allocation and optimization models while the exact quantity of unreported withdrawal will be uncertain these withdrawal quantities should at the very least be estimated to provide a scope of the potential agricultural water supply risks stemming from unreported irrigation this work presents an initial step in characterizing supplemental irrigation withdrawals using usda census data and presents several areas for additional research our methodology of evaluating irrigation water withdrawals is transferrable to other locations but would require validation for other states within different climates soil types crops and irrigation needs additionally the irrigation water withdrawals developed by using this methodology could be tested against remote sensing techniques to evaluate the shortcomings and benefits of each approach under diverse climatic and spatial conditions furthermore future studies should focus on identifying irrigation water withdrawals under changing climatic conditions more recently studies have acknowledged the estimation of both irrigation water withdrawals and irrigation water consumption for developing and evaluating water policies zhang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c therefore future studies must focus on developing the estimates of irrigation water consumption in addition to withdrawals especially when estimates are used to inform water policy 5 conclusion this study presents a methodology for generating estimates of supplemental irrigation withdrawals using publicly available data from the usda census of agriculture and irrigation and water management survey as well as meteorological data our results indicate that a simple method based on irrigated acreage and rainfall deficit results in reasonable estimates of unreported irrigation withdrawals that are consistent with the spatial and temporal patterns exhibited in reported data the use of publicly available data allows this methodology to be replicated in any other state in the usa and around the world depending on data availability where irrigation withdrawals are not well represented in reported data or estimates derived from physical models or remotely sensed data the unreported estimated withdrawals from this study were compared to the vdeq reported withdrawals in virginia however the vdeq requires the reporting of withdrawals exceeding 1 million gallons in a single month therefore a large number of small farms were excluded from reporting obligations when reporting occurs users often underreport or are not in compliance with reporting regulations affecting water supply planning one of the major benefits of this study is that unreported withdrawals from small farm and large farms were separated using irrigated acreage per operation this provides us with the spatial distribution of counties with large cumulative volumes of irrigation withdrawals stemming from small farms which would otherwise be unrepresented in planning and management it was observed from the results in va that sf unreported withdrawals in census years vary between 1135 m3 to 377 591 m3 0 30 99 76 mg per year it was observed that 86 of counties in virginia with irrigation have cumulative sf withdrawals of sufficient magnitude that would be subject to reporting requirements if they were from a single user county level large farm unreported withdrawals vary between 1060 m3 per year 8573 549 m3 per year 0 28 mg per year to 2266 mg per year and were approximately equal to reported withdrawals on a statewide basis while the exact quantity of unreported withdrawals is uncertain our results indicate that these withdrawals have the potential to be of a similar magnitude to reported withdrawals and thus could exhibit a significant impact on water availability and low flows during dry periods thus it is crucial that water managers in locations where irrigation withdrawals go unreported have tools and approaches that can characterize these withdrawals to accurately assess water supply availability challenges and limitations in the accuracy and coverage of reported irrigation withdrawals stem from a complex mixture of legislative and regulatory factors that are subject to political pressures and institutional inertia in the face of these challenges our proposed methodology can be used to fill data gaps stemming from unreported

8848,irrigation accounts for the largest consumptive water use in the united states us representing 62 of the total water consumption water supply managers and government agencies use user reported water withdrawal data for developing water management programs however many users underreport or are not in compliance with the water withdrawal reporting regulations of the state the regulations in many states also exempt users from reporting irrigation water withdrawals under a specific amount such irregularities in non reported but consumptive agricultural withdrawals result in the underestimation of water use and considerable uncertainty about the impacts of irrigation withdrawals on water supply therefore this study presents a methodology for estimation of non reported agricultural withdrawals at the county level to understand their potential effects on water supply and enhance management of agricultural water resources this study developed a data based method using usda census irrigation data usda irrigation and water management survey iwms and gridded meteorological data to develop estimates of irrigation water withdrawals from 2002 to 2017 additionally user reported withdrawal data was used to validate estimates and quantify the volume of unreported water use for small below the withdrawal reporting threshold and large farms at county level it was observed that small and large farm unreported withdrawals averaged 13 and 110 of reported withdrawals respectively notably 86 of counties in virginia with irrigation have collective small farm withdrawals of sufficient magnitude that would be subject to reporting requirements if they were from a single user small farm unreported withdrawals were consistent through time and large farm unreported withdrawals decreased between 2002 and 2017 due to lower irrigation demand and higher reporting this approach provides a practical method that can be adopted by water supply managers to better account for agricultural water use in humid climates where supplemental irrigation is not fully captured in existing permitting and reporting regulations keywords irrigation water withdrawals

introduction irrigated agriculture accounts for the largest consumptive water use in united states the u s geological survey usgs along with various state and federal agencies collects and estimates water use data every five years since 1950 to estimate water use trends through time at county state and national levels these reported withdrawals have been used for analyzing water demand trends for various sectors and regions brown et al 2019 kannan et al 2019a sanchez et al 2020 in the recent water use report an overall decrease was observed in all water use categories except for irrigation dieter et al 2018a 2018b additionally in 2015 irrigation withdrawals recorded a 2 increase from 2010 accounting for 37 of the total withdrawals and 42 of freshwater withdrawals with 52 of the total withdrawals from surface water sources maupin 2018 irrigation also represented 62 of the total water consumption water not returned to the source after being withdrawn the highest consumption among all water use sectors in 2015 dieter et al 2018a 2018b even in areas where irrigation is a small percentage of water withdrawals it is likely to account for a higher percentage of water consumption for example in pennsylvania agricultural withdrawals makeup 0 4 of total withdrawals but account for 10 of the state s water consumed abdalla and blunk 2007 supplemental irrigation application in humid areas is likely to increase among the farmers to increase the food production to keep up with the increased demand by the projected population and cope with climate change over the past decade irrigation water use saw an increase for all states east of the mississippi river walton 2014 generally water demands are highest during dry periods when surface water supplies are stressed due to the higher consumption factor involved in irrigation even moderate volumes of irrigation can significantly impact the water supply especially during low flows and in localized areas for example in virginia va irrigation water withdrawals account for roughly 1 6 of the non energy withdrawals statewide but within individual counties irrigation sometimes accounts for more than 50 of total withdrawals additionally irrigation withdrawals show a more robust relationship for higher withdrawals in warmer years specially during the summer months crop growing period shortridge and dicarlo 2020 this combined with the high consumptive rate of irrigation means that withdrawals of irrigation water can have an outsize influence on water supplies particularly at local scale during dry periods sangha et al 2020a acknowledging future demand growth and climate change understanding these withdrawals is essential for water security in the region however water consumption is poorly quantified because of its limitations in data availability and the inherent challenges in measuring water consumption a key challenge in quantifying and understanding irrigation withdrawals is the limited data available on them particularly in eastern states with a history of riparian water rights many water users may withdrawal water without obtaining approval from water managers or reporting their water use for instance the virginia department of environmental quality vdeq under virginia water withdrawal regulation vwwr requires reporting of withdrawals over a million gallons in any month for crop irrigation i e irrigating 37 acres at a depth of one inch or irrigating for over 65 h with a 56 m3 per hour 250 gpm pump vdeq 2015 this means that irrigation users below this amount are not required to report their water use similar non reporting provisions exist in other states including indiana michigan south carolina below 11 356 230 m3 3 million gallons for 30 days north carolina below 37 8 m3 10 000 gallons in a day barnette et al 2020 kelley 2019 ncwater 2014 furthermore even in situations where water withdrawal reporting is required users may not always be in compliance with these reporting regulations for example in michigan an estimated 20 30 of withdrawals are not reported in accordance with the reporting regulations wuac 2014 these irregularities in non reported but consumptive agricultural withdrawals result in the underestimation of water use and considerable uncertainty about the impacts of irrigation withdrawals because these withdrawals aren t included in water supply planning purposes they can also potentially impact other permitted users lead to water shortages and negatively impact stream ecology in the absence of reported irrigation withdrawal data research has often aimed to leverage remote sensing to quantify irrigation water use e g foster et al 2020a tetteh et al 2021 2020 for instance the usgs calculated national water consumption using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model leveraging satellite based data for evapotranspiration et estimates to calculate irrigation consumption dieter et al 2018a 2018b senay et al 2013 other studies have used hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat soil and water balance models such as dssat cropwat and fao 56 methods for estimation of irrigation requirements at field and watershed scale sangha et al 2020b kannan et al 2019b schwaller et al 2021 thorp et al 2017 however these studies estimated the irrigated water use based on metrological analysis which is highly dependent on assumptions such as crop coefficients and individual field irrigation scheduling decisions calculating crop water use based on remotely sensed et products is challenging in regions with a large number of small farms and higher diversity in agriculture sishodia et al 2020 this is the case in virginia which includes irrigated row crops vegetables and nursery production and a large percentage of small farms relative to other states the accuracy and reliability of satellite based approaches to monitoring irrigation water use is also a challenge in humid regions particularly at the scales relevant to agricultural water management policy xie et al 2019 zurqani et al 2021 thus additional research is needed to characterize agricultural water use in humid regions where irrigation withdrawals may go unreported and are not well characterized by existing data sources and remote sensing methods this study presents a methodology for estimating non reported agricultural withdrawals at the county level to understand potential impacts on water supply and enhance agricultural water management in addition to metrological data this study leverages data from the usda census of agriculture and irrigation and water management survey iwms both of which are available at five year increments these data are used to quantify the percentage of irrigation subject to reporting requirements in each county and estimate the volume of irrigation withdrawals that go unreported meteorological data is then used to develop county level time series of irrigation withdrawals from 2002 to 2017 we apply this method in virginia and use vdeq reported withdrawal data to quantify non reported agricultural withdrawals and provide a contextual validation of trends in non reported withdrawals for our estimates 2 methods the methodology and equations used to generate estimates and time series of unreported irrigation withdrawals is summarized in fig 1 and table 1 this study used data from two key publicly available data sources the usda census of agriculture usda ca and usda irrigation and water management survey usda iwms to estimate irrigation withdrawals at county level in the region because this data is publicly available for the entire u s this approach can be replicated in other regions and for newer versions of these datasets once they are available these county level withdrawals were disaggregated into small and large farm withdrawals to estimate the relative proportion of irrigation associated with small farms who are likely below withdrawal reporting thresholds the irrigation withdrawal estimates derived from usda data were verified through comparison with vdeq farmer reported withdrawals and used to estimate the fraction of unreported water withdrawals in each county finally a time series of unreported water withdrawals was generated for all years between 2002 and 2017 to characterize interannual variability in irrigation withdrawals 2 1 data sources data from the usda ca provide uniform and comprehensive data on u s farms and ranches every five years 2002 2007 2012 and 2017 usda 2019a table 2 the usda defines a farm for the census as any place that produces and sells agricultural products worth at least 1000 during the census year usda ca is a large and comprehensive dataset that includes sectors crops demographics and economics commodities agricultural land crop types and market value of agricultural products sold operating arrangements and various management practices usda 2019a depending on the type of data it is classified according to farm size county state watershed agricultural district and american indian reservation in this study irrigated acreage and the number of operations were obtained at the county level from the usda ca an example of such dataset in one county of virginia va is shown in table 4 the data for irrigated acreage and the number of operations in a county are also broken down into farm size classes table 4 this data was downloaded using usdarnass package in r dinterman and eyer 2019 to protect the confidentiality of the data respondents usda ca withholds data that could allow for identification of an individual farm thus irrigated acreage size class data that could enable an accurate estimate of irrigated area on a single farm is coded with the letter d table 3 however the number of irrigated operations for such farm size classes is not considered confidential and has been reported in the usda ca usda 2019a the usda iwms data formerly known as the farm and ranch irrigation survey provide data for on farm irrigation activities to supplement the basic irrigation data collected from the usda ca these data were available for the years following the usda ca 2003 2008 2013 and 2018 usda 2019b table 2 usda iwms data are used for a wide variety of water related local programs to compare water use by application methods and to develop improved technologies economic models legislative initiatives and feasibility studies usda 2019b in this study the state level average irrigation amount was obtained for each survey year to estimate the seasonal crop water demand cwd one limitation of usda iwms data is that it is available only at the state level table 2 furthermore the usda iwms is a follow up to the usda ca and is based on surveying a sample of all farmers who have indicated in the agricultural census that they use irrigation on their farms usda 2019b thus response rates and coverage in the usda iwms is typically lower than in the usda ca irrigated volume estimates derived from the usda ca and usda iwms were compared with irrigation withdrawals reported to the virginia department of environmental quality to provide a context in terms of the scale timing and geographic distribution of these withdrawals the virginia va water withdrawal reporting regulation requires reporting annual surface water and groundwater withdrawals to vdeq by january 31 each year vdeq 2021 all withdrawals greater than one million gallons or more of surface water and or groundwater in a single month used for crop irrigation must be reported to vdeq vdeq 2016 this data is used by vdeq to prepare and plan water management programs for the state vdeq 2021 this dataset contained monthly reported withdrawals at the facility level which were aggregated to the county level for analysis irrigation withdrawals were downloaded from vahydro database maintained by vdeq for each year from 2002 to 2017 table 2 this data is certainly an underestimate of crop water use in the state due to exemptions from reporting for users below the reporting threshold as well as larger farms that are not in compliance with reporting requirements an initial comparison of vdeq irrigation withdrawals with usda ca irrigated area indicated that in 2017 a total of 94 counties in virginia had irrigation present according to usda records but only 37 of these counties had irrigation reported to vdeq fig 2 additionally 2 counties had irrigation reported to vdeq but not to usda thus it is apparent that neither the vdeq nor usda records are a complete picture of all irrigation occurring in the state nevertheless the use of both data sources in conjunction can provide a more accurate accounting of irrigation withdrawals than either source in isolation in addition to water withdrawal data meteorological data for precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism datasets at daily time step for each year from 2002 to 2017 prism 2022 the usda ca and usda iwms data doesn t contain information on precise geographical location of the farms and existence of a weather station near each farm is unlikely additionally prism datasets are also the official spatial climate data sets of usda the prism data is available at 4 by 4 km grid and was spatially aggregated to the county level in va for each digital elevation model dem grid cell prism uses climate elevation regression and weather stations entering the regression are allocated weights based on the physiographic resemblance of the station to the grid cell it also considers the location height proximity to the coast topographic facet orientation vertical atmospheric layer topographic position and orographic effectiveness of the terrain daly et al 2008 2 2 unreported withdrawal coefficients 2 2 1 usda ca data processing because the usda ca reports county level irrigated acreage for farms across different size classifications this data can be used to estimate the prevalence and magnitude of irrigation on small farms that are not included in reporting regulations however a key challenge in using usda ca size classification data is the frequency with which records are withheld to protect grower privacy for instance across our dataset in virginia a total of 1479 observations 59 of all observations of county level irrigated area within a given size classification were withheld the withheld data in usda ca is essential for water supply planning at the user or sector level marston et al 2022 therefore an estimated value of irrigated acres was assigned to such size classes in each county based on the following procedure the example of the process is detailed for shenandoah county in table 3 first for each county i and each size class j the percentage of total farm area under irrigation ip sc ij was calculated by dividing the irrigated acres in each size class ia sc ji by the number of farms in that size class f sc ji this estimate of average irrigated area per farm in each size class was then divided by the average total farm size of that size class a fa j this value represents for each size classification present in that county the average irrigated area as a percentage of total farm size table 4 1 ip scj ij i 1 n i a sc j f sc j a fa j the statewide mean irrigated percentage ip sc j was then calculated for each size class across all i counties with data reported for that size class this value represents on average the percentage of farm area under irrigation for each size class table 4 in the majority 83 of size classes irrigated percentages were relatively consistent ranging from 7 to 12 of total farm size 2 ip sc j 1 i i 1 i ip sc ji the withheld acreage ia w i for each county is calculated using the difference between the reported county level irrigated acreage and sum of size class acreage 3 ia w i ia c i j 1 j ia sc ij the estimated irrigated acreage in size classes with withheld data ia sc ji was calculated by multiplying the statewide average irrigated percentage for that size class ip sc j by the average farm size and number of farms in that size class and county and then rescaling these values so that the sum of all withheld size classes equaled the total withheld acreage ia w i 4 ia sc ij ip sc j a fa j f sc ji ia w i j 1 j i p sc j a fa j f sc ji 2 2 2 classification of small and large farms the estimates of unreported small farm sf and large farm lf withdrawals were developed in each county for usda ca years 2002 2007 2012 2017 the va water withdrawal reporting regulations require any user to report a monthly withdrawal of more than one million gallons in any month from non tidal waters for crop irrigation to vdeq vdeq 2021 a million gallons is equivalent to approximately 36 8 acres inches of water or one inch 25 4 mm of water applied to 9 2 acres of field per week of a month therefore we assume that farms irrigating below 10 acres per operation were considered as sf whereas the farms irrigating above 10 acres per operation were considered as lf thus the identification of sf and lf is based on irrigated area not total farm area irrigated area per iapf operation for each county and each size class was calculated as 5 iapf ij ia sc ij f sc ij sf acreage in county i is calculated as sum of acreage of all size classes in that county wherewith iapf less than 10 6 ia sm i j 1 j ia sc j for all j where iapf ij 10 2 2 3 unreported irrigated volume for census years after calculating the irrigated acreage in each county associated with small and large farms these estimates of irrigated area had to be converted to an estimate of irrigation volume this presents a key challenge because irrigation decisions at the farm level are influenced by numerous factors including the crop grown soil type meteorological conditions the irrigation system in use and water availability usda ca provides some data on the irrigated area associated with different crops but these estimates only cover a small percentage of the irrigated area in each county in this study we used a general approach to estimating irrigation volumes across a broad area that includes a diverse range of production systems based on precipitation p and irrigation depth obtained from prism and usda iwms data respectively daily rainfall raster data from prism were extracted and spatially averaged across each va county to create a time series of county level daily precipitation precipitation for each day was then converted to effective precipitation p eff d p eff d is calculated from months of june to august and assumes any rainfall above 38 1 mm 1 5 in in 48 h is lost as runoff and doesn t contribute to meeting cwd while irrigation can occur outside of the months of june to august vdeq records indicate that on average 75 of irrigation occurs in june july or august to avoid the confounding impact of heavy rainfall during the early or late growing season when crop water demands are lower s peff was calculated by summing the daily values between june and august 7 p eff d p d if p d p d 1 38 1 mm 8 p eff d 38 1 if p d p d 1 38 1 mm 9 s peff d 1 d p eff d d total days from june 1 to august 31 a statewide s peff value was calculated as the spatial average across all counties weighted by spatial area table 5error reference source not found for the years in usda iwms data seasonal cwd was calculated as sum of s peff and irrigation reported in iwms survey data irr survey cwd varied from 535 94 mm to 436 88 mm 21 1 17 2 in table 5 therefore cwd of 508 mm 20 in was assumed for all irrigated areas for each census year irrigation demand id for each individual county i is calculated using county specific effective rainfall data s peff i 10 id i 508 s peff i the volume of unreported irrigation on small farms is calculated as 11 v sm i ia sm i id i the large farm irrigation volume is calculated

i v rep i v sm i 2 3 time series of withdrawals unreported withdrawal estimates for the census years were used to obtain a monthly sequence of unreported withdrawals for each year from 2002 to 2017 the main assumption for generating a time series is that the rainfall deficit is the primary driver of irrigation water withdrawal id was calculated based on the effective precipitation for each county and year between 2002 and 2017 the sf acreage under the reporting threshold for each county was assumed to be the median ia sm i from each census year and the lf acreage was the median total acreage ia c i a limitation with the use of a constant value for irrigated acreage in each county through time is that it cannot account for long term trends in irrigated area through the expansion or removal of irrigation however an analysis of irrigated acreage reported in each county for usda ca years found that very few counties exhibited a monotonic trend of increasing or decreasing irrigation unreported withdrawals were then calculated using a procedure similar for census years 3 results 3 1 unreported withdrawals census years a statewide summary of withdrawal estimates is shown in table 6 irrigation withdrawals decreased between 2002 and 2017 driven by a combination of lower irrigated acreage and lower cwd in 2012 and 2017 however vdeq reported withdrawals remained relatively consistent over this period table 6 sf unreported withdrawals ranged from 12 to 22 of the vdeq reported withdrawals between the 2002 and 2017 census years while lf unreported ranged between 76 and 200 of vdeq reported withdrawals however these statewide totals mask considerable geographic variability fig 3 presents county level estimates of sf withdrawals across all four census years in counties where small farm withdrawals were present these volumes ranged from 1135 to 377 591 m3 0 30 99 76 mg per year to put these quantities in context this ranges from 0 0015 to 164 of reported irrigation withdrawals in counties with vdeq reported data as the threshold for reporting is withdrawals greater than 1 million gallons in any month 86 of counties have a seasonal cumulative volume of small farm withdrawals that would likely meet reporting thresholds if the volume were from a single user spatial patterns of sf withdrawal volume were relatively consistent from year to year with the highest sf withdrawals in the shenandoah and southside regions of the state fig 4 shows unreported lf withdrawals for county census years lf withdrawals were more than double vdeq reported withdrawals in 2002 due to higher irrigated acreage and lower vdeq reported withdrawals and reduced to 92 of vdeq reported withdrawals in 2017 with lower irrigation demand table 6 spatially lf unreported withdrawals existed in similar regions as sf unreported withdrawals with additional counties in the eastern parts of the state fig 4 however lf unreported withdrawals were substantially higher than sf unreported lf unreported withdrawals ranged from 1060 m3 0 28 mg per year to 8573 549 m3 2266 mg per year the lf unreported amounts ranged from 0 024 to 959 of the vdeq reported withdrawals in counties where vdeq reported withdrawals were available conversely there also existed some counties with no lf unreported withdrawals as the irrigation demand was accounted in sf unreported or the irrigation demand was less than irrigation 3 2 time series of unreported withdrawals fig 5 shows a time series of statewide total annual sf lf unreported and vdeq reported withdrawals from 2002 through 2017 year to year variability was consistent between estimated unreported withdrawals and vdeq reported withdrawals vdeq reported withdrawals and estimated unreported volumes both dropped in 2003 2004 and 2013 even though lf unreported withdrawals are calculated using precipitation deficit time series trends for lf unreported withdrawals capture the reporting trends of vdeq irrigation withdrawals fig 5 the sf unreported withdrawals vary between 8 and 19 of the vdeq reported withdrawals between 2002 and 2017 fig 5 the lf unreported varied substantially over the years ranging from 76 to 200 of vdeq reported withdrawals with an average of 110 of vdeq reported withdrawals at the county level lf the highest volumes of unreported withdrawals primarily stemmed from the total irrigated acreage of the county and lower vdeq reported irrigation withdrawals on the other end lower lf unreported withdrawals were attributed to multiple reasons lf unreported withdrawals were zero in some counties with large irrigated areas due to high vdeq reported withdrawals additionally lower lf unreported withdrawals were observed in counties with less irrigated acreage indicating lower number of lfs to further investigate the spatial variability in time series of unreported withdrawals we selected three counties that encompassed a range of irrigated acreage northampton county is located on virginia s eastern shore a region with some of the highest rates of irrigation in the state 7810 median irrigated acreage sm estimates were significantly lower than lf and vdeq reported estimates in this county due to the prevalence of large irrigated farms shenandoah county is in virginia s shenandoah valley a region with expansive and relatively high value agriculture where irrigation is becoming more prevalent 824 median irrigated acreage powhatan county is located in central virginia in greater richmond metropolitan area 81 median irrigated acreage in shenandoah and powhatan counties small farm withdrawals were a larger portion of total withdrawals due to a high percentage of farms that appear to be below the vdeq reporting threshold county level temporal patterns demonstrate how unreported withdrawal estimates are influenced by a both vdeq reported withdrawal and precipitation variability in northampton county the 2002 unreported withdrawals are due to high irrigation demand combined with relatively low reported withdrawal volume fig 6 however the peak in 2010 unreported withdrawals is due to a temporary decline in vdeq reported irrigation withdrawals combined with a relatively high irrigation demand on the other hand the lower unreported withdrawal of 2003 and 2004 is due to high precipitation and 2011 decline in unreported withdrawals due to high reported vdeq withdrawals unreported withdrawals are consistent in shenandoah due to relatively consistent vdeq reported withdrawals fig 6 the one exception to this is in 2010 and 2011 when reported irrigation withdrawals increased dramatically without a commiserate increase in large farm withdrawals in shenandoah 2010 and 2011 were the two driest years resulting in high irrigation demand this was reflected in vdeq reported withdrawals which were 263 and 230 higher than the long term mean reported withdrawal in 2010 and 2011 respectively however irrigation demand in 2010 and 2011was only 48 and 28 higher than the long term average resulting in a decline in unreported lf withdrawals this points to potential limitations in our estimation process for id which will not capture short term dry periods if they do not influence total effective precipitation at the seasonal scale in the lower irrigated acreage powhatan county volume of unreported withdrawals was lower than other two counties in certain years 2008 2014 high unreported withdrawals appear driven by strong declines in reported withdrawals further demonstrating the degree to which unreported withdrawal estimates are influenced by variability in both irrigation demand and reported withdrawals to verify consistency between spatial and temporal patterns estimated irrigation withdrawals the unreported irrigation withdrawal in each county and year were compared with vdeq reported withdrawals in the subset of counties where reported withdrawals were available overall it was observed that unreported withdrawals generally corresponded to vdeq reported withdrawals fig 7 unreported withdrawals increased in counties with higher vdeq reported withdrawals indicating that farms underreported their use however in a few counties there was a substantial difference between vdeq reported withdrawals and estimated irrigation withdrawals this was because of the very low vdeq reported withdrawals in these counties interestingly in a few counties vdeq reported withdrawals were higher than estimated irrigation withdrawals fig 7 this was generally observed during years of low id in the county this also indicates that crops with an id higher than 508 mm 20 in might be grown in the area 4 discussion this study presents a new approach for calculating irrigation water withdrawals using publicly available data sources in humid regions where supplemental irrigation is underreported irrigation water withdrawals were then compared with user reported withdrawals in the va to generate unreported irrigation water withdrawals at the county level many previous studies have used remote sensing to monitor irrigation water use through estimates of irrigated acreage and irrigation demand brocca et al 2018 deines et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c however the efficiency of such data at a regional scale with diverse landscapes remains a challenge because of the coarse resolution gaps in image acquisition uncertainties in the key inputs of energy balance models and choice of algorithms and models for calculating et biggs et al 2016 fan et al 2022 fisher et al 2008 foster et al 2020 senay et al 2016 zhang et al 2022a recent studies argue that simpler models using irrigated withdrawals as function of irrigated areas may result in more robust method of irrigated withdrawals estimation puy et al 2021 there exists a potential for the simplification of methods to calculate irrigation water withdrawals especially for larger scales puy et al 2021 thompson and smith 2019 therefore this study developed survey based irrigated acreage method to obtain irrigated water withdrawals our results indicate that a simple method based on publicly reported data results in reasonable estimates of unreported irrigation withdrawals that are consistent with the spatial and temporal patterns exhibited in reported data usda ca contains results accumulated from bottom up primary surveys of water users led by national and state entities statistical and census agencies these primary surveys and observations are the foundation of water use data this data collection process is more time consuming and expensive than modeled estimates of water usage but is generally considered a more accurate primary observations of water use ruddell 2018 however the irrigated acreage from usda ca used in this study to calculate the irrigation withdrawals is not error free studies suggest the irrigated withdrawals using usda ca could potentially be an underestimation for instance dickens et al 2011 found that irrigation acreage in usda ca was lower than usgs water use compilations it is important to emphasize that precipitation patterns and irrigated acreage of a county influence the outcomes of the proposed approach of calculating irrigation water use conceptually irrigation and precipitation are negatively correlated however many other meteorological parameters such as temperature influence irrigation demand which are not accounted for in the irrigation demand the relationship between evaporative demand and irrigation application is more complex nie et al 2021 additionally the calculation of p eff d is governed by the soil type while the soil water holding capacity was considered constant in this study it would vary in practice regions with fine textured soils would result in higher surface runoff under same precipitation and initial conditions than sandy soils thus reducing the effective precipitation thus more spatially and temporally refined representation of soil and meteorological conditions would likely be a valuable area for additional research the decline in irrigated acreage observed in our study could result from a number of meteorological and economic factors it was found that the proportion of irrigated corn acreage relative to rainfed acreage has declined in the eastern us because growing season precipitation is found to be adequate under normal rainfall conditions hrozencik 2021 however crop specific trends may be counteracted by broader trends in agricultural production such as incentive programs that encourage the production of high value specialty crops that are often more water sensitive majsztrik et al 2019 trends in irrigation will also interact with trends in agricultural land use more broadly for example small to medium sized farms in va were reported to have financial difficulties due to lack of flexibility in responding to changing commodity and consumer markets leading to the conversion of 104 000 acres of farmland to other land use between 2002 and 2007 bendfeldt 2012 overall variability in precipitation availability of irrigation water and financial goals and status together may impact producers decisions at the farm level in general a 38 reduction in irrigating farms was observed between 2002 and 2017 in va however the number of irrigating small farms 1 9 acres increased between the same time period this indicates more small farms added to va s agriculture therefore studies like these are essential to develop the estimates of water use at such farms because regulations in va require reporting of irrigation withdrawals above a certain volume this provided an opportunity to contextualize our irrigation withdrawal estimates and quantify the volume of unreported withdrawals at county level in va most states in the mid atlantic region of the us have similar reporting requirements that require reporting irrigation water withdrawals above a certain threshold allowing for replication of our approach however none of these states require metering of irrigation water current estimates of reported irrigation withdrawals are generally based on pumping rates and runtimes user reported data may include errors and inconsistencies that have been noted in other research dunham et al 2022 mccarthy et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 while the vdeq screens data to remove duplicate and leads outreach efforts to involve all users the user reported data used to calculate unreported withdrawals impacts the interpretation of unreported withdrawals trends in vdeq reported data are highly influenced by the availability of resources and staff for outreach to increase participation in such programs in a particular year these trends may also be influenced by changes in the rate of reporting farms through time our methodology and findings can help support practical management of water used for supplemental irrigation in humid climates in several ways this approach provides a necessary framework for estimation of irrigation withdrawals in regions with diverse agriculture small farms and regions with hard to distinguish between irrigated and non irrigated fields the use of reported withdrawal data to develop irrigation water management plans and permits may lack the holistic view due to incomplete reporting and therefore missing an important opportunity to reduce water stress and conflicts one of the key benefits of this study was its ability to isolate withdrawals below and above the reporting threshold existing water management and planning efforts typically rely on reported withdrawals from individual users above the reporting threshold however many small users existing in one location may have a substantial cumulative withdrawal in the region particularly as irrigation withdrawals may occur at the same time due to meteorological conditions our results found that 86 of the sf withdrawals would have been reported if withdrawn by a single user indicating a large cumulative volume bringing all individual small users under permit would likely be a challenge for permitting authorities and subject to push back from users our proposed methodology can assist in filling this gap by providing estimates of water use that is not captured by existing reporting requirements additionally our results suggest that even when reporting requirements are in place significant quantities of withdrawn water are likely unaccounted for in reported water use data exclusion of these withdrawals in water management efforts would likely lead to overestimates of available water supply creating a risk of shortages and conflict the spatial analysis of unreported withdrawals allows the water management planners to identify the counties with higher unreported irrigation withdrawals which could be reflected in water allocation and optimization models while the exact quantity of unreported withdrawal will be uncertain these withdrawal quantities should at the very least be estimated to provide a scope of the potential agricultural water supply risks stemming from unreported irrigation this work presents an initial step in characterizing supplemental irrigation withdrawals using usda census data and presents several areas for additional research our methodology of evaluating irrigation water withdrawals is transferrable to other locations but would require validation for other states within different climates soil types crops and irrigation needs additionally the irrigation water withdrawals developed by using this methodology could be tested against remote sensing techniques to evaluate the shortcomings and benefits of each approach under diverse climatic and spatial conditions furthermore future studies should focus on identifying irrigation water withdrawals under changing climatic conditions more recently studies have acknowledged the estimation of both irrigation water withdrawals and irrigation water consumption for developing and evaluating water policies zhang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c therefore future studies must focus on developing the estimates of irrigation water consumption in addition to withdrawals especially when estimates are used to inform water policy 5 conclusion this study presents a methodology for generating estimates of supplemental irrigation withdrawals using publicly available data from the usda census of agriculture and irrigation and water management survey as well as meteorological data our results indicate that a simple method based on irrigated acreage and rainfall deficit results in reasonable estimates of unreported irrigation withdrawals that are consistent with the spatial and temporal patterns exhibited in reported data the use of publicly available data allows this methodology to be replicated in any other state in the usa and around the world depending on data availability where irrigation withdrawals are not well represented in reported data or estimates derived from physical models or remotely sensed data the unreported estimated withdrawals from this study were compared to the vdeq reported withdrawals in virginia however the vdeq requires the reporting of withdrawals exceeding 1 million gallons in a single month therefore a large number of small farms were excluded from reporting obligations when reporting occurs users often underreport or are not in compliance with reporting regulations affecting water supply planning one of the major benefits of this study is that unreported withdrawals from small farm and large farms were separated using irrigated acreage per operation this provides us with the spatial distribution of counties with large cumulative volumes of irrigation withdrawals stemming from small farms which would otherwise be unrepresented in planning and management it was observed from the results in va that sf unreported withdrawals in census years vary between 1135 m3 to 377 591 m3 0 30 99 76 mg per year it was observed that 86 of counties in virginia with irrigation have cumulative sf withdrawals of sufficient magnitude that would be subject to reporting requirements if they were from a single user county level large farm unreported withdrawals vary between 1060 m3 per year 8573 549 m3 per year 0 28 mg per year to 2266 mg per year and were approximately equal to reported withdrawals on a statewide basis while the exact quantity of unreported withdrawals is uncertain our results indicate that these withdrawals have the potential to be of a similar magnitude to reported withdrawals and thus could exhibit a significant impact on water availability and low flows during dry periods thus it is crucial that water managers in locations where irrigation withdrawals go unreported have tools and approaches that can characterize these withdrawals to accurately assess water supply availability challenges and limitations in the accuracy and coverage of reported irrigation withdrawals stem from a complex mixture of legislative and regulatory factors that are subject to political pressures and institutional inertia in the face of these challenges our proposed methodology can be used to fill data gaps stemming from unreported irrigation withdrawals and lead to more robust and accurate agricultural water supply planning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8849,soil moisture sm is a key variable in agriculture and its monitoring is essential sm determines the amount of water available to plants having a direct impact on the development of crops on the forecasting of crop yields and on the surveillance of food security microwave remote sensing offers a great potential for estimating sm because it is sensitive to the dielectric characteristics of observed surface that depend on surface soil moisture the objective of this study is the evaluation of three change detection methodologies for sm estimation over wheat at the agricultural field scale based on sentinel 1 time series short term change detection stcd tu wien change detection tuwcd and multitemporal bayesian change detection mtbcd different methodological alternatives were proposed for the implementation of these techniques at the agricultural field scale soil moisture measurements from eight experimental wheat fields were used for validating the methodologies all available sentinel 1 acquisitions were processed and the eventual benefit of correcting for vegetation effects in backscatter time series was evaluated the results were rather variable with some experimental fields achieving successful performance metrics ubrmse 0 05 m3 m3 and some others rather poor ones ubrmse 0 12 m3 m3 evaluating median performance metrics it was observed that both tuwcd and mtbcd methods obtained better results when run with vegetation corrected backscatter time series ubrmse 0 07 m3 m3 whereas stcd produced similar results with and without vegetation correction ubrmse 0 08 m3 m3 the soil moisture content had an influence on the accuracy of the different methodologies with higher errors observed for drier conditions and rain fed fields in comparison to wetter conditions and irrigated fields taking into account the spatial scale of this case study results were considered promising for the future application of these techniques in irrigation management graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil wetness agriculture sar change detection field scale 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable for understanding modeling and forecasting different processes occurring at the earth surface brocca et al 2018 green et al 2019 liu et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2010 wasko and nathan 2019 due to its relevance in 2010 it was recognized as an essential climate variable ecv by the global climate observing system gcos of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc its monitoring is therefore necessary to track our changing climate and design proper mitigation and adaptation measures in agricultural systems sm determines the amount of water available to plants and therefore it has a direct impact on the development of crops and on the forecasting of crop yields therefore sm monitoring is essential for the surveillance of food security lobell and burke 2010 remote sensing has a great potential for sm retrieval due to its capability to observe large areas of the territory repeatedly over time although optical and thermal sensors have potential for sm estimation verstraeten et al 2006 wang and qu 2007 most progress in the last decades has been achieved by the microwave scientific community entekhabi et al 2010a kerr et al 2001 wagner et al 1999 due to the long time known sensitivity of microwave reflectance and emissivity to the dielectric characteristics of observed surfaces which mostly depend on surface sm ulaby and long 2014 in recent years global sm products at coarse spatial resolution 10 50 km have been developed principally based on radiometers or scatterometers brocca et al 2011 chan et al 2016 kerr et al 2012 naeimi et al 2009 synthetic aperture radar sar sensors achieve finer spatial resolutions 10 20 m that might be suitable to work at the scale of agricultural fields this possibility is very appealing as it would enable a field scale sm monitoring with direct implications for irrigation management harvest forecast and disease control however sm estimation at this scale is still challenging peng et al 2021 because sar sensors are also sensitive to other variables related to vegetation bindlish and barros 2001 or soil surface roughness verhoest et al 2008 therefore the inversion of classic bare soil backscatter models such as the physically based integral equation model iem fung 1994 or the semi empirical models of oh et al 1992 dubois et al 1995 or shi et al 1997 is generally ill posed and its operational application not guaranteed moreover sm estimation in vegetated conditions requires the coupling of backscatter models for bare soil and for vegetation zhang et al 2021 one of the most popular models is the semi empirical water cloud model wcm attema and ulaby 1978 which requires external vegetation descriptors and a specific parameterization for the local conditions this case is even more complex although recent progress is being made in the transferability of model parameters to the regional scale benninga et al 2022 the launch of the sentinel 1 satellites in 2014 and 2016 opened new possibilities for the estimation of sm at high spatial resolution their unprecedented compromise between high spatial resolution frequent revisit time and radiometric accuracy torres et al 2012 along with the open data distribution policy and the operational vocation of the copernicus program fostered the development of new methods for sm estimation or the adaptation of existing ones to the characteristics of sentinel 1 data in particular the development of retrieval methods based on change detection techniques that evaluate backscatter changes between consecutive observations has made significant progress the main hypothesis of these methods is that if time series are dense enough the backscatter differences between consecutive observations might only be caused by sm variations since the other variables affecting backscatter e g soil roughness and vegetation could be considered constant during such a short period following this idea different approaches have been developed such as the short term change detection stcd approach balenzano et al 2021 2011 or the tu wien change detection tuwcd model bauer marschallinger et al 2019 wagner et al 1999 on the other hand some other methods following different principles have also been applied to sentinel 1 data such as bayesian approaches notarnicola 2014 notarnicola et al 2006 or machine learning algorithms like random forest regression liu et al 2021 support vector regression svr pasolli et al 2011 or artificial neural network ann baghdadi et al 2012 recently a retrieval method that combined the sliding window approach balenzano et al 2021 with physical scattering models in a stochastic ensemble inversion was proposed zhu et al 2023 with very promising results at present some of these approaches are applied to routinely produce sm products at scales of 1 km balenzano et al 2021 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 which significantly improve the spatial resolution of radiometer or scatterometer based products zappa et al 2022 however for some agricultural applications such as irrigation scheduling this spatial resolution might still be too coarse and sm values at the field scale are ideally sought gao et al 2018 le page et al 2020 modanesi et al 2022 furthermore field size varies significantly around the world white and roy 2015 and many agricultural areas particularly in africa asia and europe are smallholders 2 ha lesiv et al 2019 where high resolution is a necessity for remote sensing to be useful to farmers therefore the applicability and the performance of different sm estimation approaches at the field scale still need to be evaluated the objective of this work is to evaluate different sm estimation approaches based on sentinel 1 data for wheat fields three change detection approaches were selected the stcd approach balenzano et al 2011 the tuwcd model wagner et al 1999 and a multitemporal bayesian change detection mtbcd algorithm notarnicola 2014 these approaches were calibrated on eight experimental fields with available sm measurements and some methodological adaptations were proposed to enhance their applicability to the particular case of wheat fields furthermore the influence of vegetation on backscatter and hence on sm retrievals was accounted for by comparing the results obtained with the original sentinel 1 time series and those obtained after applying the wheat attenuation correction method watcor recently proposed by arias et al 2022b 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil moisture measurements the study focused on eight winter wheat test fields located in the province of navarre spain fig 1 navarre is a small but diverse province regarding climate topography and land use therefore it is divided in seven agricultural regions arias et al 2020 where conditions for crop growth are expected to be rather constant two test fields were located in region r3 rather wet classified as cf2b according to köppen climate classification average annual temperature ta of 12 5ºc and annual rainfall ra of 900 mm four in region r5 intermediate with csb climate class ta 12 7ºc and ra 655 mm and two in region r6 dry with csa climate class ta 14ºc and ra 350 mm two fields were monitored per agricultural year 2017 2018 fields 1 and 2 2018 2019 fields 3 and 4 2019 2020 fields 5 and 6 2020 2021 fields 7 and 8 each year field pairs were managed exactly the same in terms of soil preparation sowing and agricultural management fertilization and other agrichemicals except for irrigation with half of them odd field numbers rain fed and the other half irrigated even field numbers the irrigation system used was sprinkler irrigation with a sprinkler spacing of 15mx18m a design pressure of 3 kg cm2 and an application rate of 6 mm h that lead to an irrigation uniformity of 90 irrigation shifts are scheduled at night table 1 provides additional details several 3 6 capacitance sm probes sentek sensor technologies stepney sa 5069 australia were installed on each field in winter and they were removed just before harvest table 1 these probes recorded volumetric sm every 30 min at 6 different depths from the soil surface down to 60 cm deep the top most measurements 10 cm were used in this study so a basic assumption of this study is that sm is invariant in the top 10 cm of the soil this is important because sentinel 1 sensing depth might vary from 1 cm to 10 cm approximately depending on the actual sm content of the soil ulaby et al 1996 for each field the median sm time series of all the probes installed on it was calculated then these time series that had a 30 min temporal resolution were confronted with sentinel 1 acquisition dates and times selecting only the measurements closest to each sentinel 1 acquisition the final number of measurements used depended on the availability of sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b on each of the three orbits that over flew the study area i e 103asc 8desc and 81desc at best 30 acquisitions were available per orbit table 2 surface sm dynamics varied quite strongly in the different test fields study years fig 2 rain fed fields normally experienced a transition from wet conditions in winter to dry soils in may june e g fields 1 and 7 fig 2a and g however this was not always the case and field 3 fig 2c had already quite dry conditions in winter field 5 fig 2e in turn recorded frequent and significant precipitations during the spring so no clear drying was observed in general irrigation management in fields 2 4 6 and 8 fig 2b d f and h avoided soil drying however keeping in mind that measurements were taken at the soil surface quite rapid dynamics were observed with sm increasing rapidly due to irrigation events and decreasing also quite rapidly afterwards 2 2 satellite imagery and data extraction fig 3 summarizes all the satellite imagery and data needed for implementing the sm estimation techniques investigated detailing the general and specific characteristics of each methodology in the following sections further details and explanations are given 2 2 1 sentinel 1 data sentinel 1 c band sar data was the base of this study in particular the interferometric wide iw swath mode data with a 250 km swath 5 20 m spatial resolution and dual pol vh vv configuration which is the pre defined observation scenario over land in europe all available scenes from 1 september 2015 31 august 2021 covering the province of navarre were downloaded as level 1 ground range detected grd products these images corresponded to one ascending 103asc and two descending orbits 8desc and 81desc images were processed with an automated pipeline implemented in snap graph processing toolbox which followed these steps 1 thermal noise removal 2 slice assembly 3 apply orbit file 4 calibration 5 speckle filtering 3 3 gamma map 6 terrain flattening 7 range doppler terrain correction and 8 subset to the extent of navarre the terrain flattening and terrain correction step employed the srtm 1 s hgt dem as a result γ0 backscatter coefficient images in vh and vv polarizations were produced with a pixel size of 20 m the projected local incidence angle was also obtained as a secondary output for each scene for the eight test fields median backscatter coefficient values were extracted for each sentinel 1 acquisition resulting in backscatter time series in vv and vh polarizations prior to this a 10 m inner buffer was applied to field boundaries to avoid mixed pixels two further processes were applied to the backscatter time series firstly the local incidence angle was normalized to a reference angle of θ 400 by applying an adapted version arias et al 2022a of the methodology proposed by mladenova et al 2013 secondly the influence of wheat canopy in vv backscatter was corrected for with the watcor method arias et al 2022b obtaining a new vv backscatter time series corresponding to the soil named γ0 soil which is assumed to be free of the influence of wheat vegetation cover as opposed to the original backscatter time series γ0 can which corresponds to the complete wheat canopy watcor removes the attenuation pattern produced by the wheat canopy in vv backscatter based on the information contained in the backscatter time series itself with no need for external information or parametrization arias et al 2022b arias et al 2022b evaluated the performance of this method and found that it successfully eliminated wheat attenuation from sentinel 1 backscatter time series improving the correlation with ground measured sm and outperforming the results obtained by approaches based on the water cloud model 2 2 2 esa cci soil moisture product the european space agency esa provides a coarse resolution sm product through its climate change initiative cci dorigo et al 2017 this esa cci sm product is a global product containing daily sm estimates from 1978 until 2021 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 based on active scatterometers and passive radiometers microwave sensors previous studies reported that the esa cci sm product performed accurately wang et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 in this study the v06 1 level 3 combined sm product was used as ancillary data for the stcd approach with this aim the esa cci sm time series of the pixels covering the test fields were downloaded and processed to obtain monthly statistics in particular the minimum maximum and percentiles p05 p15 p25 p75 p85 and p95 were used 2 2 3 regional characterization of wheat backscatter for calibrating the tuwcd model see section 2 3 2 a regional characterization of wheat backscatter was carried out with this aim a gis database containing the field boundaries of all the eu common agricultural policy cap declarations in navarre for years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was used which was provided by the department of agriculture of the government of navarre wheat fields were extracted from this database and processed as follows 1 create subsets for agricultural regions r3 r5 and r6 2 mask out fields smaller than 0 5 ha 3 apply a 5 m inner buffer to the field boundaries 4 compute the median vv backscatter time series per field 5 remove outliers i e the 10 of fields most dissimilar to the median time series of all the fields on a region arias et al 2020 6 normalize backscatter to a local incidence angle of θ 400 and apply watcor after this process backscatter time series of 13 200 wheat fields were obtained for region r3 18 994 for region r5 and 11 401 for region r6 with this data a regional characterization of wheat backscatter was obtained by computing different percentiles of backscatter time series for each region r3 r5 and r6 and orbit pass 103asc 8desc and 81desc 2 3 soil moisture estimation techniques 2 3 1 short term change detection stcd the stcd approach balenzano et al 2011 is a change detection approach that uses dense time series 6 12 days revisit of t co polarized backscatter observations γ 1 0 γ 2 0 γ t 0 to estimate a sm time series sm 1 sm 2 sm t the hypothesis of the methodology is that sm changes occur at a shorter temporal scale days than other parameters affecting the backscatter response e g soil roughness vegetation biomass or canopy structure which vary at a longer temporal scale weeks therefore the ratio between two subsequent sar observations γ 2 0 γ 1 0 in linear units can be expressed as a function of the dielectric constant ɛ and the local incidence angle θ of each observation date eq 1 1 γ 2 0 γ 1 0 α pp 2 ε θ α pp 1 ε θ 2 where α pp is the fresnel reflection coefficient at hh or vv polarization and α vv is defined as follows eq 2 2 α vv ε θ ε 1 sin 2 θ ε 1 sin 2 θ ε cos θ ϵ sin 2 θ 2 for n observations there are n 1 equations with n unknown fresnel coefficients a bounded least squares optimization was used to solve the equation system balenzano et al 2013 once that the α time series were determined for the observations the corresponding ɛ values were obtained and converted into volumetric sm values using the empirical expression of hallikainen et al 1985 the values of the boundary conditions α min α max were found to play an important role in the retrieval accuracy he et al 2017 ideally α min α ma x should correspond to the dynamic range of sm for the study area during the period of observation ouellette et al 2017 in the literature different methods for constraining α min α max can be found for instance some studies used fixed sm values balenzano et al 2011 while others relied on sm field measurements zhang et al 2018 other authors used coarser scale sm values obtained from scatterometers or radiometers al khaldi et al 2019 ouellette et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 in this study the latter approach was followed and thus α min α max were derived from the esa cci sm product with this aim the monthly minimum and maximum esa cci sm values were initially considered supplementary materials 1 but they showed a rather low dynamic range due to their coarser spatial scale so additional schemes were tested enhancing the esa cci sm dynamic range for this the mean monthly sm variation range was estimated through a variable named sm diff eq 3 this variable was added or subtracted to the different esa cci sm monthly percentiles table 3 to find the combination optimally describing α min α max boundary conditions 3 sm diff sm max month sm min month 2 regarding the length of the time series considered palmisano et al 2018 suggested sub dividing the complete backscatter time series t in smaller blocks to avoid error propagation into sm estimations therefore a sliding window of n backscatter observations was considered and the average value of the estimations was calculated shi et al 2021 different values of n 4 5 6 8 12 and 18 were evaluated and the optimum was selected therefore the implementation of this approach had first a calibration phase that consisted in evaluating which combination of α min α max boundary conditions table 3 and n value provided the best results after this calibration phase scheme d and n 4 were identified as optimal so this was the option used in the study supplementary materials 2 1 2 3 2 tu wien change detection model tuwcd the tuwcd model wagner et al 1999 interprets backscatter changes in a time series as changes in soil moisture while other surface properties geometry roughness vegetation etc are considered as static this model is used to produce a global sm product at a resolution of 1 km bauer marschallinger et al 2019 here the algorithm is applied at the field scale using sentinel 1 backscatter time series of each field see section 2 2 1 this model defines the surface soil moisture content ssm as a relative index between 0 and 1 which is estimated from the backscatter value of that particular day normalized with some minimum and maximum backscatter boundary conditions eq 4 4 ssm t γ 0 t γ min 0 γ max 0 γ min 0 where γ 0 t is the backscatter observation in db units at time t and γ min 0 and γ max 0 are the minimum and maximum backscatter values in db units corresponding to dry and saturated soil conditions respectively these values are ideally extracted from long time series where it is likely that the pixel or polygon of interest would reach these dry and saturated conditions some time wagner et al 1999 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 already mentioned that the relatively short length of the sentinel 1 data record might result in an absence of the dry and saturated conditions required to successfully apply this algorithm this might be particularly difficult in humid regions zribi et al 2014 or in agricultural areas with irrigation systems where completely dry conditions might never be met furthermore in agricultural areas more and more often managed under crop rotation schemes european commission 2022 yearly varying crops might also influence backscatter dynamics arias et al 2020 veloso et al 2017 making the selection of γ min 0 and γ max 0 very challenging to overcome this problem this study proposes a regional characterization of backscatter for wheat fields section 2 2 3 for each agricultural region backscatter time series of thousands of wheat fields were obtained for four different years and their statistics minimum maximum and different percentiles were computed and used to calibrate the algorithm that is to select the dry and wet references evaluating different schemes table 4 these different schemes were applied on a calibration phase to select the optimum γ min 0 γ max 0 the results of this calibration see supplementary materials 2 2 showed that scheme 3 was optimal backscatter values below or above the limits were set to 0 and 1 respectively hornáček et al 2012 then relative ssm values were linearly scaled to sm values m3 m3 carranza et al 2019 eq 5 5 sm t sm sat sm wp ssm t sm wp where sm sat is the saturated soil moisture content extracted from soil texture data rawls et al 1982 and sm wp is the wilting point also estimated from soil texture data saxton and rawls 2006 the soil texture of the test fields table 1 was obtained by field sampling and laboratory analyses 2 3 3 multitemporal bayesian change detection approach mtbcd the mtbcd is an inversion procedure for sm estimation based on the bayes theorem adapted from notarnicola 2014 the objective is to infer the unknown soil dielectric constant time series ε 1 ε 1 ε t from the available sentinel 1 backscatter time series γ 1 0 γ 2 0 γ t 0 by applying bayes theorem it is possible to turn probabilities estimated from a training dataset into probabilities for the estimation of the unknown variable ɛ gelman et al 2013 the conditional probability density function pdf p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 ε i which is the probability of finding the vector of γ i 0 given specific values of ε i is estimated from a training set of backscatter values and their corresponding values of ɛ by using the integral equation model iem fung 1994 the theoretical backscatter values γ i iem 0 calculated from the ground sm measurements were obtained these values were compared to the sentinel 1 backscatter values introducing a random variable r that accounts for the sensor noise and model errors notarnicola et al 2008 eq 6 6 γ i 0 r γ i iem 0 the pdf of r is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution eq 7 and its mean μ and standard deviation σ are determined by using the maximum likelihood principle tests were carried out to check whether this distribution adequately represents the data notarnicola et al 2008 7 p r e r μ 2 2 σ 2 2 π σ once that the pdf parameters were calculated the bayes theorem from two consecutive γ 1 0 γ 2 0 observations for obtaining the conditional density function p ε γ 1 0 γ 2 0 was applied eq 8 8 p ε γ 1 0 γ 2 0 p prior ε p post γ 1 0 γ 2 0 ε p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 where p prior is the a priori joint density function for ɛ which can be assumed to follow a uniform density function over the physical range of the parameter p post γ 1 0 γ 2 0 ε is the posterior density function based on measured values p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 is a normalization factor p ε γ 1 0 γ 2 0 can be expressed in terms of the probability density p r by a transformation detailed in notarnicola et al 2006 the optimal estimator ε for ε which has de minimum variance is the conditional mean eq 9 9 ε ε ε min p prior ε 1 γ iem 0 2 p γ 1 0 γ iem 0 p γ 2 0 γ iem 0 d ε p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 where ε min is the minimum value of the uniform density function from p prior this approach needs to be trained and validated for this iem simulations were used since the iem requires as input not only ε but also soil roughness parameters s standard deviation of heights and l correlation length and soil roughness measurements were not available for this study s and l were optimized in total 414 combinations of soil roughness parameters were evaluated s from 0 2 cm to 2 cm with a step of 0 1 cm and l from 2 cm to 25 cm with a step of 1 cm for each combination of s and l the backscatter values were simulated using as input the available sm measurements then the optimization function selected the combination of roughness parameters that minimized the rmse between the observed and simulated backscatter values being s 0 4 cm and l 3 cm see supplementary materials 2 3 the training phase consisted in determining the pdf parameters that were later used for sm estimation in this case a 4 fold cross validation scheme was performed separately for each orbit pass with 6 fields used for training and 2 for validation in each fold 2 4 evaluation of results the performance of the evaluated sm retrieval techniques was assessed with different metrics entekhabi et al 2010b calculated between the volumetric sm recorded by the probes sm obs and the estimated sm sm est with each technique pearson correlation r root mean square error rmse bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse the typical target accuracy threshold defined for low resolution missions e g smos or smap is ubrmse 0 04 m3 m3 gruber et al 2020 each sm est value was compared with the sm obs ground measurement closest to its acquisition time in the evaluation of results performance metrics were reported for each change detection technique and for each test field furthermore the eventual influence that some scene acquisition and field conditions might have in the results were evaluated in particular the sentinel 1 orbit considered the rainfed or irrigated status of the field the month of the year and the wetness of the field 3 results 3 1 comparison between methodologies in this section the global statistical results obtained for each methodology are presented the numerical results for every field and orbit pass using as input both the γ0 can and γ0 soil time series can be found in supplementary materials 3 as an example the results of a sample field field 5 are shown here fig 4 where best results were obtained with tuwcd and γ0 soil fig 5 shows the results of all the fields after computing the performance metrics per orbit pass and field points not only represent the different test fields colors but also the sentinel 1 orbit pass used in each case symbols boxplots represent all the point data summarizing the median and quartiles of the performance metrics obtained for each approach median values of the performance metrics demonstrate a positive effect of the vegetation correction in all techniques in particular γ0 soil metrics improved those obtained with γ0 can in the tuwcd and mtbcd approaches and to a much lesser extent in the stcd different metrics provide different views on the performance of the techniques regarding the rmse best results were obtained with the tuwcd 0 08 m3 m3 followed by stcd 0 09 m3 m3 and mtbcd 0 12 m3 m3 stcd and mtbcd had negative bias and tuwcd a positive one looking at the unbiased ubrmse the tuwcd approach also provided the best results 0 06 m3 m3 but practically matched by the mtbcd and then followed by stcd 0 08 m3 m3 in turn the highest correlation values were obtained by the mtbcd approach 0 52 followed by tuwcd 0 46 and stcd 0 45 looking at field results in detail it can be observed that results varied from case to case with rather large variability ranges for all the metrics rmse 0 05 0 17 m3 m3 bias 0 16 to 0 12 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 04 0 15 m3 m3 and r 0 4 to 0 9 the approaches with the highest variability were tuwcd and mtbcd on the other hand stcd provided more consistent results and had a lower variability this field to field variability might be related to the particular characteristics of each field for instance fields 1 7 and 8 all had a positive bias indicating a systematic overestimation of sm conversely fields 3 4 5 and 6 had a negative bias except for tuwcd the correlation values have to be interpreted with care as they depend on the dynamic range of sm for each field for instance field 3 showed poor r values but successful results in terms of bias rmse and ubrmse for a more in depth analysis the results obtained with each method run with γ0 soil were examined to evaluate the influence of different factors on the retrievals the selected factors were the agricultural water management rain fed or irrigated the satellite orbit passes the month of the year and the soil moisture content 3 2 comparison between rain fed and irrigated fields the results based on the agricultural water management are shown in fig 6 rmse metrics did not differ greatly between rain fed and irrigated fields for mtbcd 0 10 m3 m3 however for stcd and tuwcd approaches the rmse was lower in irrigated fields in general rmse variability error bars in fig 6a was larger for rain fed fields regarding the ubrmse all techniques achieved similar median results 0 08 m3 m3 with slightly lower errors for irrigated conditions specifically fields 1 2 7 and 8 had higher ubrmse 0 08 m3 m3 than fields 3 4 5 and 6 ubrmse 0 05 m3 m3 see supplementary materials 3 in terms of correlation stcd and mtbcd showed higher correlation values for irrigated fields whereas tuwcd did not show any clear difference 3 3 comparison between orbit passes the performance metrics obtained for the three orbit passes fig 7 did not show clear differences in general for each sm estimation technique the values of the performance metrics obtained for the three orbit passes were similar in terms of ubrmse results were slightly better for the ascending pass in tuwcd and mtbcd but differences were minor for tuwcd descending orbits showed a larger variability in terms of rmse and bias than the ascending one correlation results showed minor differences with slightly lower correlations for the ascending orbit in stcd but slightly higher in mtbcd in any case these differences were not significant and performance metrics seemed to vary more strongly depending on the particular field than on the orbit pass 3 4 evaluation of results per month median performance metrics were computed per month to assess the eventual influence of the scene acquisition month on the accuracy fig 8 correlation results in this case are omitted since the sm dynamic range on each month was too small to provide reliable values there were clear differences depending on the month particularly for tuwcd and mtbcd rmse values were lowest in winter months january and february for all cases with values below 0 05 m3 m3 for tuwcd and mtbcd in stcd the rmse was slightly higher 0 075 m3 m3 the rmse in march was higher for all methods except for mtbcd and april may and june obtained the highest errors in all cases 0 08 0 12 m3 m3 rmse was exceptionally high in june in the mtbcd 0 13 m3 m3 regarding ubrmse results tuwcd presented very low values in january and february 0 02 m3 m3 while the remaining months had higher values that did not exceed 0 05 m3 m3 mtbcd also had a very good result in january 0 02 m3 m3 intermediate ones in february march and april 0 035 m3 m3 and higher errors in may and june 0 05 0 06 m3 m3 finally stcd was the approach that had overall the highest ubrmse results with a less marked difference between months although winter months had also the lowest errors 3 5 evaluation of results depending on soil moisture content with the aim of evaluating the performance of the retrieval methods depending on the actual soil moisture content of fields the median performance metrics were computed for three sm levels dry 0 15 m3 m3 intermediate 0 15 m3 m3 0 30 m3 m3 and wet 0 30 m3 m3 the median rmse results fig 9 showed certainly high error values for dry conditions in all the techniques 0 013 0 18 m3 m3 wet conditions also presented relatively high rmse metrics but not as high as in the dry case 0 09 0 011 m3 m3 except for the tuwcd that achieved the best results in wet conditions rmse 0 06 m3 m3 in general the best results were achieved with intermediate moisture conditions with rmse 0 06 m3 m3 for the stcd tuwcd and mtbcd all approaches presented a high positive bias 0 12 m3 m3 for dry conditions conversely bias was negative for wet conditions 0 05 to 0 1 m3 m3 intermediate conditions obtained the lowest bias for all approaches unbiased rmse values ubrmse were similar for the four techniques 0 03 0 05 m3 m3 and did not depend on the actual moisture conditions these results showed that depending on the actual sm content the approaches could overestimate or underestimate sm in fig 10 sm time series for different test fields are displayed to show the behavior of the different approaches fig 2 shows that fields 1 and 2 had a similar sm content during january and february and then sm dropped dramatically in field 1 whereas sm remained slightly higher in field 2 due to irrigation in this case although the evaluated approaches were sensitive to the precipitation event and subsequent soil wetting in april 2018 they did not predict adequately the significant drying of field 1 fig 10a mtbc and stcd approaches estimated sm better in the irrigated field 2 fig 10b on the other hand fields 3 4 5 and 6 had rather high sm fig 2 and although field 6 was under irrigation it showed slightly lower sm values than field 5 because precipitations were abundant that season for these fields tuwcd provided the best estimations predicting a range of sm values similar to measurements and showing sensitivity to some wetting and drying events throughout the season fig 10c f stcd and mtbc also showed some sensitivity to sm dynamics but their sm estimates were severely biased underestimated similarly to field 1 field 7 also had an extreme sm drop in march and neither of the approaches was able to estimate these low sm conditions from march to may fig 10g although field 8 also presented a sm drop as field 7 did the estimations were better because sm was higher during spring months due to irrigation events in this field tuwcd had the highest bias because it predicted a high sm level almost the whole period fig 10h 4 discussion the comparative analysis between the three methodologies demonstrated clear benefits after vegetation correction for tuwcd and mtbcd in stcd the results were similar with and without vegetation correction so this pre processing step might be omitted earlier studies already demonstrated that vegetation dynamics and eventually surfaces roughness changes might have a substantial effect on tuwcd results zhu et al 2019 on the other hand stcd obtained optimal results when a sliding window of n 4 was considered as n increased results worsened this can be interpreted as a smoothing effect of n on sm estimates blurring the short term sm dynamics other researchers stated that large n values might foster error propagation in the algorithm palmisano et al 2018 and provide sm estimates affected by changing surface and vegetation conditions in the mid term balenzano et al 2011 the overall performance metrics showed that there was not any approach that clearly outperformed the rest the four approaches obtained median rmse values ranging from 0 08 to 0 11 m3 m3 in terms of bias the tuwcd appeared to have a different behavior as positive bias was found in most test fields contrary to the rest of techniques were negative bias predominated median pearson correlation values ranged from 0 44 to 0 55 but the interpretation of these results had to be done with care since the actual soil moisture dynamic range of each field during the agricultural season might influence correlation in terms of ubrmse results were also very similar with tuwcd and mtbcd achieving a median value of 0 07 m3 m3 and stcd of 0 08 m3 m3 the statistical results of this study are comparable to other works attarzadeh et al 2018 obtained rmse values 0 06 m3 m3 when fitting a svr at the field scale using as input both sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 features benninga et al 2020 used a calibrated version of the iem to obtain field scale sm estimations in sparsely vegetated soils with rmse values of 0 08 0 11 m3 m3 also working at the field scale amazirh et al 2018 obtained a rmse of 0 16 m3 m3 with tuwcd even at coarser resolutions medium correlation values and intrinsic rmse of 0 07 m3 m3 was obtained after applying stcd in larger areas balenzano et al 2021 and rmse in the range 0 08 0 12 m3 m3 was obtained in vegetated areas pulvirenti et al 2018 using other sm estimation methods similar results were also found in wheat ma et al 2020 or in cropland areas benninga et al 2022 qiu et al 2019 results varied strongly from field to field e g rmse values ranged from 0 05 m3 m3 to 0 16 m3 m3 these rather high variability was also encountered in other studies attarzadeh et al 2018 and might be caused by local conditions related to soil texture stoniness etc or crop characteristics ouaadi et al 2020 as well as to the general sm dynamics during the agricultural season on each field the analysis of the performance of the methods based on the actual sm conditions showed that highest errors were obtained in dry conditions sm heterogeneity is known to be higher in dry conditions hupet and vanclooster 2002 and this might influence both the performance of retrieval techniques and the representativity of field measurements in these conditions wet conditions also lead to quite high errors although not as high as in the dry case holtgrave et al 2018 obtained higher errors for wet conditions with a svr model and zhu et al 2022 with the stcd these authors interpreted the poor performance for wet conditions as a consequence of the lower sensitivity of sar backscatter to high sm values intermediate sm conditions produced the best performance metrics sm retrieval at the field scale is challenging due to the high complexity of the sar signal bauer marschallinger et al 2019 especially in vegetated areas although none of the approaches analyzed in this study achieved the target accuracy threshold of ubrmse 0 04 m3 m3 defined for low resolution missions smos or smap gruber et al 2020 the use of these sm products could still be useful even with biases entekhabi et al 2010b as long as the estimations reproduce reasonably the temporal dynamics of sm koster et al 2009 furthermore performance metrics have to be interpreted considering that the accuracy of in situ sm probes after detailed laboratory calibrations are at best rmse 0 02 m3 m3 kizito et al 2008 and rmse 0 035 m3 m3 are typical in real soil conditions kim et al 2020 varble and chávez 2011 with even higher errors reported for near surface layers where rmse values 0 1 m3 m3 can be obtained mittelbach et al 2012 furthermore measurement uncertainty strongly increases with extent scale famiglietti et al 2008 finally the choice of one technique or another is not straightforward as their performance has been found to be similar the use of stcd could be more advantageous as it might not need any vegetation correction however stcd performance depends on the selection of sm bounds tuwcd is simple but its accuracy depends on correcting for vegetation effects in backscatter and setting adequate dry and wet bounds mtbcd is technically more complex as it requires a preliminary implementation of the iem a limitation of this study might be the lack of ground sm data during the summer autumn period further studies focused on this period might complement the results obtained here in addition it would be convenient to perform similar analyses elsewhere 5 conclusions in this study three different sm estimation approaches stcd tuwcd and mtbcd based on sentinel 1 data were evaluated at the agricultural field scale showing similar performance metrics between the estimated and measured sm ubrmse 7 8 m3 m3 in general higher errors were observed for dry conditions sm 0 15 m3 m3 where a positive bias was generally observed particularly for tuwcd this caused a lower accuracy in late spring months particularly in rain fed conditions tuwcd and mtbcd obtained better results after applying a vegetation correction to sentinel 1 data conversely for stcd vegetation correction only resulted in minor improvements in sm estimations from the methodological point of view it should be noted that stcd provided the best results when applied to rather short time windows four s 1 observations or 1 month and considering rather extreme boundary conditions tuwcd required setting dry and wet backscatter bounds which is challenging on agricultural areas subject to crop rotation this was accomplished by means of a regional and multi year characterization of wheat fields backscatter statistics mtbcd required a calibration based on iem simulations that had to be optimized overall the performance of the evaluated techniques was comparable to similar studies yet it might be emphasized that in this study they were applied at the agricultural field scale 1 8 ha therefore results were considered promising for the future application of these techniques in irrigation management it is recommended that similar validation studies be carried out in other locations and conditions to complement the results obtained here funding this work was supported by the spanish ministry of science and innovation and the european regional development fund

8849,soil moisture sm is a key variable in agriculture and its monitoring is essential sm determines the amount of water available to plants having a direct impact on the development of crops on the forecasting of crop yields and on the surveillance of food security microwave remote sensing offers a great potential for estimating sm because it is sensitive to the dielectric characteristics of observed surface that depend on surface soil moisture the objective of this study is the evaluation of three change detection methodologies for sm estimation over wheat at the agricultural field scale based on sentinel 1 time series short term change detection stcd tu wien change detection tuwcd and multitemporal bayesian change detection mtbcd different methodological alternatives were proposed for the implementation of these techniques at the agricultural field scale soil moisture measurements from eight experimental wheat fields were used for validating the methodologies all available sentinel 1 acquisitions were processed and the eventual benefit of correcting for vegetation effects in backscatter time series was evaluated the results were rather variable with some experimental fields achieving successful performance metrics ubrmse 0 05 m3 m3 and some others rather poor ones ubrmse 0 12 m3 m3 evaluating median performance metrics it was observed that both tuwcd and mtbcd methods obtained better results when run with vegetation corrected backscatter time series ubrmse 0 07 m3 m3 whereas stcd produced similar results with and without vegetation correction ubrmse 0 08 m3 m3 the soil moisture content had an influence on the accuracy of the different methodologies with higher errors observed for drier conditions and rain fed fields in comparison to wetter conditions and irrigated fields taking into account the spatial scale of this case study results were considered promising for the future application of these techniques in irrigation management graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil wetness agriculture sar change detection field scale 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable for understanding modeling and forecasting different processes occurring at the earth surface brocca et al 2018 green et al 2019 liu et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2010 wasko and nathan 2019 due to its relevance in 2010 it was recognized as an essential climate variable ecv by the global climate observing system gcos of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc its monitoring is therefore necessary to track our changing climate and design proper mitigation and adaptation measures in agricultural systems sm determines the amount of water available to plants and therefore it has a direct impact on the development of crops and on the forecasting of crop yields therefore sm monitoring is essential for the surveillance of food security lobell and burke 2010 remote sensing has a great potential for sm retrieval due to its capability to observe large areas of the territory repeatedly over time although optical and thermal sensors have potential for sm estimation verstraeten et al 2006 wang and qu 2007 most progress in the last decades has been achieved by the microwave scientific community entekhabi et al 2010a kerr et al 2001 wagner et al 1999 due to the long time known sensitivity of microwave reflectance and emissivity to the dielectric characteristics of observed surfaces which mostly depend on surface sm ulaby and long 2014 in recent years global sm products at coarse spatial resolution 10 50 km have been developed principally based on radiometers or scatterometers brocca et al 2011 chan et al 2016 kerr et al 2012 naeimi et al 2009 synthetic aperture radar sar sensors achieve finer spatial resolutions 10 20 m that might be suitable to work at the scale of agricultural fields this possibility is very appealing as it would enable a field scale sm monitoring with direct implications for irrigation management harvest forecast and disease control however sm estimation at this scale is still challenging peng et al 2021 because sar sensors are also sensitive to other variables related to vegetation bindlish and barros 2001 or soil surface roughness verhoest et al 2008 therefore the inversion of classic bare soil backscatter models such as the physically based integral equation model iem fung 1994 or the semi empirical models of oh et al 1992 dubois et al 1995 or shi et al 1997 is generally ill posed and its operational application not guaranteed moreover sm estimation in vegetated conditions requires the coupling of backscatter models for bare soil and for vegetation zhang et al 2021 one of the most popular models is the semi empirical water cloud model wcm attema and ulaby 1978 which requires external vegetation descriptors and a specific parameterization for the local conditions this case is even more complex although recent progress is being made in the transferability of model parameters to the regional scale benninga et al 2022 the launch of the sentinel 1 satellites in 2014 and 2016 opened new possibilities for the estimation of sm at high spatial resolution their unprecedented compromise between high spatial resolution frequent revisit time and radiometric accuracy torres et al 2012 along with the open data distribution policy and the operational vocation of the copernicus program fostered the development of new methods for sm estimation or the adaptation of existing ones to the characteristics of sentinel 1 data in particular the development of retrieval methods based on change detection techniques that evaluate backscatter changes between consecutive observations has made significant progress the main hypothesis of these methods is that if time series are dense enough the backscatter differences between consecutive observations might only be caused by sm variations since the other variables affecting backscatter e g soil roughness and vegetation could be considered constant during such a short period following this idea different approaches have been developed such as the short term change detection stcd approach balenzano et al 2021 2011 or the tu wien change detection tuwcd model bauer marschallinger et al 2019 wagner et al 1999 on the other hand some other methods following different principles have also been applied to sentinel 1 data such as bayesian approaches notarnicola 2014 notarnicola et al 2006 or machine learning algorithms like random forest regression liu et al 2021 support vector regression svr pasolli et al 2011 or artificial neural network ann baghdadi et al 2012 recently a retrieval method that combined the sliding window approach balenzano et al 2021 with physical scattering models in a stochastic ensemble inversion was proposed zhu et al 2023 with very promising results at present some of these approaches are applied to routinely produce sm products at scales of 1 km balenzano et al 2021 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 which significantly improve the spatial resolution of radiometer or scatterometer based products zappa et al 2022 however for some agricultural applications such as irrigation scheduling this spatial resolution might still be too coarse and sm values at the field scale are ideally sought gao et al 2018 le page et al 2020 modanesi et al 2022 furthermore field size varies significantly around the world white and roy 2015 and many agricultural areas particularly in africa asia and europe are smallholders 2 ha lesiv et al 2019 where high resolution is a necessity for remote sensing to be useful to farmers therefore the applicability and the performance of different sm estimation approaches at the field scale still need to be evaluated the objective of this work is to evaluate different sm estimation approaches based on sentinel 1 data for wheat fields three change detection approaches were selected the stcd approach balenzano et al 2011 the tuwcd model wagner et al 1999 and a multitemporal bayesian change detection mtbcd algorithm notarnicola 2014 these approaches were calibrated on eight experimental fields with available sm measurements and some methodological adaptations were proposed to enhance their applicability to the particular case of wheat fields furthermore the influence of vegetation on backscatter and hence on sm retrievals was accounted for by comparing the results obtained with the original sentinel 1 time series and those obtained after applying the wheat attenuation correction method watcor recently proposed by arias et al 2022b 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil moisture measurements the study focused on eight winter wheat test fields located in the province of navarre spain fig 1 navarre is a small but diverse province regarding climate topography and land use therefore it is divided in seven agricultural regions arias et al 2020 where conditions for crop growth are expected to be rather constant two test fields were located in region r3 rather wet classified as cf2b according to köppen climate classification average annual temperature ta of 12 5ºc and annual rainfall ra of 900 mm four in region r5 intermediate with csb climate class ta 12 7ºc and ra 655 mm and two in region r6 dry with csa climate class ta 14ºc and ra 350 mm two fields were monitored per agricultural year 2017 2018 fields 1 and 2 2018 2019 fields 3 and 4 2019 2020 fields 5 and 6 2020 2021 fields 7 and 8 each year field pairs were managed exactly the same in terms of soil preparation sowing and agricultural management fertilization and other agrichemicals except for irrigation with half of them odd field numbers rain fed and the other half irrigated even field numbers the irrigation system used was sprinkler irrigation with a sprinkler spacing of 15mx18m a design pressure of 3 kg cm2 and an application rate of 6 mm h that lead to an irrigation uniformity of 90 irrigation shifts are scheduled at night table 1 provides additional details several 3 6 capacitance sm probes sentek sensor technologies stepney sa 5069 australia were installed on each field in winter and they were removed just before harvest table 1 these probes recorded volumetric sm every 30 min at 6 different depths from the soil surface down to 60 cm deep the top most measurements 10 cm were used in this study so a basic assumption of this study is that sm is invariant in the top 10 cm of the soil this is important because sentinel 1 sensing depth might vary from 1 cm to 10 cm approximately depending on the actual sm content of the soil ulaby et al 1996 for each field the median sm time series of all the probes installed on it was calculated then these time series that had a 30 min temporal resolution were confronted with sentinel 1 acquisition dates and times selecting only the measurements closest to each sentinel 1 acquisition the final number of measurements used depended on the availability of sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b on each of the three orbits that over flew the study area i e 103asc 8desc and 81desc at best 30 acquisitions were available per orbit table 2 surface sm dynamics varied quite strongly in the different test fields study years fig 2 rain fed fields normally experienced a transition from wet conditions in winter to dry soils in may june e g fields 1 and 7 fig 2a and g however this was not always the case and field 3 fig 2c had already quite dry conditions in winter field 5 fig 2e in turn recorded frequent and significant precipitations during the spring so no clear drying was observed in general irrigation management in fields 2 4 6 and 8 fig 2b d f and h avoided soil drying however keeping in mind that measurements were taken at the soil surface quite rapid dynamics were observed with sm increasing rapidly due to irrigation events and decreasing also quite rapidly afterwards 2 2 satellite imagery and data extraction fig 3 summarizes all the satellite imagery and data needed for implementing the sm estimation techniques investigated detailing the general and specific characteristics of each methodology in the following sections further details and explanations are given 2 2 1 sentinel 1 data sentinel 1 c band sar data was the base of this study in particular the interferometric wide iw swath mode data with a 250 km swath 5 20 m spatial resolution and dual pol vh vv configuration which is the pre defined observation scenario over land in europe all available scenes from 1 september 2015 31 august 2021 covering the province of navarre were downloaded as level 1 ground range detected grd products these images corresponded to one ascending 103asc and two descending orbits 8desc and 81desc images were processed with an automated pipeline implemented in snap graph processing toolbox which followed these steps 1 thermal noise removal 2 slice assembly 3 apply orbit file 4 calibration 5 speckle filtering 3 3 gamma map 6 terrain flattening 7 range doppler terrain correction and 8 subset to the extent of navarre the terrain flattening and terrain correction step employed the srtm 1 s hgt dem as a result γ0 backscatter coefficient images in vh and vv polarizations were produced with a pixel size of 20 m the projected local incidence angle was also obtained as a secondary output for each scene for the eight test fields median backscatter coefficient values were extracted for each sentinel 1 acquisition resulting in backscatter time series in vv and vh polarizations prior to this a 10 m inner buffer was applied to field boundaries to avoid mixed pixels two further processes were applied to the backscatter time series firstly the local incidence angle was normalized to a reference angle of θ 400 by applying an adapted version arias et al 2022a of the methodology proposed by mladenova et al 2013 secondly the influence of wheat canopy in vv backscatter was corrected for with the watcor method arias et al 2022b obtaining a new vv backscatter time series corresponding to the soil named γ0 soil which is assumed to be free of the influence of wheat vegetation cover as opposed to the original backscatter time series γ0 can which corresponds to the complete wheat canopy watcor removes the attenuation pattern produced by the wheat canopy in vv backscatter based on the information contained in the backscatter time series itself with no need for external information or parametrization arias et al 2022b arias et al 2022b evaluated the performance of this method and found that it successfully eliminated wheat attenuation from sentinel 1 backscatter time series improving the correlation with ground measured sm and outperforming the results obtained by approaches based on the water cloud model 2 2 2 esa cci soil moisture product the european space agency esa provides a coarse resolution sm product through its climate change initiative cci dorigo et al 2017 this esa cci sm product is a global product containing daily sm estimates from 1978 until 2021 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 based on active scatterometers and passive radiometers microwave sensors previous studies reported that the esa cci sm product performed accurately wang et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 in this study the v06 1 level 3 combined sm product was used as ancillary data for the stcd approach with this aim the esa cci sm time series of the pixels covering the test fields were downloaded and processed to obtain monthly statistics in particular the minimum maximum and percentiles p05 p15 p25 p75 p85 and p95 were used 2 2 3 regional characterization of wheat backscatter for calibrating the tuwcd model see section 2 3 2 a regional characterization of wheat backscatter was carried out with this aim a gis database containing the field boundaries of all the eu common agricultural policy cap declarations in navarre for years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was used which was provided by the department of agriculture of the government of navarre wheat fields were extracted from this database and processed as follows 1 create subsets for agricultural regions r3 r5 and r6 2 mask out fields smaller than 0 5 ha 3 apply a 5 m inner buffer to the field boundaries 4 compute the median vv backscatter time series per field 5 remove outliers i e the 10 of fields most dissimilar to the median time series of all the fields on a region arias et al 2020 6 normalize backscatter to a local incidence angle of θ 400 and apply watcor after this process backscatter time series of 13 200 wheat fields were obtained for region r3 18 994 for region r5 and 11 401 for region r6 with this data a regional characterization of wheat backscatter was obtained by computing different percentiles of backscatter time series for each region r3 r5 and r6 and orbit pass 103asc 8desc and 81desc 2 3 soil moisture estimation techniques 2 3 1 short term change detection stcd the stcd approach balenzano et al 2011 is a change detection approach that uses dense time series 6 12 days revisit of t co polarized backscatter observations γ 1 0 γ 2 0 γ t 0 to estimate a sm time series sm 1 sm 2 sm t the hypothesis of the methodology is that sm changes occur at a shorter temporal scale days than other parameters affecting the backscatter response e g soil roughness vegetation biomass or canopy structure which vary at a longer temporal scale weeks therefore the ratio between two subsequent sar observations γ 2 0 γ 1 0 in linear units can be expressed as a function of the dielectric constant ɛ and the local incidence angle θ of each observation date eq 1 1 γ 2 0 γ 1 0 α pp 2 ε θ α pp 1 ε θ 2 where α pp is the fresnel reflection coefficient at hh or vv polarization and α vv is defined as follows eq 2 2 α vv ε θ ε 1 sin 2 θ ε 1 sin 2 θ ε cos θ ϵ sin 2 θ 2 for n observations there are n 1 equations with n unknown fresnel coefficients a bounded least squares optimization was used to solve the equation system balenzano et al 2013 once that the α time series were determined for the observations the corresponding ɛ values were obtained and converted into volumetric sm values using the empirical expression of hallikainen et al 1985 the values of the boundary conditions α min α max were found to play an important role in the retrieval accuracy he et al 2017 ideally α min α ma x should correspond to the dynamic range of sm for the study area during the period of observation ouellette et al 2017 in the literature different methods for constraining α min α max can be found for instance some studies used fixed sm values balenzano et al 2011 while others relied on sm field measurements zhang et al 2018 other authors used coarser scale sm values obtained from scatterometers or radiometers al khaldi et al 2019 ouellette et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 in this study the latter approach was followed and thus α min α max were derived from the esa cci sm product with this aim the monthly minimum and maximum esa cci sm values were initially considered supplementary materials 1 but they showed a rather low dynamic range due to their coarser spatial scale so additional schemes were tested enhancing the esa cci sm dynamic range for this the mean monthly sm variation range was estimated through a variable named sm diff eq 3 this variable was added or subtracted to the different esa cci sm monthly percentiles table 3 to find the combination optimally describing α min α max boundary conditions 3 sm diff sm max month sm min month 2 regarding the length of the time series considered palmisano et al 2018 suggested sub dividing the complete backscatter time series t in smaller blocks to avoid error propagation into sm estimations therefore a sliding window of n backscatter observations was considered and the average value of the estimations was calculated shi et al 2021 different values of n 4 5 6 8 12 and 18 were evaluated and the optimum was selected therefore the implementation of this approach had first a calibration phase that consisted in evaluating which combination of α min α max boundary conditions table 3 and n value provided the best results after this calibration phase scheme d and n 4 were identified as optimal so this was the option used in the study supplementary materials 2 1 2 3 2 tu wien change detection model tuwcd the tuwcd model wagner et al 1999 interprets backscatter changes in a time series as changes in soil moisture while other surface properties geometry roughness vegetation etc are considered as static this model is used to produce a global sm product at a resolution of 1 km bauer marschallinger et al 2019 here the algorithm is applied at the field scale using sentinel 1 backscatter time series of each field see section 2 2 1 this model defines the surface soil moisture content ssm as a relative index between 0 and 1 which is estimated from the backscatter value of that particular day normalized with some minimum and maximum backscatter boundary conditions eq 4 4 ssm t γ 0 t γ min 0 γ max 0 γ min 0 where γ 0 t is the backscatter observation in db units at time t and γ min 0 and γ max 0 are the minimum and maximum backscatter values in db units corresponding to dry and saturated soil conditions respectively these values are ideally extracted from long time series where it is likely that the pixel or polygon of interest would reach these dry and saturated conditions some time wagner et al 1999 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 already mentioned that the relatively short length of the sentinel 1 data record might result in an absence of the dry and saturated conditions required to successfully apply this algorithm this might be particularly difficult in humid regions zribi et al 2014 or in agricultural areas with irrigation systems where completely dry conditions might never be met furthermore in agricultural areas more and more often managed under crop rotation schemes european commission 2022 yearly varying crops might also influence backscatter dynamics arias et al 2020 veloso et al 2017 making the selection of γ min 0 and γ max 0 very challenging to overcome this problem this study proposes a regional characterization of backscatter for wheat fields section 2 2 3 for each agricultural region backscatter time series of thousands of wheat fields were obtained for four different years and their statistics minimum maximum and different percentiles were computed and used to calibrate the algorithm that is to select the dry and wet references evaluating different schemes table 4 these different schemes were applied on a calibration phase to select the optimum γ min 0 γ max 0 the results of this calibration see supplementary materials 2 2 showed that scheme 3 was optimal backscatter values below or above the limits were set to 0 and 1 respectively hornáček et al 2012 then relative ssm values were linearly scaled to sm values m3 m3 carranza et al 2019 eq 5 5 sm t sm sat sm wp ssm t sm wp where sm sat is the saturated soil moisture content extracted from soil texture data rawls et al 1982 and sm wp is the wilting point also estimated from soil texture data saxton and rawls 2006 the soil texture of the test fields table 1 was obtained by field sampling and laboratory analyses 2 3 3 multitemporal bayesian change detection approach mtbcd the mtbcd is an inversion procedure for sm estimation based on the bayes theorem adapted from notarnicola 2014 the objective is to infer the unknown soil dielectric constant time series ε 1 ε 1 ε t from the available sentinel 1 backscatter time series γ 1 0 γ 2 0 γ t 0 by applying bayes theorem it is possible to turn probabilities estimated from a training dataset into probabilities for the estimation of the unknown variable ɛ gelman et al 2013 the conditional probability density function pdf p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 ε i which is the probability of finding the vector of γ i 0 given specific values of ε i is estimated from a training set of backscatter values and their corresponding values of ɛ by using the integral equation model iem fung 1994 the theoretical backscatter values γ i iem 0 calculated from the ground sm measurements were obtained these values were compared to the sentinel 1 backscatter values introducing a random variable r that accounts for the sensor noise and model errors notarnicola et al 2008 eq 6 6 γ i 0 r γ i iem 0 the pdf of r is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution eq 7 and its mean μ and standard deviation σ are determined by using the maximum likelihood principle tests were carried out to check whether this distribution adequately represents the data notarnicola et al 2008 7 p r e r μ 2 2 σ 2 2 π σ once that the pdf parameters were calculated the bayes theorem from two consecutive γ 1 0 γ 2 0 observations for obtaining the conditional density function p ε γ 1 0 γ 2 0 was applied eq 8 8 p ε γ 1 0 γ 2 0 p prior ε p post γ 1 0 γ 2 0 ε p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 where p prior is the a priori joint density function for ɛ which can be assumed to follow a uniform density function over the physical range of the parameter p post γ 1 0 γ 2 0 ε is the posterior density function based on measured values p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 is a normalization factor p ε γ 1 0 γ 2 0 can be expressed in terms of the probability density p r by a transformation detailed in notarnicola et al 2006 the optimal estimator ε for ε which has de minimum variance is the conditional mean eq 9 9 ε ε ε min p prior ε 1 γ iem 0 2 p γ 1 0 γ iem 0 p γ 2 0 γ iem 0 d ε p γ 1 0 γ 2 0 where ε min is the minimum value of the uniform density function from p prior this approach needs to be trained and validated for this iem simulations were used since the iem requires as input not only ε but also soil roughness parameters s standard deviation of heights and l correlation length and soil roughness measurements were not available for this study s and l were optimized in total 414 combinations of soil roughness parameters were evaluated s from 0 2 cm to 2 cm with a step of 0 1 cm and l from 2 cm to 25 cm with a step of 1 cm for each combination of s and l the backscatter values were simulated using as input the available sm measurements then the optimization function selected the combination of roughness parameters that minimized the rmse between the observed and simulated backscatter values being s 0 4 cm and l 3 cm see supplementary materials 2 3 the training phase consisted in determining the pdf parameters that were later used for sm estimation in this case a 4 fold cross validation scheme was performed separately for each orbit pass with 6 fields used for training and 2 for validation in each fold 2 4 evaluation of results the performance of the evaluated sm retrieval techniques was assessed with different metrics entekhabi et al 2010b calculated between the volumetric sm recorded by the probes sm obs and the estimated sm sm est with each technique pearson correlation r root mean square error rmse bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse the typical target accuracy threshold defined for low resolution missions e g smos or smap is ubrmse 0 04 m3 m3 gruber et al 2020 each sm est value was compared with the sm obs ground measurement closest to its acquisition time in the evaluation of results performance metrics were reported for each change detection technique and for each test field furthermore the eventual influence that some scene acquisition and field conditions might have in the results were evaluated in particular the sentinel 1 orbit considered the rainfed or irrigated status of the field the month of the year and the wetness of the field 3 results 3 1 comparison between methodologies in this section the global statistical results obtained for each methodology are presented the numerical results for every field and orbit pass using as input both the γ0 can and γ0 soil time series can be found in supplementary materials 3 as an example the results of a sample field field 5 are shown here fig 4 where best results were obtained with tuwcd and γ0 soil fig 5 shows the results of all the fields after computing the performance metrics per orbit pass and field points not only represent the different test fields colors but also the sentinel 1 orbit pass used in each case symbols boxplots represent all the point data summarizing the median and quartiles of the performance metrics obtained for each approach median values of the performance metrics demonstrate a positive effect of the vegetation correction in all techniques in particular γ0 soil metrics improved those obtained with γ0 can in the tuwcd and mtbcd approaches and to a much lesser extent in the stcd different metrics provide different views on the performance of the techniques regarding the rmse best results were obtained with the tuwcd 0 08 m3 m3 followed by stcd 0 09 m3 m3 and mtbcd 0 12 m3 m3 stcd and mtbcd had negative bias and tuwcd a positive one looking at the unbiased ubrmse the tuwcd approach also provided the best results 0 06 m3 m3 but practically matched by the mtbcd and then followed by stcd 0 08 m3 m3 in turn the highest correlation values were obtained by the mtbcd approach 0 52 followed by tuwcd 0 46 and stcd 0 45 looking at field results in detail it can be observed that results varied from case to case with rather large variability ranges for all the metrics rmse 0 05 0 17 m3 m3 bias 0 16 to 0 12 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 04 0 15 m3 m3 and r 0 4 to 0 9 the approaches with the highest variability were tuwcd and mtbcd on the other hand stcd provided more consistent results and had a lower variability this field to field variability might be related to the particular characteristics of each field for instance fields 1 7 and 8 all had a positive bias indicating a systematic overestimation of sm conversely fields 3 4 5 and 6 had a negative bias except for tuwcd the correlation values have to be interpreted with care as they depend on the dynamic range of sm for each field for instance field 3 showed poor r values but successful results in terms of bias rmse and ubrmse for a more in depth analysis the results obtained with each method run with γ0 soil were examined to evaluate the influence of different factors on the retrievals the selected factors were the agricultural water management rain fed or irrigated the satellite orbit passes the month of the year and the soil moisture content 3 2 comparison between rain fed and irrigated fields the results based on the agricultural water management are shown in fig 6 rmse metrics did not differ greatly between rain fed and irrigated fields for mtbcd 0 10 m3 m3 however for stcd and tuwcd approaches the rmse was lower in irrigated fields in general rmse variability error bars in fig 6a was larger for rain fed fields regarding the ubrmse all techniques achieved similar median results 0 08 m3 m3 with slightly lower errors for irrigated conditions specifically fields 1 2 7 and 8 had higher ubrmse 0 08 m3 m3 than fields 3 4 5 and 6 ubrmse 0 05 m3 m3 see supplementary materials 3 in terms of correlation stcd and mtbcd showed higher correlation values for irrigated fields whereas tuwcd did not show any clear difference 3 3 comparison between orbit passes the performance metrics obtained for the three orbit passes fig 7 did not show clear differences in general for each sm estimation technique the values of the performance metrics obtained for the three orbit passes were similar in terms of ubrmse results were slightly better for the ascending pass in tuwcd and mtbcd but differences were minor for tuwcd descending orbits showed a larger variability in terms of rmse and bias than the ascending one correlation results showed minor differences with slightly lower correlations for the ascending orbit in stcd but slightly higher in mtbcd in any case these differences were not significant and performance metrics seemed to vary more strongly depending on the particular field than on the orbit pass 3 4 evaluation of results per month median performance metrics were computed per month to assess the eventual influence of the scene acquisition month on the accuracy fig 8 correlation results in this case are omitted since the sm dynamic range on each month was too small to provide reliable values there were clear differences depending on the month particularly for tuwcd and mtbcd rmse values were lowest in winter months january and february for all cases with values below 0 05 m3 m3 for tuwcd and mtbcd in stcd the rmse was slightly higher 0 075 m3 m3 the rmse in march was higher for all methods except for mtbcd and april may and june obtained the highest errors in all cases 0 08 0 12 m3 m3 rmse was exceptionally high in june in the mtbcd 0 13 m3 m3 regarding ubrmse results tuwcd presented very low values in january and february 0 02 m3 m3 while the remaining months had higher values that did not exceed 0 05 m3 m3 mtbcd also had a very good result in january 0 02 m3 m3 intermediate ones in february march and april 0 035 m3 m3 and higher errors in may and june 0 05 0 06 m3 m3 finally stcd was the approach that had overall the highest ubrmse results with a less marked difference between months although winter months had also the lowest errors 3 5 evaluation of results depending on soil moisture content with the aim of evaluating the performance of the retrieval methods depending on the actual soil moisture content of fields the median performance metrics were computed for three sm levels dry 0 15 m3 m3 intermediate 0 15 m3 m3 0 30 m3 m3 and wet 0 30 m3 m3 the median rmse results fig 9 showed certainly high error values for dry conditions in all the techniques 0 013 0 18 m3 m3 wet conditions also presented relatively high rmse metrics but not as high as in the dry case 0 09 0 011 m3 m3 except for the tuwcd that achieved the best results in wet conditions rmse 0 06 m3 m3 in general the best results were achieved with intermediate moisture conditions with rmse 0 06 m3 m3 for the stcd tuwcd and mtbcd all approaches presented a high positive bias 0 12 m3 m3 for dry conditions conversely bias was negative for wet conditions 0 05 to 0 1 m3 m3 intermediate conditions obtained the lowest bias for all approaches unbiased rmse values ubrmse were similar for the four techniques 0 03 0 05 m3 m3 and did not depend on the actual moisture conditions these results showed that depending on the actual sm content the approaches could overestimate or underestimate sm in fig 10 sm time series for different test fields are displayed to show the behavior of the different approaches fig 2 shows that fields 1 and 2 had a similar sm content during january and february and then sm dropped dramatically in field 1 whereas sm remained slightly higher in field 2 due to irrigation in this case although the evaluated approaches were sensitive to the precipitation event and subsequent soil wetting in april 2018 they did not predict adequately the significant drying of field 1 fig 10a mtbc and stcd approaches estimated sm better in the irrigated field 2 fig 10b on the other hand fields 3 4 5 and 6 had rather high sm fig 2 and although field 6 was under irrigation it showed slightly lower sm values than field 5 because precipitations were abundant that season for these fields tuwcd provided the best estimations predicting a range of sm values similar to measurements and showing sensitivity to some wetting and drying events throughout the season fig 10c f stcd and mtbc also showed some sensitivity to sm dynamics but their sm estimates were severely biased underestimated similarly to field 1 field 7 also had an extreme sm drop in march and neither of the approaches was able to estimate these low sm conditions from march to may fig 10g although field 8 also presented a sm drop as field 7 did the estimations were better because sm was higher during spring months due to irrigation events in this field tuwcd had the highest bias because it predicted a high sm level almost the whole period fig 10h 4 discussion the comparative analysis between the three methodologies demonstrated clear benefits after vegetation correction for tuwcd and mtbcd in stcd the results were similar with and without vegetation correction so this pre processing step might be omitted earlier studies already demonstrated that vegetation dynamics and eventually surfaces roughness changes might have a substantial effect on tuwcd results zhu et al 2019 on the other hand stcd obtained optimal results when a sliding window of n 4 was considered as n increased results worsened this can be interpreted as a smoothing effect of n on sm estimates blurring the short term sm dynamics other researchers stated that large n values might foster error propagation in the algorithm palmisano et al 2018 and provide sm estimates affected by changing surface and vegetation conditions in the mid term balenzano et al 2011 the overall performance metrics showed that there was not any approach that clearly outperformed the rest the four approaches obtained median rmse values ranging from 0 08 to 0 11 m3 m3 in terms of bias the tuwcd appeared to have a different behavior as positive bias was found in most test fields contrary to the rest of techniques were negative bias predominated median pearson correlation values ranged from 0 44 to 0 55 but the interpretation of these results had to be done with care since the actual soil moisture dynamic range of each field during the agricultural season might influence correlation in terms of ubrmse results were also very similar with tuwcd and mtbcd achieving a median value of 0 07 m3 m3 and stcd of 0 08 m3 m3 the statistical results of this study are comparable to other works attarzadeh et al 2018 obtained rmse values 0 06 m3 m3 when fitting a svr at the field scale using as input both sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 features benninga et al 2020 used a calibrated version of the iem to obtain field scale sm estimations in sparsely vegetated soils with rmse values of 0 08 0 11 m3 m3 also working at the field scale amazirh et al 2018 obtained a rmse of 0 16 m3 m3 with tuwcd even at coarser resolutions medium correlation values and intrinsic rmse of 0 07 m3 m3 was obtained after applying stcd in larger areas balenzano et al 2021 and rmse in the range 0 08 0 12 m3 m3 was obtained in vegetated areas pulvirenti et al 2018 using other sm estimation methods similar results were also found in wheat ma et al 2020 or in cropland areas benninga et al 2022 qiu et al 2019 results varied strongly from field to field e g rmse values ranged from 0 05 m3 m3 to 0 16 m3 m3 these rather high variability was also encountered in other studies attarzadeh et al 2018 and might be caused by local conditions related to soil texture stoniness etc or crop characteristics ouaadi et al 2020 as well as to the general sm dynamics during the agricultural season on each field the analysis of the performance of the methods based on the actual sm conditions showed that highest errors were obtained in dry conditions sm heterogeneity is known to be higher in dry conditions hupet and vanclooster 2002 and this might influence both the performance of retrieval techniques and the representativity of field measurements in these conditions wet conditions also lead to quite high errors although not as high as in the dry case holtgrave et al 2018 obtained higher errors for wet conditions with a svr model and zhu et al 2022 with the stcd these authors interpreted the poor performance for wet conditions as a consequence of the lower sensitivity of sar backscatter to high sm values intermediate sm conditions produced the best performance metrics sm retrieval at the field scale is challenging due to the high complexity of the sar signal bauer marschallinger et al 2019 especially in vegetated areas although none of the approaches analyzed in this study achieved the target accuracy threshold of ubrmse 0 04 m3 m3 defined for low resolution missions smos or smap gruber et al 2020 the use of these sm products could still be useful even with biases entekhabi et al 2010b as long as the estimations reproduce reasonably the temporal dynamics of sm koster et al 2009 furthermore performance metrics have to be interpreted considering that the accuracy of in situ sm probes after detailed laboratory calibrations are at best rmse 0 02 m3 m3 kizito et al 2008 and rmse 0 035 m3 m3 are typical in real soil conditions kim et al 2020 varble and chávez 2011 with even higher errors reported for near surface layers where rmse values 0 1 m3 m3 can be obtained mittelbach et al 2012 furthermore measurement uncertainty strongly increases with extent scale famiglietti et al 2008 finally the choice of one technique or another is not straightforward as their performance has been found to be similar the use of stcd could be more advantageous as it might not need any vegetation correction however stcd performance depends on the selection of sm bounds tuwcd is simple but its accuracy depends on correcting for vegetation effects in backscatter and setting adequate dry and wet bounds mtbcd is technically more complex as it requires a preliminary implementation of the iem a limitation of this study might be the lack of ground sm data during the summer autumn period further studies focused on this period might complement the results obtained here in addition it would be convenient to perform similar analyses elsewhere 5 conclusions in this study three different sm estimation approaches stcd tuwcd and mtbcd based on sentinel 1 data were evaluated at the agricultural field scale showing similar performance metrics between the estimated and measured sm ubrmse 7 8 m3 m3 in general higher errors were observed for dry conditions sm 0 15 m3 m3 where a positive bias was generally observed particularly for tuwcd this caused a lower accuracy in late spring months particularly in rain fed conditions tuwcd and mtbcd obtained better results after applying a vegetation correction to sentinel 1 data conversely for stcd vegetation correction only resulted in minor improvements in sm estimations from the methodological point of view it should be noted that stcd provided the best results when applied to rather short time windows four s 1 observations or 1 month and considering rather extreme boundary conditions tuwcd required setting dry and wet backscatter bounds which is challenging on agricultural areas subject to crop rotation this was accomplished by means of a regional and multi year characterization of wheat fields backscatter statistics mtbcd required a calibration based on iem simulations that had to be optimized overall the performance of the evaluated techniques was comparable to similar studies yet it might be emphasized that in this study they were applied at the agricultural field scale 1 8 ha therefore results were considered promising for the future application of these techniques in irrigation management it is recommended that similar validation studies be carried out in other locations and conditions to complement the results obtained here funding this work was supported by the spanish ministry of science and innovation and the european regional development fund
