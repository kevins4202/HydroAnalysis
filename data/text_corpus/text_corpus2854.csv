14270,membrane technology has raised considerable interest in sustainable water purification over the past decade the development of antifouling membranes is always the basic approach to address the omnipresent bottlenecks of the membrane fouling in this study alsi2o6 nanoparticles were synthesized using a coprecipitation technique and their influence was investigated on the permeation and antifouling properties of ultrafiltration uf membranes of polysulfone psf a series of membranes were fabricated with various concentrations such as 0 0 2 5 5 and 7 5 wt of alsi2o6 nanoparticles through diffusion induced phase separation method the prepared composite membranes demonstrate homogeneous nanoparticles dispersion greater surface hydrophilicity elevated surface roughness and greater mechanical strength the membrane s separation efficiency and antifouling property rises with increased concentration of alsi2o6 results suggest that with higher concentration of alsi2o6 the water fluxes as well as separation efficiency of oil in water nanoemulsion increase up to 95 furthermore the antifouling characteristics of composite membranes are efficiently enhanced by separating 100 mg l of oil in water nanoemulsion 200 nm size with a flux recovery ratio of up to 97 even though 52 percent of total fouling therefore these membranes can be expected to become a competitive candidate for the separation of oil water emulsions separation in the scope of environmental protection keywords polysulfone antifouling nanocomposite flux decline alsi2o6 1 introduction everyday more and more oily wastewater is produced from transportation food processing dyestuff and petrochemical industries during oil production 1 2 the discharged oily wastewater pollutes surface and ground waters as well as soil which leads to a significant deleterious impact on the environment 3 a significant attention has been paid to membrane technology for the treatment of oil in water emulsions ultrafiltration uf membranes are receiving increased attention because the pore size is usually in the range of 0 002 0 05 μm and the oil droplets size in emulsion is usually in the range of 0 1 10 μm and thus oil droplets could be effectively removed by using uf membranes 4 6 however the life span of the membrane is a major issue because of fouling furthermore membrane surface hydrophilicity and pore structures play an important role with excellent antifouling properties in the membrane separation process an effective membrane must have good hydrophilicity permeability and great chemical resistance to the streams of feed high surface porosity and appropriate pore structures are vital to achieve extremely permeable membranes thus the most appropriate choice for this purpose seems to be asymmetric membranes 7 8 polysulfone psf is one of the finest polymers to form asymmetric membranes among all polymer materials 9 indeed despite a low fabrication cost psf based membranes are perfectly suitable due to their good mechanical and anticompaction properties and their strong thermal and chemical stabilities including outstanding acidic and alkaline resistance despite many interesting properties hydrophobicity is a major issue that affects the performance due to membrane fouling 10 for this reason to enhance their hydrophilicity and antifouling characteristics it is essential to alter psf membranes recently many psf membrane modification studies have concentrated on mixing inorganic materials nanoparticles to enhance their hydrophilicity the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into the membrane matrix improves permeability and allows a better control over the membrane surface properties 11 15 among numerous inorganic nanoparticles that can be introduced in the polymer matrix such as silica sio2 16 zirconium dioxide zro2 12 fe3o4 17 szy 18 tio2 sio2 19 mixtures of metal oxides are often chosen because of combined chemical properties which lead to convenient operation and mild reactivity till now several antifouling membranes have been developed and produced by constantly altering the geometric structure of the membrane surface snd core applied to separate oil in water emulsion 20 21 hydrophilic and oleophobic membranes are particularly desirable for the type of water removal 22 23 yan et al recently reported the preparation of hydrophilic pvdf membrane with a nano sized al2o3 as an inorganic additive 24 ahmad et al used composite technique to fabricate hydrophilic polysufonemembranes with a functionalized sio2 25 in practical application the use of a facial and 3d modification by blending approach to the constraction of high performance membranes is of great importance alsi2o6 is the best choice to modify the core structure of the polymer membrane and construct a structure of roughness due to its strong adhesion hydrophilicity antioxidation and low toxicity etc 25 additionally alsi2o6 is introduced to the membrane matrix through a simple 3d modification aproch in a mild condition that not only retains uniform dispersion of alsi2o6 on the membrane surface and core but also increases the durable stability of the nanocomposite membrane to the best of our knowledge alsi2o6 modified polysulfone based antifouling membrane is not reported in the present study psf ultrafiltration membranes are modified by alsi2o6 nanoparticles using phase inversion method 26 the surface and the core structure of modified and unmodified psf membranes were studied using field emission scanning electron microscope fesem atomic force microscopy afm energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection infra red atr ir spectroscopy the water uptake contact angle water flux and oil retention efficiency of the membranes were also examined towards oil in water emulsion filtration experiment results indicated that the 3d modified membrane efficiently anhanced the hydophilicity porocity and antifouling property 1 1 materials aluminium nitrate al no3 3 9h2o ammonium hydroxide nh4oh tetraethyl orthosilicate teos and ethanol purchased from reachem russia were used as precursor for the preparation of the alsi2o6 nanoparticles the polysulfone psf 32000 da and 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp were purchased from sigma aldrich india sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was supplied by avra india machine oil 90 of pure base oil and remaining 10 of the additives which posseses the density of about 881 4 kg m3 at 25 c was received from bangalore india the chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade and thus used without further purification 1 2 alsi2o6 nanoparticles synthesis via precipitation method a solution of aluminum nitrate 0 33 m was firstly prepared to it teos 0 67 m added dropwise and followed by additon of required amount of ethanol the solution ph was then adjusted to 12 with nh4oh the precipitate formed at this ph was washed several times with deionized water for removing unreacted elements when a ph of 7 is attained the final precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at around 4000 rpm precipitate was further dried in the oven for about 2 h at 40 c finally the white powder was recovered and subjected for various characterizations 1 3 fabrication of mixed matrix membrane all the psf alsi2o6 mixed matrix membranes were synthesized by diffusion induced phase separation dips proccess 26 and compared with a prepared psf control membrane various concentrations of synthesized alsi2o6 nanoparticles were dispersed in nmp 16 ml with ultrasonic vibration to obtain a uniform particle dispersion the specified amount wt of psf was dissolved in the above solution at 45 c and the latter stirred for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension at room temperature the viscous casting solutions were degassed at 25 c for at least 24 h the final suspension was dispersed uniformly on a glass plate where two edges are covered with the tape and membrane is casted using casting rodto get membrane of uniform thickness the casted film was immediately immersed into a distilled water bath at room temperature to allow phase separation after phase inversion the membrane was transferred to another water bath for 1 or 2 days to remove any residual solvent from the membrane structure and gain mechanical strength the membrane composition is tabulated in table 1 1 4 porosity the porosity of the membrane was investigated to check the effect of blending nanoparticle on membrane pore size by gravimetric method using the following equation 27 31 1 ε w w w d ρ w a l 100 where ww is the wet weight of the membrane and wd is the dry weight of the membranes respectively ρw is the water density 0 998 g cm 3 a is the effective area and l is the thickness of the membrane 1 5 water uptake the membrane s water absorption capacity was determined by taking 3 cm2 of membrane areas these membranes were carefully rinsed with deionized water and then dried for 24 h in vacuum desiccators until we noted a constant weight dried membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h then water absorbed membrane was taken out and excess water on the surface ware wiped by using tissue paper the membrane s swollen weight was weighed rapidly the degree of water absorption property was calculated using the formula below 32 2 w a t e r u p t a k e w w w d w d 100 where ww is the weight of the wet membrane and wd is the weight of the dried membrane 1 6 pure water flux and hydraulic permeability measurement pure water flux was evaluated using in house constructed stirred cell dead end filtration unit with a nitrogen cylinder to provide the necessary pressure the 5 cm2 diameter membrane was put at the bottom of the stired cell the top surface of the membrane facing the incoming feed water flux at 25 c was measured at 2 4 6 8 and 10 bar pressure the equations below were used to calculate the pure water flux and hydraulic permeability for the membrane 33 3 p u r e w a t e r f l u x j w v a o δ t 4 p e r m e a b i l i t y j w δ p where jw v a0 δt and δp is the pure water flux permeate flux permeated water volume membrane effective area measurement time and applied pressure across the membrane respectively 1 7 membrane antifouling study the rejection of the synthetic oil in water emulsions was investigated using nano composite membranes of different concentrations in a dead end filtration unit a piece of membrane separation area is 0 001256 m2 was fixed in the bottom of the unit a mechanical agitator was stirred 3 mm above membrane surface at 300 rpm during the separation process 750 ml of an oil in water emulsion permeated the membrane under a pressure difference from 200 kpa to 1000 kpa for each separation cycle the filtrate water was collected and the oil content in the filtrate was determined the percentage of rejection was calculated using the following equation 27 5 r e j e c t i o n r c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp is the concentration of oil in the feed and permeate respectively the antifouling property was explored by evaluating the permeability as a function of time as well as the percentage of the water flux recovery after fouling the membrane was pre compacted in a dead end filtration cell filled with di water at applied pressure of 10 bar under nitrogen gas and the pure water flux jw 1 was then measured using eq 4 afterwards the feed was switched to o w emulsion 100 mg l to obtain the permeability at a stirring rate of 300 rpm and 10 bar n2 pressure the flux was calculated at different time intervals for 1 5 h after the filtration the membrane was cleaned by rinsing with hot di water for 30 min and dead end stirred cell was washed with the soap solution and hot water further membrane was reused for pure water flux jw 2 was calculated again at the same pressure the fouling resistance in terms of flux recovery ratio frr of the membrane was calculated according to the following equation 29 31 34 35 6 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 where jw 1 is the pure water flux of the before fouling and jw2 is the pure water flux of membrane after fouling in generally higher frr is a better antifouling property of the membrane to get a detailed idea of the fouling process total fouling ratio rt reversible fouling ratio rr and irreversible fouling ratio rir were calculated by using the following equations 36 37 7 r t 1 j p j w 1 100 8 r r j w 2 j p j w 1 100 9 r i r j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 r t r r where jp is the o w emulsion permeation flux at a filtration time of 90 min 2 results and discussion 2 1 characterization of alsi2o6 nanoparticles fig 1 a shows the pxrd patterns for the synthesized nanoparticles the obtained pattern is found to match the icdd standard data for al0 32si0 68o2 entry number 96 901 6279 38 which clearly reveals the al0 32si0 68o2 phase purity material the 2θ values of pxrd patterns peaks of 20 26 21 74 22 14 23 20 25 90 and 27 53 correspond to rhombohedral crystal system of alsi2o6 the surface morphology of the synthesized alsi2o6 nanoparticles were investigated by fesem analysis and images are provided in fig 1b and c the various magnified sem images clearly show the occurence of nanoparticles with soft agglomerations the particle diameter is found to be in the range of 24 36 nm sem edx spectral data of the alsi2o6 nanoparticles were displayed in the figure s3 the edx analysis confirms the presence of al si and o atoms in the alsi2o6 which demonstrates the successful synthesis of alsi2o6 nanoparticles it should be mentioned that the presence of pt in the edx is due to sputter coating porosity and surface area of the synthesized alsi2o6 nps were characterized using bet analysis fig 1d draws the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve for alsi2o6 nps which highlights a type iv isotherm the surface area of alsi2o6 nps was ascertained to be 257 26 m2 g 1 via bet analysis 2 2 membrane characterization 2 2 1 membrane morphology study the images of membrane surface are shown in fig 2 fig 2a corresponding to the control membrane and fig 2b d corresponding to various compositions of nps it can be seen that the nature of the alsi2o6 dispersion on the membrane surface depends on the concentration of nps however figure s3d shows that the surface pores are mostly formed in the vicinity of alsi2o6 aggregates these facts indicate that a greater addition of nps into the membrane increases the viscosity of casting solution resulting in a slight pore enlargement at the membrane surface this enlargement can be attributed to the stress enhancement between polymer matrix and nps arising from the organic shrinkage that occurs during the phase inversion process 39 the cross section morphology of the membrane is shown in fig 3 for the control membrane 1a and for nps embedded in the polymer matrix 3b 3c 3d in neat psf membrane m sponge like layer is very thick compared to the other membranes fig 3b d the membrane skin layer along with prominent finger like projections in the sub layer changed with the various additions of alsi2o6 nps into the membrane matrix for membrane m1 and m2 brad finger like projections with large pores in the bottom layer are observed with m3 membrane the three layers of the structure appear to be merged giving one single layer with sponge like and brad finger like projections 40 this behavior with the amount of nps is presumably owing to the greater thermodynamic stability in the coagulation bath system when the solvent and polymer were brought into contact for this region not much more changes were observed in the inner structure of the m1 and m2 membranes because the radius of gyration rg of the linear polymer is greater than that of nps rp 41 an increase in alsi2o6 content m3 enhances the casting solution s viscosity and reduces thermodynamic stability disturbing the penetration of nps closer into the polymer matrix during the process of phase inversion 42 the concentration of nps therefore plays a significant part in altering the structure as well as the synthesized membrane performance the sem edx spectra of the plane psf and alsi2o6 psf composites are displayed in the fig s4 the analysis of edx confirms the existence of atoms c n o and s in the control psf membrane fig s4 the alsi2o6 psf composites show a fresh peak for si and al the intensity of the o peak observed in the composite membrane is higher than that of the control psf membrane fig s4 these facts indicate the well dispersion of incorporated alsi2o6 nanoparticles in the psf polymer matrix indeed as we increased the nps concentration into the membrane elemental composition of the si al and o percentage was increased similarly this result also substainted the elemental mapping of membrane surface and cross section m3 as shown in fig 4 a c si and al stay together and evenly distributed nanoparticle on both surfaces and cross sectional channel across the membrane were promising to further enhance the hydrophilicity and antifouling property of the composite membranes 2 2 2 structural study of the alsi2o6 psf composite by xrd and atr ir analysis fig 5 a shows the xrd pattern of the alsi2o6 nps neat psf control and the alsi2o6 psf composites with various alsi2o6 nps contents the xrd patterns showed amorphous alsi2o6 nps and semi crystalline psf for 2θ 23 20 and 17 6 respectively which is consistent with literature 43 there are no changes in the xrd data of m1 m2 and m3 composite membranes however compared to the control psf membrane fig 5a the intensity of the peaks was reduced this could be increased by the amorphous alsi2o6 nps content into psf which leads to an increase of the graphitization degree and increased transformation of the crystal structure from γ form to α form with the addition of alsi2o6 nps as discussed in the literature 43 the atr ir spectra are exhibited in fig 5b and it reveals the molecular interaction existing between the polymer matrix and the nps the atr ir spectra of alsi2o6 nps shows typical peak at 1055 cm 1 corresponding to the si o si bond the peak at 900 800 cm 1 appears because of v sioh in the alsi2o6 nps these results highlight the successful synthesis of nanoparticles the ir spectra of control psf peak at 2967 cm 1 is attributed to the c h stretching and coc stretching was due to the existence of a strong peak at 1242 cm 1 finally the oso stretching corresponds to the peaks at 1150 cm 1 and 1105 cm 1 44 psf and alsi2o6 psf s prominent bands remain the same 2 2 3 surface roughness of the membrane fig 6 presents the three dimensional afm images of the membrane surface in the scanning range of 10 μm the incorporation of the alsi2o6 nps into the psf membrane tends to increase the surface roughness and rougher surface are obtained compared with the unmodified membrane the mean surface roughness ra of the control psf membrane was 10 74 nm whereas that of composite m1 m2 and m3 membranes was 11 04 15 25 and 23 45 nm respectively fig 6 this means that the surface roughness of the composite membranes slightly increases with the concentration of nps the hydrophillic alsi2o6 particles penetrate into the membrane surface during phase inversion process which leads to higher surface roughness of the membrane however alsi2o6 mixed metal oxide nanoparticles are highly porous in nature fig 1d water molecules can permeate easily which decreases the anti fouling properties their accumulation on the membrane surface also increases the effective filtration area of the membrane which tends to efficiently increase permeation flux i̇t should be noted that surface roughness can increase membrane fouling to owing contaminants accumulation in the valleys of rough membrane surfaces however in our case accumulation of hydrophilic alsi2o6 nps on the membrane necessarily enhances the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane reducing interactions between contaminants and the membrane surface for this reason it is expected that the addition of alsi2o6 nps in membrane matrix enhances anti fouling properties as well as filtration performances 2 2 4 water uptake porosity and contact angle of the membrane the wettability water uptake capacity and porosity of control psf and composite membranes are provided in fig 7 it can be seen that the increasing of the alsi2o6 particle concentration causes a decrease in the water contact angle from 75 to 64 this indicates that the addition of alsi2o6 nps to psf polymer enhances membrane hydrophilicity as expected as can be noticed control psf membrane shows a lower water uptake capacity than the composite membrane this observation is due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the polymer which resists the absorbtion of water this result was also supported by contact angle measurements 75 28 for the psf the water uptake capacity of the composite membrane m1 m2 and m3 increases proportionately from 20 91 to 97 91 fig 7 with the increase in concentration of alsi2o6 nps the incorporation of the hydrophilic alsi2o6 nps into the polymer matrix facilitates absorption of water and hence its affinity towards water the alsi2o6 nps composite membranes show higher porosity than the control psf membrane indeed the addition of a certain amount of alsi2o6 nps into the polymer matrix enhances the formation of larger pores in the vicinity because of the higher surface energy of the nanoparticle aggregate and defects the membrane inner structure the pore enlargement is probably due to interfacial stresses between the polymer and alsi2o6 nps resulting in the formation of interfacial pores the shrinkage of organic phase during the precipitation process of phase inversion indeed causes an increase in average pore size with the addition of lower amount of alsi2o6 nps 45 therefore a low content of alsi2o6 nps has an effect on the macrostructure and change in the inner pore of the membrane 2 2 5 mechanicla property study of composite membranes the membrane ware s mechanical stability is determined by the tensile strength and stress strain curve data as shown in fig 8 a and b it was evident that the addition of alsi2o6 nanoparticles into the psf matrix considerably improves the tensile strength from 3 04 to 4 85 mpa the alsi2o6 composite membranes displayed higher mechanical strength comparatively pristine psf membrane which could be attributed to the electrostatic interactions or suitability between alsi2o6 and psf matrix owing to the outstanding mechanical strength high aspect ratio and elevated np surface area the synergistic impact could decrease the possibility of loss of mechanical property due to interfacial defects or bad compatibility in order to improve the mechanical properties of hybrid membranes however m2 membrane demonstrated the highest mechanical strength further addition of nps resulted in a decrease in tensile strength potentially owing to the expanded porous architecture in the membrane structure 2 3 membrane perpormence study 2 3 1 permeation rejection and antifouling study of membranes the pure water flux and oil rejection of the prepared alsi2o6 psf composite membranes are presented in fig 9 a and b control neat psf membrane are not provided in fig 9 since it exhibits very low flux due to its high hydrophobic nature fig 9a represents the membrane flux vs time for the composite membranes water flux is only slightly reduced between 20 200 min which means that the mixed metal oxide nanocomposite membranes exhibit a good performance and mechanical stability fig 9b represents the rejection of oil throughout 120 min of filtration for all the composite membranes the oil rejection remains almost constant over time for m1 and m2 membranes i e slightly inceases from 90 to 99 for the former and slightly decreases from 99 to 96 for the latter oppositely the large amount of nps added for in m3 membrane leads to a significant drop of oil rejection over time from 88 to 60 probably due to the more flux fig 9a and the higher pore size fig 3d of the membrane furthermore while the membrane surface is charged pores eventually collapse owing to external forces and slight fouling occurs unlike expectations fouling does not boost rejection but reduces it this means that fouling is necessarily significant enough to influence flux rather than rejection this can also infer that the process of rejection is largely controlled by the charge of the membrane over the volume of the pore and therefore the reduction in the size of the pore due to fouling does not influence rejection fouling can suppress the charge required to maintain the oil in water emulsions resulting in a decrease rejection 46 membrane fouling in the separation membrane is a bottleneck issue so fouling resistance is a significant membrane efficiency index oil is one of wastewater s most prevalent foulants therefore the psf alsi2o6 composite membranes antifouling property was assessed using emulsified machine oil as the foulant 0 1 g l of oil in water solution was filtered fig 10 shows the time dependent flux evolution of the prepared composite membranes before and after oil rejection control psf membrane is still not drawn because of very low flux from fig 10a it can firstly be observed that the flux drastically decreases when the feed was switched from pure water to oil in water solution this trend which is partially due to an increase in overall solution viscosity appears to be more marked for m2 and m3 membranes than for m1 membrane this difference could probably be attributed to higher adsorption or deposition of oil on the membrane surface with m2 and m3 membranes this accumulation could cause the formation of an oil cake layer at the membrane surface leading to a progressive decline of flux from fig 10a it can be seen that flux of the m1 and m2 membranes almost recovers their initial water flux after switching back to pure water this means that these membranes are weakly fouled by oil oppositely water flux of the m3 composite membrane was not fully recovered probably due to its rougher surface ra 23 45 nm rq 30 25 nm rz 107 59 nm compared to the others cf fig 6 this means that this membrane is more severely impacted by oil accumulation at the membrane surface membrane fouling can be qualified as reversible or irreversible with reversible fouling foulants are loosely attached on the membrane surface and can thus be easily removed by washing with water on the other hand deposit that strongly adheres on membrane surface and cannot be removed by washing with water is called irreversible fouling fig 10b provides flux recovery ratio for all the investigated membranes and values obtained for the m1 m2 and m3 membranes were 86 97 and 75 respectively this indicates that higher water flux recoveries can be achieved with the composite membranes due to their improved hydrophilic nature and low cake resistance leading to better antifouling properties 47 the fig 10b reveals that the total fouling resistance of the prepared composite membrane m1 is lower in comparison with the m2 and m3 membrane and the irreversible resistance of the composite membranes was considerably reduced in all the cases additionally it seems that m2 membrane is more prone to reversible fouling but with a very little propensity to irreversible fouling the flux recovery ratio frr reversible resistance rr and irreversible resistance rir of composite membranes were improved and the membrane surface properties were modified successfully alsi2o6 psf composite membranes antifouling efficiency was competitive with elevated rate of flux recovery the implementation of alsi2o6 nps could considerably enhance alsi2o6 psf composite membranes antifouling characteristics it was suggested that the alsi2o6 psf composite membranes resisted oil fouling through the hydraulic layer barrier synergy and electrostatic repulsion barrier resulting in elevated flux recovery capacity and low irreversible fouling psf alsi2o6 composite membranes greater hydrophilicity and hydraulic capacity was useful for binding hydration layers on membrane surfaces the resulting layers of hydration could act as physical and energy barriers to oil fouling leading in adherence of oil droplets to membrane surfaces in an negative thermodynamic state 23 48 the barrier to the hydration layer should play a critical part in improving the antifouling property of the membrane furthermore the electrostatic repulsion barrier created between high surface negativity hybrid membranes and negatively charged emulsified oil also inhibited oil adsorption and deposition which also played a non ignorable role in the favorable antifouling capacity of the alsi2o6 psf composite membrane 3 conclusions a straightforward composite technique was adopted in this research for the easy preparation of the novel antifouling membrane based on alsi2o6 through the subsequent non solvent induced phase separation method the alsi2o6 nanoparticle was succefuly induced in psf membrane matrix with an improved hydrophilicity surface energy and more porous structure ultimately once applied to oil water emulsion separation the as prepared alsi2o6 psf composite membrane showed extremely enhanced permeability and antifouling efficiency in the case of 5 alsi2o6 psf m2 composite membrane with water flux up to 96 2 l m2 h superior hybrid membrane quality was noted and flux recovery was greater than 97 percent using a 0 1 g l oil in water emulsion feed solution showing the consistent and comprehensive antifouling properties of composite membranes in contradiction of oil foulant in addition even afterward two fouling cleaning test cycles the 5 percent alsi2o6 psf m2 composite membrane was also fitted with the recyclable antifouling performance for extremely focused oil water emulsion separation in conclusion the general findings highlighted the potential for the development of antifouling membranes in composite strategy and suggested promising future applications of prepared antifouling composite membranes alsi2o6 psf in industrial oily water treatment acknowledgements the work was carried out with financial support from the department of science and technology for

100 mg l of oil in water nanoemulsion 200 nm size with a flux recovery ratio of up to 97 even though 52 percent of total fouling therefore these membranes can be expected to become a competitive

waters as well as soil which leads to a significant deleterious impact on the environment 3 a significant attention has been paid to membrane technology for the treatment of oil in water emulsions ultrafiltration uf membranes are receiving increased attention because the pore size is usually in the range of 0 002 0 05 μm and the oil droplets size in emulsion is usually in the range of 0 1 10 μm and thus oil droplets could be effectively removed by using uf membranes 4 6 however the life span of the membrane is a major issue because of fouling furthermore membrane surface hydrophilicity and pore structures play an important role with excellent antifouling properties in the membrane separation process an effective membrane must have good hydrophilicity permeability and great chemical resistance to the streams of feed high surface porosity and appropriate pore structures are vital to achieve extremely permeable membranes thus the most appropriate choice for this purpose seems to be

washed several times with deionized water for removing unreacted elements when a ph of 7 is attained the final precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at around 4000 rpm precipitate was further dried in the oven for about 2 h at 40 c finally the white powder was recovered and subjected for various characterizations 1 3 fabrication of mixed matrix membrane all the psf alsi2o6 mixed matrix membranes were synthesized by diffusion induced phase separation dips proccess 26 and compared with a prepared psf control membrane various concentrations of synthesized alsi2o6 nanoparticles were dispersed in nmp 16 ml with ultrasonic vibration to obtain a uniform particle dispersion the specified amount wt of psf was dissolved in the above solution at 45 c and the latter stirred for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension at room temperature the viscous casting solutions were degassed at 25 c for at least 24 h the final suspension was dispersed uniformly on a glass plate where two edges are covered with the tape and membrane is casted using casting rodto get membrane of uniform thickness the casted film was immediately immersed into a distilled water bath at room temperature to allow phase separation after phase inversion the membrane was transferred to another water bath for 1 or 2 days to remove any residual solvent from the membrane structure and gain mechanical strength the membrane composition is tabulated in table 1 1 4 porosity the porosity of the membrane was investigated to check the effect of blending nanoparticle on membrane pore size by gravimetric method using the following equation 27 31 1 ε w w w d ρ w a l 100 where ww is the wet weight of the membrane and wd is the dry weight of the membranes respectively ρw is the water density 0 998 g cm 3 a is the effective area and l is the thickness of the membrane 1 5 water uptake the membrane s water absorption capacity was determined by taking 3 cm2 of membrane areas these membranes were carefully rinsed with deionized water and then dried for 24 h in vacuum desiccators until we noted a constant weight dried membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h then water absorbed membrane was taken out and excess water on the surface ware wiped by using tissue paper the membrane s swollen weight was weighed rapidly the degree of water absorption property was calculated using the formula below 32 2 w a t e r u p t a k e w w w d w d 100 where ww is the weight of the wet membrane and wd is the weight of the dried membrane 1 6 pure water flux and hydraulic permeability measurement pure water flux was evaluated using in house constructed stirred cell dead end filtration unit with a nitrogen cylinder to provide the necessary pressure the 5 cm2 diameter membrane was put at the bottom of the stired cell the top surface of the membrane facing the incoming feed water flux at 25 c was measured at 2 4 6 8 and 10 bar pressure the equations below were used to calculate the pure water flux and hydraulic permeability for the membrane 33 3 p u r e w a t e r f l u x j w v a o δ t 4 p e r m e a b i l i t y j w δ p where jw v a0 δt and δp is the pure water flux permeate flux permeated water volume membrane effective area measurement time and applied pressure across the membrane respectively 1 7 membrane antifouling study the rejection of the synthetic oil in water emulsions was investigated using nano composite membranes of different concentrations in a dead end filtration unit a piece of membrane separation area is 0 001256 m2 was fixed in the bottom of the unit a mechanical agitator was stirred 3 mm above membrane surface at 300 rpm during the separation process 750 ml of an oil in water emulsion permeated the membrane under a pressure difference from 200 kpa to 1000 kpa for each separation cycle the filtrate water was collected and the oil content in the filtrate was determined the percentage of rejection was calculated using the following equation 27 5 r e j e c t i o n r c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp is the concentration of oil in the feed and permeate respectively the antifouling property was explored by evaluating the permeability as a function of time as well as the percentage of the water flux recovery after fouling the membrane was pre compacted in a dead end filtration cell filled with di water at applied pressure of 10 bar under nitrogen gas and the pure water flux jw 1 was then measured using eq 4 afterwards the feed was switched to o w emulsion 100 mg l to obtain the permeability at a stirring rate of 300 rpm and 10 bar n2 pressure the flux was calculated at different time intervals for 1 5 h after the filtration the membrane was cleaned by rinsing with hot di water for 30 min and dead end stirred cell was washed with the soap solution and hot water further membrane was reused for pure water flux jw 2 was calculated again at the same pressure the fouling resistance in terms of flux recovery ratio frr of the membrane was calculated according to the following equation 29 31 34 35 6 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 where jw 1 is the pure water flux of the before fouling and jw2 is the pure water flux of membrane after fouling in generally higher frr is a better antifouling property of the membrane to get a detailed idea of the fouling process total fouling ratio rt reversible fouling ratio rr and irreversible fouling ratio rir were calculated by using the following equations 36 37 7 r t 1 j p j w 1 100 8 r r j w 2 j p j w 1 100 9 r i r j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 r t r r where jp is the o w emulsion permeation flux at a filtration time of 90 min 2 results and discussion 2 1 characterization of alsi2o6 nanoparticles fig 1 a shows the pxrd patterns for the synthesized nanoparticles the obtained pattern is found to match the icdd standard data for al0 32si0 68o2 entry number 96 901 6279 38 which clearly reveals the al0 32si0 68o2 phase purity material the 2θ values of pxrd patterns peaks of 20 26 21 74 22 14 23 20 25 90 and 27 53 correspond to rhombohedral crystal system of alsi2o6 the surface morphology of the synthesized alsi2o6 nanoparticles were investigated by fesem analysis and images are provided in fig 1b and c the various magnified sem images clearly show the occurence of nanoparticles with soft agglomerations the particle diameter is found to be in the range of 24 36 nm sem edx spectral data of the alsi2o6 nanoparticles were displayed in the figure s3 the edx analysis confirms the presence of al si and o atoms in the alsi2o6 which demonstrates the successful synthesis of alsi2o6 nanoparticles it should be mentioned that the presence of pt in the edx is due to sputter coating porosity and surface area of the synthesized alsi2o6 nps were characterized using bet analysis fig 1d draws the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve for alsi2o6 nps which highlights a type iv isotherm the surface area of alsi2o6 nps was ascertained to be 257 26 m2 g 1 via bet analysis 2 2 membrane characterization 2 2 1 membrane morphology study the images of membrane surface are shown in fig 2 fig 2a corresponding to the control membrane and fig 2b d corresponding to various compositions of nps it can be seen that the nature of the alsi2o6 dispersion on the membrane surface depends on the concentration of nps however figure s3d shows that the surface pores are mostly formed in the vicinity of alsi2o6 aggregates these facts indicate that a greater addition of nps into the membrane increases the viscosity of casting solution resulting in a slight pore enlargement at the membrane surface this enlargement can be attributed to the stress enhancement between polymer matrix and nps arising from the organic shrinkage that occurs during the phase inversion process 39 the cross section morphology of the membrane is shown in fig 3 for the control membrane 1a and for nps embedded in the polymer matrix 3b 3c 3d in neat psf membrane m sponge like layer is very thick compared to the other membranes fig 3b d the membrane skin layer along with prominent finger like projections in the sub layer changed with the various additions of alsi2o6 nps into the membrane matrix for membrane m1 and m2 brad finger like projections with large pores in the bottom layer are observed with m3 membrane the three layers of the structure appear to be merged giving one single layer with sponge like and brad finger like projections 40 this behavior with the amount of nps is presumably owing to the greater thermodynamic stability in the coagulation bath system when the solvent and polymer were brought into contact for this region not much more changes were observed in the inner structure of the m1 and m2 membranes because the radius of gyration rg of the linear polymer is greater than that of nps rp 41 an increase in alsi2o6 content m3 enhances the casting solution s viscosity and reduces thermodynamic stability disturbing the penetration of nps closer into the polymer matrix during the process of phase inversion 42 the concentration of nps therefore plays a significant part in altering the structure as well as the synthesized membrane performance the sem edx spectra of the plane psf and alsi2o6 psf composites are displayed in the fig s4 the analysis of edx confirms the existence of atoms c n o and s in the control psf membrane fig s4 the alsi2o6 psf composites show a fresh peak for si and al the intensity of the o peak observed in the composite membrane is higher than that of the control psf membrane fig s4 these facts indicate the well dispersion of incorporated alsi2o6 nanoparticles in the psf polymer matrix indeed as we increased the nps concentration into the membrane elemental composition of the si al and o percentage was increased similarly this result also substainted the elemental mapping of membrane surface and cross section m3 as shown in fig 4 a c si and al stay together and evenly distributed nanoparticle on both surfaces and cross sectional channel across the membrane were promising to further enhance the hydrophilicity and antifouling property of the composite membranes 2 2 2 structural study of the alsi2o6 psf composite by xrd and atr ir analysis fig 5 a shows the xrd pattern of the alsi2o6 nps neat psf control and the alsi2o6 psf composites with various alsi2o6 nps contents the xrd patterns showed amorphous alsi2o6 nps and semi crystalline psf for 2θ 23 20 and 17 6 respectively which is consistent with literature 43 there are no changes in the xrd data of m1 m2 and m3 composite membranes however compared to the control psf membrane fig 5a the intensity of the peaks was reduced this could be increased by the amorphous alsi2o6 nps content into psf which leads to an increase of the graphitization degree and increased transformation of the crystal structure from γ form to α form with the addition of alsi2o6 nps as discussed in the literature 43 the atr ir spectra are exhibited in fig 5b and it reveals the molecular interaction existing between the polymer matrix and the nps the atr ir spectra of alsi2o6 nps shows typical peak at 1055 cm 1 corresponding to the si o si bond the peak at 900 800 cm 1 appears because of v sioh in the alsi2o6 nps these results highlight the successful synthesis of nanoparticles the ir spectra of control psf peak at 2967 cm 1 is attributed to the c h stretching and coc stretching was due to the existence of a strong peak at 1242 cm 1 finally the oso stretching corresponds to the peaks at 1150 cm 1 and 1105 cm 1 44 psf and alsi2o6 psf s prominent bands remain the same 2 2 3 surface roughness of the membrane fig 6 presents the three dimensional afm images of the membrane surface in the scanning range of 10 μm the incorporation of the alsi2o6 nps into the psf membrane tends to increase the surface roughness and rougher surface are obtained compared with the unmodified membrane the mean surface roughness ra of the control psf membrane was 10 74 nm whereas that of composite m1 m2 and m3 membranes was 11 04 15 25 and 23 45 nm respectively fig 6 this means that the surface roughness of the composite membranes slightly increases with the concentration of nps the hydrophillic alsi2o6 particles penetrate into the membrane surface during phase inversion process which leads to higher surface roughness of the membrane however alsi2o6 mixed metal oxide nanoparticles are highly porous in nature fig 1d water molecules can permeate easily which decreases the anti fouling properties their accumulation on the membrane surface also increases the effective filtration area of the membrane which tends to efficiently increase permeation flux i̇t should be noted that surface roughness can increase membrane fouling to owing contaminants accumulation in the valleys of rough membrane surfaces however in our case accumulation of hydrophilic alsi2o6 nps on the membrane necessarily enhances the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane reducing interactions between contaminants and the membrane surface for this reason it is expected that the addition of alsi2o6 nps in membrane matrix enhances anti fouling properties as well as filtration performances 2 2 4 water uptake porosity and contact angle of the membrane the wettability water uptake capacity and porosity of control psf and composite membranes are provided in fig 7 it can be seen that the increasing of the alsi2o6 particle concentration causes a decrease in the water contact angle from 75 to 64 this indicates that the addition of alsi2o6 nps to psf polymer enhances membrane hydrophilicity as expected as can be noticed control psf membrane shows a lower water uptake capacity than the composite membrane this observation is due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the polymer which resists the absorbtion of water this result was also supported by contact angle measurements 75 28 for the psf the water uptake capacity of the composite membrane m1 m2 and m3 increases proportionately from 20 91 to 97 91 fig 7 with the increase in concentration of alsi2o6 nps the incorporation of the hydrophilic alsi2o6 nps into the polymer matrix facilitates absorption of water and hence its affinity towards water the alsi2o6 nps composite membranes show higher porosity than the control psf membrane indeed the addition of a certain amount of alsi2o6 nps into the polymer matrix enhances the formation of larger pores in the vicinity because of the higher surface energy of the nanoparticle aggregate and defects the membrane inner structure the pore enlargement is probably due to interfacial stresses between the polymer and alsi2o6 nps resulting in the formation of interfacial pores the shrinkage of organic phase during the precipitation process of phase inversion indeed causes an increase in average pore size with the addition of lower amount of alsi2o6 nps 45 therefore a low content of alsi2o6 nps has an effect on the macrostructure and change in the inner pore of the membrane 2 2 5 mechanicla property study of composite membranes the membrane ware s mechanical stability is determined by the tensile strength and stress strain curve data as shown in fig 8 a and b it was evident that the addition of alsi2o6 nanoparticles into the psf matrix considerably improves the tensile strength from 3 04 to 4 85 mpa the alsi2o6 composite membranes displayed higher mechanical strength comparatively pristine psf membrane which could be attributed to the electrostatic interactions or suitability between alsi2o6 and psf matrix owing to the outstanding mechanical strength high aspect ratio and elevated np surface area the synergistic impact could decrease the possibility of loss of mechanical property due to interfacial defects or bad compatibility in order to improve the mechanical properties of hybrid membranes however m2 membrane demonstrated the highest mechanical strength further addition of nps resulted in a decrease in tensile strength potentially owing to the expanded porous architecture in the membrane structure 2 3 membrane perpormence study 2 3 1 permeation rejection and antifouling study of membranes the pure water flux and oil rejection of the prepared alsi2o6 psf composite membranes are presented in fig 9 a and b control neat psf membrane are not provided in fig 9 since it exhibits very low flux due to its high hydrophobic nature fig 9a represents the membrane flux vs time for the composite membranes water flux is only slightly reduced between 20 200 min which means that the mixed metal oxide nanocomposite membranes exhibit a good performance and mechanical stability fig 9b represents the rejection of oil throughout 120 min of filtration for all the composite membranes the oil rejection remains almost constant over time for m1 and m2 membranes i e slightly inceases from 90 to 99 for the former and slightly decreases from 99 to 96 for the latter oppositely the large amount of nps added for in m3 membrane leads to a significant drop of oil rejection over time from 88 to 60 probably due to the more flux fig 9a and the higher pore size fig 3d of the membrane furthermore while the membrane surface is charged pores eventually collapse owing to external forces and slight fouling occurs unlike expectations fouling does not boost rejection but reduces it this means that fouling is necessarily significant enough to influence flux rather than rejection this can also infer that the process of rejection is largely controlled by the charge of the membrane over the volume of the pore and therefore the reduction in the size of the pore due to fouling does not influence rejection fouling can suppress the charge required to maintain the oil in water emulsions resulting in a decrease rejection 46 membrane fouling in the separation membrane is a bottleneck issue so fouling resistance is a significant membrane efficiency index oil is one of wastewater s most prevalent foulants therefore the psf alsi2o6 composite membranes antifouling property was assessed using emulsified machine oil as the foulant 0 1 g l of oil in water solution was filtered fig 10 shows the time dependent flux evolution of the prepared composite membranes before and after oil rejection control psf membrane is still not drawn because of very low flux from fig 10a it can firstly be observed that the flux drastically decreases when the feed was switched from pure water to oil in water solution this trend which is partially due to an increase in overall solution viscosity appears to be more marked for m2 and m3 membranes than for m1 membrane this difference could probably be attributed to higher adsorption or deposition of oil on the membrane surface with m2 and m3 membranes this accumulation could cause the formation of an oil cake layer at the membrane surface leading to a progressive decline of flux from fig 10a it can be seen that flux of the m1 and m2 membranes almost recovers their initial water flux after switching back to pure water this means that these membranes are weakly fouled by oil oppositely water flux of the m3 composite membrane was not fully recovered probably due to its rougher surface ra 23 45 nm rq 30 25 nm rz 107 59 nm compared to the others cf fig 6 this means that this membrane is more severely impacted by oil accumulation at the membrane surface membrane fouling can be qualified as reversible or irreversible with reversible fouling foulants are loosely attached on the membrane surface and can thus be easily removed by washing with water on the other hand deposit that strongly adheres on membrane surface and cannot be removed by washing with water is called irreversible fouling fig 10b provides flux recovery ratio for all the investigated membranes and values obtained for the m1 m2 and m3 membranes were 86 97 and 75 respectively this indicates that higher water flux recoveries can be achieved with the composite membranes due to their improved hydrophilic nature and low cake resistance leading to better antifouling properties 47 the fig 10b reveals that the total fouling resistance of the prepared composite membrane m1 is lower in comparison with the m2 and m3 membrane and the irreversible resistance of the composite membranes was considerably reduced in all the cases additionally it seems that m2 membrane is more prone to reversible fouling but with a very little propensity to irreversible fouling the flux recovery ratio frr reversible resistance rr and irreversible resistance rir of composite membranes were improved and the membrane surface properties were modified successfully alsi2o6 psf composite membranes antifouling efficiency was competitive with elevated rate of flux recovery the implementation of alsi2o6 nps could considerably enhance alsi2o6 psf composite membranes antifouling characteristics it was suggested that the alsi2o6 psf composite membranes resisted oil fouling through the hydraulic layer barrier synergy and electrostatic repulsion barrier resulting in elevated flux recovery capacity and low irreversible fouling psf alsi2o6 composite membranes greater hydrophilicity and hydraulic capacity was useful for binding hydration layers on membrane surfaces the resulting layers of hydration could act as physical and energy barriers to oil fouling leading in adherence of oil droplets to membrane surfaces in an negative thermodynamic state 23 48 the barrier to the hydration layer should play a critical part in improving the antifouling property of the membrane furthermore the electrostatic repulsion barrier created between high surface negativity hybrid membranes and negatively charged emulsified oil also inhibited oil adsorption and deposition which also played a non ignorable role in the favorable antifouling capacity of the alsi2o6 psf composite membrane 3 conclusions a straightforward composite technique was adopted in this research for the easy preparation of the novel antifouling membrane based on alsi2o6 through the subsequent non solvent induced phase separation method the alsi2o6 nanoparticle was succefuly induced in psf membrane matrix with an improved hydrophilicity surface energy and more porous structure ultimately once applied to oil water emulsion separation the as prepared alsi2o6 psf composite membrane showed extremely enhanced permeability and antifouling efficiency in the case of 5 alsi2o6 psf m2 composite membrane with water flux up to 96 2 l m2 h superior hybrid membrane quality was noted and flux recovery was greater than 97 percent using a 0 1 g l oil in water emulsion feed solution showing the consistent and comprehensive antifouling properties of composite membranes in contradiction of oil foulant in addition even afterward two fouling cleaning test cycles the 5 percent alsi2o6 psf m2 composite membrane was also fitted with the recyclable antifouling performance for extremely focused oil water emulsion separation in conclusion the general findings highlighted the potential for the development of antifouling membranes in composite strategy and suggested promising future applications of prepared

14271,the primary reasons for reduction of permeate flux in membrane separation processes are cake layer formation and concentration polarization phenomenon although pore blocking affects cross membrane flux but its influence has been neglected in the previous numerical studies in present study macroscopic 2d cfd modeling and experimental survey in treatment of oil in water emulsion with cellulose acetate ca membrane in a cross flow microfiltration are presented in order to investigate the simultaneous effects of both phenomena of cake formation and pore blocking an oil droplet size distribution based on experimental measurements is considered in the modeling the pore blocking is simulated macroscopically in the microfiltration process as a main result by considering membrane governing equations into a 2d domain i e pore blocking phenomenon the simulation prediction can improve about 15 effects of various operational conditions such as trans membrane pressure tmp cross flow velocity cfv and feed oil concentration on permeate flux and process performance are also evaluated by increasing feed oil concentration from 1000 to 10000 mg l the maximum value of oil concentration on membrane surface increases 9 68 times and by increasing cfv from 0 5 to 1 1 m s the maximum thickness of concentration polarization cp layer decreases 14 comparison of model

past three decades membrane filtration processes have been widely used in industrial separation recently the application of cross flow filtration and pressure driven membrane processes in liquid separation has attracted the attention of several researchers 1 3 discovering the underlying phenomenological reasons for flux decline is essential in developing ways to postponing it computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling techniques have been used to study different phenomena in fluid systems such as fouling and concentration polarization cp in membrane processes 4 6 wastewater is generated in different industries such as transportation oil gas and petrochemical 7 in microfiltration mf which is a pressure driven membrane filtration process the unwanted removed particles and contaminants lay within size range of 0 1 1 μm these are larger than those removed by ultrafiltration uf or reverse osmosis ro but smaller than those removed by conventional filtration methods 8 9 this process has been proven to be a suitable technique in treatment of oil in water emulsion 10 11 in membrane processes concentration polarization and fouling cause cross membrane permeate flux decline fouling is divided into two categories i internal blockage or pore blocking ii external blockage or cake layer formation 12 concentration polarization may result in the formation of cake layer over the membrane surface and often leads to the formation of a concentrated boundary layer near the membrane surface 13 this phenomenon significantly relies on system hydrodynamics nature and size of solute molecules membrane pore size molecular weight cut off and characteristics hydrophobic hydrophilic surface charge etc in microfiltration process cp mainly leads to cake layer formation upon the membrane surface which decrease the permeate flux 14 in recent years the effects of cake layer formation and cp on membrane performance and permeate flux in membrane separation processes of oil in water emulsion have been investigated most of these studies have been investigated experimental1y such as the effects of operational conditions on process performance 15 19 or membrane structure modifications for improved efficiency 20 22 some studies have considered a model such as hermia s 23 25 and performed numerical modeling 26 28 for cake layer formation and cp layer other studies have been conducted to simulate cake layer formation and cp layer effects on permeate flux 29 30 some have predicted the steady state permeate flux while others have described the permeate flux as a function of time but in all membrane pore blocking has been neglected 31 32 ahmad et al 33 performed cfd simulation to predict the concentration polarization and mass transfer coefficient under different types of conditions in a narrow membrane channel they assumed a fixed permeate flux for the membrane and used laminar flow for two dimensional membrane channel domain solved with solute conservation equation their results showed that the concentration polarization reduces by increasing both feed reynold s number and wall shear stress pak et al 34 developed a two dimensional numerical solution of coupled navier stokes darcy s law and mass transfer equation to simulate concentration polarization for a porous tubular membrane their results showed that variable permeation flux assumption for the porous section may have better agreement with experiment results zare et al 35 carried out a simulation to evaluate cp phenomenon in microfiltration of oil in water emulsion in a rectangular membrane module they investigated the effects of reynold s number on cp and oil droplets concentration however they showed that higher reynold s number higher tmp and lower feed concentration can increase permeate flux but the mixture model did not predict cp layer accurately in their study as they neglected the interaction between oil droplets and the membrane surface and the inter particle interactions of oil droplets lotfiyan et al 36 conducted a 2d computational fluid dynamics modeling to simulate oil concentration profile in the boundary layer and to predict the permeate flux they used eulerian multi phase model for fluid flow and darcy s equation for the permeate flux of the porous media they argued that there is not a linear relation between tmps and permeate flux when feeding oil in water emulsion into the membrane modules although this relation was linear for pure water they also investigated cp profile in the mass boundary layer which showed by increasing tmps the concentration near the membrane surface increases although they took interaction between oil droplets and the membrane surface and the inter particle interactions of oil droplets into consideration which had been previously neglected by zare et al the difference between simulation results and experimental data for permeate flux was still reported to be large they presumed the deviations might have been due to not having taken porous media pore blocking into consideration tashvigh et al 37 developed a 2d cfd model to predict permeate flux decline in microfiltration of oil in water emulsions they employed a combination of molecular and shear induced diffusion coefficient to describe back diffusion of oil droplets from the membrane wall toward the bulk the effects of tmp cross flow velocity cfv on the model precision and different operational conditions on cp layer were studied they assumed rejection to be 100 for process and results showed that their model can predict the trend of permeate flux vs time more accurately compared to previous studies in the last stated simulation studies membrane has been considered as a boundary condition although in the previous studies the pore blocking phenomenon has been neglected in the simulation or developed as an empirical model or investigated microscopically but in the current study this phenomenon is simulated macroscopically using membrane governing equations to evaluate the amount of pore blocking effect on permeate flux reduction an oil droplet distribution to ensure occurrence of both phenomena of cake layer formation and pore blocking is considered under unsteady state condition in the simulation the effects of various operational conditions on process performance are also predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed preparation and the membrane properties a flat sheet cellulose acetate ca hydrophilic membrane sartorius germany was used in the present study the scanning electron microscope sem of ca membrane is shown in fig 1 a sharp mean size for pore sizes based on membrane catalog information is used in the present study a stable and homogenous mixture of oil in water emulsion was prepared through mixing kerosene using tween 80 and span 80 as surfactants the membrane and feed properties and parameters considered in this study are presented in table 1 the amounts of surfactants used in emulsion preparation were of three weight percentages of 0 5 1 and 1 5 relative to the oil phase to prepare the oil in water emulsions a mixture volumetrically containing 90 tween 80 and 10 span 80 has been used initially the required tween 80 should be dissolved in deionized water followed by dissolving the required span 80 in kerosene the two solutions are then mixed completely in a storage tank by a homogenizer kinematica ag pt 1200c switzerland at 7000 rpm for 30 min droplet size distribution dsd was calculated for these three emulsions by dynamic light scattering dls 38 test according to dsd results addition of 1 5 surfactants cause droplets emulsion with small size droplets and 0 5 surfactants addition causes phase inversion thus 1 was chosen as the required amount of surfactants the emulsion stabilities were evaluated by keeping them constant for 12 h to assess emulsion stability the droplet size distribution dsd diagram was obtained using the dls device malvern nano zs zen 3600 england once after mixing was completed 30 min and once again 12 h later no significant change in droplet size distribution dsd and mean droplet size in both cases were used as emulsion stability criterion this emulsion preparation method was optimized in comparison with other methods optimal preparation method for oil in water emulsion comprises of proper choice of the surfactant type used mixing time surfactant weight percentage relative to the oil phase and the relative ratio of surfactants used compared to each other the dsd diagram for final oil in water emulsion with 1 surfactants after 30 min mixing is shown in fig 2 this figure showed that the droplets diameter was between 0 1 and 3 μm which due to mean membrane pore size both phenomena of cake formation and pore blocking were occurred in experiments all experimental data is repeated three times at optimum conditions based on response surface methodology rsm and box behnken method 39 which was performed by sheikhi et al 40 the average experimental permeate fluxes and standard deviations sd under various tmps are depicted in fig 3 due to experimental results the deviations from average values for all experimental permeate fluxes are lower than 4 2 2 experimental setup the centrifugal pump pedrollo pkm 90 italy delivered emulsion to the membrane module from the tank the velocity and the trans membrane pressure were customized with rotameter and pump the permeate flux was determined with sampling from permeate channel by a digital balance precisa bj8100d switzerland as follows 1 j v p a δ t where vp is the accumulated volume of permeate flow a is the membrane area and δt is the time interval of sampling with l m2 and hr as dimensions respectively a schematic view of the laboratory setup is depicted in fig 4 to minimize pore blocking phenomenon and consequently the occurrence of cake formation singly the oil in water emulsion was circulated in the experimental setup for 60 min by the centrifugal pump at 1836 rpm the emulsion was sampled every 5 min and dsd test was performed which is depicted in fig 5 from dsd results it was concluded that the dsd was almost fixed after 30 min and droplets diameter was larger than 1 μm it should be noted that the accumulated volume of permeate flow was added to the storage tank after every sampling to keep feed oil concentration constant variations in process temperature causes change in emulsion viscosity and shear stress near the membrane surface and result in permeate flux variations since the emulsion was circulating in the setup throughout the process time it could have caused the temperature variation throughout the membrane filtration process and resulted dsd variations to evaluate this process under temperature independent conditions and eliminate the energy equations in the modeling heat exchanger is used to keep the process temperature constant the chemical oxygen demand cod 43 was used to calculate oil concentration in the permeate flow and measure the rejection rate 3 theory 3 1 problem description and module geometry due to not significant changes in results less than unity value of height to width ratio of membrane module h w 0 04 and less computational time the 2d modeling is utilized for cfd model calculations the heights and lengths of the rectangular feed channel membrane and permeation channel are 1 100 mm2 0 12 100 mm2 and 0 3 100 mm2 respectively as shown schematically with the imposed boundary conditions in fig 6 the feed is a mixture of two phase oil as the dispersed phase and water as the continuous phase in order to omit the mesh size effects on the permeate flux results i e the mesh dependency tests cfd modeling is carried out under different mesh sizes to find the coarsest size which no significant accuracy improvement is observed as demonstrated in fig 7 this led to 36 674 square computational cells resulting in acceptable error compared to computations carried out with 54 000 cells 3 2 governing equations the hydrodynamics of the fluid flow in the membrane module in cross flow microfiltration processes may be studied through discretization of the geometry and the solution of the governing equations in the present study the feed flow of oil in water emulsion is assumed to be laminar incompressible and isothermal 3 2 1 fluid hydrodynamics a mixture containing water as the continuous phase and oil as the dispersed phase at low concentrations with the specific dsd is fed to feed channel inlet for emulsions with dispersed phase less than 10 the mixture model form euler euler approach is appropriate model to predict process behavior as reported in literature the model concepts are founded on volume fraction and other parameters such as relative velocity and drag force which are used in feed and permeate channels mixture model equations for the two phases oil in water emulsion of dispersed phase p and continuous phase q are presented in the following 3 2 1 1 continuous phase continuity equation is 2 ρ t ρ u 0 momentum equation is the navier stokes equation represented below 3 ρ d u d t p μ 2 u ρ g where ρ is density μ is viscosity u is the velocity vector t is time g is the gravitational acceleration and p is pressure 3 2 1 2 dispersed phase volume fraction equation ϕ is 4 t φ p ρ p φ p ρ p v m φ p ρ p v d r p where vdr k is drift velocity for the

velocity which are calculated as follows 12 v m k 1 n φ k ρ k v k ρ m 13 ρ m k 1 n φ k ρ k momentum equation for mixture properties and the parameter introduced above is given as follows 14 t ρ m v m

velocity for the dispersed phase p is calculated as follows 3 2 2 mass transfer equation the mass balance equation is 16 c t u c d c where c is the oil concentration d is the oil in water diffusion coefficient the dispersion in the x direction is assumed negligible and a combination of shear induced and molecular diffusion coefficient is used for diffusion in y direction described as follows 17 d y d m 0 33 u y α p 2 φ 2 1 0 5 e 8 8 φ where dm demonstrates the molecular diffusion of oil in water φ represents oil volume fraction αp is the oil droplet size and the second term in the right hand side of eq 17 indicates the shear induced diffusion the eqs 16 and 17 are used to predict oil concentration in the feed and permeate channels and related to oil saturation at the membrane boundaries as is stated in section 2 2 4 3 2 3 membrane equations pore blocking prediction although the oil droplets flow through the porous membranes may be involved very mechanisms but a transport process with convection and dispersion mechanisms are assumed as dominant phenomena to simulate membrane pore blocking the continuity and mass transfer equations for the membrane section are described as 44 18 ε p ρ t ρ u 0 18a u κ μ p 19 ε p c t c u d c c 19a c s ρ where εp is the membrane porosity κ is the membrane permeability ρ is the fluid density μ is the fluid viscosity u is the fluid velocity p is the membrane pressure dc is the capillary diffusion s is the fluid saturation and c is the fluid content these equations are solved for both phases which are related together through their saturation the rate of diffusion and fouling in the membrane pores are based on relative permeability of each phase hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity property of membrane and interfacial tension effects due to interaction between membrane surface and oil droplets is defined by capillary diffusion 42 in the current simulation contact angle between membrane pores surface and oil droplets is assumed 120 degrees based on monfared et al 7 work and the capillary diffusion calculated from capillary pressure 45 is used as a constant value in the membrane governing equations as represented in table 1 in the present simulation it is assumed that oil droplets separate from water within the membrane pores based on their relative permeability difference lower relative permeability of one phase causes lower permeability of that phase within the membrane pores and results in a decreased its saturation concentration 3 2 4 volume fraction and saturation mass balance and mixture model equations are coupled at membrane boundaries to do so the velocity used in the mass balance equation is calculated from the mixture model and the oil volume fraction to solve the mixture flow equations is obtained from oil concentration calculations of the mass balance equation the relation between concentration and volume fraction is 20 φ c o i l c w a t e r m w o i l m w m i x ρ m i x ρ o i l mwoil and mwmix indicates the oil and mixture molecular weights and ρoil and ρmix represents the oil and mixture densities respectively the water properties are assumed for the mixture density and molecular weight for inlet condition due to low concentration of oil in emulsion but the mixture properties are calculated locally and replaced in eq 20 based on mixture model calculations eq 21 is used to relate the oil volume fraction in the mixture model to oil saturation at the membrane boundaries 21 s φ ε p where φ is the oil volume fraction and s is the oil saturation 3 2 5 empirical models 3 2 5 1 cake formation when oil droplets larger than the average pore size accumulate on the membrane surface cake layer formation occurs as time elapses cake layer thickness δc grows the resistance of this layer increases consequently diminishing the permeate flux to consider the effects of this layer on permeate flux a model may be described as follows 22 1 j 1 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where j0 and kc are the initial permeate flux and the constant of the cake formation model respectively this empirical model has been developed to describe cake layer formation effects on permeate flux reduction for the microfiltration process of oil in water emulsion experimentally by abbasi et al 46 but in the present modeling darcy s law is used to predict cake formation phenomenon which its formula is as follows 23 j δ p μ l c r c where j is the permeate flux δp is the pressure difference between feed channel and membrane section μ is the emulsion viscosity lc and rc are the thickness and resistance of cake layer formation in this equation the amount of lcrc is unknown and is predicted in the present study as follows due to dsd diagram reported in fig 5 which the oil droplets size was larger than mean membrane pore size the experimental permeate fluxes can be predicted by eq 22 under these conditions of dsd only the cake formation was occurred and pore blocking can be neglected the lcrc term used in darcy s law can be predicted as a function of time based on back calculation method of simultaneous using of eqs 22 23 and experimental permeate fluxes 3 2 5 2 pore blocking as mentioned in the section 3 2 3 pore blocking effects is simulated directly using membrane governing equations but adding a separated 2d domain for membrane in the simulation and solving membrane equations can be caused more computational time in order to minimize the computational time the membrane can be assumed as a boundary condition using empirical model for this purpose intermediate pore blocking model can be utilized which its equation is 24 1 j 2 1 j 1 k i a t where ki is a constant in the intermediate pore blocking model and a is the membrane surface area 46 the ki term is unknown in this equation which can be calculated by comparing two modeling cases of cake formation alone and both cake formation and pore blocking 3 2 6 rejection rate and cp layer thickness the oil rejection from membrane is given by 47 25 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c b 100 where cp and cb are oil concentrations in permeate and bulk feed flow channels respectively the cp layer thickness is calculated under condition blew 26 c o c b c b 0 01 the distance from the membrane surface where the oil concentration co is 99 of the bulk oil concentration cb 3 3 boundary conditions and assumptions the boundary conditions for computational domain are represented in table 2 some assumptions used in the present modeling are as follows the feed is a mixture of continuous and dispersed phase with the specific dsd entering the domain at the same velocity and under laminar conditions through the feed channel all walls in membrane module are considered as impermeable with no slip boundary condition being imposed the mean membrane pore size is defined as a condition such that droplets smaller than it could pass through the membrane and those larger could not the pressure drop in the feed channel is assumed negligible the membrane resistance term i e lmrm exp is calculated from experimental permeate flux for pure water using darcy s law and the cake resistance term i e lcrc exp is measured for oil in water emulsion experimentally after 60 min which presented in table 3 these two parameters are used in steady state study which is explained in details in solution algorithm due to dsd results in fig 2 it is assumed that oil phase enters into the membrane pores with vinc as flux and the oil rejection is not 100 in contrary to previous research such as tashvigh et al 37 simplifying assumptions 3 4 solution strategy finite element method was utilized to solve the nonlinear equations of momentum and mass balance using a developed home code coupled with femlab v2 3 the segregated implicit pressure projection algorithm based on the pressure correction algorithm was used for pressure velocity coupling control volume technique was used for discretization of governing equations in the computational domain in steady state simulation fluid properties were updated based on the initialized solution but in time dependent simulation those were updated based on the ongoing solution the convergence criteria for the momentum and volume fraction residuals were 10 4 and 10 6 respectively for solving the equations a total number of 4 5 106 iterations were used in the computational domain using intel xeon e3 1240 3 5 ghz cpu and 32 gb of ram as the system in the current study two separated modeling were performed as follows case 1 steady state modeling in this simulation the cake formation and pore blocking resistances terms i e lcrc and lmrm respectively using in darcy s law equation are considered as constant values based on experimental measurements thus the permeate fluxes are only function of local pressure in the membrane module this modeling is validated by two separated experimental works lotfiyan et al work and present work the solution algorithm of this modeling is represented in fig 8 it should be noted that a constant mean oil droplets diameter based on dsd results in fig 2 is assumed for feed inlet condition case 2 unsteady state modeling in this simulation as mentioned in the previous sections first the cake resistance term i e lcrc used in the darcy s law was obtained as a function of time using eqs 22 and 23 and experimental permeate fluxes this term was calculated for dsd reported in fig 5 as initial feed condition which only cake formation occurred under these conditions the pore blocking phenomenon can be neglected due to dsd and membrane pore size after finding the cake resistance function the dsd reported in fig 2 is initiated at feed inlet to ensure both cake layer and pore blocking occur thus by predicting the cake formation effects on permeate flux reduction the effects of pore blocking phenomenon are directly investigated based on membrane governing equations and cfd calculations the solution algorithm for unsteady sated modeling is also presented in fig 9 4 results and discussions 4 1 steady state modeling 4 1 1 validation and pore blocking effects in steady state simulation the membrane and cake layer resistances are assumed constant therefore the permeate flux is a function of local pressure only as mentioned lotfiyan et al 36 evaluated the steady state permeate flux with a significant error they did not consider pore blocking and the cake layer thickness increasing as time elapses they considered the membrane as a line in their simulation and used the membrane resistance under steady state conditions when permeate flux was stable for pure water as the used resistance term in darcy s law equation it should be noted that their emulsion properties are extracted from their work 36 and used in the current simulation they also used this resistance for pure water to predict oil in water emulsion as cake formation resistance in their simulation not computing the cake formation resistance experimentally to evaluate the effects of pore blocking a modeling of their work under the same conditions is performed and pore blocking is added in the simulation which its results is presented in table 4 the values of permeate fluxes showed that by considering pore blocking the relative error decreasing by about 15 but the errors were also considerable thus it was concluded that the main error may be due to not considering the oil droplets accumulation variations with time on the membrane surface and effects of its resistance rise on permeate flux in their work 4 1 2 effects of tmp on permeate flux another modeling was on the ca membrane experimental data carried out on three different tmps with cross flow velocity and oil concentration being 0 8 m s and 1000 mg l respectively including both membrane and cake resistances as expected by increasing tmp the permeate flux increases a comparison between steady state experimental data and cfd modeling results are depicted in fig 10 in this case the relative errors are 11 9 20 4 and 26 3 for 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 mpa respectively membrane porosity changes as oil droplets accumulate inside the membrane pores leading to a rise in membrane flow resistance a phenomenon over looked in steady state modeling hence the error may be due to both simplifications of considering the cake layer resistance constant and neglecting the membrane resistance variations due to changes in porosity it should be noted that all steady state permeate fluxes in the experiment are obtained when the changes in permeate flux vs time tend to zero 4 1 3 effects of oil concentration the effects of increasing oil concentration on oil rejection rate under steady state conditions are depicted in fig 11 as observed by increasing oil concentration in the feed flow the amount of oil rejection increases the accumulation of oil droplets and formation of larger droplets creates an obstacle to the passage of smaller particles as expected from eq 25 by increasing feed oil concentration oil concentration in permeate channel cp increases at a much lower rate compared to bulk oil concentration cb thus increasing of cb overcomes the increasing cp leading to an increase in rejection since the cake layer formation and oil droplets accumulation could not be calculated under steady state modeling conditions cp layer is only formed under the influence of oil concentration on the membrane surface and diffusion coefficient relevant to that concentration fig 11 shows the importance of consideration of the pore blocking phenomenon in the simulation and its effects on the steady state rejection at various feed oil concentrations due to small changes is rejection based on fig 11 it is deduced that the rejection under steady state conditions is almost independent of feed oil concentration since the cp layer thickness δcp near the membrane surface is a function of oil accumulation on membrane surface as time elapses the effects of different feed oil concentrations on δcp is evaluated under unsteady state study conditions discussed in section 4 2 3 4 1 4 membrane pressure profile in the current study the membrane pressure is assumed unknown and calculated from membrane governing equations eqs 18 and 19 the membrane pressure profile is depicted in fig 12 a it is clear by increasing tmp the membrane pressure increases as seen in fig 12 b as observed by increasing tmp the slope of membrane pressure vs membrane length increases but an issue that matters here is distribution of the membrane pressure along the membrane length if the beginning and the end effects of the membrane geometry were to be neglected membrane pressure distribution would be linear by moving along the membrane length the fouling and the oil saturation within the membrane pores increase the permeate flux through the membrane decreases consequently the membrane pressure increases the relative pressures are used in modeling but results are reported as absolute pressure 4 2 unsteady state study 4 2 1 effects of tmp under unsteady state conditions an oil droplets size distribution based on fig 2 is considered at feed inlet therefore due to membrane pores diameters both cake layer formation and pore blocking phenomena occur to consider the effects of fouling on permeate flux darcy s law and membrane governing equations are used for cake layer formation and pore blocking which unlike steady state conditions are not constant in this modeling the initial membrane porosity is assumed as a constant value but cfd calculations predict its variations based on oil saturation in the membrane pores as time elapses the permeate flux variations with time at different tmps is presented in fig 13 under unsteady state conditions in which the pore blocking and fouling on the membrane surface are to be considered results showed that the difference between experimental data and model predictions are reduced very much as shown in table 5 it is seen that by increasing the number of computational cells model precision increases a little while the computational time is raised the permeate flux was also calculated for 0 15 mpa and 0 2 mpa for 54 000 computational cells but the relative errors did not change significantly the model underestimation for permeate flux at 0 2 mpa may be due to higher pressure effects on membrane structure and cake formation throughout the membrane filtration and result in higher permeate flux under experimental conditions as shown the steady state permeate flux is near to permeate flux at time of 3600 s for tmp of 0 1 mpa but for tmp of 0 2 mpa more time is needed for the permeate flux to reach steady state conditions 4 2 2 effects of cross flow velocity by increasing cfv feed reynold s number and shear forces on membrane surface increase consequently the thickness of mass boundary layer on the membrane surface decreases the effects of cfv on concentration polarization thickness δcp near the membrane surface are shown in fig 14 it is seen that at higher cfvs resulting in higher feed reynold s number δcp decreases three cfvs are performed under unsteady state conditions the predicted values showed that changing cfv from 0 5 to 0 8 m s decreased the cp layer thickness by about 11 while further increase from 0 8 to 1 1 m s decreased it about 3 since the cp is a time dependent phenomenon as time is elapsed its thickness grows to values larger than that under steady state conditions the reasons for which are mentioned in section 4 1 3 4 2 3 effects of oil concentration by increasing the feed oil concentration the amount of oil droplets accumulation and concentration on membrane surface increase thus effects of cp phenomenon increases as shown in fig 15 as expected by increasing oil accumulation on membrane surface the resistance of cake layer formation increases consequently the permeate flux decreases the effects of different feed oil concentration on pore blocking are depicted in fig 16 as indicated by increasing feed oil concentration the membrane pore blocking increases although not very tangibly this may be due to increased oil droplets collision leading to the formation of larger droplets as oil concentration is increased hindering them from entering into the membrane pores thus preventing pore blocking to change significantly as stated by increasing feed oil concentration the rate of fouling formation on membrane surface increases consequently preventing the oil droplets passing thorough the membrane as time elapses as a result the amount of rejection increases with time the changing of rejection with time is represented in fig 17 the results demonstrate as time elapses at initial process times and before cake formation small droplets pass thorough the membrane pores cp increases and consequently rejection decreases eq 25 and exponential decreasing of rejection may be due to pore blocking phenomenon occurring but from a specific time about 400 s initial layer of cake formed on the membrane surface cp decreases resulting in a slight increase in rejection finally ending on a fixed value as discussed in section 4 1 2 by increasing feed oil concentration cp increases at a very slower rate compared to cb with rejection consequently increasing due to experimental measurements and eq 25 the rejection was obtained 98 2 for oil concentration of 1000 mg l after 60 min the higher model based predicted rejection rates compared to the experimental measurements may be due to squeezing of large oil droplets through the small pores a phenomenon not considered in the current simulation from these results it is deduced that the ca is a suitable hydrophilic membrane to separate oil from oil in water emulsion 5 conclusions the performance of ca membrane in separating oil from oil in water emulsion and the simultaneous employment both cake layer formation and pore blocking phenomena to describe through membrane permeate flux in cross flow microfiltration were investigated the aim of the current study was increasing the precision of modeling considering the phenomena occurring in the process in a first study being under steady state conditions evaluation of membrane pressure distribution was targeted moving along the membrane coincides with raise in oil saturation in membrane pores pore blocking resistance increases decrease in permeate flux thorough the membrane and increase in membrane pressure results also show a linear variation of the membrane pressure along the length under a second set of unsteady state conditions simulation results for permeate fluxes had acceptable agreement in comparisons against experimental data in which absolute minimum and maximum errors were 0 44 and 4 62 respectively in addition effects of different operational conditions on cp layer thickness oil concentration on membrane surface and oil saturation in membrane pores were successfully modeled by increasing feed oil concentration oil saturation inside the membrane pores and the oil concentration on the membrane surface increase also by increasing membrane cfv cp layer thickness decreases results of this survey proved that simultaneous application of the two types of fouling can predict the process behavior well under different operational conditions and may be verified by experimental data appropriately it may be noted that due to its hydrophilic properties ca must be a good choice for the separation of oil in water emulsions in cross flow microfiltration 
14271,the primary reasons for reduction of permeate flux in membrane separation processes are cake layer formation and concentration polarization phenomenon although pore blocking affects cross membrane flux but its influence has been neglected in the previous numerical studies in present study macroscopic 2d cfd modeling and experimental survey in treatment of oil in water emulsion with cellulose acetate ca membrane in a cross flow microfiltration are presented in order to investigate the simultaneous effects of both phenomena of cake formation and pore blocking an oil droplet size distribution based on experimental measurements is considered in the modeling the pore blocking is simulated macroscopically in the microfiltration process as a main result by considering membrane governing equations into a 2d domain i e pore blocking phenomenon the simulation prediction can improve about 15 effects of various operational conditions such as trans membrane pressure tmp cross flow velocity cfv and feed oil concentration on permeate flux and process performance are also evaluated by increasing feed oil concentration from 1000 to 10000 mg l the maximum value of oil concentration on membrane surface increases 9 68 times and by increasing cfv from 0 5 to 1 1 m s the maximum thickness of concentration polarization cp layer decreases 14 comparison of model

past three decades membrane filtration processes have been widely used in industrial separation recently the application of cross flow filtration and pressure driven membrane processes in liquid separation has attracted the attention of several researchers 1 3 discovering the underlying phenomenological reasons for flux decline is essential in developing ways to postponing it computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling techniques have been used to study different phenomena in fluid systems such as fouling and concentration polarization cp in membrane processes 4 6 wastewater is generated in different industries such as transportation oil gas and petrochemical 7 in microfiltration mf which is a pressure driven membrane filtration process the unwanted removed particles and contaminants lay within size range of 0 1 1 μm these are larger than those removed by ultrafiltration uf or reverse osmosis ro but smaller than those removed by conventional filtration methods 8 9 this process has been proven to be a suitable technique in treatment of oil in water emulsion 10 11 in membrane processes concentration polarization and fouling cause cross membrane permeate flux decline fouling is divided into two categories i internal blockage or pore blocking ii external blockage or cake layer formation 12 concentration polarization may result in the formation of cake layer over the membrane surface and often leads to the formation of a concentrated boundary layer near the membrane surface 13 this phenomenon significantly relies on system hydrodynamics nature and size of solute molecules membrane pore size molecular weight cut off and characteristics hydrophobic hydrophilic surface charge etc in microfiltration process cp mainly leads to cake layer formation upon the membrane surface which decrease the permeate flux 14 in recent years the effects of cake layer formation and cp on membrane performance and permeate flux in membrane separation processes of oil in water emulsion have been investigated most of these studies have been investigated experimental1y such as the effects of operational conditions on process performance 15 19 or membrane structure modifications for improved efficiency 20 22 some studies have considered a model such as hermia s 23 25 and performed numerical modeling 26 28 for cake layer formation and cp layer other studies have been conducted to simulate cake layer formation and cp layer effects on permeate flux 29 30 some have predicted the steady state permeate flux while others have described the permeate flux as a function of time but in all membrane pore blocking has been neglected 31 32 ahmad et al 33 performed cfd simulation to predict the concentration polarization and mass transfer coefficient under different types of conditions in a narrow membrane channel they assumed a fixed permeate flux for the membrane and used laminar flow for two dimensional membrane channel domain solved with solute conservation equation their results showed that the concentration polarization reduces by increasing both feed reynold s number and wall shear stress pak et al 34 developed a two dimensional numerical solution of coupled navier stokes darcy s law and mass transfer equation to simulate concentration polarization for a porous tubular membrane their results showed that variable permeation flux assumption for the porous section may have better agreement with experiment results zare et al 35 carried out a simulation to evaluate cp phenomenon in microfiltration of oil in water emulsion in a rectangular membrane module they investigated the effects of reynold s number on cp and oil droplets concentration however they showed that higher reynold s number higher tmp and lower feed concentration can increase permeate flux but the mixture model did not predict cp layer accurately in their study as they neglected the interaction between oil droplets and the membrane surface and the inter particle interactions of oil droplets lotfiyan et al 36 conducted a 2d computational fluid dynamics modeling to simulate oil concentration profile in the boundary layer and to predict the permeate flux they used eulerian multi phase model for fluid flow and darcy s equation for the permeate flux of the porous media they argued that there is not a linear relation between tmps and permeate flux when feeding oil in water emulsion into the membrane modules although this relation was linear for pure water they also investigated cp profile in the mass boundary layer which showed by increasing tmps the concentration near the membrane surface increases although they took interaction between oil droplets and the membrane surface and the inter particle interactions of oil droplets into consideration which had been previously neglected by zare et al the difference between simulation results and experimental data for permeate flux was still reported to be large they presumed the deviations might have been due to not having taken porous media pore blocking into consideration tashvigh et al 37 developed a 2d cfd model to predict permeate flux decline in microfiltration of oil in water emulsions they employed a combination of molecular and shear induced diffusion coefficient to describe back diffusion of oil droplets from the membrane wall toward the bulk the effects of tmp cross flow velocity cfv on the model precision and different operational conditions on cp layer were studied they assumed rejection to be 100 for process and results showed that their model can predict the trend of permeate flux vs time more accurately compared to previous studies in the last stated simulation studies membrane has been considered as a boundary condition although in the previous studies the pore blocking phenomenon has been neglected in the simulation or developed as an empirical model or investigated microscopically but in the current study this phenomenon is simulated macroscopically using membrane governing equations to evaluate the amount of pore blocking effect on permeate flux reduction an oil droplet distribution to ensure occurrence of both phenomena of cake layer formation and pore blocking is considered under unsteady state condition in the simulation the effects of various operational conditions on process performance are also predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed preparation and the membrane properties a flat sheet cellulose acetate ca hydrophilic membrane sartorius germany was used in the present study the scanning electron microscope sem of ca membrane is shown in fig 1 a sharp mean size for pore sizes based on membrane catalog information is used in the present study a stable and homogenous mixture of oil in water emulsion was prepared through mixing kerosene using tween 80 and span 80 as surfactants the membrane and feed properties and parameters considered in this study are presented in table 1 the amounts of surfactants used in emulsion preparation were of three weight percentages of 0 5 1 and 1 5 relative to the oil phase to prepare the oil in water emulsions a mixture volumetrically containing 90 tween 80 and 10 span 80 has been used initially the required tween 80 should be dissolved in deionized water followed by dissolving the required span 80 in kerosene the two solutions are then mixed completely in a storage tank by a homogenizer kinematica ag pt 1200c switzerland at 7000 rpm for 30 min droplet size distribution dsd was calculated for these three emulsions by dynamic light scattering dls 38 test according to dsd results addition of 1 5 surfactants cause droplets emulsion with small size droplets and 0 5 surfactants addition causes phase inversion thus 1 was chosen as the required amount of surfactants the emulsion stabilities were evaluated by keeping them constant for 12 h to assess emulsion stability the droplet size distribution dsd diagram was obtained using the dls device malvern nano zs zen 3600 england once after mixing was completed 30 min and once again 12 h later no significant change in droplet size distribution dsd and mean droplet size in both cases were used as emulsion stability criterion this emulsion preparation method was optimized in comparison with other methods optimal preparation method for oil in water emulsion comprises of proper choice of the surfactant type used mixing time surfactant weight percentage relative to the oil phase and the relative ratio of surfactants used compared to each other the dsd diagram for final oil in water emulsion with 1 surfactants after 30 min mixing is shown in fig 2 this figure showed that the droplets diameter was between 0 1 and 3 μm which due to mean membrane pore size both phenomena of cake formation and pore blocking were occurred in experiments all experimental data is repeated three times at optimum conditions based on response surface methodology rsm and box behnken method 39 which was performed by sheikhi et al 40 the average experimental permeate fluxes and standard deviations sd under various tmps are depicted in fig 3 due to experimental results the deviations from average values for all experimental permeate fluxes are lower than 4 2 2 experimental setup the centrifugal pump pedrollo pkm 90 italy delivered emulsion to the membrane module from the tank the velocity and the trans membrane pressure were customized with rotameter and pump the permeate flux was determined with sampling from permeate channel by a digital balance precisa bj8100d switzerland as follows 1 j v p a δ t where vp is the accumulated volume of permeate flow a is the membrane area and δt is the time interval of sampling with l m2 and hr as dimensions respectively a schematic view of the laboratory setup is depicted in fig 4 to minimize pore blocking phenomenon and consequently the occurrence of cake formation singly the oil in water emulsion was circulated in the experimental setup for 60 min by the centrifugal pump at 1836 rpm the emulsion was sampled every 5 min and dsd test was performed which is depicted in fig 5 from dsd results it was concluded that the dsd was almost fixed after 30 min and droplets diameter was larger than 1 μm it should be noted that the accumulated volume of permeate flow was added to the storage tank after every sampling to keep feed oil concentration constant variations in process temperature causes change in emulsion viscosity and shear stress near the membrane surface and result in permeate flux variations since the emulsion was circulating in the setup throughout the process time it could have caused the temperature variation throughout the membrane filtration process and resulted dsd variations to evaluate this process under temperature independent conditions and eliminate the energy equations in the modeling heat exchanger is used to keep the process temperature constant the chemical oxygen demand cod 43 was used to calculate oil concentration in the permeate flow and measure the rejection rate 3 theory 3 1 problem description and module geometry due to not significant changes in results less than unity value of height to width ratio of membrane module h w 0 04 and less computational time the 2d modeling is utilized for cfd model calculations the heights and lengths of the rectangular feed channel membrane and permeation channel are 1 100 mm2 0 12 100 mm2 and 0 3 100 mm2 respectively as shown schematically with the imposed boundary conditions in fig 6 the feed is a mixture of two phase oil as the dispersed phase and water as the continuous phase in order to omit the mesh size effects on the permeate flux results i e the mesh dependency tests cfd modeling is carried out under different mesh sizes to find the coarsest size which no significant accuracy improvement is observed as demonstrated in fig 7 this led to 36 674 square computational cells resulting in acceptable error compared to computations carried out with 54 000 cells 3 2 governing equations the hydrodynamics of the fluid flow in the membrane module in cross flow microfiltration processes may be studied through discretization of the geometry and the solution of the governing equations in the present study the feed flow of oil in water emulsion is assumed to be laminar incompressible and isothermal 3 2 1 fluid hydrodynamics a mixture containing water as the continuous phase and oil as the dispersed phase at low concentrations with the specific dsd is fed to feed channel inlet for emulsions with dispersed phase less than 10 the mixture model form euler euler approach is appropriate model to predict process behavior as reported in literature the model concepts are founded on volume fraction and other parameters such as relative velocity and drag force which are used in feed and permeate channels mixture model equations for the two phases oil in water emulsion of dispersed phase p and continuous phase q are presented in the following 3 2 1 1 continuous phase continuity equation is 2 ρ t ρ u 0 momentum equation is the navier stokes equation represented below 3 ρ d u d t p μ 2 u ρ g where ρ is density μ is viscosity u is the velocity vector

acceleration thus continuity equation for a mixture which is derived from summation of the phases is in the following 11 t ρ m ρ m v m 0 where ρm and vm are the mixture density and mass average velocity which are calculated as follows 12 v m k 1 n φ k ρ k v k ρ m 13 ρ m k 1 n φ k ρ k momentum equation for mixture properties and the parameter introduced above is given as follows 14 t ρ m v m

velocity for the dispersed phase p is calculated as follows 3 2 2 mass transfer equation the mass balance equation is 16 c t u c d c where c is the oil concentration d is the oil in water diffusion coefficient the dispersion in the x direction is assumed negligible and a combination of shear induced and molecular diffusion coefficient is used for diffusion in y direction described as follows 17 d y d m 0 33 u y α p 2 φ 2 1 0 5 e 8 8 φ where dm demonstrates the molecular diffusion of oil in water φ represents oil volume fraction αp is the oil droplet size and the second term in the right hand side of eq 17 indicates the shear induced diffusion the eqs 16 and 17 are used to predict oil concentration in the feed and permeate channels and related to oil saturation at the membrane boundaries as is stated in section 2 2 4 3 2 3 membrane equations pore blocking prediction although the oil droplets flow through the porous membranes may be involved very mechanisms but a transport process with convection and dispersion mechanisms are assumed as dominant phenomena to simulate membrane pore blocking the continuity and mass transfer equations for the membrane section are described as 44 18 ε p ρ t ρ u 0 18a u κ μ p 19 ε p c t c u d c c 19a c s ρ where εp is the membrane porosity κ is the membrane permeability ρ is the fluid density μ is the fluid viscosity u is the fluid velocity p is the membrane pressure dc is the capillary diffusion s is the fluid saturation and c is the fluid content these equations are solved for both phases which are related together through their saturation the rate of diffusion and fouling in the membrane pores are based on relative permeability of each phase hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity property of membrane and interfacial tension effects due to interaction between membrane surface and oil droplets is defined by capillary diffusion 42 in the current simulation contact angle between membrane pores surface and oil droplets is assumed 120 degrees based on monfared et al 7 work and the capillary diffusion calculated from capillary pressure 45 is used as a constant value in the membrane governing equations as represented in table 1 in the present simulation it is assumed that oil droplets separate from water within the membrane pores based on their relative permeability difference lower relative permeability of one phase causes lower permeability of that phase within the membrane pores and results in a decreased its saturation concentration 3 2 4 volume fraction and saturation mass balance and mixture model equations are coupled at membrane boundaries to do so the velocity used in the mass balance equation is calculated from the mixture model and the oil volume fraction to solve the mixture flow equations is obtained from oil concentration calculations of the mass balance equation the relation between concentration and volume fraction is 20 φ c o i l c w a t e r m w o i l m w m i x ρ m i x ρ o i l mwoil and mwmix indicates the oil and mixture molecular weights and ρoil and ρmix represents the oil and mixture densities respectively the water properties are assumed for the mixture density and molecular weight for inlet condition due to low concentration of oil in emulsion but the mixture properties are calculated locally and replaced in eq 20 based on mixture model calculations eq 21 is used to relate the oil volume fraction in the mixture model to oil saturation at the membrane boundaries 21 s φ ε p where φ is the oil volume fraction and s is the oil saturation 3 2 5 empirical models 3 2 5 1 cake formation when oil droplets larger than the average pore size accumulate on the membrane surface cake layer formation occurs as time elapses cake layer thickness δc grows the resistance of this layer increases consequently diminishing the permeate flux to consider the effects of this layer on permeate flux a model may be described as follows 22 1 j 1 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where j0 and kc are the initial permeate flux and the constant of the cake formation model respectively this empirical model has been developed to describe cake layer formation effects on permeate flux reduction for the microfiltration process of oil in water emulsion experimentally by abbasi et al 46 but in the present modeling darcy s law is used to predict cake formation phenomenon which its formula is as follows 23 j δ p μ l c r c where j is the permeate flux δp is the pressure difference between feed channel and membrane section μ is the emulsion viscosity lc and rc are the thickness and resistance of cake layer formation in this equation the amount of lcrc is unknown and is predicted in the present study as follows due to dsd diagram reported in fig 5 which the oil droplets size was larger than mean membrane pore size the experimental permeate fluxes can be predicted by eq 22 under these conditions of dsd only the cake formation was occurred and pore blocking can be neglected the lcrc term used in darcy s law can be predicted as a function of time based on back calculation method of simultaneous using of eqs 22 23 and experimental permeate fluxes 3 2 5 2 pore blocking as mentioned in the section 3 2 3 pore blocking effects is simulated directly using membrane governing equations but adding a separated 2d domain for membrane in the simulation and solving membrane equations can be caused more computational time in order to minimize the computational time the membrane can be assumed as a boundary condition using empirical model for this purpose intermediate pore blocking model can be utilized which its equation is 24 1 j 2 1 j 1 k i a t where ki is a constant in the intermediate pore blocking model and a is the membrane surface area 46 the ki term is unknown in this equation which can be calculated by comparing two modeling cases of cake formation alone and both cake formation and pore blocking 3 2 6 rejection rate and cp layer thickness the oil rejection from membrane is given by 47 25 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c b 100 where cp and cb are oil concentrations in permeate and bulk feed flow channels respectively the cp layer thickness is calculated under condition blew 26 c o c b c b 0 01 the distance from the membrane surface where the oil concentration co is 99 of the bulk oil concentration cb 3 3 boundary conditions and assumptions the boundary conditions for computational domain are represented in table 2 some assumptions used in the present modeling are as follows the feed is a mixture of continuous and dispersed phase with the specific dsd entering the domain at the same velocity and under laminar conditions through the feed channel all walls in membrane module are considered as impermeable with no slip boundary condition being imposed the mean membrane pore size is defined as a condition such that droplets smaller than it could pass through the membrane and those larger could not the pressure drop in the feed channel is assumed negligible the membrane resistance term i e lmrm exp is calculated from experimental permeate flux for pure water using darcy s law and the cake resistance term i e lcrc exp is measured for oil in water emulsion experimentally after 60 min which presented in table 3 these two parameters are used in steady state study which is explained in details in solution algorithm due to dsd results in fig 2 it is assumed that oil phase enters into the membrane pores with vinc as flux and the oil rejection is not 100 in contrary to previous research such as tashvigh et al 37 simplifying assumptions 3 4 solution strategy finite element method was utilized to solve the nonlinear equations of momentum and mass balance using a developed home code coupled with femlab v2 3 the segregated implicit pressure projection algorithm based on the pressure correction algorithm was used for pressure velocity coupling control volume technique was used for discretization of governing equations in the computational domain in steady state simulation fluid properties were updated based on the initialized solution but in time dependent simulation those were updated based on the ongoing solution the convergence criteria for the momentum and volume fraction residuals were 10 4 and 10 6 respectively for solving the equations a total number of 4 5 106 iterations were used in the computational domain using intel xeon e3 1240 3 5 ghz cpu and 32 gb of ram as the system in the current study two separated modeling were performed as follows case 1 steady state modeling in this simulation the cake formation and pore blocking resistances terms i e lcrc and lmrm respectively using in darcy s law equation are considered as constant values based on experimental measurements thus the permeate fluxes are only function of local pressure in the membrane module this modeling is validated by two separated experimental works lotfiyan et al work and present work the solution algorithm of this modeling is represented in fig 8 it should be noted that a constant mean oil droplets diameter based on dsd results in fig 2 is assumed for feed inlet condition case 2 unsteady state modeling in this simulation as mentioned in the previous sections first the cake resistance term i e lcrc used in the darcy s law was obtained as a function of time using eqs 22 and 23 and experimental permeate fluxes this term was calculated for dsd reported in fig 5 as initial feed condition which only cake formation occurred under these conditions the pore blocking phenomenon can be neglected due to dsd and membrane pore size after finding the cake resistance function the dsd reported in fig 2 is initiated at feed inlet to ensure both cake layer and pore blocking occur thus by predicting the cake formation effects on permeate flux reduction the effects of pore blocking phenomenon are directly investigated based on membrane governing equations and cfd calculations the solution algorithm for unsteady sated modeling is also presented in fig 9 4 results and discussions 4 1 steady state modeling 4 1 1 validation and pore blocking effects in steady state simulation the membrane and cake layer resistances are assumed constant therefore the permeate flux is a function of local pressure only as mentioned lotfiyan et al 36 evaluated the steady state permeate flux with a significant error they did not consider pore blocking and the cake layer thickness increasing as time elapses they considered the membrane as a line in their simulation and used the membrane resistance under steady state conditions when permeate flux was stable for pure water as the used resistance term in darcy s law equation it should be noted that their emulsion properties are extracted from their work 36 and used in the current simulation they also used this resistance for pure water to predict oil in water emulsion as cake formation resistance in their simulation not computing the cake formation resistance experimentally to evaluate the effects of pore blocking a modeling of their work under the same conditions is performed and pore blocking is added in the simulation which its results is presented in table 4 the values of permeate fluxes showed that by considering pore blocking the relative error decreasing by about 15 but the errors were also considerable thus it was concluded that the main error may be due to not considering the oil droplets accumulation variations with time on the membrane surface and effects of its resistance rise on permeate flux in their work 4 1 2 effects of tmp on permeate flux another modeling was on the ca membrane experimental data carried out on three different tmps with cross flow velocity and oil concentration being 0 8 m s and 1000 mg l respectively including both membrane and cake resistances as expected by increasing tmp the permeate flux increases a comparison between steady state experimental data and cfd modeling results are depicted in fig 10 in this case the relative errors are 11 9 20 4 and 26 3 for 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 mpa respectively membrane porosity changes as oil droplets accumulate inside the membrane pores leading to a rise in membrane flow resistance a phenomenon over looked in steady state modeling hence the error may be due to both simplifications of considering the cake layer resistance constant and neglecting the membrane resistance variations due to changes in porosity it should be noted that all steady state permeate fluxes in the experiment are obtained when the changes in permeate flux vs time tend to zero 4 1 3 effects of oil concentration the effects of increasing oil concentration on oil rejection rate under steady state conditions are depicted in fig 11 as observed by increasing oil concentration in the feed flow the amount of oil rejection increases the accumulation of oil droplets and formation of larger droplets creates an obstacle to the passage of smaller particles as expected from eq 25 by increasing feed oil concentration oil concentration in permeate channel cp increases at a much lower rate compared to bulk oil concentration cb thus increasing of cb overcomes the increasing cp leading to an increase in rejection since the cake layer formation and oil droplets accumulation could not be calculated under steady state modeling conditions cp layer is only formed under the influence of oil concentration on the membrane surface and diffusion coefficient relevant to that concentration fig 11 shows the importance of consideration of the pore blocking phenomenon in the simulation and its effects on the steady state rejection at various feed oil concentrations due to small changes is rejection based on fig 11 it is deduced that the rejection under steady state conditions is almost independent of feed oil concentration since the cp layer thickness δcp near the membrane surface is a function of oil accumulation on membrane surface as time elapses the effects of different feed oil concentrations on δcp is evaluated under unsteady state study conditions discussed in section 4 2 3 4 1 4 membrane pressure profile in the current study the membrane pressure is assumed unknown and calculated from membrane governing equations eqs 18 and 19 the membrane pressure profile is depicted in fig 12 a it is clear by increasing tmp the membrane pressure increases as seen in fig 12 b as observed by increasing tmp the slope of membrane pressure vs membrane length increases but an issue that matters here is distribution of the membrane pressure along the membrane length if the beginning and the end effects of the membrane geometry were to be neglected membrane pressure distribution would be linear by moving along the membrane length the fouling and the oil saturation within the membrane pores increase the permeate flux through the membrane decreases consequently the membrane pressure increases the relative pressures are used in modeling but results are reported as absolute pressure 4 2 unsteady state study 4 2 1 effects of tmp under unsteady state conditions an oil droplets size distribution based on fig 2 is considered at feed inlet therefore due to membrane pores diameters both cake layer formation and pore blocking phenomena occur to consider the effects of fouling on permeate flux darcy s law and membrane governing equations are used for cake layer formation and pore blocking which unlike steady state conditions are not constant in this modeling the initial membrane porosity is assumed as a constant value but cfd calculations predict its variations based on oil saturation in the membrane pores as time elapses the permeate flux variations with time at different tmps is presented in fig 13 under unsteady state conditions in which the pore blocking and fouling on the membrane surface are to be considered results showed that the difference between experimental data and model predictions are reduced very much as shown in table 5 it is seen that by increasing the number of computational cells model precision increases a little while the computational time is raised the permeate flux was also calculated for 0 15 mpa and 0 2 mpa for 54 000 computational cells but the relative errors did not change significantly the model underestimation for permeate flux at 0 2 mpa may be due to higher pressure effects on membrane structure and cake formation throughout the membrane filtration and result in higher permeate flux under experimental conditions as shown the steady state permeate flux is near to permeate flux at time of 3600 s for tmp of 0 1 mpa but for tmp of 0 2 mpa more time is needed for the permeate flux to reach steady state conditions 4 2 2 effects of cross flow velocity by increasing cfv feed reynold s number and shear forces on membrane surface increase consequently the thickness of mass boundary layer on the membrane surface decreases the effects of cfv on concentration polarization thickness δcp near the membrane surface are shown in fig 14 it is seen that at higher cfvs resulting in higher feed reynold s number δcp decreases three cfvs are performed under unsteady state conditions the predicted values showed that changing cfv from 0 5 to 0 8 m s decreased the cp layer thickness by about 11 while further increase from 0 8 to 1 1 m s decreased it about 3 since the cp is a time dependent phenomenon as time is elapsed its thickness grows to values larger than that under steady state conditions the reasons for which are mentioned in section 4 1 3 4 2 3 effects of oil concentration by increasing the feed oil concentration the amount of oil droplets accumulation and concentration on membrane surface increase thus effects of cp phenomenon increases as shown in fig 15 as expected by increasing oil accumulation on membrane surface the resistance of cake layer formation increases consequently the permeate flux decreases the effects of different feed oil concentration on pore blocking are depicted in fig 16 as indicated by increasing feed oil concentration the membrane pore blocking increases although not very tangibly this may be due to increased oil droplets collision leading to the formation of larger droplets as oil concentration is increased hindering them from entering into the membrane pores thus preventing pore blocking to change significantly as stated by increasing feed oil concentration the rate of fouling formation on membrane surface increases consequently preventing the oil droplets passing thorough the membrane as time elapses as a result the amount of rejection increases with time the changing of rejection with time is represented in fig 17 the results demonstrate as time elapses at initial process times and before cake formation small droplets pass thorough the membrane pores cp increases and consequently rejection decreases eq 25 and exponential decreasing of rejection may be due to pore blocking phenomenon occurring but from a specific time about 400 s initial layer of cake formed on the membrane surface cp decreases resulting in a slight increase in rejection finally ending on a fixed value as discussed in section 4 1 2 by increasing feed oil concentration cp increases at a very slower rate compared to cb with rejection consequently increasing due to experimental measurements and eq 25 the rejection was obtained 98 2 for oil concentration of 1000 mg l after 60 min the higher model based predicted rejection rates compared to the experimental measurements may be due to squeezing of large oil droplets through the small pores a phenomenon not considered in the current simulation from these results it is deduced that the ca is a suitable hydrophilic membrane to separate oil from oil in water emulsion 5 conclusions the performance of ca membrane in separating oil from oil in water emulsion and the simultaneous employment both cake layer formation and pore blocking phenomena to describe through membrane permeate flux in cross flow microfiltration were investigated the aim of the current study was increasing the precision of modeling considering the phenomena occurring in the process in a first study being under steady state conditions evaluation of membrane pressure distribution was targeted moving along the membrane coincides with raise in oil saturation in membrane pores pore blocking resistance increases decrease in permeate flux thorough the membrane and increase in membrane pressure results also show a linear variation of the membrane pressure along the length under a second set of unsteady state conditions simulation results for permeate fluxes had acceptable agreement in comparisons against experimental data in which absolute minimum and maximum errors were 0 44 and 4 62 respectively in addition effects of different operational conditions on cp layer thickness oil concentration on membrane surface and oil saturation in membrane pores were successfully modeled by increasing feed oil concentration oil saturation inside the membrane pores and the oil concentration on the membrane surface increase also by increasing membrane cfv cp layer thickness decreases results of this survey proved that simultaneous application of the two types of fouling can predict the process behavior well under different operational conditions and may be verified by experimental data appropriately it may be noted that due to its hydrophilic properties ca must be a good choice for the separation of oil in water emulsions in cross flow microfiltration 
14272,the present study aims to investigate the impact of water chemistry shelf life and regeneration of a previously developed chitosan cs polyethyleneimine pei graphene oxide go nanocomposite membrane coating several studies have shown the development of coatings with multifuctionality in di water but have negleted the effects of water chemistry shelf life and chemical regeneration of these nanocomposite coatings for the simultaneous removal of different biological and chemical water contaminants this nanocomposite was selected for this investigation since it showed a broad removal capability this nanocomposite showed removals of cr vi cu ii and pb ii over 90 at 1 ppm initial concentration and nitrate 75 at 20 ppm initial concentration under di water furthermore the coated filters were effective in removing 3 logs of e coli k12 b subtilis and p aeruginosa the integrity and performance of the modified filters were investigated against a wide range of water chemistries with different ph values salinity and total hardness for water chemistries with ph 4 9 salinity 50 1000 ppm and total hardness of 50 500 ppm as caco3 at least one tested contaminant showed similar percentage removals indicating the potential use of the modified filters in these large ranges of water chemistry conditions based on that the filters were used to treat representative samples of wastewater and seawater the coated filters were able to remove suspended particles bacteria and heavy metals effectively later the potential for regeneration and the shelf life of the coated filters were also investigated for the regeneration only 0 1 m hcl was able to desorb up to 40 of the adsorbed heavy metal indicating that the filter can be partially regenerated accelerated experiments of shelf life demonstrated that the modified filters lose their optimum performance around 9 12 months indicating their potential for short term storage without any specific preservation conditions keywords indirect potable reuse water nanocomposite heavy metals removal microorganisms removal 1 introduction water and wastewater treatment facilities can be an integral part of most municipalities depending on the sequence of treatment steps in the wastewater treatment facilities and different downstream treatment approaches of effluent water for drinking water water treatment plants can be categorized as direct potable indirect potable and unplanned potable water reuse plants 1 3 direct potable water reuse plants are common in areas affected by water scarcity as opposed to indirect in the first case the treated wastewater is directly fed to the distribution system for potable reuse while in the second case the wastewater is left for a certain amount of time in a reservoir or natural ponds for natural purification 3 4 in all cases additional treatment is needed to purify the water since the water may still be of poor quality for drinking purposes due to diverse types and levels of contaminants present furthermore in these systems the water chemistry tends to be complex which can make the treatment more complicated polymers as adsorbents have been used widely in both domestic and industrial applications for direct or indirect treatment of water however different polymers carry different contaminant removal capabilities based on their functionality which creates a barrier for applications requiring removal of a wide range of water contaminants for water reuse therefore the direction of research has moved toward incorporating nanomaterials with diverse polymeric materials to provide functional variety structural strength and stability this approach has several advantages such as enhanced adsorption capacity selectivity improved design flexibility and potential for large scale fabrication 5 6 a special interest has drawn to natural polymers or biopolymers such as cellulose lignin hemicellulose and chitosan cs to form graphene based nanocomposites with enhanced or multifunctional properties 7 9 previous studies done by our research group and others have shown that it is easy to successfully disperse graphene based nanomaterial into a polymer matrix yielding new multifunctional nanocomposites 7 8 10 11 these nanocomposites also have shown to prevent biofouling while being non toxic to mammalian cells although some researchers have investigated these nanocomposites with real water samples we have very little understanding of how changes in the water chemistry would impact these nanocomposites more importantly how long these biopolymer nanocomposites can maintain their active coating layer after storage or chemical regeneration in a previous preliminary study 12 we developed using a mathematical approach within response surface methodology rsm an optimized coating containing graphene oxide go embedded into a polymeric matrix made of cs and polyethyleneimine pei 12 the preliminary results of this nanocomposite with spiked deionized water di suggested the ability of this coating to remove positive and negative heavy metal ions the preliminary results were based on only two differently charged heavy metals spiked in di water in the present study we build upon these initial findings and confirm the ability of this coating to remove diverse range of contaminants such as nitrate microorganisms and other toxic heavy metals not only in di water but also under complex water chemistries after chemical regeneration and after different storage times in the present study the removal efficiency by the coating was further analysed in a wide range of ph values salinity and hardness the modified filters were used to treat representative wastewater and seawater samples spiked with heavy metals and microorganisms to quantify the performance of the modified filters with real world water samples that have complex water chemistries finally the shelf life and capability of regeneration of the coated filters were investigated this systematic study gives us an understanding of the impact of different types of water chemistries as well as shelf life and chemical regeneration impact on the treatment capability of

dissolved in di water to prepare 500 ppm stock solutions of cr vi cu ii pb ii cd ii and ni ii metal ions to prepare the 500 ppm nitrate stock solution potassium nitrate kno3 crystals was used to prepare the bacterial wastewater solution first the desired bacterium was inoculated into 25 ml of liquid nutrient media e coli k12 and b subtilis were grown in tryptic soy broth tsb media while p aeruginosa was grown in luria broth lb media all three bacteria were grown at 37 c overnight in their respective media then they were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min to separate the bacterial cells from the media bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs solution with an optical density of 0 5 at 600 nm od600 using the biotek synergy 2 multi mode reader dilutions of 100 fold were used for actual filtrations the solutions were made freshly for each filtration carried out to prepare a liquid stock of bacteriophage the host bacterium e coli atcc 15597 was inoculated in tsb media and processed as described earlier 15 detailed information about the bacteriophage stock preparation and enumeration are given in esi text s3 2 4 contaminant removal experiments with synthetic wastewater solutions initial validation of the removal of different contaminants was done as dead end filtrations in smaller volumes such as 20 ml using the cs pei go coated gmf filters larger volumes of 1 l were also used later to validate the contaminant removals in larger batches for cr vi cu ii and pb ii initial concentrations of 1 10 and 20 ppm were used while for cd

metals were analyzed using the flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas aanalyst 200 from perkin elmer using chromium copper lead cadmium and nickel lamps from perkin elmer five standard solutions were prepared as calibration standards with known heavy metal concentrations the averages and standard deviations of triplicate measurements are reported for all measurements nitrate concentrations were measured with a thermo scientific orion nitrate electrode equipped with a sure flow combination electrode 9707bnwp an ionic strength adjuster was added to nitrate samples based on the target nitrate concentration of each sample for the bacterial removal bacterial solutions were passed through the modified filters bacterial concentrations of the filtrates and the initial solutions were measured using the drop plating method after serially diluting with pbs for the bacteriophage removal bacteriophage solutions were passed through cs pei go coated gmf membranes 16 to measure the concentration titer of filtrates the plaque forming units pfu ml counts on double layer agar plating was used 33 the filtrates were serially diluted with 1x pbs aliquots of 0 1 ml of these dilutions were mixed with 0 9 ml of six hours old bacterial host and 3 ml of warm soft agar which was poured onto pre solidified tsa plates and incubated at 37 c after about 24 h of incubation higher dilutions of the filtrates resulted in countable plaques of bacteriophage on the lawn of bacteria this number was counted and according to the dilution factor bacteriophage concentration was determined as pfu ml for all these experiments non coated gmf membranes were used as the negative controls all the experiments were done in three or more replicates the results were averaged out and standard deviations were calculated 2 5 investigating effect of water chemistry on contaminant removal removal efficiencies of cr vi nitrate and e coli k12 with varying water chemistries were investigated individually investigated water chemistry variables were ph salinity and hardness working synthetic wastewater solutions were prepared by diluting from the stock solutions prepared and by changing the water chemistry as mentioned below for the ph related experiments the ph of the solutions was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions with ph 4 9 were used for the experiments for salinity related experiments sodium chloride nacl was added to prepare solutions with desired salinity in the range of 0 1000 ppm for the hardness related experiments calcium carbonate caco3 was added to prepare solutions with 0 500 ppm hardness as caco3 initial concentrations of solutions were set at 10 ppm 20 ppm and 107 cfu ml for cr vi nitrate and e coli k12 respectively the removals were quantified using the respective techniques mentioned above 2 6 wastewater sample collection and contaminant removal the performance of the filters in real contaminated water with complex water chemistries was tested using representative wastewater and seawater the representative wastewater contained 95 v v bayou water and 5 v v wastewater influent more information about the collection of water samples and their characteristics can be found in the esi text s4 and table s1 due to undetectable amounts of chromium or copper in the environmental samples they were spiked with these metals before the filtration experiments to have 10 ppm of initial metal concentrations samples were also spiked with bacteriophage ms2 to investigate the effect on virus removal these water sources however already contained microorganisms therefore no additional microorganisms were added for bacterial removal experiments heterotrophic plate count hpc was used to measure the number of bacteria before and after the filtration employing the drop plating method 16 effect of filtration on solid removal was measured in terms of total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss employing the gravimetric method 17 2 7 investigation of reusability of coated filters based on cr vi adsorption a set of adsorption and desorption experiments were performed to analyze the reusability of the coated filters for these adsorption experiments the cr vi solution was prepared in di water with 2 ppm initial concentration one liter of cr vi solution was filtered with the cs pei go coated gmf filters throughout the filtration samples were collected every 10 ml intervals until 250 ml and every 15 ml interval until 1000 ml and was analyzed using aas the amount of cr vi adsorbed wad in this step was calculated as follows 1 amount of cr adsorbed wad ci ce v here ci is the initial concentration of the synthetic solution of cr and ce is the final cr concentration of the filtrate v is the total volume which was 1000 ml in this case spent membranes were then treated with different desorption agents a volume of 100 ml of these agents namely 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m nahco3 and 0 1 m nacl were filtered through used membranes desorption was calculated as a percentage with respect to the amount of cr adsorbed during the previous step as follows here wde is the desorbed cr amount regenerated filters were again used for the cr vi filtrations after being washed with 100 ml of di water eq 1 was used again to calculate the amount of cr vi adsorption 2 d e s o r p t i o n w d e w a d 100 2 8 accelerated aging of coated filters a thermal aging process was employed to assess the effect of storing and aging of cs pei go coated filters the accelerated aging was equivalent to 3 12 months of storage under room temperature at 24 c the aging procedure was carried out as suggested by astm f1980 and nbsir 74 499 protocols 18 19 astm f1980 is the standard guide for accelerated aging of sterile barrier systems for medical devices and nbsir 74 499 is the protocol for accelerated aging for papers combining these two procedures filters were stored at 55 c for a calculated pre determined period accelerated aging time aat which were calculated as follows 3 a c c e l e r a t e d a g i n g t i m e a a t d e s i r e d r e a l t i m e r t q 10 t a a t r a 10 here the accelerated aging temperature taa is measured in c common taa values are 50 c 55 c and 60 c the 55 c was selected for corresponding to the average ambient temperature trt was measured in c the temperature typically varies between 20 c 25 c and can be interpreted as the storage temperature in this study it was 24 c the aging factor q10 is unitless and this factor is typically between 1 8 2 5 with a value of 2 0 being the most common which was selected for this calculation after the aging these filter membranes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem and were tested for cr vi cu ii and e coli k12 removal the results were compared to the results with freshly coated filters also the membranes were analyzed with atr ftir to visualize the differences between the aged membranes 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of cs pei go coted filters the successful dip coating of the gmf filters with cs pei go nanocomposite was confirmed by the detailed characterization of the coating sem images shown in fig 1 a and b illustrates the appearance of the successful cs pei go coating on the fiber like structure of the bare gmf membrane as shown in the atr ftir spectrum of the cs pei go coated filters in fig 1c new peaks appeared at 1396 1449 1638 2852 2923 and 3359 cm 1 after the coating step the peak at 1396 can be attributed to the ch stretch from nhcoch3 group from cs while the peak at 1449 cm 1 was assigned to the ch bending 14 the peak at 1638 was assigned to the carbonyl stretching of the nhcogroup or the carbonyl results from the cross linking peaks at 2852 and 2923 cm 1 were assigned to ch vibrations from ch2 and ch3 respectively which were originated from cs and pei 20 a broad peak was visible around 3100 3600 cm 1 range the peak at 3359 cm 1 was attributed to oh from go and cs and nh2 from cs and pei 14 20 fig 1d and e show the deconvolution of the o1s and n1s peak of the high resolution xps spectra of cs pei go coating respectively the deconvolution of the o1s core level spectrum shows three major peaks with binding energies of 531 8 532 9 and 534 ev these binding energies were attributed to aliphatic coc oh or co groups and oco groups mainly found in the go structure deconvolution of n1s core level spectrum has two major peaks at 397 6 and 399 8 ev binding energies which can be assigned to imine cn and amine nh2 groups which are found in cs and pei 10 21 the c o ratio for the bare gmf membrane showed a decreased from 7 5 to 1 1 for the cs pei go coating due to the presence of carbonaceous groups on the surface of the filter in summary the characterization of cs pei go coated filters shows the successful coating procedure and availability of different functional groups from the components of the nanocomposites that are useful in contaminant removals the synthesis was based on the optimized procedure already published 12 in the previous investigation the grafting efficiency based on the thermogravimetric analysis was estimated to be 27 on the coated membranes 12 the change of water flux after the cs pei go coating was also determined and extensively explained in our previously published study 12 in brief the flow rate increased from 227 lm 1s 1 to 411 lm 1s 1 after the cs pei go coating indicating that the incorporation of hydrophilic cs has facilitated the liquid flow through the pores 3 2 contaminant removal experiments with synthetic wastewater solutions the coated filters were tested for the removal of various contaminants firstly the cs pei go coating was optimized based on the heavy metals cr vi and cu ii removals results showed removal of both contaminants efficiently with 10 ppm concentrations 12 for the other heavy metal contaminants tested in this study analytical conditions for the aas are shown in esi table s2 in this study cr vi and cu ii were further analyzed for the following concentrations 1 and 20 ppm these extreme concentrations were not previously analyzed in the coating optimization investigation 12 to understand the effect of initial concentration three different initial concentrations were selected for each heavy metal based on their respective linear ranges in the aas instrument this approach allowed us a more accurate quantification of the metals and also allowed us to achieve more realistic concentrations found in the environment as shown in esi table s2 22 23 based on the aas linear ranges for each metal cd ii and ni ii were studied at 1 5 and 10 ppm while cr vi cu ii and pb ii were studied at 1 10 and 20 ppm fig 2 summarizes the results of the removal experiments for heavy metals and nitrates cs pei go coated gmf filters were able to remove over 90 cr vi fig 2a cu ii fig 2b and pb ii fig 2c at 1 ppm cr vi removal was consistent up to 20 ppm and reached 99 removals however cu ii and pb ii removals dropped when the initial concentration increased for ni ii the highest removal of 62 was obtained for an initial concentration of 1 ppm as shown in fig 2d however the coated filters were not very effective in removing cd ii as less than 15 removals were recorded for initial concentrations up to 10 ppm fig 2e adsorption effect is affected by the size of the hydration radius the smaller the hydration radius and the larger the charge density per area the better will be the affinity of the metal for the adsorbent since cd2 exhibits a larger hydration radius 4 26 å compared to the other heavy metals a reduced adsorption is observed with this metal than the others 24 25 nitrate is an inorganic contaminant which is also regulated by epa with an allowable limit of up to 10 ppm maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water experiments for nitrate were carried out for the initial concentrations between 20 and 60 ppm cs pei go coated gmf filters showed maximum removals of 78 at 20 ppm fig 2f while the removal decreased with the increasing initial concentrations furthermore since the number of adsorption sites remained the same higher initial contaminant concentrations resulted in saturation of adsorption sites in the heavy metal removal cs and pei play a major role the mechanism of removal for the prepared filters involve the participation of the unshared electron pair present in the nitrogen atom of the amine group from the cs and pei this electron pair will form a donor bond with the unsaturated transition metals then the hydroxyl and amine groups present will capture the metals while forming a shared bond between the metal and the amino groups of cs and pei 26 results for microbiological contaminant removals are shown in fig 3 bacterial removals were over 3 logs or 99 9 with cs pei go coated filters for all three bacterial strains b subtilis was also removed with the non coated filters this can be understood as b subtilis is a much larger bacteria compared to the other two types of bacteria used b subtilis is about 4 10 μm long and 0 25 1 0 μm in diameter compared to the 1 2 μm length of e coli k12 and 1 5 μm length of p aeruginosa 27 29 however in the case of uncoated filters the mechanisms of removal are entirely sieving i e based on the size of the bacterial cells and the pore structure of the bare membranes however for the cs pei go coated filters the mechanism is driven by a combination of sieving and antimicrobial activity therefore recording much higher removals with bacteria 30 31 the sem images of the coated and uncoated filters taken after the e coli k12 filtration are given in fig 4 this result shows how effective the coated filters entrapped and inactivated bacteria during filtration it was not possible to see any bacteria retained on the bare membranes fig 4a for the modified filters as shown in fig 4b these bacterial cells seemed to be adsorbed and distorted indicating that they could potentially be inactivated due to the antimicrobial properties of the go we can clearly see aggregation on the coated gmf membrane due to bacterial cell adsorption observation of distorted cells in the presence of go is a well studied phenomenon as go tends to work as nano blades and puncture bacterial cells 32 33 another possibility is the generation of reactive oxygen species which could destroy the bacterial cells 19 the nano sized bacteriophage ms2 was not retained by the cs pei go coated gmf membranes fig s2 showed the comparison between the coated and uncoated filters we can see that even if the viruses could pass through the filter some were inactivated due to the antimicrobial properties of go 3 3 effect of water chemistry on contaminant removal for any water treatment technique it is important to expect varying water chemistries of the source water hence it is important to investigate the removal efficiency of any novel water treatment technique under different water chemistries in order to assure a high quality purification process 34 35 in this study effects of changing ph salinity and hardness on removal efficiencies of indicator contaminants were investigated therefore we selected three different contaminants such as a heavy metal cr vi a microorganism e coli k12 and a nutrient contaminant nitrate for further study since these contaminants were shown earlier to have higher removals by the filter coating compared to the other studied contaminants fig 5 shows the summary of results for removal of cr vi nitrate and e coli k12 the ph is a measure of acidity and basicity which is affected by the natural environment or can be man made for instance sources of ph changes can come from photosynthesis microbial respiration in the water dissolution of carbon dioxide acid rain acidic discharges and mineral discharges 36 usually for surface water systems ph values range from 6 5 to 8 5 while for groundwater systems the range is from 6 to 8 5 37 in this study a range of ph 4 to 9 was tested representing the possible ph range for different water sources fig 5a throughout for the selected ph range the removal was always above 95 for cr vi with the cs pei go coated filters although ph affected the active sites that are responsible for antimicrobial properties of the coating no significant result is shown in the removal of e coli k12 at various ph ranges 38 39 effect of the ph was more prominent in nitrate removal when acidic and basic conditions lowered the percentage nitrate removal significantly in the case of anionic contaminants that are removed via electrostatic interactions with positively charged functional groups of the nanocomposites ph lower than 5 was more favourable for removal 40 43 since more h ions are in the solution at acidic ph there were some restrictions in the free movement of nitrate ions toward the adsorption sites with increasing ph more oh ions are present in the solution these ions compete with the nitrate ions and hence decrease the adsorption capacity of the filter 44 fig s3 showed a decrease in the zeta potential at higher ph values which suggested favorable adsorption of negatively charged species in lower ph values salinity is the mass of dissolved salts in a certain mass of water measured in ppm parts per million or ppt parts per thousand or psu practical salinity units 45 salinity often interferes with contaminant removals by claiming adsorption sites and competing with other contaminants in the source water in general for the surface and groundwater sources salinities below 80 ppm are considered preferable for consumption whereas salinities above 1000 ppm are considered to be poor in quality 45 a range of 50 1000 ppm was used in this study as shown in fig 5b cr vi removal remained consistent throughout the selected salinity range previously it was shown that chlorides interfere with nitrate adsorption by suppressing nitrate uptake at elevated chloride concentrations 46 our results corroborate this nitrate removal trend with increasing salinity furthermore fig 5b showed no significant changes in bacterial removals with increasing salinity indicating salinity does not interfere with bacterial removal total hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the source water measured in ppm as caco3 it is common to see hardness cause problems in water treatment facilities and membrane technologies by aiding scaling on membrane surfaces 47 48 water sources can be categorized into different levels of total hardness 0 60 ppm as caco3 as soft water 61 120 ppm as caco3 as moderately hard 121 180 ppm as caco3 as hard and 180 ppm as caco3 as very hard 49 50 to represent all these categories a range of 50 500 ppm as caco3 of total hardness was tested in this study overall hardness showed an inhibitory role for cr vi and nitrate removals with increasing hardness as shown in fig 5c the addition of more carbonate in the initial solution resulted in reduction of acidity therefore inhibiting electrostatic attraction of anionic contaminants 51 in conclusion the optimized cs pei go coating remained effective in a variety of water chemistries except for the source waters with very high total hardness the cs pei go coated gmf filters presented consistent removals throughout the selected ranges of water chemistries indicating the applicability of the modified coating with cs pei go for water purification applications it is important to mention that in real water samples the ranges of such water qualities can be narrow depending on the cleanliness and the water source used however the extreme conditions such as high ph or high salinity can be correlated to harsh environments that could occur in nature additionally it is also important to understand how more complex water chemistries affect removals therefore the coated filters were tested to filter real environmental water samples 3 4 the performance of the filters in real contaminated water with complex water chemistry a representative wastewater sample containing 95 v v bayou water and 5 v v wastewater influent as well as a water sample of seawater were filtered with the optimized cs pei go coated filters to observe the performance of the filters in more realistic conditions table s1 contains the physical and chemical characterization of the collected samples and table s3 compile the removal data for all the experiments performed in wastewater and seawater the removals can be interpreted as changes to physical and chemical properties as well as the contaminant removal the initial treatment of the collected water was first determined via physical properties of the water such as turbidity and tss fig 6 the seawater contained higher turbidity which was 181 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu than the representative wastewater that contained 32 ntu the filtrate of the latter resulted in 0 9 ntu on average while the seawater filtrate presented a turbidity of 1 5 ntu according to epa s national primary drinking water regulations turbidity should not exceed 1 ntu if the treatment system contains conventional or direct filtration at no time can the turbidity measurement go higher than 1 ntu 23 in that sense the filtrate produced from the representative wastewater was the closest to that limit fig 6a from the gravimetric analysis total dissolved solids tds in the representative wastewater was reduced to 670 mg l compared to the initial amount of 760 mg l after the filtration with cs pei go coated filters fig 6b with respect to the epa s drinking water regulations recorded tds was higher than the regulated limit of 500 mg l for the seawater which contained a very high amount of tds 33 500 mg l compared to the representative wastewater it only reduced to 30 000 mg l after the filtration this removal of about 3000 ppm for tds was observed for the non coated and cs pei go coated filters therefore suggesting the limitation of the coating in removing tds in contrast much larger suspended solids were well removed during the filtration fig 6c for the representative wastewater the removal dropped to 18 mg l from initial total suspended solids tss amount of 82 mg l seawater contained a much higher amount of tss 2700 mg l and after filtration it measured at 220 mg l in summary the filtration alone was effective in removing tss from the water however it was ineffective in removing dissolved solids such as ions and salts 39 therefore it is important to use this type of modified membranes coupled with another treatment approach if the water contains considerable amounts of dissolved solids in the case of cr vi and cu ii removals they were similar for both seawater and representative wastewater as shown in fig 7 a and b the cr vi removals were slightly higher than the removals recorded with the experiments performed earlier with di water it is possible that organic matter in the water would also act as a flocculant therefore entrapping heavy metals such as cr vi and cu ii in the flocs as they got removed from the water during filtration 52 53 the tested water samples contained microorganisms measured in the form of heterotrophic plate count though no additional bacteria were added to the source water they were spiked with bacteriophage ms2 to perform filtrations to investigate their removals as shown in fig 7c the filter was able to reduce 3 2 logs of the heterotrophic bacteria it is important to note that hpc consist of a variety of culturable microorganisms present in water which is essentially not a single bacteria rather a mixture of bacterial species that will show a colonial growth on hpc agar plates 54 seawater contained less initial hpc 5 3 102 cfu ml compared to the representative wastewater 3 4 106 cfu ml and also showed reduced removals of hpc during the filtration the modified filter was able to remove 3 1 logs in wastewater while for seawater the removal was 2 7 logs however with bacteriophage more removal 2 8 logs was recorded for the seawater compared to 1 5 log removal in wastewater overall ms2 removals were much higher than compared to the experiments with ms2 solutions made with di water it is possible that the solids in the source water have worked as a flocculant entrapping bacteriophage during the filtration and therefore improving their removal it is well known that the flocculation enhances the bacteriophage removal during filtrations 55 3 5 regeneration and reusability of the modified filters the modified filters were used for filtration of larger volumes of 2 ppm cr vi 2 ppm cu ii and 20 ppm nitrate solutions adsorption curves for each contaminant are shown in the fig 8 unlike cu ii and nitrate for cr vi it took much longer time to saturate and exceed the mcl limit of the selected contaminant in the coated filters these results show that the removal of different contaminants will vary with the coating the possibility of regeneration and reusability of modified filters were also investigated since the removal of cr vi was more efficient filters retaining cr vi was further investigated for regeneration it is important to highlight however that cr vi concentration of the filtrate did not reach a saturation value even after filtrating 1 l indicating there could be free sites still available for cr vi adsorption the used filters were treated with desorption agents that had diverse properties as shown in fig 9 none of the desorption agents were able to remove more than 40 of the adsorbed amount of cr vi indicating stronger complexation of cr species to the adsorption sites during the filtration in addition subsequent filtrations with cr vi solutions with the desorbed modified filters showed lower cr vi removals the use of 0 1 m hcl was the most efficient solution for the regeneration of cr vi adsorbed to the coating as mentioned earlier with adsorption sites available even after the 1st adsorption there were vacant adsorption sites that could remove cr in the subsequent filtration it is worth to note that regeneration of filter systems is important in industrial contexts where more focus is given in enhancing the number of total adsorption sites by changing the physical and chemical properties of the coating materials 3 6 accelerated aging of filters aging is another aspect that needed to be determined for the cs pei go coated filters as cs polymers is a natural polymer which can be degraded over time 56 due to its degradability it could affect the overall stability of the filter coating therefore it is better to quantify how long the performance of the coating remains unchanged under normal storage conditions to investigate that thermal accelerated aging was performed on the filters experiments were equivalent to storage times of up to 12 months aged modified filters were tested for cr vi cu ii and bacterial removal and compared to the removals of freshly coated filters fig 10 illustrates the removals for the selected contaminants when treated with the aged filters to determine statistically the significance of the removal changes t tests were carried out this was done for both coated filters and respective uncoated filters in order to provide a clear insight of the differences in the filter matrix itself when stored for a long time to be exact storing of 3 6 9 and 12 months periods when considering the cr vi removal cs pei go coated gmf membranes showed a significant drop in removal in 12 months while the removal from uncoated gmf remained the same for up to 12 months fig 10a data for cu ii removals suggest that the cs pei go coated gmf membranes show a significant drop in removal after 9 months of storage however bare gmf membranes did not show any significant change in terms of cu vi removals fig 10b similarly when considering bacteria removals a significant reduction was evident after storage for 9 months fig 10c similarly the bare gmf membranes also showed reduced removal trend after 9 months the preservation of the nanocomposite structure was confirmed by the atr ftir and sem images to ensure no significant structural or composition change after 12 months of aging was happening figs s4 and s5 the sem images showed no significative changes in the morphology of the nanocomposites compared to the no aged filter fig s5 shows the atr ftir results before and after 12 months aged in the spectra we can appreciate some loss of some of the functionalities for the cs pei go gmf nanocomposites the loss of some of the functional groups such as oh and nh2 can explain the efficiency loss in the heavy metal removal nonetheless the removal of contaminants is still suitable before 9 months the loss of efficiency is no more than 10 hence it is safe to say that the coated filters were consistent in removing the tested contaminants compared to the freshly coated filters suggesting that around 9 12 months the cs pei go coatings started to show signs of decay in other words this means that the coated filters can be used in the first 9 months without losing its removal efficiencies however it is also important to note that the method of aging used in this study is not a standardized method for coatings we adapted the methods suggested in astm f1980 standard guide and nbsir 74 499 which were protocols developed primarily for the accelerated aging of sterile barrier systems for medical devices and for papers in this case heating was used as the aging technique based on the arrhenius equation which explains that the higher temperatures result in higher reaction rates 57 but in other terms heating can also be considered as a physical crosslinking method and therefore higher fatigue temperatures could have adversely affected the performance of the filters not only by aging alone 58 it is important to note that modified filters could be stored under vacuum or acclimated conditions which could potentially extend the shelf life of the coatings however in in our experimental design we did not investigate alternative methods to better preserve the coatings on the contrary our focus was to test them under the worst case scenarios 4 conclusions a previously optimized cs pei go coating on gmf membranes was investigated to understand the behavior of the coating with different water contaminants under a wide range of water chemistries the coatings were effective in removing heavy metals such as cr cu and pb nitrate and bacteria from the solutions containing these contaminants in di water the coating was tested under different water chemistries ph salinity hardness and alkalinity and shown to perform consistently for a wide range of water chemistries coated filters were investigated against real environmental waters where they were effective in removing cr cu hpc and bacteriophage despite the presence of complex water chemistries in the desorption studies 0 1 m hcl was found to be the best desorption agent however it was not very effective to regenerate all binding sites in the coating indicating that the coating cannot be completely regenerated the accelerated aging experiments indicated that the long term storage of the coated filters is possible for up to 9 months without any special storing procedure a vacuum or under dry or temperature regulated conditions as a summary cs pei go coating has emerged as a promising nanocomposite coating that can be used as a multifunctional water treatment technique we were able to demonstrate that it can remove a variety of contaminants and is effective in many water chemistries this coating can surely be used in practical applications for indirect potable reuse water treatments and in many other water treatment applications funding this work was funded by the us department of interior bureau of

14272,the present study aims to investigate the impact of water chemistry shelf life and regeneration of a previously developed chitosan cs polyethyleneimine pei graphene oxide go nanocomposite membrane coating several studies have shown the development of coatings with multifuctionality in di water but have negleted the effects of water chemistry shelf life and chemical regeneration of these nanocomposite coatings for the simultaneous removal of different biological and chemical water contaminants this nanocomposite was selected for this investigation since it showed a broad removal capability this nanocomposite showed removals of cr vi cu ii and pb ii over 90 at 1 ppm initial concentration and nitrate 75 at 20 ppm initial concentration under di water furthermore the coated filters were effective in removing 3 logs of e coli k12 b subtilis and p aeruginosa the integrity and performance of the modified filters were investigated against a wide range of water chemistries with different ph values salinity and total hardness for water chemistries with ph 4 9 salinity 50 1000 ppm and total hardness of 50 500 ppm as caco3 at least one tested contaminant showed similar percentage removals indicating the potential use of the modified filters in these large ranges of water chemistry conditions based on that the filters were used to treat representative samples of wastewater and seawater the coated filters were able to remove suspended particles bacteria and heavy metals effectively later the potential for regeneration and the shelf life of the coated filters were also investigated for the regeneration only 0 1 m hcl was able to desorb up to 40 of the adsorbed heavy metal indicating that the filter can be partially regenerated accelerated experiments of shelf life demonstrated that the modified filters lose their optimum performance around 9 12 months indicating their potential for short term storage without any specific preservation conditions keywords indirect potable reuse water nanocomposite heavy metals removal microorganisms removal 1 introduction water and wastewater treatment facilities can be an integral part of most municipalities depending on the sequence of treatment steps in the wastewater treatment facilities and different downstream treatment approaches of effluent water for drinking water water treatment plants can be categorized as direct potable indirect potable and unplanned potable water reuse plants 1 3 direct potable water reuse plants are common in areas affected by water scarcity as opposed to indirect in the first case the treated wastewater is directly fed to the distribution system for potable reuse while in the second case the wastewater is left for a certain amount of time in a reservoir or natural ponds for natural purification 3 4 in all cases additional treatment is needed to purify the water since the water may still be of poor quality for drinking purposes due to diverse types and levels of contaminants present furthermore in these systems the water chemistry tends to be complex which can make the treatment more complicated polymers as adsorbents have been used widely in both domestic and industrial applications for direct or indirect treatment of water however different polymers carry different contaminant removal capabilities based on their functionality which creates a barrier for applications requiring removal of a wide range of water contaminants for water reuse therefore the direction of research has moved toward incorporating nanomaterials with diverse polymeric materials to provide functional variety structural strength and stability this approach has several advantages such as enhanced adsorption capacity selectivity improved design flexibility and potential for large scale fabrication 5 6 a special interest has drawn to natural polymers or biopolymers such as cellulose lignin hemicellulose and chitosan cs to form graphene based nanocomposites with enhanced or multifunctional properties 7 9 previous studies done by our research group and others have shown that it is easy to successfully disperse graphene based nanomaterial into a polymer matrix yielding new multifunctional nanocomposites 7 8 10 11 these nanocomposites also have shown to prevent biofouling while being non toxic to mammalian cells although some researchers have investigated these nanocomposites with real water samples we have very little understanding of how changes in the water chemistry would impact these nanocomposites more importantly how long these biopolymer nanocomposites can maintain their active coating layer after storage or chemical regeneration in a previous preliminary study 12 we developed using a mathematical approach within response surface methodology rsm an optimized coating containing graphene oxide go embedded into a polymeric matrix made of cs and polyethyleneimine pei 12 the preliminary results of this nanocomposite with spiked deionized water di suggested the ability of this coating to remove positive and negative heavy metal ions the preliminary results were based on only two differently charged heavy metals spiked in di water in the present study we build upon these initial findings and confirm the ability of this coating to remove diverse range of contaminants such as nitrate microorganisms and other toxic heavy metals not only in di water but also under complex water chemistries after chemical regeneration and after different storage times in the present study the removal efficiency by the coating was further analysed in a wide range of ph values salinity and hardness the modified filters were used to treat representative wastewater and seawater samples spiked with heavy metals and microorganisms to quantify the performance of the modified filters with real world water samples that have complex water chemistries finally the shelf life and capability of regeneration of the coated filters were investigated this systematic study gives us an understanding of the impact of different types of water chemistries as well as shelf life and chemical regeneration impact on the treatment capability of

purchased from american type culture collection manassas va usa 2 2 synthesis and characterization of cs pei go coated filters gmf filters were coated with the optimum cs pei go composition as described in bandara et al 2019 12 briefly the gmf membranes were soaked in 0 04 cs solution for 30 min meanwhile a solution containing 1 78 pei and 1500 ppm go and di water were weighed in a separate glass vial and mixed thoroughly using a vortex mixer a solution of 2 glutaraldehyde gla was used as a crosslinker reagent gla was added to the above mixture and stirred thoroughly for one additional

k2cr2o7 crystals 99 8 assay cupric nitrate cu no3 2 3h2o crystals 98 assay lead nitrate pb no3 2 99 9 assay cadmium sulfate cdso4 crystals 98 assay and nickel nitrate ni no3 6h2o crystals were dissolved in di water to prepare 500 ppm stock solutions of cr vi cu ii pb ii cd ii and ni ii metal ions to prepare the 500 ppm nitrate stock solution potassium nitrate kno3 crystals was used to prepare the bacterial wastewater solution first the desired bacterium was inoculated into 25 ml of liquid nutrient media e coli k12 and b subtilis were grown in tryptic soy broth tsb media while p aeruginosa was grown in luria broth lb media all three bacteria were grown at 37 c overnight in their respective media then they were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min to separate the bacterial cells from the media bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs solution with an optical density of 0 5 at 600 nm od600 using the biotek synergy 2 multi mode reader dilutions of 100 fold were used for actual filtrations the solutions were made freshly for each filtration carried out to prepare a liquid stock of bacteriophage the host bacterium e coli atcc 15597 was inoculated in tsb media and processed as described earlier 15 detailed information about the bacteriophage stock preparation and enumeration are given in esi text s3 2 4 contaminant removal experiments with synthetic wastewater solutions initial validation of the removal of different contaminants was done as dead end filtrations in smaller volumes such as 20 ml using the cs pei go coated gmf filters larger volumes of 1 l were also used later to validate the contaminant removals in larger batches for cr vi cu ii and pb ii initial concentrations of 1 10 and 20 ppm were used while for cd ii and ni ii 1 5 and 10 ppm were used as initial concentrations for nitrate 20 40 and 60 ppm initial concentrations were used filtration experiments were carried out as batch experiments all the heavy metals were analyzed using the flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas aanalyst 200 from perkin elmer using chromium copper lead cadmium and nickel lamps from perkin elmer five standard solutions were prepared as calibration standards with known heavy metal concentrations the averages and standard deviations of triplicate measurements are reported for all measurements nitrate concentrations were measured with a thermo scientific orion nitrate electrode equipped with a sure flow combination electrode 9707bnwp an ionic strength adjuster was added to nitrate samples based on the target nitrate concentration of each sample for the bacterial removal bacterial solutions were passed through the modified filters bacterial concentrations of the filtrates and the initial solutions were measured using the drop plating method after serially diluting with pbs for the bacteriophage removal bacteriophage solutions were passed through cs pei go coated gmf membranes 16 to measure the concentration titer of filtrates the plaque forming units pfu ml counts on double layer agar plating was used 33 the filtrates were serially diluted with 1x pbs aliquots of 0 1 ml of these dilutions were mixed with 0 9 ml of six hours old bacterial host and 3 ml of warm soft agar which was poured onto pre solidified tsa plates and incubated at 37 c after about 24 h of incubation higher dilutions of the filtrates resulted in countable plaques of bacteriophage on the lawn of bacteria this number was counted and according to the dilution factor bacteriophage concentration was determined as pfu ml for all these experiments non coated gmf membranes were used as the negative controls all the experiments were done in three or more replicates the results were averaged out and standard deviations were calculated 2 5 investigating effect of water chemistry on contaminant removal removal efficiencies of cr vi nitrate and e coli k12 with varying water chemistries were investigated individually investigated water chemistry variables were ph salinity and hardness working synthetic wastewater solutions were prepared by diluting from the stock solutions prepared and by changing the water chemistry as mentioned below for the ph related experiments the ph of the solutions was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions with ph 4 9 were used for the experiments for salinity related experiments sodium chloride nacl was added to prepare solutions with desired salinity in the range of 0 1000 ppm for the hardness related experiments calcium carbonate caco3 was added to prepare solutions with 0 500 ppm hardness as caco3 initial concentrations of solutions were set at 10 ppm 20 ppm and 107 cfu ml for cr vi nitrate and e coli k12 respectively the removals were quantified using the respective techniques mentioned above 2 6 wastewater sample collection and contaminant removal the performance of the filters in real contaminated water with complex water chemistries was tested using representative wastewater and seawater the representative wastewater contained 95 v v bayou water and 5 v v wastewater influent more information about the collection of water samples and their characteristics can be found in the esi text s4 and table s1 due to undetectable amounts of chromium or copper in the environmental samples they were spiked with these metals before the filtration experiments to have 10 ppm of initial metal concentrations samples were also spiked with bacteriophage ms2 to investigate the effect on virus removal these water sources however already contained microorganisms therefore no additional microorganisms were added for bacterial removal experiments heterotrophic plate count hpc was used to measure the number of bacteria before and after the filtration employing the drop plating method 16 effect of filtration on solid removal was measured in terms of total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss employing the gravimetric method 17 2 7 investigation of reusability of coated filters based on cr vi adsorption a set of adsorption and desorption experiments were performed to analyze the reusability of the coated filters for these adsorption experiments the cr vi solution was prepared in di water with 2 ppm initial concentration one liter of cr vi solution was filtered with the cs pei go coated gmf filters throughout the filtration samples were collected every 10 ml intervals until 250 ml and every 15 ml interval until 1000 ml and was analyzed using aas the amount of cr vi adsorbed wad in this step was calculated as follows 1 amount of cr adsorbed wad ci ce v here ci is the initial concentration of the synthetic solution of cr and ce is the final cr concentration of the filtrate v is the total volume which was 1000 ml in this case spent membranes were then treated with different desorption agents a volume of 100 ml of these agents namely 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m nahco3 and 0 1 m nacl were filtered through used membranes desorption was calculated as a percentage with respect to the amount of cr adsorbed during the previous step as follows here wde is the desorbed cr amount regenerated filters were again used for the cr vi filtrations after being washed with 100 ml of di water eq 1 was used again to calculate the amount of cr vi adsorption 2 d e s o r p t i o n w d e w a d 100 2 8 accelerated aging of coated filters a thermal aging process was employed to assess the effect of storing and aging of cs pei go coated filters the accelerated aging was equivalent to 3 12 months of storage under room temperature at 24 c the aging procedure was carried out as suggested by astm f1980 and nbsir 74 499 protocols 18 19 astm f1980 is the standard guide for accelerated aging of sterile barrier systems for medical devices and nbsir 74 499 is the protocol for accelerated aging for papers combining these two procedures filters were stored at 55 c for a calculated pre determined period accelerated aging time aat which were calculated as follows 3 a c c e l e r a t e d a g i n g t i m e a a t d e s i r e d r e a l t i m e r t q 10 t a a t r a 10 here the accelerated aging temperature taa is measured in c common taa values are 50 c 55 c and 60 c the 55 c was selected for corresponding to the average ambient temperature trt was measured in c the temperature typically varies between 20 c 25 c and can be interpreted as the storage temperature in this study it was 24 c the aging factor q10 is unitless and this factor is typically between 1 8 2 5 with a value of 2 0 being the most common which was selected for this calculation after the aging these filter membranes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem and were tested for cr vi cu ii and e coli k12 removal the results were compared to the results with freshly coated filters also the membranes were analyzed with atr ftir to visualize the differences between the aged membranes 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of cs pei go coted filters the successful dip coating of the gmf filters with cs pei go nanocomposite was confirmed by the detailed characterization of the coating sem images shown in fig 1 a and b illustrates the appearance of the successful cs pei go coating on the fiber like structure of the bare gmf membrane as shown in the atr ftir spectrum of the cs pei go coated filters in fig 1c new peaks appeared at 1396 1449 1638 2852 2923 and 3359 cm 1 after the coating step the peak at 1396 can be attributed to the ch stretch from nhcoch3 group from cs while the peak at 1449 cm 1 was assigned to the ch bending 14 the peak at 1638 was assigned to the carbonyl stretching of the nhcogroup or the carbonyl results from the cross linking peaks at 2852 and 2923 cm 1 were assigned to ch vibrations from ch2 and ch3 respectively which were originated from cs and pei 20 a broad peak was visible around 3100 3600 cm 1 range the peak at 3359 cm 1 was attributed to oh from go and cs and nh2 from cs and pei 14 20 fig 1d and e show the deconvolution of the o1s and n1s peak of the high resolution xps spectra of cs pei go coating respectively the deconvolution of the o1s core level spectrum shows three major peaks with binding energies of 531 8 532 9 and 534 ev these binding energies were attributed to aliphatic coc oh or co groups and oco groups mainly found in the go structure deconvolution of n1s core level spectrum has two major peaks at 397 6 and 399 8 ev binding energies which can be assigned to imine cn and amine nh2 groups which are found in cs and pei 10 21 the c o ratio for the bare gmf membrane showed a decreased from 7 5 to 1 1 for the cs pei go coating due to the presence of carbonaceous groups on the surface of the filter in summary the characterization of cs pei go coated filters shows the successful coating procedure and availability of different functional groups from the components of the nanocomposites that are useful in contaminant removals the synthesis was based on the optimized procedure already published 12 in the previous investigation the grafting efficiency based on the thermogravimetric analysis was estimated to be 27 on the coated membranes 12 the change of water flux after the cs pei go coating was also determined and extensively explained in our previously published study 12 in brief the flow rate increased from 227 lm 1s 1 to 411 lm 1s 1 after the cs pei go coating indicating that the incorporation of hydrophilic cs has facilitated the liquid flow through the pores 3 2 contaminant removal experiments with synthetic wastewater solutions the coated filters were tested for the removal of various contaminants firstly the cs pei go coating was optimized based on the heavy metals cr vi and cu ii removals results showed removal of both contaminants efficiently with 10 ppm concentrations 12 for the other heavy metal contaminants tested in this study analytical conditions for the aas are shown in esi table s2 in this study cr vi and cu ii were further analyzed for the following concentrations 1 and 20 ppm these extreme concentrations were not previously analyzed in the coating optimization investigation 12 to understand the effect of initial concentration three different initial concentrations were selected for each heavy metal based on their respective linear ranges in the aas instrument this approach allowed us a more accurate quantification of the metals and also allowed us to achieve more realistic concentrations found in the environment as shown in esi table s2 22 23 based on the aas linear ranges for each metal cd ii and ni ii were studied at 1 5 and 10 ppm while cr vi cu ii and pb ii were studied at 1 10 and 20 ppm fig 2 summarizes the results of the removal experiments for heavy metals and nitrates cs pei go coated gmf filters were able to remove over 90 cr vi fig 2a cu ii fig 2b and pb ii fig 2c at 1 ppm cr vi removal was consistent up to 20 ppm and reached 99 removals however cu ii and pb ii removals dropped when the initial concentration increased for ni ii the highest removal of 62 was obtained for an initial concentration of 1 ppm as shown in fig 2d however the coated filters were not very effective in removing cd ii as less than 15 removals were recorded for initial concentrations up to 10 ppm fig 2e adsorption effect is affected by the size of the hydration radius the smaller the hydration radius and the larger the charge density per area the better will be the affinity of the metal for the adsorbent since cd2 exhibits a larger hydration radius 4 26 å compared to the other heavy metals a reduced adsorption is observed with this metal than the others 24 25 nitrate is an inorganic contaminant which is also regulated by epa with an allowable limit of up to 10 ppm maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water experiments for nitrate were carried out for the initial concentrations between 20 and 60 ppm cs pei go coated gmf filters showed maximum removals of 78 at 20 ppm fig 2f while the removal decreased with the increasing initial concentrations furthermore since the number of adsorption sites remained the same higher initial contaminant concentrations resulted in saturation of adsorption sites in the heavy metal removal cs and pei play a major role the mechanism of removal for the prepared filters involve the participation of the unshared electron pair present in the nitrogen atom of the amine group from the cs and pei this electron pair will form a donor bond with the unsaturated transition metals then the hydroxyl and amine groups present will capture the metals while forming a shared bond between the metal and the amino groups of cs and pei 26 results for microbiological contaminant removals are shown in fig 3 bacterial removals were over 3 logs or 99 9 with cs pei go coated filters for all three bacterial strains b subtilis was also removed with the non coated filters this can be understood as b subtilis is a much larger bacteria compared to the other two types of bacteria used b subtilis is about 4 10 μm long and 0 25 1 0 μm in diameter compared to the 1 2 μm length of e coli k12 and 1 5 μm length of p aeruginosa 27 29 however in the case of uncoated filters the mechanisms of removal are entirely sieving i e based on the size of the bacterial cells and the pore structure of the bare membranes however for the cs pei go coated filters the mechanism is driven by a combination of sieving and antimicrobial activity therefore recording much higher removals with bacteria 30 31 the sem images of the coated and uncoated filters taken after the e coli k12 filtration are given in fig 4 this result shows how effective the coated filters entrapped and inactivated bacteria during filtration it was not possible to see any bacteria retained on the bare membranes fig 4a for the modified filters as shown in fig 4b these bacterial cells seemed to be adsorbed and distorted indicating that they could potentially be inactivated due to the antimicrobial properties of the go we can clearly see aggregation on the coated gmf membrane due to bacterial cell adsorption observation of distorted cells in the presence of go is a well studied phenomenon as go tends to work as nano blades and puncture bacterial cells 32 33 another possibility is the generation of reactive oxygen species which could destroy the bacterial cells 19 the nano sized bacteriophage ms2 was not retained by the cs pei go coated gmf membranes fig s2 showed the comparison between the coated and uncoated filters we can see that even if the viruses could pass through the filter some were inactivated due to the antimicrobial properties of go 3 3 effect of water chemistry on contaminant removal for any water treatment technique it is important to expect varying water chemistries of the source water hence it is important to investigate the removal efficiency of any novel water treatment technique under different water chemistries in order to assure a high quality purification process 34 35 in this study effects of changing ph salinity and hardness on removal efficiencies of indicator contaminants were investigated therefore we selected three different contaminants such as a heavy metal cr vi a microorganism e coli k12 and a nutrient contaminant nitrate for further study since these contaminants were shown earlier to have higher removals by the filter coating compared to the other studied contaminants fig 5 shows the summary of results for removal of cr vi nitrate and e coli k12 the ph is a measure of acidity and basicity which is affected by the natural environment or can be man made for instance sources of ph changes can come from photosynthesis microbial respiration in the water dissolution of carbon dioxide acid rain acidic discharges and mineral discharges 36 usually for surface water systems ph values range from 6 5 to 8 5 while for groundwater systems the range is from 6 to 8 5 37 in this study a range of ph 4 to 9 was tested representing the possible ph range for different water sources fig 5a throughout for the selected ph range the removal was always above 95 for cr vi with the cs pei go coated filters although ph affected the active sites that are responsible for antimicrobial properties of the coating no significant result is shown in the removal of e coli k12 at various ph ranges 38 39 effect of the ph was more prominent in nitrate removal when acidic and basic conditions lowered the percentage nitrate removal significantly in the case of anionic contaminants that are removed via electrostatic interactions with positively charged functional groups of the nanocomposites ph lower than 5 was more favourable for removal 40 43 since more h ions are in the solution at acidic ph there were some restrictions in the free movement of nitrate ions toward the adsorption sites with increasing ph more oh ions are present in the solution these ions compete with the nitrate ions and hence decrease the adsorption capacity of the filter 44 fig s3 showed a decrease in the zeta potential at higher ph values which suggested favorable adsorption of negatively charged species in lower ph values salinity is the mass of dissolved salts in a certain mass of water measured in ppm parts per million or ppt parts per thousand or psu practical salinity units 45 salinity often interferes with contaminant removals by claiming adsorption sites and competing with other contaminants in the source water in general for the surface and groundwater sources salinities below 80 ppm are considered preferable for consumption whereas salinities above 1000 ppm are considered to be poor in quality 45 a range of 50 1000 ppm was used in this study as shown in fig 5b cr vi removal remained consistent throughout the selected salinity range previously it was shown that chlorides interfere with nitrate adsorption by suppressing nitrate uptake at elevated chloride concentrations 46 our results corroborate this nitrate removal trend with increasing salinity furthermore fig 5b showed no significant changes in bacterial removals with increasing salinity indicating salinity does not interfere with bacterial removal total hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the source water measured in ppm as caco3 it is common to see hardness cause problems in water treatment facilities and membrane technologies by aiding scaling on membrane surfaces 47 48 water sources can be categorized into different levels of total hardness 0 60 ppm as caco3 as soft water 61 120 ppm as caco3 as moderately hard 121 180 ppm as caco3 as hard and 180 ppm as caco3 as very hard 49 50 to represent all these categories a range of 50 500 ppm as caco3 of total hardness was tested in this study overall hardness showed an inhibitory role for cr vi and nitrate removals with increasing hardness as shown in fig 5c the addition of more carbonate in the initial solution resulted in reduction of acidity therefore inhibiting electrostatic attraction of anionic contaminants 51 in conclusion the optimized cs pei go coating remained effective in a variety of water chemistries except for the source waters with very high total hardness the cs pei go coated gmf filters presented consistent removals throughout the selected ranges of water chemistries indicating the applicability of the modified coating with cs pei go for water purification applications it is important to mention that in real water samples the ranges of such water qualities can be narrow depending on the cleanliness and the water source used however the extreme conditions such as high ph or high salinity can be correlated to harsh environments that could occur in nature additionally it is also important to understand how more complex water chemistries affect removals therefore the coated filters were tested to filter real environmental water samples 3 4 the performance of the filters in real contaminated water with complex water chemistry a representative wastewater sample containing 95 v v bayou water and 5 v v wastewater influent as well as a water sample of seawater were filtered with the optimized cs pei go coated filters to observe the performance of the filters in more realistic conditions table s1 contains the physical and chemical characterization of the collected samples and table s3 compile the removal data for all the experiments performed in wastewater and seawater the removals can be interpreted as changes to physical and chemical properties as well as the contaminant removal the initial treatment of the collected water was first determined via physical properties of the water such as turbidity and tss fig 6 the seawater contained higher turbidity which was 181 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu than the representative wastewater that contained 32 ntu the filtrate of the latter resulted in 0 9 ntu on average while the seawater filtrate presented a turbidity of 1 5 ntu according to epa s national primary drinking water regulations turbidity should not exceed 1 ntu if the treatment system contains conventional or direct filtration at no time can the turbidity measurement go higher than 1 ntu 23 in that sense the filtrate produced from the representative wastewater was the closest to that limit fig 6a from the gravimetric analysis total dissolved solids tds in the representative wastewater was reduced to 670 mg l compared to the initial amount of 760 mg l after the filtration with cs pei go coated filters fig 6b with respect to the epa s drinking water regulations recorded tds was higher than the regulated limit of 500 mg l for the seawater which contained a very high amount of tds 33 500 mg l compared to the representative wastewater it only reduced to 30 000 mg l after the filtration this removal of about 3000 ppm for tds was observed for the non coated and cs pei go coated filters therefore suggesting the limitation of the coating in removing tds in contrast much larger suspended solids were well removed during the filtration fig 6c for the representative wastewater the removal dropped to 18 mg l from initial total suspended solids tss amount of 82 mg l seawater contained a much higher amount of tss 2700 mg l and after filtration it measured at 220 mg l in summary the filtration alone was effective in removing tss from the water however it was ineffective in removing dissolved solids such as ions and salts 39 therefore it is important to use this type of modified membranes coupled with another treatment approach if the water contains considerable amounts of dissolved solids in the case of cr vi and cu ii removals they were similar for both seawater and representative wastewater as shown in fig 7 a and b the cr vi removals were slightly higher than the removals recorded with the experiments performed earlier with di water it is possible that organic matter in the water would also act as a flocculant therefore entrapping heavy metals such as cr vi and cu ii in the flocs as they got removed from the water during filtration 52 53 the tested water samples contained microorganisms measured in the form of heterotrophic plate count though no additional bacteria were added to the source water they were spiked with bacteriophage ms2 to perform filtrations to investigate their removals as shown in fig 7c the filter was able to reduce 3 2 logs of the heterotrophic bacteria it is important to note that hpc consist of a variety of culturable microorganisms present in water which is essentially not a single bacteria rather a mixture of bacterial species that will show a colonial growth on hpc agar plates 54 seawater contained less initial hpc 5 3 102 cfu ml compared to the representative wastewater 3 4 106 cfu ml and also showed reduced removals of hpc during the filtration the modified filter was able to remove 3 1 logs in wastewater while for seawater the removal was 2 7 logs however with bacteriophage more removal 2 8 logs was recorded for the seawater compared to 1 5 log removal in wastewater overall ms2 removals were much higher than compared to the experiments with ms2 solutions made with di water it is possible that the solids in the source water have worked as a flocculant entrapping bacteriophage during the filtration and therefore improving their removal it is well known that the flocculation enhances the bacteriophage removal during filtrations 55 3 5 regeneration and reusability of the modified filters the modified filters were used for filtration of larger volumes of 2 ppm cr vi 2 ppm cu ii and 20 ppm nitrate solutions adsorption curves for each contaminant are shown in the fig 8 unlike cu ii and nitrate for cr vi it took much longer time to saturate and exceed the mcl limit of the selected contaminant in the coated filters these results show that the removal of different contaminants will vary with the coating the possibility of regeneration and reusability of modified filters were also investigated since the removal of cr vi was more efficient filters retaining cr vi was further investigated for regeneration it is important to highlight however that cr vi concentration of the filtrate did not reach a saturation value even after filtrating 1 l indicating there could be free sites still available for cr vi adsorption the used filters were treated with desorption agents that had diverse properties as shown in fig 9 none of the desorption agents were able to remove more than 40 of the adsorbed amount of cr vi indicating stronger complexation of cr species to the adsorption sites during the filtration in addition subsequent filtrations with cr vi solutions with the desorbed modified filters showed lower cr vi removals the use of 0 1 m hcl was the most efficient solution for the regeneration of cr vi adsorbed to the coating as mentioned earlier with adsorption sites available even after the 1st adsorption there were vacant adsorption sites that could remove cr in the subsequent filtration it is worth to note that regeneration of filter systems is important in industrial contexts where more focus is given in enhancing the number of total adsorption sites by changing the physical and chemical properties of the coating materials 3 6 accelerated aging of filters aging is another aspect that needed to be determined for the cs pei go coated filters as cs polymers is a natural polymer which can be degraded over time 56 due to its degradability it could affect the overall stability of the filter coating therefore it is better to quantify how long the performance of the coating remains unchanged under normal storage conditions to investigate that thermal accelerated aging was performed on the filters experiments were equivalent to storage times of up to 12 months aged modified filters were tested for cr vi cu ii and bacterial removal and compared to the removals of freshly coated filters fig 10 illustrates the removals for the selected contaminants when treated with the aged filters to determine statistically the significance of the removal changes t tests were carried out this was done for both coated filters and respective uncoated filters in order to provide a clear insight of the differences in the filter matrix itself when stored for a long time to be exact storing of 3 6 9 and 12 months periods when considering the cr vi removal cs pei go coated gmf membranes showed a significant drop in removal in 12 months while the removal from uncoated gmf remained the same for up to 12 months fig 10a data for cu ii removals suggest that the cs pei go coated gmf membranes show a significant drop in removal after 9 months of storage however bare gmf membranes did not show any significant change in terms of cu vi removals fig 10b similarly when considering bacteria removals a significant reduction was evident after storage for 9 months fig 10c similarly the bare gmf membranes also showed reduced removal trend after 9 months the preservation of the nanocomposite structure was confirmed by the atr ftir and sem images to ensure no significant structural or composition change after 12 months of aging was happening figs s4 and s5 the sem images showed no significative changes in the morphology of the nanocomposites compared to the no aged filter fig s5 shows the atr ftir results before and after 12 months aged in the spectra we can appreciate some loss of some of the functionalities for the cs pei go gmf nanocomposites the loss of some of the functional groups such as oh and nh2 can explain the efficiency loss in the heavy metal removal nonetheless the removal of contaminants is still suitable before 9 months the loss of efficiency is no more than 10 hence it is safe to say that the coated filters were consistent in removing the tested contaminants compared to the freshly coated filters suggesting that around 9 12 months the cs pei go coatings started to show signs of decay in other words this means that the coated filters can be used in the first 9 months without losing its removal efficiencies however it is also important to note that the method of aging used in this study is not a standardized method for coatings we adapted the methods suggested in astm f1980 standard guide and nbsir 74 499 which were protocols developed primarily for the accelerated aging of sterile barrier systems for medical devices and for papers in this case heating was used as the aging technique based on the arrhenius equation which explains that the higher temperatures result in higher reaction rates 57 but in other terms heating can also be considered as a physical crosslinking method and therefore higher fatigue temperatures could have adversely affected the performance of the filters not only by aging alone 58 it is important to note that modified filters could be stored under vacuum or acclimated conditions which could potentially extend the shelf life of the coatings however in in our experimental design we did not investigate alternative methods to better preserve the coatings on the contrary our focus was to test them under the worst case scenarios 4 conclusions a previously optimized cs pei go coating on gmf membranes was investigated to understand the behavior of the coating with different water contaminants under a wide range of water chemistries the coatings were effective in removing heavy metals such as cr cu and pb nitrate and bacteria from the solutions containing these contaminants in di water the coating was tested under different water chemistries ph salinity hardness and alkalinity and shown to perform consistently for a wide range of water chemistries coated filters were investigated against real environmental waters where they were effective in removing cr cu hpc and bacteriophage despite the presence of complex water chemistries in the desorption studies 0 1 m hcl was found to be the best desorption agent however it was not very effective to regenerate all binding sites in the coating indicating that the coating cannot be completely regenerated the accelerated aging experiments indicated that the long term storage of the coated filters is possible for up to 9 months without any special storing procedure a vacuum or under dry or temperature regulated conditions as a summary cs pei go coating has emerged as a promising nanocomposite coating that can be used as a multifunctional water treatment technique we were able to demonstrate that it can remove a variety of contaminants and is effective in many water chemistries this coating can surely be used in practical applications for indirect potable reuse water treatments and in many other water treatment applications funding this work was funded by the us department of interior bureau of

14273,microfiltration carbon membranes mfcms were prepared and modified by incorporating polyacrylonitrile based microspheres the thermal stability microstructure morphology and porous structure of the membrane samples were analyzed the effects of preparation and operation parameters on the oil removal of mfcms for oil water emulsion were investigated results demonstrate that the addition of microspheres effectively adjusts the porous structure adsorption property and oil removal of mfcms for mfcms made by the precursor containing 35 wt microspheres the highest oil removal is achieved to 93 6 along with the permeation flux of 251 1 kg m2 h under the operation condition of feed oil concentration at 50 mg l trans membrane pressure at 0 03 mpa and feed flowrate at 6 ml min keywords microfiltration oily wastewater separation adsorption polyacrylonitrile microspheres 1 introduction with the rapid development of civilization and urbanization large quantity of oily wastewater is increasingly by produced in petroleum refineries petrochemical industries food processing textile plants steel working etc hence considerable effort has been taken on the stringent oily wastewater treatment prior to recycling or discharging 1 2 so far many techniques could be applied for oily wastewater treatment in reports such as air flotation adsorption skimming photocatalysis electrochemistry coagulation and flocculation 3 5 however most of them are incapable of the effective removal of emulsified oil drops from water 6 7 during the last several decades membrane separation has grown into one of the most promising techniques for the treatment of oil in water emulsion due to the advantages of high efficiency easy operation low investment no chemical addition and so on 8 9 shen et al removed 99 9 oil in wastewater by a poly vinylidene fluoride hybrid membrane blended with zro2 10 chakrabarty et al diminished over 90 oil in wastewater by polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes 11 das et al obtained a good oil removal of 95 4 for an oil in water emulsion with a concentration of 250 mg l by ceramic membranes 12 yeom et al reduced 98 oil of a 600 mg l oily wastewater by alumina coated clay diatomite membranes 13 changmai et al lowered the initial concentration of oil and grease from 35 mg l to 10 2 mg l by microfiltration ceramic membranes in batch mode for oily wastewater 14 trinh et al studied the influence of surfactants on the oil removal of oil emulsions in terms of flux fouling and interaction energy during microfiltration 15 although both microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes can be opted for oily wastewater treatment the former is more attractive for actual situation because of the excellent separation performance durability and wide application span besides microfiltration possesses the advantages of higher water flux rejection of ultrafine particles in solution and lower requirements for feeding water quality 1 16 17 since the membrane material primarily dominates the process and attractiveness of membrane separation so it is the first critical issue to appropriately choose membrane materials prior to preparation and application of microfiltration in common polymeric membranes are suffered from the structural degradation after a certain service time especially in harsh working medium some inorganic membrane materials like zeolites and ceramics are too fragile or expensive to meet the requirement of industrial production and application 18 therefore more interests have been successively paid for developing alternative candidates recently microfiltration carbon membranes mfcms have been identified as one of the most appealing materials owing to their excellent mechanical strength temperature resistance chemical stability and controllable porous structure 19 in particular their raw materials are widely available and quite economic for feasible industrialization 20 furthermore previous works have clearly confirmed the feasibility of mfcms for the treatment of emulsified oily wastewater 17 21 however mfcms still fail to achieve large scale industrial application because of the restriction from the deficiency of inferior oil removal about 70 in the absence of any means of reinforcement for instance demulsifier and applied electric field and so forth 16 22 in addition to the reinforcement strategy during permeation it is also effective by optimizing the structure and nature of mfcms previously our team found that the oil removal was heavily dependent on the porous structure and adsorption properties of mfcms 17 hence it is of great significance to enhance the abovementioned two aspects by various means e g incorporating fillers into the continuous membrane matrix 17 in this work an attempt was made to tailor the microstructure and property of mfcms by polyacrylonitrile pan based microspheres for the purpose of improving oil removal from oil water emulsion the motivation for us to utilize pan microspheres is 1 pan is a well known precursor for preparing porous carbon materials with excellent adsorption capacity 23 2 pan based carbon materials is expectant to exhibit outstanding interfacial compatibility with the matrix of mfcms due to their analogous carbon sources thereby it could alleviate the defect formation by avoiding serious interfacial separation during preparation 3 in addition the spherical morphology is favorable for understanding the underlying rules of modification of mfcms 2 experimental 2 1 raw materials the technical grade raw materials were commercially acquired powder of phenolic resin pr 2123 3 model less than 80 μm in particle size xinxiang bomafengfan industrial ltd co and polyacrylonitrile microspheres pan sinopec shanghai petrochemical ltd co as shown in fig s1 see supplementary information file the used pan microspheres have pretty good spherical shape with the uniform particle size around 35 1 μm the reagents including sodium carboxymethyl cellulose nacmc technical grade as binder and hexamethylene tetramine hmta analytical grade as curing agent were used as commercially received the crude oil was offered by turmin oil fields in russia of which the major parameters are 35 7 api 0 53 sulphuric content 842 3 density 20 c kg m3 and 4 304 kinetic viscosity 50 c mm2 s 1 the oil water emulsion was prepared by ultrasonically mixing the crude oil into double distillated water for 1 h to form uniform emulsion with the concentration of 50 200 mg l regarding any possible side effect of the instability of the oil water emulsion the following measures were taken into account in this work to ensure steady state operation and good repeatability first the oily wastewater is configured with a lower oil concentration 50 200 mg l the second is the current use to avoid long term placement and instable changes the third is the use of crude oil containing trace amount of water and salt which is conducive to the natural dispersion of oil droplets the oil drop size distribution is in the range of 410 130 nm determined by a laser particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk the results confirm the present three solutions are typical oil in water emulsions 2 2 preparation of mfcms the preparation procedure of mfcms includes the following steps curing pulverizing mixing molding pressing drying and carbonization as shown in fig s2 the detailed information can be referred to our previous work 22 differently pan microspheres fig s1 and nacmc were respectively used as additives and binders with the mass fractions of 25 45wt and 20wt over pr the shaped pristine precursor membranes were labeled with pm t where t refers to the mass fraction of pan over pr in starting mixture the carbonization was conducted by a tubular furnace in an atmosphere of 100 ml min flowing nitrogen of which the temperature was precisely regulated by a programmable temperature controller the precursor membranes were first heated at 2 c min from room temperature to 400 c for dwelling 2 h then ramped at 1 c min to 600 c for dwelling 2 h next at 0 5 c min to 650 c for dwelling 2 h last naturally cooled down to room temperature eventually circular coin like mfcms were obtained with the diameter of 2 5 cm and thickness of 0 5 cm for convenience the mfcms made from pm t were labeled with cm t 2 3 characterization the particle size distribution of powder samples was detected by a bt 9300s type laser particle size instrument bettersize with highly purified water as the dispersion medium the thermal stability of precursor membranes was evaluated by a tga 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer perkin elmer at a heating rate of 20 c min from room temperature to 800 c with the sweeping of 20 ml min flowing nitrogen the functional groups of membrane surface were examined by a tensor ii platinum atr ftir bruker in a wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 with scanning 15 times the pore size distributions of mfcms were measured by a bubble pressure method using isopropyl alcohol as wetting agent 24 the macroporosity of mfcms was obtained by a boiling point method in the national standard of china gb t 1966 1996 besides the parameters of mesopores and micropores were also measured by an asap2420 nitrogen adsorption analyzer micro meritics usa at 196 c the microstructure of the membranes was investigated by an ultima iv 185 mm x ray powder diffractometer rigaku at 40 kv and 40 ma in a 2θ range of 10 60 the interlayer d spacing d002 values were calculated by bragg s equation the morphology of samples was directly observed by a tm 3000 scanning electron microscope hitachi at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv and standard observation mode without any pretreatment of surface sputtering the water contact angle is a characterization method that visually reflects the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface during the test process 10 u l pure water was dropped on the dried membrane sample adhered to a horizontally glass slide this process was recorded by a jc2000d contact angle analyzer the detailed permeation process of mfcms for oil water emulsion is given in the supplementary information file in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test data the permeation experiments of all samples were tested three times in parallel the final listed data are the average values 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal analysis of precursor membranes fig 1 gives the curves of thermal weight losses and their derivatives of precursor membranes there are four thermal degradation stages i 170 c ii 170 350 c iii 350 460 c and iv 460 650 c the first tiny weight loss is assigned to the release of residual water in matrix and gases formed by further curing reaction of pr 25 the second stage is primarily attributed to the decomposition of nacmc and the evolution of ladder type molecular structure by the cyclization reaction of pan 26 as the carbonization temperature goes up to the third stage the corresponding weight loss is owing to the drastic degradation of pan accompanying by the release of derived gases co co2 hcn h2o etc 27 nevertheless the actual contribution of pan is indistinctive judging by the little difference in tga profiles of precursors with and without pan addition this implies that a semi interpenetrating network semi ipn is formed between pan and pr which prevents the huge weight loss of pure pan 28 at the fourth stage the successive weight loss is ascribed to the breakage of molecular backbone of pr and pan 29 among the pan doped precursor membranes the final weight remaining follows the order of pm 45 57 31 pm 35 55 89 pm 25 48 39 namely the increment of pan amount tends to improve the final weight remaining of the precursor membranes this result seems to be contradictory to the inferior thermal stability of pan in comparison to that of pr in fact pan has been widely utilized as excellent starting materials for porous carbon materials like activated carbon fibers 30 on the other hand a thermally stable semi ipn structure could be derived between pan and pr 31 consequently the addition of pan results into the increment of the final weight remaining of precursors 32 33 nevertheless the residual weight remaining of pm 25 is lower than that of pure precursor membrane the probable reason is that the insufficient ratio of pan over pr causes an adverse condition for yielding semi ipn when the amount is lower i e 25 wt the addition of pan would obviously obstruct the well formation of self crosslinking structure for phenolic resin resulting in a higher decomposition degree of precursor with a larger loss of final char yield 34 35 oppositely when the amount of pan exceeds 25 wt the semi ipn structure would be successfully formed between the pan and the phenolic resin molecules thereby improving the overall thermal stability therefore the pan amount should be greater than that value if one wants to get the positive effect on the thermal stability of precursor membranes in addition the thermal analysis data also confirm that the present carbonization temperature at 650 c is suitable for the full formation of carbon structure in mfcms 3 2 evolution of surface functional groups in fig 2 a the typical functional groups are identified as the stretching vibration of oh at 3262 cm 1 asymmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 at 2937 cm 1 stretching vibration of co at 1733 cm 1 skeleton vibration of benzene at 1593 cm 1 and stretching vibration of coc at 1013 cm 1 respectively 36 besides the characters of cn 2242 cm 1 and ch2 1541 cm 1 are obviously found for pan 37 as expected the spectrum of neat precursor lacks of the bonds of c n of pan at the same time the peak intensities become more strong for the abovementioned two bonds as well as cn and co with elevating the doped pan amount in contrast most of the reflectance peaks of original precursor membranes are lost on the surface of mfcms this demonstrates that the polymeric molecules of pan and pr have been thermally decomposed which is in good agreement with the tga section simultaneously the peak intensity of aromatic rings and polycondensed aromatic hydrocarbon structures is more obvious with graphitization progressing 38 consequently the background of the ftir spectra of mfcms is wider than that of the precursor membranes nevertheless the bonds of nh and cn are still remained in the doped mfcms suggesting that some thermally stable n containing groups are formed in the matrix of mfcms those hetero atomic groups are probably beneficial for improving the hydrophilic property of mfcms 39 40 3 3 morphology observation fig 3 is the sem images of mfcms it clearly finds that the porous structure of the neat mfcms is mainly constituted by the random stacking of pr derived carbon clumps moreover the hybrid mfcms also contain a certain amount of doped pan derived carbon microspheres which are embedded in the membrane matrix the images also indicate that the morphology of pan microspheres is well remained even after high temperature carbonization in particular the number of carbon microspheres remarkably increases as the amount of pan increases in precursors no doubt the porous structure of mfcms is certainly adjusted by incorporating the pan microspheres noticeably there are also some bigger pore apertures for mfcms as shown in the sem images but they are not the really effective pore sizes because that the porous structure of carbon materials is constructed by complicated three dimensional inter connecting of pore passages with different sizes and shapes usually the narrowest constrictions in the pore passages dominate the separation performance 3 4 porous structure in this section the porous structure of mfcms will be respectively analyzed by two techniques on the macropores and meso micro pores in fig 4 it shows that the average macropore size of mfcms significantly reduces from 0 84 μm to 0 36 μm with increasing the pan content from 0 wt to 45 wt the results reflect the different modification degree of mfcms by incorporation of carbon microspheres in addition the porosity of macropores for mfcms successively decreases from 53 80 to 51 86 by changing the pan amounts from 25 wt to 45 wt it also proves that the addition of microspheres obviously influences the larger macropores in mfcms especially for the high amount in sum the addition of pan microspheres helps to reduce the macropore size of mfcms this is ascribed to the pan based microspheres filling into the gaps of larger macropores formed by the stacking of pr derived carbon clumps in the membranes matrix the result is consistent with the previous sem observation apart from macropores the meso micro pores of mfcms are also listed in table s1 in comparison to the undoped neat mfcms the hybrid mfcms present much reduced total volume and specific surface area this difference is similar to that of the aforementioned macropores implying that the pore blockage also affects mesopoers and micropores by the pan based carbon microspheres among the three hybrid samples cm 35 has the highest pore volume and specific surface area this suggests that either higher content or lower amount of microspheres is likely to diminish the meso micro pores in resultant mfcms for lower amount the thermal degradation degree of precursor is higher due to the invalid formation of semi ipn structure as has been discussed in previous tga section on the contrary the addition of higher amount of microspheres tends to block the pores more seriously 3 5 microstructure analysis in fig 5 a broad diffraction peak appears at 16 18 in the xrd patterns for all precursor membranes it is assigned to the overlapping of diffraction peaks of pan and pr 36 apart from the typical diffraction peaks for nacmc also appear at 32 and 42 among the patterns neat precursor has the most symmetrical profile with the diffraction location at 18 in addition another peak arises around 16 for pan doped membranes with the pan amount elevating the peak intensity becomes more obvious together with the weakness of the peak intensity of 32 and 46 due to the enhanced modification of pan microspheres after carbonization the original peaks at 16 18 for pan and pr are replaced by another broad 002 plane diffraction of amorphous carbon at 19 2 it suggests that only amorphous carbon is derived from the mixed precursors by pan and pr this also validates our speculation on the good carbon carbon compatibility between carbonaceous microspheres and mfcms furthermore the symmetry of this peak improves as the microspheres amount increases along with the peak position shifting from 19 2 to 23 1 that is the calculated d002 values decrease from 0 462 nm to 0 385 nm it reveals that the microstructure is more compact with increasing the amount of pan based microspheres the conclusion is in good accordance with the previous results of porosity and pore size distribution at the same time the peaks at 32 and 43 are more pronounced indicating that the na containing species derived from nacmc still exist in the system after carbonization 3 6 effects of pan based microspheres amount on permeation flux and oil removal fig 6 gives the permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcms as the function of microspheres amount and running time at the first stage the permeation flux of cm 35 and cm 45 descends steeply with time until to the terminal 90 min simultaneously the permeation flux of neat mfcms and cm 25 slightly fluctuates and quickly approaches to the steady state it is worthy of notice that an uncommon increase in permeation flux with time is contradictory to the famous darcy equation 41 the abnormal data are probably ascribed to the poor hydrophilicity of the two mfcms as has been confirmed by the water contact angles table s2 and fig s4 it is ascertained that the inferior hydrophilicity of membranes usually needs longer wetting time to fully open the permeating passages for water in contrast the addition of pan microspheres remarkably improves the hydrophilicity of final mfcms so as to gradually diminish the time delay phenomenon this issue will be further discussed in the later adsorption section additionally the variation in permeation flux among the mfcms is closely related to the retention evolution of oil droplets through mfcms initially the pore passages in mfcms are fully accessible for oil droplets passing through freely by the driving forces of pressure and concentration differences however more and more oil droplets would be gradually accumulated on the wall surfaces and constrictions of pores with time by the conjunct effects of adsorption and size exclusion eventually a cake gel layer is generated with the coalescence of more oil drops and the growth of oil size it results into the reduction of effective pore size to a certain degree and the falling of permeation flux 42 43 at the same time the oil rejection is on the rise because of the enhancement of pore size exclusion with time anyhow all the mfcms reach their steady state of permeation when the running time is greater than 90 min at the steady state of 90 240 min the permeation flux of the as prepared four mfcms is in the range of 240 900 k g m2 h with the rejection of 78 85 until to the end points actually the separation performance of present mfcms is comparable to some deliberately modified membrane materials in reports as listed in table s3 the results indicate that the use of pan microspheres as additives could effectively modify the microstructure and oil removal of mfcms on the other hand the stable data also imply the quite good anti fouling performance of mfcms for oil water emulsion treatment at 240 min the permeation flux of hybrid mfcms is in the order of cm 45 210 2 kg m2 h cm 35 184 5 kg m2 h cm 25 179 3 kg m2 h which is exactly in the same order of the amount of pan based microspheres rather than the orders of pore size pore volume and structural compactness this indicates that the permeation process is dominated by not only the pore size exclusion but also the surface nature of membranes 44 it has found in the previous ftir and xrd sections that the introduction of pan increases the number of heteroatoms in mfcms which tends to enhance the hydrophilicity of mfcms and promote the permeation flux 45 46 on the other hand the pore volume determined by nitrogen adsorption technique cannot accurately distinguish the percent of pore types i e passing pores and dead end pores in mfcms since both of them are available for nitrogen adsorption probably higher amount of pan based microspheres in mfcms is likely to generate more passing pores for permeation therefore cm 45 exhibits the highest permeation flux in addition cm 35 also has the highest oil rejection of 84 6 among the three hybrid mfcms at the steady state nevertheless the difference in permeation flux and rejection for the three hybrid mfcms is not obviously distinct on the whole in comparison to that of pure mfcms as a kind of porous membranes the permeation behavior of mfcms is simultaneously governed by the pore size exclusion and adsorption 47 the adsorption contribution during permeation can also be evaluated by the data in fig s5 it notices that the absorption quantity rapidly increases with time during the initial 30 min due to the successive opening of active sites as the result of wetting more parts of mfcms by the solution 48 after that the mfcms gradually reach their adsorption equilibrium states among them neat mfcms cm 25 and cm 35 have the approximate values at 3 0 3 2 mg g together with a relatively inferior value at 2 5 mg g for cm 45 it is ascribed to the lowest pore volume and specific surface area disadvantageous for adsorption of cm 45 regarding this it ascertains that the change in permeation flux at the early stage is certainly attributed to the reduction of adsorption because of their consistent spent time for reaching equilibrium and steady stage in summary cm 35 has the paramount oil rejection of 84 6 along with the permeation flux of 184 5kg m2 h among the mfcms hence the data of cm 35 at a running time of 240 min are further used to investigate the effects of operation condition 3 7 effect of feed concentration on oil removal fig 7 shows the permeation flux and oil rejection with varying the feed oil concentration under the condition of feed flowrate at 6 ml min and trans membrane pressure at 0 02 mpa the rejection changes within the scope of 70 85 by altering the feed concentration from 50 mg l to 200 mg l the slight difference in oil rejections is associated with various factors including gel cake formation porous structure evolution and surface property change 49 50 the lower feed concentration yields higher oil rejection is due to the well exertion of membrane hydrophilicity because of few oil drops being deposited on membrane surface on the other hand a higher feed concentration is also beneficial for the size exclusion effect because of the enhanced contribution of thicker gel cake layer 51 in addition the permeation flux is remarkably increased from 184 5 kg m2 h to 590 8 kg m2 h with elevating the feed concentration from 50 mg l to 200 mg l this phenomenon justifies that the present mfcms are free of the influence of concentration polarization and the transportation resistance is mainly contributed by the other factor i e cake gel layer 52 53 it can be interpreted that the carbon matrix of mfcms essentially features with partial lipophilicity that allows for opening more inner pores for penetrants filtration at higher feed oil concentration due to the rapid wetting effect this judgment can also be justified by the data in fig s5 it shows that the adsorption quantity increases significantly with the increment of oil concentration in water solution at the circumstances of higher oil concentration a larger concentration gradient would be formed between the bulky solution and the inner pores of mfcms so as to let more oil droplets diffusing into the inner pores at the same time some oil droplets tend to be entrained in the permeating water and passing through mfcms owing to the insufficient adsorption active sites thus the oil rejection is reduced in addition only the feed at of 50 mg l can yield the product allowable for emission by the demands of national environmental standard of which the oil concentration is less than 10 mg l at the permeate side as listed in table s3 54 55 therefore the optimum feed oil concentration is fixed at 50 mg l for the following study 3 8 effect of feed flowrate on oil removal in fig 8 it shows that the permeation fluxes are 280 5 kg m2 h for 4 ml min 184 5 kg m2 h for 6 ml min 263 9 kg m2 h for 8 ml min respectively in general membrane fouling tends to be less severe at higher feed flowrate by reducing concentration polarization and improving mass transfer as the result the permeation fluxes should be monotonically increased with pressure however the present mfcms are not strictly in accordance with the abovementioned rule this irregular change is probably due to the influence of local eddy currents and the degree of cake deposition per unit time the oil rejection is just in the opposite order of the permeation flux which is in line with the general rule of trade off relation between permeation flux and rejection for membrane materials 7 the variation of oil rejection with feed flowrate can be interpreted as follows at the steady state of permeation the oil rejection of mfcms is merely subjected to the cake gel layer filtration in that the system has already reached the adsorption equilibrium on the other hand more quantity of oil water mixture will pass through unit surface area of mfcms for given period with elevating feed flowrate as the result it evolves a thicker and denser cake gel layer with higher oil rejection however the cake gel layer should be partially destroyed due to scouring of an extremely high flow e g 8 ml min which diminishes the size exclusion and oil rejection moreover it could also prevent the boundary layer and the oil from accumulating along the membrane surface 50 56 therefore the higher oil rejection is reached at 84 6 at the feed flowrate of 6 ml min together with the permeation flux of 184 5 kg m2 h and the oil concentration of 7 7 mg l at permeate side 3 9 effect of trans membrane pressure on oil removal as shown in fig 9 the permeation flux increases with improving the trans membrane pressure across the membranes at the same time the oil rejections vary in the range of 85 94 there are two points concerning the above variation of oil removal 1 the increment of permeation flux with increasing pressure difference is due to the enhanced driving force 2 the change in oil rejection with pressure is closely associated with the two effects pore size exclusion and adsorption 54 at steady state the oil droplets would be more readily squeezed into the membrane pores at higher pressure during membrane filtration the major factor affecting the permeation resistance is pore fouling at the onset due to the concentration polarization and oil adsorption 49 57 the increased pressure difference favors the oil deposition and gel cake layer formation therefore pore size exclusion governs the mechanism of oil rejection at this situation due to the enhanced contribution of gel cake layer to further analyze the fouling process darcy equation is generally utilized for the permeation flux determination which is defined as follows based on the trans membrane pressure 58 1 j 1 a d v d t δ p μ r m r c in which δp is the trans membrane pressure μ the viscosity rm the membrane resistance and rc the cake resistance rm and rc are the product of internal pore size the pore density and the pore depth and the product of external colloidal fouling concentration polarization and formation of the gel layer respectively 59 after linear fitting regression by limiting the forced zero crossing the darcy equation is obtained on the permeation flux as the function of applied pressure as shown in fig 9 it is not a strict linear relation between the trans membrane pressure and the permeation flux with a poor standard variance 0 8949 this implies that the external resistance rc could not be ignored due to the significant blocking effect of the cake 58 besides the dynamics of membrane fouling process are varied under different pressures the result has evidently proved the previous analysis of membrane fouling on the separation performance of mfcms nevertheless all the concentrations of penetrating fluids are below 10 mg l that are satisfactory for the requirement of wastewater emission standard 4 conclusions phenolic resin based mfcms were modified by introducing pan microspheres the incorporation of pan microspheres could significantly improve the thermal degradation property of precursor as the pan amount increases the average macropores of resultant mfcms decrease together with the reduction of mesopores and micropores and the densification of microstructure the addition of pan microspheres eminently improves the emulsified oil water separation performance of as prepared mfcms which is stable enough to keep steady operation for running time over 240 min the separation performance of mfcms for oil water emulsion is heavily depended on the adsorption at the early stage and the size exclusion at the steady state respectively for mfcms made by the precursor containing 35 wt pan microspheres the permeation flux increases by increasing feed oil concentration or trans membrane pressure acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural

14273,microfiltration carbon membranes mfcms were prepared and modified by incorporating polyacrylonitrile based microspheres the thermal stability microstructure morphology and porous structure of the membrane samples were analyzed the effects of preparation and operation parameters on the oil removal of mfcms for oil water emulsion were investigated results demonstrate that the addition of microspheres effectively adjusts the porous structure adsorption property and oil removal of mfcms for mfcms made by the precursor containing 35 wt microspheres the highest oil removal is achieved to

microfiltration oily wastewater separation adsorption polyacrylonitrile microspheres 1 introduction with the rapid development of civilization and urbanization large quantity of oily wastewater is increasingly by produced in petroleum refineries petrochemical industries food processing textile plants steel working etc hence considerable effort has been taken on the stringent oily wastewater treatment prior to recycling or discharging 1 2 so far many techniques could be applied for oily wastewater treatment in reports such as air flotation adsorption skimming photocatalysis electrochemistry coagulation and flocculation 3 5 however most of them are incapable of the effective removal of emulsified oil drops from water 6 7 during the last several decades membrane separation has grown into one of the most promising techniques for the treatment of oil in water emulsion due to the advantages of high efficiency easy operation low investment no chemical addition and so on 8 9 shen et al removed 99 9 oil in wastewater by a poly vinylidene fluoride hybrid membrane blended with zro2 10 chakrabarty et al diminished over 90 oil in wastewater by polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes 11 das et al obtained a good oil removal of 95 4 for an oil in water emulsion with a concentration of 250 mg l by ceramic membranes 12 yeom et al reduced 98 oil of a 600 mg l oily wastewater by alumina coated clay diatomite membranes 13 changmai et al lowered the initial concentration of oil and grease from 35 mg l to 10 2 mg l by microfiltration ceramic membranes in batch mode for oily wastewater 14 trinh et al studied the influence of surfactants on the oil removal of oil emulsions in terms of flux fouling and interaction energy during microfiltration 15 although both microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes can be opted for oily wastewater treatment the former is more attractive for actual situation because of the excellent separation performance durability and wide application span besides microfiltration possesses the advantages of higher water flux rejection of ultrafine particles in solution and lower requirements for feeding water quality 1 16 17 since the membrane material primarily dominates the process and attractiveness of membrane separation so it is the first critical issue to appropriately choose membrane materials prior to preparation and application of microfiltration in common polymeric membranes are suffered from the structural degradation after a certain service time especially in harsh working medium some inorganic membrane materials like zeolites and ceramics are too fragile or expensive to meet the requirement of industrial production and application 18 therefore more interests have been successively paid for developing alternative candidates recently microfiltration carbon membranes mfcms have been identified as one of the most appealing materials owing to their excellent mechanical strength temperature resistance chemical stability and controllable porous structure 19 in particular their raw materials are widely available and quite economic for feasible industrialization 20 furthermore previous works have clearly confirmed the feasibility of mfcms for the treatment of emulsified oily wastewater 17 21 however mfcms still fail to achieve large scale industrial application because of the restriction from the deficiency of inferior oil removal about 70 in the absence of any means of reinforcement for instance demulsifier and applied electric field and so forth 16 22 in addition to the reinforcement strategy during permeation it is also effective by optimizing the structure and nature of mfcms previously our team found that the oil removal was heavily dependent on the porous structure and adsorption properties of mfcms 17 hence it is of great significance to enhance the abovementioned two aspects by various means e g incorporating fillers into the continuous membrane matrix 17 in this work an attempt was made to tailor the microstructure and property of mfcms by polyacrylonitrile pan based microspheres for the purpose of improving oil removal from oil water emulsion the motivation for us to utilize pan microspheres is 1 pan is a well known precursor for preparing porous carbon materials with excellent adsorption capacity 23 2 pan based carbon materials is expectant to exhibit outstanding interfacial compatibility with the matrix of mfcms due to their analogous carbon sources thereby it could alleviate the defect formation by avoiding serious interfacial separation during preparation 3 in addition the spherical morphology is favorable for understanding the underlying rules of modification of mfcms 2 experimental 2 1 raw materials the

the oil water emulsion was prepared by ultrasonically mixing the crude oil into double distillated water for 1 h to form uniform emulsion with the concentration of 50 200 mg l regarding any possible side effect of the instability of the oil water emulsion the following measures were taken into account in this work to ensure steady state operation and good repeatability first the oily wastewater is configured with a lower oil concentration 50 200 mg l the second is the current use to avoid long term placement and instable changes the third is the use of crude oil containing trace amount of water and salt which is conducive to the natural dispersion of oil droplets the oil drop size distribution is in the range of 410 130 nm determined by a laser particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk the results confirm the present three solutions are typical oil in water emulsions 2 2 preparation of mfcms the preparation procedure of mfcms includes the following steps curing pulverizing mixing molding pressing drying and carbonization as shown in fig s2 the detailed information can be referred to our previous work 22 differently pan microspheres fig s1 and nacmc were respectively used as additives and binders with the mass fractions of 25 45wt and 20wt over pr the shaped pristine precursor membranes were labeled with pm t where t refers to the mass fraction of pan over pr in starting mixture the carbonization was conducted by a tubular furnace in an atmosphere of 100 ml min flowing nitrogen of which the temperature was precisely regulated by a programmable temperature controller the precursor membranes were first heated at 2 c min from room temperature to 400 c for dwelling 2 h then ramped at 1 c min to 600 c for dwelling 2 h next at 0 5 c min to 650 c for dwelling 2 h last naturally cooled down to room temperature eventually circular coin like mfcms were obtained with the diameter of 2 5 cm and thickness of 0 5 cm for convenience the mfcms made from pm t were labeled with cm t 2 3 characterization the particle size distribution of powder samples was detected by a bt 9300s type laser particle size instrument bettersize with highly purified water as the dispersion medium the thermal stability of precursor membranes was evaluated by a tga 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer perkin elmer at a heating rate of 20 c min from room temperature to 800 c with the sweeping of 20 ml min flowing nitrogen the functional groups of membrane surface were examined by a tensor ii platinum atr ftir bruker in a wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 with scanning 15 times the pore size distributions of mfcms were measured by a bubble pressure method using isopropyl alcohol as wetting agent 24 the macroporosity of mfcms was obtained by a boiling point method in the national standard of china gb t 1966 1996 besides the parameters of mesopores and micropores were also measured by an asap2420 nitrogen adsorption analyzer micro meritics usa at 196 c the microstructure of the membranes was investigated by an ultima iv 185 mm x ray powder diffractometer rigaku at 40 kv and 40 ma in a 2θ range of 10 60 the interlayer d spacing d002 values were calculated by bragg s equation the morphology of samples was directly observed by a tm 3000 scanning electron microscope hitachi at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv and standard observation mode without any pretreatment of surface sputtering the water contact angle is a characterization method that visually reflects the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface during the test process 10 u l pure water was dropped on the dried membrane sample adhered to a horizontally glass slide this process was recorded by a jc2000d contact angle analyzer the detailed permeation process of mfcms for oil water emulsion is given in the supplementary information file in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test data the permeation experiments of all samples were tested three times in parallel the final listed data are the average values 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal analysis of precursor membranes fig 1 gives the curves of thermal weight losses and their derivatives of precursor membranes there are four thermal degradation stages i 170 c ii 170 350 c iii 350 460 c and iv 460 650 c the first tiny weight loss is assigned to the release of residual water in matrix and gases formed by further curing reaction of pr 25 the second stage is primarily attributed to the decomposition of nacmc and the evolution of ladder type molecular structure by the cyclization reaction of pan 26 as the carbonization temperature goes up to the third stage the corresponding weight loss is owing to the drastic degradation of pan accompanying by the release of derived gases co co2 hcn h2o etc 27 nevertheless the actual contribution of pan is indistinctive judging by the little difference in tga profiles of precursors with and without pan addition this implies that a semi interpenetrating network semi ipn is formed between pan and pr which prevents the huge weight loss of pure pan 28 at the fourth stage the successive weight loss is ascribed to the breakage of molecular backbone of pr and pan 29 among the pan doped precursor membranes the final weight remaining follows the order of pm 45 57 31 pm 35 55 89 pm 25 48 39 namely the increment of pan amount tends to improve the final weight remaining of the precursor membranes this result seems to be contradictory to the inferior thermal stability of pan in comparison to that of pr in fact pan has been widely utilized as excellent starting materials for porous carbon materials like activated carbon fibers 30 on the other hand a thermally stable semi ipn structure could be derived between pan and pr 31 consequently the addition of pan results into the increment of the final weight remaining of precursors 32 33 nevertheless the residual weight remaining of pm 25 is lower than that of pure precursor membrane the probable reason is that the insufficient ratio of pan over pr causes an adverse condition for yielding semi ipn when the amount is lower i e 25 wt the addition of pan would obviously obstruct the well formation of self crosslinking structure for phenolic resin resulting in a higher decomposition degree of precursor with a larger loss of final char yield 34 35 oppositely when the amount of pan exceeds 25 wt the semi ipn structure would be successfully formed between the pan and the phenolic resin molecules thereby improving the overall thermal stability therefore the pan amount should be greater than that value if one wants to get the positive effect on the thermal stability of precursor membranes in addition the thermal analysis data also confirm that the present carbonization temperature at 650 c is suitable for the full formation of carbon structure in mfcms 3 2 evolution of surface functional groups in fig 2 a the typical functional groups are identified as the stretching vibration of oh at 3262 cm 1 asymmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 at 2937 cm 1 stretching vibration of co at 1733 cm 1 skeleton vibration of benzene at 1593 cm 1 and stretching vibration of coc at 1013 cm 1 respectively 36 besides the characters of cn 2242 cm 1 and ch2 1541 cm 1 are obviously found for pan 37 as expected the spectrum of neat precursor lacks of the bonds of c n of pan at the same time the peak intensities become more strong for the abovementioned two bonds as well as cn and co with elevating the doped pan amount in contrast most of the reflectance peaks of original precursor membranes are lost on the surface of mfcms this demonstrates that the polymeric molecules of pan and pr have been thermally decomposed which is in good agreement with the tga section simultaneously the peak intensity of aromatic rings and polycondensed aromatic hydrocarbon structures is more obvious with graphitization progressing 38 consequently the background of the ftir spectra of mfcms is wider than that of the precursor membranes nevertheless the bonds of nh and cn are still remained in the doped mfcms suggesting that some thermally stable n containing groups are formed in the matrix of mfcms those hetero atomic groups are probably beneficial for improving the hydrophilic property of mfcms 39 40 3 3 morphology observation fig 3 is the sem images of mfcms it clearly finds that the porous structure of the neat mfcms is mainly constituted by the random stacking of pr derived carbon clumps moreover the hybrid mfcms also contain a certain amount of doped pan derived carbon microspheres which are embedded in the membrane matrix the images also indicate that the morphology of pan microspheres is well remained even after high temperature carbonization in particular the number of carbon microspheres remarkably increases as the amount of pan increases in precursors no doubt the porous structure of mfcms is certainly adjusted by incorporating the pan microspheres noticeably there are also some bigger pore apertures for mfcms as shown in the sem images but they are not the really effective pore sizes because that the porous structure of carbon materials is constructed by complicated three dimensional inter connecting of pore passages with different sizes and shapes usually the narrowest constrictions in the pore passages dominate the separation performance 3 4 porous structure in this section the porous structure of mfcms will be respectively analyzed by two techniques on the macropores and meso micro pores in fig 4 it shows that the average macropore size of mfcms significantly reduces from 0 84 μm to 0 36 μm with increasing the pan content from 0 wt to 45 wt the results reflect the different modification degree of mfcms by incorporation of carbon microspheres in addition the porosity of macropores for mfcms successively decreases from 53 80 to 51 86 by changing the pan amounts from 25 wt to 45 wt it also proves that the addition of microspheres obviously influences the larger macropores in mfcms especially for the high amount in sum the addition of pan microspheres helps to reduce the macropore size of mfcms this is ascribed to the pan based microspheres filling into the gaps of larger macropores formed by the stacking of pr derived carbon clumps in the membranes matrix the result is consistent with the previous sem observation apart from macropores the meso micro pores of mfcms are also listed in table s1 in comparison to the undoped neat mfcms the hybrid mfcms present much reduced total volume and specific surface area this difference is similar to that of the aforementioned macropores implying that the pore blockage also affects mesopoers and micropores by the pan based carbon microspheres among the three hybrid samples cm 35 has the highest pore volume and specific surface area this suggests that either higher content or lower amount of microspheres is likely to diminish the meso micro pores in resultant mfcms for lower amount the thermal degradation degree of precursor is higher due to the invalid formation of semi ipn structure as has been discussed in previous tga section on the contrary the addition of higher amount of microspheres tends to block the pores more seriously 3 5 microstructure analysis in fig 5 a broad diffraction peak appears at 16 18 in the xrd patterns for all precursor membranes it is assigned to the overlapping of diffraction peaks of pan and pr 36 apart from the typical diffraction peaks for nacmc also appear at 32 and 42 among the patterns neat precursor has the most symmetrical profile with the diffraction location at 18 in addition another peak arises around 16 for pan doped membranes with the pan amount elevating the peak intensity becomes more obvious together with the weakness of the peak intensity of 32 and 46 due to the enhanced modification of pan microspheres after carbonization the original peaks at 16 18 for pan and pr are replaced by another broad 002 plane diffraction of amorphous carbon at 19 2 it suggests that only amorphous carbon is derived from the mixed precursors by pan and pr this also validates our speculation on the good carbon carbon compatibility between carbonaceous microspheres and mfcms furthermore the symmetry of this peak improves as the microspheres amount increases along with the peak position shifting from 19 2 to 23 1 that is the calculated d002 values decrease from 0 462 nm to 0 385 nm it reveals that the microstructure is more compact with increasing the amount of pan based microspheres the conclusion is in good accordance with the previous results of porosity and pore size distribution at the same time the peaks at 32 and 43 are more pronounced indicating that the na containing species derived from nacmc still exist in the system after carbonization 3 6 effects of pan based microspheres amount on permeation flux and oil removal fig 6 gives the permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcms as the function of microspheres amount and running time at the first stage the permeation flux of cm 35 and cm 45 descends steeply with time until to the terminal 90 min simultaneously the permeation flux of neat mfcms and cm 25 slightly fluctuates and quickly approaches to the steady state it is worthy of notice that an uncommon increase in permeation flux with time is contradictory to the famous darcy equation 41 the abnormal data are probably ascribed to the poor hydrophilicity of the two mfcms as has been confirmed by the water contact angles table s2 and fig s4 it is ascertained that the inferior hydrophilicity of membranes usually needs longer wetting time to fully open the permeating passages for water in contrast the addition of pan microspheres remarkably improves the hydrophilicity of final mfcms so as to gradually diminish the time delay phenomenon this issue will be further discussed in the later adsorption section additionally the variation in permeation flux among the mfcms is closely related to the retention evolution of oil droplets through mfcms initially the pore passages in mfcms are fully accessible for oil droplets passing through freely by the driving forces of pressure and concentration differences however more and more oil droplets would be gradually accumulated on the wall surfaces and constrictions of pores with time by the conjunct effects of adsorption and size exclusion eventually a cake gel layer is generated with the coalescence of more oil drops and the growth of oil size it results into the reduction of effective pore size to a certain degree and the falling of permeation flux 42 43 at the same time the oil rejection is on the rise because of the enhancement of pore size exclusion with time anyhow all the mfcms reach their steady state of permeation when the running time is greater than 90 min at the steady state of 90 240 min the permeation flux of the as prepared four mfcms is in the range of 240 900 k g m2 h with the rejection of 78 85 until to the end points actually the separation performance of present mfcms is comparable to some deliberately modified membrane materials in reports as listed in table s3 the results indicate that the use of pan microspheres as additives could effectively modify the microstructure and oil removal of mfcms on the other hand the stable data also imply the quite good anti fouling performance of mfcms for oil water emulsion treatment at 240 min the permeation flux of hybrid mfcms is in the order of cm 45 210 2 kg m2 h cm 35 184 5 kg m2 h cm 25 179 3 kg m2 h which is exactly in the same order of the amount of pan based microspheres rather than the orders of pore size pore volume and structural compactness this indicates that the permeation process is dominated by not only the pore size exclusion but also the surface nature of membranes 44 it has found in the previous ftir and xrd sections that the introduction of pan increases the number of heteroatoms in mfcms which tends to enhance the hydrophilicity of mfcms and promote the permeation flux 45 46 on the other hand the pore volume determined by nitrogen adsorption technique cannot accurately distinguish the percent of pore types i e passing pores and dead end pores in mfcms since both of them are available for nitrogen adsorption probably higher amount of pan based microspheres in mfcms is likely to generate more passing pores for permeation therefore cm 45 exhibits the highest permeation flux in addition cm 35 also has the highest oil rejection of 84 6 among the three hybrid mfcms at the steady state nevertheless the difference in permeation flux and rejection for the three hybrid mfcms is not obviously distinct on the whole in comparison to that of pure mfcms as a kind of porous membranes the permeation behavior of mfcms is simultaneously governed by the pore size exclusion and adsorption 47 the adsorption contribution during permeation can also be evaluated by the data in fig s5 it notices that the absorption quantity rapidly increases with time during the initial 30 min due to the successive opening of active sites as the result of wetting more parts of mfcms by the solution 48 after that the mfcms gradually reach their adsorption equilibrium states among them neat mfcms cm 25 and cm 35 have the approximate values at 3 0 3 2 mg g together with a relatively inferior value at 2 5 mg g for cm 45 it is ascribed to the lowest pore volume and specific surface area disadvantageous for adsorption of cm 45 regarding this it ascertains that the change in permeation flux at the early stage is certainly attributed to the reduction of adsorption because of their consistent spent time for reaching equilibrium and steady stage in summary cm 35 has the paramount oil rejection of 84 6 along with the permeation flux of 184 5kg m2 h among the mfcms hence the data of cm 35 at a running time of 240 min are further used to investigate the effects of operation condition 3 7 effect of feed concentration on oil removal fig 7 shows the permeation flux and oil rejection with varying the feed oil concentration under the condition of feed flowrate at 6 ml min and trans membrane pressure at 0 02 mpa the rejection changes within the scope of 70 85 by altering the feed concentration from 50 mg l to 200 mg l the slight difference in oil rejections is associated with various factors including gel cake formation porous structure evolution and surface property change 49 50 the lower feed concentration yields higher oil rejection is due to the well exertion of membrane hydrophilicity because of few oil drops being deposited on membrane surface on the other hand a higher feed concentration is also beneficial for the size exclusion effect because of the enhanced contribution of thicker gel cake layer 51 in addition the permeation flux is remarkably increased from 184 5 kg m2 h to 590 8 kg m2 h with elevating the feed concentration from 50 mg l to 200 mg l this phenomenon justifies that the present mfcms are free of the influence of concentration polarization and the transportation resistance is mainly contributed by the other factor i e cake gel layer 52 53 it can be interpreted that the carbon matrix of mfcms essentially features with partial lipophilicity that allows for opening more inner pores for penetrants filtration at higher feed oil concentration due to the rapid wetting effect this judgment can also be justified by the data in fig s5 it shows that the adsorption quantity increases significantly with the increment of oil concentration in water solution at the circumstances of higher oil concentration a larger concentration gradient would be formed between the bulky solution and the inner pores of mfcms so as to let more oil droplets diffusing into the inner pores at the same time some oil droplets tend to be entrained in the permeating water and passing through mfcms owing to the insufficient adsorption active sites thus the oil rejection is reduced in addition only the feed at of 50 mg l can yield the product allowable for emission by the demands of national environmental standard of which the oil concentration is less than 10 mg l at the permeate side as listed in table s3 54 55 therefore the optimum feed oil concentration is fixed at 50 mg l for the following study 3 8 effect of feed flowrate on oil removal in fig 8 it shows that the permeation fluxes are 280 5 kg m2 h for 4 ml min 184 5 kg m2 h for 6 ml min 263 9 kg m2 h for 8 ml min respectively in general membrane fouling tends to be less severe at higher feed flowrate by reducing concentration polarization and improving mass transfer as the result the permeation fluxes should be monotonically increased with pressure however the present mfcms are not strictly in accordance with the abovementioned rule this irregular change is probably due to the influence of local eddy currents and the degree of cake deposition per unit time the oil rejection is just in the opposite order of the permeation flux which is in line with the general rule of trade off relation between permeation flux and rejection for membrane materials 7 the variation of oil rejection with feed flowrate can be interpreted as follows at the steady state of permeation the oil rejection of mfcms is merely subjected to the cake gel layer filtration in that the system has already reached the adsorption equilibrium on the other hand more quantity of oil water mixture will pass through unit surface area of mfcms for given period with elevating feed flowrate as the result it evolves a thicker and denser cake gel layer with higher oil rejection however the cake gel layer should be partially destroyed due to scouring of an extremely high flow e g 8 ml min which diminishes the size exclusion and oil rejection moreover it could also prevent the boundary layer and the oil from accumulating along the membrane surface 50 56 therefore the higher oil rejection is reached at 84 6 at the feed flowrate of 6 ml min together with the permeation flux of 184 5 kg m2 h and the oil concentration of 7 7 mg l at permeate side 3 9 effect of trans membrane pressure on oil removal as shown in fig 9 the permeation flux increases with improving the trans membrane pressure across the membranes at the same time the oil rejections vary in the range of 85 94 there are two points concerning the above variation of oil removal 1 the increment of permeation flux with increasing pressure difference is due to the enhanced driving force 2 the change in oil rejection with pressure is closely associated with the two effects pore size exclusion and adsorption 54 at steady state the oil droplets would be more readily squeezed into the membrane pores at higher pressure during membrane filtration the major factor affecting the permeation resistance is pore fouling at the onset due to the concentration polarization and oil adsorption 49 57 the increased pressure difference favors the oil deposition and gel cake layer formation therefore pore size exclusion governs the mechanism of oil rejection at this situation due to the enhanced contribution of gel cake layer to further analyze the fouling process darcy equation is generally utilized for the permeation flux determination which is defined as follows based on the trans membrane pressure 58 1 j 1 a d v d t δ p μ r m r c in which δp is the trans membrane pressure μ the viscosity rm the membrane resistance and rc the cake resistance rm and rc are the product of internal pore size the pore density and the pore depth and the product of external colloidal fouling concentration polarization and formation of the gel layer respectively 59 after linear fitting regression by limiting the forced zero crossing the darcy equation is obtained on the permeation flux as the function of applied pressure as shown in fig 9 it is not a strict linear relation between the trans membrane pressure and the permeation flux with a poor standard variance 0 8949 this implies that the external resistance rc could not be ignored due to the significant blocking effect of the cake 58 besides the dynamics of membrane fouling process are varied under different pressures the result has evidently proved the previous analysis of membrane fouling on the separation performance of mfcms nevertheless all the concentrations of penetrating fluids are below 10 mg l that are satisfactory for the requirement of wastewater emission standard 4 conclusions phenolic resin based mfcms were modified by introducing pan microspheres the incorporation of pan microspheres could significantly improve the thermal degradation property of precursor as the pan amount increases the average macropores of resultant mfcms decrease together with the reduction of mesopores and micropores and the densification of microstructure the addition of pan microspheres eminently improves the emulsified oil water separation performance of as prepared mfcms which is stable enough to keep steady operation for running time over 240 min the separation performance of mfcms for oil water emulsion is heavily depended on the adsorption at the early stage and the size exclusion at the steady state respectively for mfcms made by the precursor containing 35 wt pan microspheres the permeation flux increases by increasing feed oil concentration or trans membrane pressure acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural

14274,a variant of constructed wetland using artificial carriers for bacterial growth as support medium high rate constructed wetlands hrcw has been developed to depurate high organic loads 45 g bod5 m 2 d 1 the metabolic state of vegetation in this phytodepuration system affects the treatment processes therefore its optimum adaptation is necessary a comparative study in mesocosms scale was undertaken to test the capacity of adaptation of three plant species cyperus alternifolius heliconia burleana and zantedeschia aethiopica in hrcw 25 units of each species were planted in three lines of hrcw one species per line named for ease of understanding as l1 l2 l3 respectively and monitored during the start up phase of the system under climatic conditions of intersection between dry tropical forest and premontane sub humid quantitative epidemiology was used to determine incidence infection rate and the relative area under the disease progress curve for each type of plant the relationship between these epidemiology variables and the environmental conditions was determined vegetative stress was observed in all species followed by a phase of high phytopathology with infection rates of 0 0049 0 0183 0 1085 0 1821 0 0911 0 1158 units day for l1 l2 and l3 respectively the combination between the high organic load water volume 94 v v and weather conditions favoured this behaviour this study indicated that cyperus alternifolius is a type of plant suitable for hrcw highlighted the importance of studies on plant adaptation in cw with particular conditions and showed epidemiological analysis as a tool for performing this selection in a low cost and user friendly way keywords constructed wetlands phytopathology artificial carrier disease incidence 1 introduction water is the main agent through which climate change impacts the ecology and society 1 2 wastewater reuse is a tool which can minimize the climate change impact especially the reuse of depurated wastewater but only with adequate treatment in latin america wastewater treatment is insufficient and only 20 of wastewater is treated 3 4 traditional technologies for depuration are expensive 5 but similar to other technologies the inexpensive technology of constructed wetlands cws could be adopted in response to water stress stringent wastewater treatment requirements sustainability consideration and climate change 6 cws are engineered wetlands which are designed and constructed to mimic physical chemical and biological processes that occur in natural wetland systems for treating wastewater 7 among the cw types the constructed wetlands with subsurface flow ssfcw are used to treat primary or secondary treated sewage 8 a ssfcw is formed by a support media plants and biofilm which interact with each other to depurate different kinds of wastewater such as municipal industrial agricultural acid mine drainage and other polluted waters 9 the key elements of its configuration that have the most influence on the system s efficiency are the support medium and plants 9 10 support medium allows the formation and development of biofilm on its surface support media having large surface area 300 m2 m 3 for biofilm growth achieve high treatment efficiency and could treat wastewater with high organic load 9 10 in addition some of their characteristics such as porosity influence the hydraulic performance and cost of construction and maintenance of ssfcw using media with high porosity 90 can reduce the construction cost because greater wastewater volume can be treated in less land area with the advantage of cw life span increment due to clogging time reduction of the ssfcw 11 which is the worst operational problem 12 in this regard some alternative support media have been tested natural materials such as zeolite limestone shale pelleted clay opaka pumice and industrial by product media as slag fly ash coal cinder alum sludge hollow brick crumbs oil palm shell have been commonly used 10 few studies have used plastic support media 11 13 14 plants in cws play a key role as they create attachment sites for biofilm release oxygen inside of the media bed uptake nutrients accumulate pollutants serve as thermal isolate and have an aesthetic function 15 16 proper selection of plant species and plant stability in cws are crucial to ensure the treatment performance since intolerance to toxic pollutants 17 or local climatic condition 16 could affect them studies about plant tolerance to wastewater recommend using native plant species 18 and carrying out preliminary laboratory studies to test plant tolerance prior to using them for phytoremediation of a specific effluent 16 19 considering the cost of cws to depurate wastewater with high organic load 40 200 g bod5 m 2 d 1 and the environmental impact of using material from quarry extraction a new support medium formed by numerous carriers for bacterial growth made with recycled plastic has been developed 20 the cws using this support medium are called high rate constructed wetlands hrcw because they were developed to treat urban or industrial wastewater with high organic load in cw technology when a new material or support medium is tested the vegetation support medium relationship should be maintained to ensure the growth and development of the vegetation this study considers the aforementioned fact in order to evaluate the adaptation capacity of three species of macrophytes in a hrcw system by applying botanical epidemiology concepts and by guaranteeing the vegetation support medium relationship the ultimate goal of this study is to offer the first phytopathological criterion regarding plant species wich must be considered in the design of this new variant of cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a system of hrcws in mesocosms scale was used in this research fig 1 this scale is a good approximation that closely simulates the natural environment and is therefore recommended to mimic field conditions this allows to analyse multiple stress treatments and predict how plants will cope with these challenges due to the complexity of stress combinations 21 it was located at the adjacent green space of the centre of materials characterization at the universidad industrial de santander in bucaramanga 7 08 n 73 08 o santander colombia weather conditions of intersection between dry tropical forest and premontane sub humid holdridge classification 22 are characteristics on site the system consisted of a mix tank 1 m3 which was used to prepare synthetic wastewater daily 600 l followed by a pump to discharge wastewater to three storage tanks from each tank the wastewater was conveyed to 3 different lines of hrcws named line 1 2 and 3 respectively each line had the same total wetland area 0 88 m2 and received the same flow rate 200 l d 1 and hydraulic retention time 1 day the hrcws were formed by two rectangular reactors 0 61 m x 0 82 m x 0 54 m each connected in series by three pipes filled with artificial carriers 2400 units m 3 with a thickness of 0 35 m 0 30 m water level and planted with 25 units of a kind of tropical plant line 1 cyperus alternifolius line 2 heliconia burleana and line 3 zantedeschia aethiopica the aforementioned species were validated by the colombian agriculture and livestock institute ica acronym in spanish the experiment was carried out without a control line without vegetation taking into account that an experimental design does not need control group if the goal is to compare the effects of the treatments not determine whether said treatment achieves better results than an inactive treatment in addition in nature it is unlikely that plants are exposed to abiotic or biotic stresses in isolation and multiple stress situations are more likely to occur simultaneously so world research has started to focus on multiple stress treatments to mimic field conditions 21 in each line wastewater was distributed through a thin channel placed across the entire width and located on the top of the first reactor to force the plug flow across the wetland each reactor was divided into two compartments by a vertical baffle located in the middle section of the reactor the baffle cut was 120 mm the wastewater flowed into the first compartment with downflow followed by upflow into the second compartment in each reactor the output of each line was located in the second reactor where three pipes located at the top of the wall opposite to the inlet collected the treated water which was finally conducted to the sewer through a drainage pipe the artificial carriers were designed to enhance both the specific surface area and porosity of cws therefore they were formed by an outer and inner structure fig 2 of planar surfaces and voids they can be made from any type of plastic material polypropylene low density polyethylene high density polyethylene polyvinylchloride polycarbonate or mixtures thereof and even polymeric or ceramic resins when the equivalent external diameter is 88 mm the artificial carriers have a specific surface area of 320 m2 m 3 for growth and biological interaction and an effective porosity of 94 for the circulation of water and gases in the treatment process the plants were bought at a nursery in order to ensure a good vegetative state and the same growing time 2 months the kinds of plants used in the investigation were selected based on the following considerations i the availability in the study area especially heliconia burleana which is a native plant from santander ii pleasing aesthetics ornamental plants and iii previous use in constructed wetlands though not tested yet in this particular climate 23 32 the plant roots were washed with tap water before planting them inside hrcws to avoid the input of solid particles in the system then plants were translocated to the hrcws and were acclimated using tap water for 2 months may to july 2015 during this period the plants were healthy due to i the nutrients accumulated in their rhizomes roots bulbs or tissues after fertilization in the nursery ii daily feeding with fresh water this procedure permitted diminution of the affectation of vegetation and gradual adaptation because inside the hrcws the water volume was around 94 of the reactor volume therefore stress by flooding could be produced thereupon all reactors were inoculated with a commercial inoculum biodyne 301 imported by biodyne bogotá from biodyne inc sarasota florida usa for one week in order to promote the biofilm growth the hrcws operated with intermittent gravity driven flow given that intermittent feeding provides a more oxidised treatment environment which favours both the growth of plants and the process of removal of wastewater contaminants 33 in shorter hydraulic retention time synthetic wastewater table 1 with similar composition to that used by 34 35 made up of tap water as solvent was fed by discharges of 33 3 litres every 4 h using electrovalves which were controlled by a siemens logo programmable controller meteorological data of mean maximum and minimum of air temperature tm tmax and tmin c relative humidity rhm rhmax and rhmin total solar radiation rs w m 2 d 1 and rainfall r mm were recorded every 10 min at a local meteorological station called bucaramanga neomundo this station belongs to the ideam public institution of technical and scientific support to the national environmental system in colombia and the meteorological data are available for public use the ph was used as a control parameter during this start up phase because of its effects on wetland water chemistry and biology a daily measurement was recorded inside each reactor by using a portable ph meter pce phd1 pce instruments company spain and its corresponding ph electrode 2 2 analytical procedures the system was monitored during 73 days july to october 2015 beginning with the feeding with wastewater the acclimatization phase was used as control for the experiment in order to evaluate the effect of the system i e wastewater ph etc on the vegetation the ph was measured every day inside each reactor on a half part of a piezometer 300 mm in depth inside the distribution tanks the variation of ph throughout the day was monitored only during the first week of the assessment period one measure when the wastewater was made 9 00 a m and one measure at 5 p m ph mean values for the first and second measurements were 7 84 and 7 76 respectively with coefficient of variation 0 005296 and 0 005 on average respectively this minimal daily decrease of wastewater ph 0 1 units approximately has no influence on the behaviour of wetlands when it is discharged into them thus it was not necessary to continue with the measurements after the first week the ph stability in the distribution tanks was due to the buffer effect achieved with the addition of nahco3 700 mg l 1 to the synthetic wastewater in order to compare the adaptation of each plant species a quantitative and qualitative approach on phytopathology was used which is a useful approach to quantify plant diseases using temporal analysis this approach takes into account that root radial oxygen loss rol is affected positively by photosynthesis and is correlated directly with nutrient removal in cws both rol and photosynthetic rate are indices that can be used to identity wetland plants with a higher nutrient removal capacity 36 38 photosynthesis is an important physiological activity of plants which directly reflects their growth and nutrient absorption moreover photosynthesis the most fundamental and intricate physiological process in all green plants is severely affected in all its phases by environmental stresses 39 following said approach visual detection of toxicity or disease symptoms spots necrosis blockage decay etc was carried out on days 21 44 and 73 on each branch of the plants in order to quantify the total number of diseased branches in each reactor the number of diseased branches was used to determine the disease incidence ic the disease progress curve the area under the disease progress curve audpc the relative area under the disease progress curve raudpc and the infection rate r according to 40 44 the ic corresponds to the number of individuals or quantified parts of an individual which had been affected by a disease in relation to the total quantity it was estimated using the following equation 1 i c n n 100 where n is the number of diseased branches n corresponds to the total number of branches assessed 40 the graphic of ic vs time corresponds to the disease progress curve the audpc for disease incidence is the amount of disease between two time observations it was calculated by means of 2 a u d p c i 1 n y i 1 y i 2 x i 1 x i where xi is the incidence of disease at the time i xi 1 the disease incidence recorded at the time i 1 n the number of registrations on the incidence and t the days between the registration of xi and xi 1 40 the total sum disease progress was used as the final audpc 41 the raudpc was estimated by normalizing the final audpc dividing it by the total area of the graph number of days from first appearance of disease until the end of the observation period 41 the infection rate r which reflects the plant variety resistance was determined from the monomolecular logistic or gompertz models 42 44 with the best nonlinear fitting using the method of the least squares monomolecular 3 y 1 1 y o e x p r m t logistic 4 y 1 1 e x p ln y o 1 y o r l t gompertz 5 y e x p l n y o e x p r g t where yo is the initial inoculum and rm rl rg correspond to the infection rates at the end of the experimental period mycological and bacteriological tests were carried out by the ica at its national laboratory of phytopathology diagnosis following the protocols established by the ica from 45 52 for these tests a sample of symptomatic plants sample size 32 was randomly selected in each hrcw line fungi detection according to 45 47 first stereoscopic and microscopic observations were done in order to characterize symptoms next a dissection of structures in the symptomatic tissue roots rhizome and stem was performed in a humid chamber by mean the cutting explants of plant tissue 3 to 5 mm in size in the transition zone between healthy and diseased tissue these materials were disinfected by immersion in ethanol 70 for 45 s immersed in sodium hypochlorite 2 for 45 s and washed with sterile water taking into account that surface sterilisation of diseased plant material removes saprobes and permits the bacterial or fungal pathogen to grow unimpeded when the material is planted onto culture medium 53 after disinfection the explants were dried on absorbent paper and put near the burner for 15 min after that the explants were sowed in potato dextrose agar pda medium incubated at 25 c and checked on 3 5 days after planting in order to isolate growths for that an identification of colonies was conducted and the isolated organism was seeded in culture plates pda and malt agar 2 and carnation petals traps finally the pathogen identification associated with the presented symptomatology was made from taxonomically determining morphological characters according to barnett and hunter 47 bacterial detection according to 45 48 52 the material was washed using running water under the tap and left to dry in the open air a portion of diseased plant tissue was taken and small pieces not more than 5 x 5 mm were cut from the edge of the lesions the tissues were disinfected in ethanol 70 for 30 s immediately they were transferred to a solution of 1 5 sodium hypochlorite naclo for 2 min and washed with sterile water in order to remove the excess of disinfectants then extraction of bacteria from the tissue was conducted using one of the following options a the disinfected material was placed in a small sterilized mortar and gently macerated to break the tissue and allow the bacteria to escape then a drop of the macerate was transferred with the handle b when the diseased tissue was succulent or rotted because of the disease small pieces of disinfected tissue were placed inside a tube with sterilized distilled water and stirred for 10 min to facilitate the outflow of the bacteria and obtain a slurry that slightly clouds the water in the tube one drop of the macerate or suspension was taken and spread in zigzag on the surface of the culture medium nutrient agar na to seed the bacteria incubation was made to 28 c for 48 h pure cultures of the obtained bacteria were cultivated by selecting an individual colony of the type that had grown most frequently in the planting lines on the culture medium the growth was transferred to a tube with sterilized distilled water shaken with the aid of a vortex and a drop was spread on the surface of a petri dish with na incubation was conducted under the same conditions after 48 h a representative individual colony was selected and transferred to tubes with sloping na for incubation it was assumed that each colony was originated from a bacterium and therefore corresponded to their clonal offspring for identification of ralstonia solanacerum a colony was transferred to 300 μl of beb1 extraction buffer agdia and the bacterium was detected using the kit 33 900 agdia for other bacteria bactident oxidase kit merck for the detection of cytochrome oxidase in microorganisms the gram stain method and identification based on biochemical characteristics according to schaad et al 48 were used 2 3 statistical analyses in this comparative study three treatments three kinds of plants were assigned to three mesocosms one of each in randomized way each mesocosms had two experimental units two reactors with 12 and 13 observational units respectively 25 plants in total data were recorded by means of three assessments sampling on population level during the experimental time the non parametric kruskal wallis test α 0 05 and post hoc conover iman were performed to compare and test differences between treatments with respect to the disease progress curve and the ph the pearson correlation test was performed in order to find the relationship between final incidence infection rate raudp and experimental conditions the xlstat software package was used to perform the statistical tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental and system conditions trends for meteorological variables remained stables during the test period with low variance a behaviour that characterizes climate in tropical areas its average values table 2 characterized the weather conditions the ph fig 3 trended downward in all reactors but was maintained around 6 5 by means of stabilization with nahco3 700 mg l 1 this pattern is commonly found in the start up phase of fixed film reactors because during the biofilm development acid formers grow at higher rates generating and accumulating volatile fatty acids which may shift the operating ph to acidic range 54 in all lines the ph on reactor 2 was higher than in reactor 1 p value 0 0002 0 0001 0 0001 for l1 l2 and l3 respectively because as the water moves in the hrcw line following a plug flow trend the organic matter is mainly accumulated in the first third of the hrcw length i e reactor 1 which generates a zone of more oxygen consumption and low ph levels furthermore reactor 2 was connected in series to the reactor 1 outlet so it received less organic load because as the wastewater flowed through the hrcw line the organic matter was degraded and the oxygen transfer increased in the same way that occurs in ssfcws 55 the environmental and system conditions were compared with the ideal conditions for plant development table 3 which depend on the species experimental conditions had higher rh and ph in relation to the required conditions especially for the l2 and l3 species the differences among these climatic conditions could produce stress in the plants just as calheiros et al 17 showed in their study that it is possible for plants to experience some difficulty in developing and propagating considering that the ph of the matrix particularly at the beginning of cw operation is out of the optimum range evidence of environmental stress such as burning tips fig 4 a yellowing fig 4 b and curling in leaves fig 4 c was displayed during the test period on the species in all lines although with more intensity in the species of l2 and l3 3 2 epidemiology variables fig 5 illustrates the disease trends in each reactor and line the vegetation in this study was healthy during the acclimatization period and in the first week after the fedding with wastewater started however as the test period elapsed toxicity symptoms stress and disease occurred following an upward behaviour in all lines of the test significant differences p 0 05 were established among the species with respect to ic values c alternifolius had the lowest incidence values 8 36 l1 in fig 5 while h burleana and z aethiopica presented greater incidence 38 89 99 98 l2 and l3 in fig 5 respectively final ic values in each reactor of 28 35 85 99 97 99 97 99 98 and 99 99 for l1r1 l1r2 l2r1 l2r2 l3r1 and l3r2 respectively confirmed the high susceptibility of the species in l2 and l3 the infection rate table 4 determined using the model with the best fit was low near zero for species in l1 and high near one for species in l2 and l3 therefore the disease was promoted more slowly in l1 than l2 and l3 correspondingly with ic and r the raudpc values table 4 followed the same pattern the raudpc is a variable that corresponds to the relative area under the curve of actual infection the higher its value the more susceptible the species is results showed that all species were susceptible but species in l2 and l3 had higher susceptibilities indeed in these lines all plants had died by the end of the experimental period on the contrary c alternifolius showed adaptation capacity and resilience 3 3 correlation of epidemiology variables and environmental conditions epidemiologically the plant pathogen environment interaction triangle of plant disease is the basis upon which to establish an agro ecological system favourable to plant growth and development at the population level analyzing the environmental conditions to create a favorable environment to host plant population but adverse to the spread and evolution of pathogen is the best way to achieve it 60 in this study strong positive correlations table 5 were found between raudpc and the ph and humidity differences pearson s correlation 0 871 and 0 785 respectively required for healthy growth of plants in l2 and l3 when plants were in contact with the wastewater the outside location or in open field of the experiment setup gave the opportunity for microorganisms to be transported by the air and insects towards the vegetation in hrcws as can happen in a real scale wetland system pathogenicity test results showed the colonization of fungi and bacteria in all plants species in l1 rhizoctonia sp fungi was detected in l2 erwinia sp bacteria exserohilum rostratum and pestalotia fungi were identified in l3 erwinia sp bacteria pythium sp and collectotrichum gloesporioides fungi were detected similar results were reported by burgoon et al 11 in a study comparing plant growth and wastewater treatment 21 g bod5 m 2 d 1 in microcosms 22 l using one type of substrate river gravel plastic support media tri paks 2 5 or 5 0 cm in diameter and one of four plant species typha latifolia phragmites australis scirpus pungens and sagittaria latifolia in each all species of plants were grown in the gravel substrate t latifolia was not grown in either plastic substrate s latifolia and s pungens grew poorly in the plastic substrates whereas p australis grew well in all three substrates s latifolia was very susceptible to fungus among the pathogens detected in this study the bacterium erwinia sp is classified as the most important of the primary pathogens 61 this soilborne facultative anaerobic bacterium causes maceration and rotting of parenchymatous tissue of all plant organs resulting in loss of the entire plant 62 according to wright and triggs 63 chance of infection by erwinia is greatly increased under conditions that impair host resistance and favour multiplication of the bacteria e g high temperatures 27 c reduced oxygen and water covering the surfaces root all these conditions were present in this study when the vegetation was exposed to the wastewater site location tropical environment high organic load 45 g bod5 m 2 d 1 which produces depletion of oxygen level and the decline of ph as well as the water quantity 94 v v which covered and waterlogged the root zone led to the death of all plants in l2 and l3 h burleana and z aethiopica respectively the high organic load and the water quantity are characteristics that differentiate hrcws from traditional ssfcws these two characteristics are the result of the use of artificial carriers for bacterial growth which give high surface area 320 m2 m 3 and porosity 94 to the wetland bed the bacterial communities in ssfccws develop on the surface of each particle of the support medium hence higher surface area enables more microorganism density in order to treat more quantity of organic contaminants high organic load in addition in traditional ssfcws the wastewater volume is around half of the volume as in hrcws because the porosity of their support media offers void space of 45 50 at most the use of artificial carriers allows treatment of more organic or hydraulic load in less land area diminishing the cost of the treatment and positioning the hrcws technology as an economic alternative to purify wastewater of different nature it is noteworthy that under the same environmental conditions but with the system fed with tap water the vegetation remained healthy hence the aforementioned conditions must simultaneously be present to generate diseases therefore these conditions being inherent to the hrcw design they cannot be changed meaning that the vegetation support medium relationship is not guaranteed for all types of vegetation and correct selection of vegetation is essential in this system the survivor plant species of this study was cyperus alternifolius which is a non native species that has been widely reported to be an effective phytoremediation plant in constructed wetland systems 23 studies on c alternifolius stress have shown its capability to endure different stressors on cws such as ammonia 24 pharmaceutically active compounds 23 and lack of water 25 in this study for c alternifolius the most important abiotic stressor was the high organic load which produced ph decline and low oxygen content in the start up phase nevertheless this species pertains to cyperaceae group which is acid tolerant 24 therefore it could be stated that the cause of 30 affectation final ic in this species was the colonization by rhizoctonia s p this biotic stressor did not become lethal because of the plant antioxidant activity 64 at the end of the experimental period c alternifolius replicated its branch numbers and grew in height it was totally adapted to artificial carriers and hrcw conditions the hrcw system has been designed to function in strong conditions high hydraulic or high organic loads which may disturb plant development in this study three types of aquatic plants commonly used in cws especially in tropical weather were tested one of them heliconia burleana was native to santander colombia it was expected that this species would be more adaptable according to the recommendation of some researchers who advise use of indigenous plant species in order to prevent undesired impacts 18 65 however this species did not adapt highlighting the importance of studies on plant adaptation to system conditions in order to guarantee the cw performance vegetation adaptation studies in cws generally use the contaminant removal efficiency to select plants 15 17 65 but in this study an analogue method of selection was used based on the vegetation health this methodology is based on the interaction of plant communities with their respective pathogens in a specified environment epidemic triangle at the population level the disease is quantified as part of the pathogenic process that expresses through the symptoms the interaction degree of the epidemic triangle and permits stablish the vegetation adaptation capacity by means of the phytopathological indicators incidence index and raudpc from this study it can be established that a final incidence index up to 30 could be used in plants selection procedures in the start up phase of hrcw and cws in order to guarantee plant survival and adaptation to different kinds of wastewater 4 conclusions this study is part of ongoing research aiming to establish the use of artificial carriers for biofilm growth inside of constructed wetlands specifically the adaptation of vegetation to this new variant of wetlands was analyzed from an analysis based on phytopathological indicators the strong conditions generated by this new support medium are a major factor in wetland ecosystem and can significantly alter the initial growth and physiological performance of the plants grown in them this is especially important because vegetation plays a core role in contaminant removal processes vegetative stress can occur in the presence of a biotic an abiotic stressor or in the presence of both therefore it is necessary to evaluate all factors that can influence the state of the vegetation as closely as possible to the operating conditions of the system in terms of the application of hrcw technology it is essential to carry out a phase of plant selection based on local climate conditions in order to avoid their affectation epidemiological analysis could be used as a tool for adequate plant selection before their use in treating a specific wastewater in constructed wetlands in a low cost and user friendly way under weather conditions of dry tropical forest and premontane sub humid it has been established that cyperus alternifolius is one vegetation species suitable for artificial high rate wetlands further research is recommended to establish whether only acid tolerant plant species are adequate for use in this variant of cws

14274,a variant of constructed wetland using artificial carriers for bacterial growth as support medium high rate constructed wetlands hrcw has been developed to depurate high organic loads 45 g bod5 m 2 d 1 the metabolic state of vegetation in this phytodepuration system affects the treatment processes therefore its optimum adaptation is necessary a comparative study in mesocosms scale was undertaken to test the capacity of adaptation of three plant species cyperus alternifolius heliconia burleana and zantedeschia aethiopica in hrcw 25 units of each species were planted in three lines of hrcw one species per line named for ease of understanding as l1 l2 l3 respectively and monitored during the start up phase of the system under climatic conditions of intersection between dry tropical forest and premontane sub humid quantitative epidemiology was used to determine incidence infection rate and the relative area under the disease progress curve for each type of plant the relationship between these epidemiology variables and the environmental conditions was determined vegetative stress was observed in all species followed by a phase of high phytopathology with infection rates of 0 0049 0 0183 0 1085 0 1821 0 0911 0 1158 units day for l1 l2 and l3 respectively the combination between the high organic load water volume 94 v v and weather conditions favoured this behaviour this study indicated that cyperus alternifolius is a type of plant suitable for hrcw highlighted the importance of studies on plant adaptation in cw with particular conditions and showed epidemiological analysis as a tool for performing this selection in a low cost and user friendly way keywords constructed wetlands phytopathology artificial carrier disease incidence 1 introduction water is the main agent through which climate change impacts the ecology and society 1 2 wastewater reuse is a tool which can minimize the climate change impact especially the reuse of depurated wastewater but only with adequate treatment in latin america wastewater treatment is insufficient and only 20 of wastewater is treated 3 4 traditional technologies for depuration are expensive 5 but similar to other technologies the inexpensive technology of constructed wetlands cws could be adopted in response to water stress stringent wastewater treatment requirements sustainability consideration and climate change 6 cws are engineered wetlands which are designed and constructed to mimic physical chemical and biological processes that occur in natural wetland systems for treating wastewater 7 among the cw types the constructed wetlands with subsurface flow ssfcw are used to treat primary or secondary treated sewage 8 a ssfcw is formed by a support media plants and biofilm which interact with each other to depurate different kinds of wastewater such as municipal industrial agricultural acid mine drainage and other polluted waters 9 the key elements of its configuration that have the most influence on the system s efficiency are the support medium and plants 9 10 support medium allows the formation and development of biofilm on its surface support media having large surface area 300 m2 m 3 for biofilm growth achieve high treatment efficiency and could treat wastewater with high organic load 9 10 in addition some of their characteristics such as porosity influence the hydraulic performance and cost of construction and maintenance of ssfcw using media with high porosity 90 can reduce the construction cost because greater wastewater volume can be treated in less land area with the advantage of cw life span increment due to clogging time reduction of the ssfcw 11 which is the worst operational problem 12 in this regard some alternative support media have been tested natural materials such as zeolite limestone shale pelleted clay opaka pumice and industrial by product media as slag fly ash coal cinder alum sludge hollow brick crumbs oil palm shell have been commonly used 10 few studies have used plastic support media 11 13 14 plants in cws play a key role as they create attachment sites for biofilm release oxygen inside of the media bed uptake nutrients accumulate pollutants serve as thermal isolate and have an aesthetic function 15 16 proper selection of plant species and plant stability in cws are crucial to ensure the treatment performance since intolerance to toxic pollutants 17 or local climatic condition 16 could affect them studies about plant tolerance to wastewater recommend using native plant species 18 and carrying out preliminary laboratory studies to test plant tolerance prior to using them for phytoremediation of a specific effluent 16 19 considering the cost of cws to depurate wastewater with high organic load 40 200 g bod5 m 2 d 1 and the environmental impact of using material from quarry extraction a new support medium formed by numerous carriers for bacterial growth made with recycled plastic has been developed 20 the cws using this support medium are called high rate constructed wetlands hrcw because they were developed to treat urban or industrial wastewater with high organic load in cw technology when a new material or support medium is tested the vegetation support medium relationship should be maintained to ensure the growth and development of the vegetation this study considers the aforementioned fact in order to evaluate the adaptation capacity of three species of macrophytes in a hrcw system by applying botanical epidemiology concepts and by guaranteeing the vegetation support medium relationship the ultimate goal of this study is to offer the first phytopathological criterion regarding plant species wich must be considered in the design of this new variant of cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a system of hrcws in mesocosms scale was used in this research fig 1 this scale is a good approximation that closely simulates the natural environment and is therefore recommended to mimic field conditions this allows to analyse multiple stress treatments and predict how plants will cope with these challenges due to the complexity of stress combinations 21 it was located at the adjacent green space of the centre of materials characterization at the universidad industrial de santander in bucaramanga 7 08 n 73 08 o santander colombia weather conditions of intersection between dry tropical forest and premontane sub humid holdridge classification 22 are characteristics on site the system consisted of a mix tank 1 m3 which was used to prepare synthetic wastewater daily 600 l followed by a pump to discharge wastewater to three storage tanks from each tank the wastewater was conveyed to 3 different lines of hrcws named line 1 2 and 3 respectively each line had the same total wetland area 0 88 m2 and received the same flow rate 200 l d 1 and hydraulic retention time 1 day the hrcws were formed by two rectangular reactors 0 61 m x 0 82 m x 0 54 m each connected in series by three pipes filled with artificial carriers 2400 units m 3 with a thickness of 0 35 m 0 30 m water level and planted with 25 units of a kind of tropical plant line 1 cyperus alternifolius line 2 heliconia burleana and line 3 zantedeschia aethiopica the aforementioned species were validated by the colombian agriculture and livestock institute ica acronym in spanish the experiment was carried out without a control line without vegetation taking into account that an experimental design does not need control group if the goal is to compare the effects of the treatments not determine whether said treatment achieves better results than an inactive treatment in addition in nature it is unlikely that plants are exposed to abiotic or biotic stresses in isolation and multiple stress situations are more likely to occur simultaneously so world research has started to focus on multiple stress treatments to mimic field conditions 21 in each line wastewater was distributed through a thin channel placed across the entire width and located on the top of the first reactor to force the plug flow across the wetland each reactor was divided into two compartments by a vertical baffle located in the middle section of the reactor the baffle cut was 120 mm the wastewater flowed into the first compartment with downflow followed by upflow into the second compartment in each reactor the output of each line was located in the second reactor where three pipes located at the top of the wall opposite to the inlet collected the treated water which was finally conducted to the sewer through a drainage pipe the artificial carriers were designed to enhance both the specific surface area and porosity of cws therefore they were formed by an outer and inner structure fig 2 of planar surfaces and voids they can be made from any type of plastic material polypropylene low density polyethylene high density polyethylene polyvinylchloride polycarbonate or mixtures thereof and even polymeric or ceramic resins when the equivalent external diameter is 88 mm the artificial carriers have a specific surface area of 320 m2 m 3 for growth and biological interaction and an effective porosity of 94 for the circulation of water and gases in the treatment process the plants were bought at a nursery in order to ensure a good vegetative state and the same growing time 2 months the kinds of plants used in the investigation were selected based on the following considerations i the availability in the study area especially heliconia burleana which is a native plant from santander ii pleasing aesthetics ornamental plants and iii previous use in constructed wetlands though not tested yet in this particular climate 23 32 the plant roots were washed with tap water before planting them inside hrcws to avoid the input of solid particles in the system then plants were translocated to the hrcws and were acclimated using tap water for 2 months may to july 2015 during this period the plants were healthy due to i the nutrients accumulated in their rhizomes roots bulbs or tissues after fertilization in the nursery ii daily feeding with fresh water this procedure permitted diminution of the affectation of vegetation and gradual adaptation because inside the hrcws the water volume was around 94 of the reactor volume therefore stress by flooding could be produced thereupon all reactors were inoculated with a commercial inoculum biodyne 301 imported by biodyne bogotá from biodyne inc sarasota florida usa for one week in order to promote the biofilm growth the hrcws operated with intermittent gravity driven flow given that intermittent feeding provides a more oxidised treatment environment which favours both the growth of plants and the process of removal of wastewater contaminants 33 in shorter hydraulic retention time synthetic wastewater table 1 with similar composition to that used by 34 35 made up of tap water as solvent was fed by discharges of 33 3 litres every 4 h using electrovalves which were controlled by a siemens logo programmable controller meteorological data of mean maximum and minimum of air temperature tm tmax and tmin c relative humidity rhm rhmax and rhmin total solar radiation rs w m 2 d 1 and rainfall r mm were recorded every 10 min at a local meteorological station called bucaramanga neomundo this station belongs to the ideam public institution of technical and scientific support to the national environmental system in colombia and the meteorological data are available for public use the ph was used as a control parameter during this start up phase because of its effects on wetland water chemistry and biology a daily measurement was recorded inside each reactor by using a portable ph meter pce phd1 pce instruments company spain and its corresponding ph electrode 2 2 analytical procedures the system was monitored during 73 days july to october 2015 beginning with the feeding with wastewater the acclimatization phase was used as control for the experiment in order to evaluate the effect of the system i e wastewater ph etc on the vegetation the ph was measured every day inside each reactor on a half part of a piezometer 300 mm in depth inside the distribution tanks the variation of ph throughout the day was monitored only during the first week of the assessment period one measure when the wastewater was made 9 00 a m and one measure at 5 p m ph mean values for the first and second measurements were 7 84 and 7 76 respectively with coefficient of variation 0 005296 and 0 005 on average respectively this minimal daily decrease of wastewater ph 0 1 units approximately has no influence on the behaviour of wetlands when it is discharged into them thus it was not necessary to continue with the measurements after the first week the ph stability in the distribution tanks was due to the buffer effect achieved with the addition of nahco3 700 mg l 1 to the synthetic wastewater in order to compare the adaptation of each plant species a quantitative and qualitative approach on phytopathology was used which is a useful approach to quantify plant diseases using temporal analysis this approach takes into account that root radial oxygen loss rol is affected positively by photosynthesis and is correlated directly with nutrient removal in cws both rol and photosynthetic rate are indices that can be used to identity wetland plants with a higher nutrient removal capacity 36 38 photosynthesis is an important physiological activity of plants which directly reflects their growth and nutrient absorption moreover photosynthesis the most fundamental and intricate physiological process in all green plants is severely affected in all its phases by environmental stresses 39 following said approach visual detection of toxicity or disease symptoms spots necrosis blockage decay etc was carried out on days 21 44 and 73 on each branch of the plants in order to quantify the total number of diseased branches in each reactor the number of diseased branches was used to determine the disease incidence ic the disease progress curve the area under the disease progress curve audpc the relative area under the disease progress curve raudpc and the infection rate r according to 40 44 the ic corresponds to the number of individuals or quantified parts of an individual which had been affected by a disease in relation to the total quantity it was estimated using the following equation 1 i c n n 100 where n is the number of diseased branches n corresponds to the total number of branches assessed 40 the graphic of ic vs time corresponds to the disease progress curve the audpc for disease incidence is the amount of disease between two time observations it was calculated by means of 2 a u d p c i 1 n y i 1 y i 2 x i 1 x i where xi is the incidence of disease at the time i xi 1 the disease incidence recorded at the time i 1 n the number of registrations on the incidence and t the days between the registration of xi and xi 1 40 the total sum disease progress was used as the final audpc 41 the raudpc was estimated by normalizing the final audpc dividing it by the total area of the graph number of days from first appearance of disease until the end of the observation period 41 the infection rate r which reflects the plant variety resistance was determined from the monomolecular logistic or gompertz models 42 44 with the best nonlinear fitting using the method of the least squares monomolecular 3 y 1 1 y o e x p r m t logistic 4 y 1 1 e x p ln y o 1 y o r l t gompertz 5 y e x p l n y o e x p r g t where yo is the initial inoculum and rm rl rg correspond to the infection rates at the end of the experimental period mycological and bacteriological tests were carried out by the ica at its national laboratory of phytopathology diagnosis following the protocols established by the ica from 45 52 for these tests a sample of symptomatic plants sample size 32 was randomly selected in each hrcw line fungi detection according to 45 47 first stereoscopic and microscopic observations were done in order to characterize symptoms next a dissection of structures in the symptomatic tissue roots rhizome and stem was performed in a humid chamber by mean the cutting explants of plant tissue 3 to 5 mm in size in the transition zone between healthy and diseased tissue these materials were disinfected by immersion in ethanol 70 for 45 s immersed in sodium hypochlorite 2 for 45 s and washed with sterile water taking into account that surface sterilisation of diseased plant material removes saprobes and permits the bacterial or fungal pathogen to grow unimpeded when the material is planted onto culture medium 53 after disinfection the explants were dried on absorbent paper and put near the burner for 15 min after that the explants were sowed in potato dextrose agar pda medium incubated at 25 c and checked on 3 5 days after planting in order to isolate growths for that an identification of colonies was conducted and the isolated organism was seeded in culture plates pda and malt agar 2 and carnation petals traps finally the pathogen identification associated with the presented symptomatology was made from taxonomically determining morphological characters according to barnett and hunter 47 bacterial detection according to 45 48 52 the material was washed using running water under the tap and left to dry in the open air a portion of diseased plant tissue was taken and small pieces not more than 5 x 5 mm were cut from the edge of the lesions the tissues were disinfected in ethanol 70 for 30 s immediately they were transferred to a solution of 1 5 sodium hypochlorite naclo for 2 min and washed with sterile water in order to remove the excess of disinfectants then extraction of bacteria from the tissue was conducted using one of the following options a the disinfected material was placed in a small sterilized mortar and gently macerated to break the tissue and allow the bacteria to escape then a drop of the macerate was transferred with the handle b when the diseased tissue was succulent or rotted because of the disease small pieces of disinfected tissue were placed inside a tube with sterilized distilled water and stirred for 10 min to facilitate the outflow of the bacteria and obtain a slurry that slightly clouds the water in the tube one drop of the macerate or suspension was taken and spread in zigzag on the surface of the culture medium nutrient agar na to seed the bacteria incubation was made to 28 c for 48 h pure cultures of the obtained bacteria were cultivated by selecting an individual colony of the type that had grown most frequently in the planting lines on the culture medium the growth was transferred to a tube with sterilized distilled water shaken with the aid of a vortex and a drop was spread on the surface of a petri dish with na incubation was conducted under the same conditions after 48 h a representative individual colony was selected and transferred to tubes with sloping na for incubation it was assumed that each colony was originated from a bacterium and therefore corresponded to their clonal offspring for identification of ralstonia solanacerum a colony was transferred to 300 μl of beb1 extraction buffer agdia and the bacterium was detected using the kit 33 900 agdia for other bacteria bactident oxidase kit merck for the detection of cytochrome oxidase in microorganisms the gram stain method and identification based on biochemical characteristics according to schaad et al 48 were used 2 3 statistical analyses in this comparative study three treatments three kinds of plants were assigned to three mesocosms one of each in randomized way each mesocosms had two experimental units two reactors with 12 and 13 observational units respectively 25 plants in total data were recorded by means of three assessments sampling on population level during the experimental time the non parametric kruskal wallis test α 0 05 and post hoc conover iman were performed to compare and test differences between treatments with respect to the disease progress curve and the ph the pearson correlation test was performed in order to find the relationship between final incidence infection rate raudp and experimental conditions the xlstat software package was used to perform the statistical tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental and system conditions trends for meteorological variables remained stables during the test period with low variance a behaviour that characterizes climate in tropical areas its average values table 2 characterized the weather conditions the ph fig 3 trended downward in all reactors but was maintained around 6 5 by means of stabilization with nahco3 700 mg l 1 this pattern is commonly found in the start up phase of fixed film reactors because during the biofilm development acid formers grow at higher rates generating and accumulating volatile fatty acids which may shift the operating ph to acidic range 54 in all lines the ph on reactor 2 was higher than in reactor 1 p value 0 0002 0 0001 0 0001 for l1 l2 and l3 respectively because as the water moves in the hrcw line following a plug flow trend the organic matter is mainly accumulated in the first third of the hrcw length i e reactor 1 which generates a zone of more oxygen consumption and low ph levels furthermore reactor 2 was connected in series to the reactor 1 outlet so it received less organic load because as the wastewater flowed through the hrcw line the organic matter was degraded and the oxygen transfer increased in the same way that occurs in ssfcws 55 the environmental and system conditions were compared with the ideal conditions for plant development table 3 which depend on the species experimental conditions had higher rh and ph in relation to the required conditions especially for the l2 and l3 species the differences among these climatic conditions could produce stress in the plants just as calheiros et al 17 showed in their study that it is possible for plants to experience some difficulty in developing and propagating considering that the ph of the matrix particularly at the beginning of cw operation is out of the optimum range evidence of environmental stress such as burning tips fig 4 a yellowing fig 4 b and curling in leaves fig 4 c was displayed during the test period on the species in all lines although with more intensity in the species of l2 and l3 3 2 epidemiology variables fig 5 illustrates the disease trends in each reactor and line the vegetation in this study was healthy during the acclimatization period and in the first week after the fedding with wastewater started however as the test period elapsed toxicity symptoms stress and disease occurred following an upward behaviour in all lines of the test significant differences p 0 05 were established among the species with respect to ic values c alternifolius had the lowest incidence values 8 36 l1 in fig 5 while h burleana and z aethiopica presented greater incidence 38 89 99 98 l2 and l3 in fig 5 respectively final ic values in each reactor of 28 35 85 99 97 99 97 99 98 and 99 99 for l1r1 l1r2 l2r1 l2r2 l3r1 and l3r2 respectively confirmed the high susceptibility of the species in l2 and l3 the infection rate table 4 determined using the model with the best fit was low near zero for species in l1 and high near one for species in l2 and l3 therefore the disease was promoted more slowly in l1 than l2 and l3 correspondingly with ic and r the raudpc values table 4 followed the same pattern the raudpc is a variable that corresponds to the relative area under the curve of actual infection the higher its value the more susceptible the species is results showed that all species were susceptible but species in l2 and l3 had higher susceptibilities indeed in these lines all plants had died by the end of the experimental period on the contrary c alternifolius showed adaptation capacity and resilience 3 3 correlation of epidemiology variables and environmental conditions epidemiologically the plant pathogen environment interaction triangle of plant disease is the basis upon which to establish an agro ecological system favourable to plant growth and development at the population level analyzing the environmental conditions to create a favorable environment to host plant population but adverse to the spread and evolution of pathogen is the best way to achieve it 60 in this study strong positive correlations table 5 were found between raudpc and the ph and humidity differences pearson s correlation 0 871 and 0 785 respectively required for healthy growth of plants in l2 and l3 when plants were in contact with the wastewater the outside location or in open field of the experiment setup gave the opportunity for microorganisms to be transported by the air and insects towards the vegetation in hrcws as can happen in a real scale wetland system pathogenicity test results showed the colonization of fungi and bacteria in all plants species in l1 rhizoctonia sp fungi was detected in l2 erwinia sp bacteria exserohilum rostratum and pestalotia fungi were identified in l3 erwinia sp bacteria pythium sp and collectotrichum gloesporioides fungi were detected similar results were reported by burgoon et al 11 in a study comparing plant growth and wastewater treatment 21 g bod5 m 2 d 1 in microcosms 22 l using one type of substrate river gravel plastic support media tri paks 2 5 or 5 0 cm in diameter and one of four plant species typha latifolia phragmites australis scirpus pungens and sagittaria latifolia in each all species of plants were grown in the gravel substrate t latifolia was not grown in either plastic substrate s latifolia and s pungens grew poorly in the plastic substrates whereas p australis grew well in all three substrates s latifolia was very susceptible to fungus among the pathogens detected in this study the bacterium erwinia sp is classified as the most important of the primary pathogens 61 this soilborne facultative anaerobic bacterium causes maceration and rotting of parenchymatous tissue of all plant organs resulting in loss of the entire plant 62 according to wright and triggs 63 chance of infection by erwinia is greatly increased under conditions that impair host resistance and favour multiplication of the bacteria e g high temperatures 27 c reduced oxygen and water covering the surfaces root all these conditions were present in this study when the vegetation was exposed to the wastewater site location tropical environment high organic load 45 g bod5 m 2 d 1 which produces depletion of oxygen level and the decline of ph as well as the water quantity 94 v v which covered and waterlogged the root zone led to the death of all plants in l2 and l3 h burleana and z aethiopica respectively the high organic load and the water quantity are characteristics that differentiate hrcws from traditional ssfcws these two characteristics are the result of the use of artificial carriers for bacterial growth which give high surface area 320 m2 m 3 and porosity 94 to the wetland bed the bacterial communities in ssfccws develop on the surface of each particle of the support medium hence higher surface area enables more microorganism density in order to treat more quantity of organic contaminants high organic load in addition in traditional ssfcws the wastewater volume is around half of the volume as in hrcws because the porosity of their support media offers void space of 45 50 at most the use of artificial carriers allows treatment of more organic or hydraulic load in less land area diminishing the cost of the treatment and positioning the hrcws technology as an economic alternative to purify wastewater of different nature it is noteworthy that under the same environmental conditions but with the system fed with tap water the vegetation remained healthy hence the aforementioned conditions must simultaneously be present to generate diseases therefore these conditions being inherent to the hrcw design they cannot be changed meaning that the vegetation support medium relationship is not guaranteed for all types of vegetation and correct selection of vegetation is essential in this system the survivor plant species of this study was cyperus alternifolius which is a non native species that has been widely reported to be an effective phytoremediation plant in constructed wetland systems 23 studies on c alternifolius stress have shown its capability to endure different stressors on cws such as ammonia 24 pharmaceutically active compounds 23 and lack of water 25 in this study for c alternifolius the most important abiotic stressor was the high organic load which produced ph decline and low oxygen content in the start up phase nevertheless this species pertains to cyperaceae group which is acid tolerant 24 therefore it could be stated that the cause of 30 affectation final ic in this species was the colonization by rhizoctonia s p this biotic stressor did not become lethal because of the plant antioxidant activity 64 at the end of the experimental period c alternifolius replicated its branch numbers and grew in height it was totally adapted to artificial carriers and hrcw conditions the hrcw system has been designed to function in strong conditions high hydraulic or high organic loads which may disturb plant development in this study three types of aquatic plants commonly used in cws especially in tropical weather were tested one of them heliconia burleana was native to santander colombia it was expected that this species would be more adaptable according to the recommendation of some researchers who advise use of indigenous plant species in order to prevent undesired impacts 18 65 however this species did not adapt highlighting the importance of studies on plant adaptation to system conditions in order to guarantee the cw performance vegetation adaptation studies in cws generally use the contaminant removal efficiency to select plants 15 17 65 but in this study an analogue method of selection was used based on the vegetation health this methodology is based on the interaction of plant communities with their respective pathogens in a specified environment epidemic triangle at the population level the disease is quantified as part of the pathogenic process that expresses through the symptoms the interaction degree of the epidemic triangle and permits stablish the vegetation adaptation capacity by means of the phytopathological indicators incidence index and raudpc from this study it can be established that a final incidence index up to 30 could be used in plants selection procedures in the start up phase of hrcw and cws in order to guarantee plant survival and adaptation to different kinds of wastewater 4 conclusions this study is part of ongoing research aiming to establish the use of artificial carriers for biofilm growth inside of constructed wetlands specifically the adaptation of vegetation to this new variant of wetlands was analyzed from an analysis based on phytopathological indicators the strong conditions generated by this new support medium are a major factor in wetland ecosystem and can significantly alter the initial growth and physiological performance of the plants grown in them this is especially important because vegetation plays a core role in contaminant removal processes vegetative stress can occur in the presence of a biotic an abiotic stressor or in the presence of both therefore it is necessary to evaluate all factors that can influence the state of the vegetation as closely as possible to the operating conditions of the system in terms of the application of hrcw technology it is essential to carry out a phase of plant selection based on local climate conditions in order to avoid their affectation epidemiological analysis could be used as a tool for adequate plant selection before their use in treating a specific wastewater in constructed wetlands in a low cost and user friendly way under weather conditions of dry tropical forest and premontane sub humid it has been established that cyperus alternifolius is one vegetation species suitable for artificial high rate wetlands further research is recommended to establish whether only acid tolerant plant species are adequate for use in this variant of cws
