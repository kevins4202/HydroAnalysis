4120,hydrological observations in angola are quite scarce and as such the water allocation process one of the main components of water resources management is commonly undertaken with a high degree of uncertainty it is therefore vital to increase our understanding of the hydrological processes namely the frequency distribution of daily streamflow in this part of southern africa and validate efficient methods that facilitate the extrapolation of information from gauged to ungauged catchments all the components of this study were carefully designed to address all the above mentioned goals this was achieved with the modelling of 121 flow duration curve samples observed in different parts of the country including large datasets e g 1954 55 to 1968 69 but mainly focused on the hydrological years of 1967 1968 and 1973 1974 and the implementation of regional frequency analysis based on the l moments approach the frequency distribution of daily streamflow was approximated with nine different probability distribution functions considering different subsets of the daily streamflow time series i daily streamflow ii different subsets of daily streamflow divided into two flows seasons wet and dry iii and the previous subsets transformed with the definition of a thirty day time lag thereby reducing the serial dependency of daily streamflow and enabling the use of the l moments approach overall the results enabled two probability distribution functions to be identified able to provide a remarkable approximation to all the above mentioned daily streamflow datasets the four parameter kappa and three parameter generalized pareto distributions furthermore the regional frequency analysis supported the prediction of daily streamflow quantiles for eight test catchments with impressive accuracy nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient μ 0 86 σ 0 10 pearson correlation coefficient μ 0 97 σ 0 02 clearly showing that this approach represents a sound alternative for the prediction of daily streamflow in ungauged catchments located in this region keywords daily streamflow frequency distribution ungauged catchment l moments 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is a graphic illustration of the relationship between the exceedance probability of streamflow and its magnitude vogel and fennessey 1994 fdcs are used to describe hydrologic regimes and are therefore crucial for water resources management planning and analysis vogel and fennessey 1995 archfield and vogel 2010 blöschl et al 2013 historically fdcs have been used for water allocation mcmahon 1993 water quality assessments vogel and fennessey 1995 river sedimentation studies torizzo and pitlick 2004 flood control and hydropower design schemes warnick 1984 vogel and fennessey 1995 in regions where water is scarce and climate change is affecting the lives and livelihoods of people it is vital to quantify the annual and seasonal streamflow variability nevertheless most of the watercourses in the world are ungauged sivapalan et al 2003 mishra and coulibaly 2009 hrachowitz et al 2013 especially those located in developing countries kanishka and eldho 2020 this is a limitation that can be difficult to overcome even with the combination of conventional monitoring methods and state of the art technology like remote sensing the accuracy of remote sensing methods for flow prediction in data scarce regions depends on the reliability of ground information such as the river bathymetry rating curves samboko et al 2020 and rainfall brocca et al 2020 which can still be difficult to obtain for remote regions therefore it is still common to rely on classical methods to estimate fdcs in ungauged catchments as described by blöschl et al 2013 these methods can be divided into two general groups statistical and process based methods the first group includes regression index flow and geostatistical methods e g nathan and mcmahon 1992 vandewiele and elias 1995 smakhtin et al 1997 bocchiola et al 2010 li et al 2010 viola et al 2011 yilmaz and onoz 2020 while the second comprises derived distribution methods and continuous models e g sefton and howartm 1998 jin et al 2009 li et al 2009 reichl et al 2009 love et al 2011 kanishka and eldho 2020 due to their relative simplicity the empirical methods included in the first group are a common choice for predicting fdcs at ungauged sites blöschl et al 2013 some of these methods comprise two steps the definition of the fdc shape through the estimation of statistical parameters and the correlation of shape parameters with the catchment characteristics booker and snelder 2012 regardless of the chosen method the identification of an acceptable probability distribution of daily streamflow is especially relevant for the process of fdcs generalization in the literature there are some examples of attempts to approximate the frequency distribution of daily streamflow using probability distribution functions pdf blum et al 2017 concluded that kappa distribution kap is a good alternative for modelling daily streamflow across the conterminous united states us while the three parameter generalized pareto gpa and lognormal distributions ln can also be applied in some us regions kap and gpa distributions were also acceptable solutions to approximate fdcs in the northeastern us vogel and fennessey 1993 fennessey 1994 leboutillier and waylen 1993 applied a two component ln distribution to daily streamflow at 182 stations located in canada and concluded that it was reasonably adept at representing the frequency distribution of fdc high and low discharge ends in southern australia li et al 2010 while defining a new regionalization approach successfully applied the three parameter ln distribution to daily streamflow despite the proven effectiveness of these models certain challenges exist that need to be overcome it is worth mentioning that the fitted distributions parameter sets can sometimes result in the prediction of negative flows this happens because the values of these parameters generate theoretical lower bounds that are less than zero archfield 2009 blum et al 2017 therefore to avoid negative flows it is a common practice to constrain the pdf lower bound to zero blum et al 2017 svensson et al 2017 this approach will typically result in a model which gives values that are arbitrarily close to zero and with a specified functional form for the distribution of near zero values hence the formation of the upper tail can be affected as mentioned by klemeš 2000 the shape of the upper tail is determined by the physical regime prevailing in the formation of the lower tail it is unusual for these conditions to be satisfied in practice when considering perennial rivers therefore for some flow regimes the option to impose a lower bound of zero can be detrimental to the fitting accuracy it is also important to mention the stochastic nature of daily streamflow that includes serial dependency and seasonality hurst 1951 montanari et al 1997 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 daily streamflows are not independent and identically distributed i i d therefore the complex nature of these datasets should in theory be explained by a mixture of fdcs of monthly or seasonal subsets to overcome this condition bowers et al 2012 divided the hydrological year of nine rivers across the us into three seasons wet dry and transitional and then applied different distributions to the different regimes the results show that the power law and ln distributions fit each of the seasons reasonably well and that the statistical properties of each season vary significantly across all rivers this variability highlights the complexity of the physical process that regulates daily streamflow despite the substantial heterogeneity of the different river flow regimes displayed by observations and modeling efforts it is well established that simple models with a small number of parameters can have a significantly explanatory power regarding catchment responses sivapalan et al 2003 this has driven the attempts to identify homogeneous regions considering a reduced number of explanatory variables to improve the global understanding of river flow regimes coopersmith et al 2012 and to predict runoff in ungauged catchments the well established l moments regional frequency analysis based on the l moments approach hosking and wallis 1997 which is commonly used for extreme value analysis such as flood frequency estimates for ungauged catchments e g nyeko ogiramoi et al 2012 drissia et al 2019 lee and kim 2019 cassalho et al 2019 is not usually applied to daily streamflow datasets this is an obvious consequence of the important serial stochastic structure of daily streamflow e g autocorrelation and seasonality which prevents the use of l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures nonetheless if both serial dependence and seasonality are reduced the l moments approach can in theory be applied to daily streamflow datasets the validation of this approach is the second of the two primary motives for the development of this research the first being to contribute to the characterization of the daily streamflow frequency distribution in this part of southern africa therefore the main objective of this paper is to answer the following questions i can an existing probability distribution approximate the frequency distribution of 120 fdcs observed in perennial rivers across angola based on the full year wet and dry season datasets ii is it possible to identify physiographic and climate regions where the performance of the probability distributions is most successful iii how does the variability of the samples l moments ratio change in relation to the different daily streamflow datasets full year wet and dry season iv is it possible to relate fdc characteristics with probability distribution performance v can regional frequency analysis based on the l moments approach serve as a sound alternative to predicting daily streamflow in ungauged catchments if daily streamflow autocorrelation and seasonality are reduced to that end probability distributions were systematically fitted to i daily streamflow ii different subsets of daily streamflow divided into two flows seasons wet and dry iii the previous subsets transformed with the definition of a thirty day time lag additionally the possibility of defining homogeneous regions where a single distribution can be used to predict daily streamflow in ungauged sites with the l moments method was explored the regional l moments approach was validated by predicting daily streamflow quantiles for eight test catchments the results of this study will hopefully not only prove useful from a practical perspective in terms of characterizing the region s water resources but also help to increase the ability to estimate streamflow at ungauged sites the definition of theories with a higher range of applicability relies on our understanding of the massive spatial temporal heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties fdcs encapsulate this information and as such it is important to gain a deeper knowledge regarding their characteristics across different latitudes 2 angola hydrometric monitoring network the republic of angola is located on the southwest coast of africa between 4 22 and 18 02 south latitude and 11 41 and 24 05 east longitude and is the fifth largest african country with an area of 1 246 700 km2 fig 1 it is bounded by the forest ecosystem of the republic of congo and the democratic republic of congo drc in the north by the arid woodlands and desert of namibia in the south by the moist savanna and the woodland ecosystem of the drc and zambia in the east and by the atlantic ocean in the west huntley et al 2019 angola s climate is primarily controlled by the annual migration of the congo air boundary low pressure across the mainland and by the south atlantic cyclonic gyre dupont et al 2008 the northern eastern and central regions have a humid tropical climate aridity index 0 65 with a rainy season running from october to april pombo et al 2015 along the coast the climate varies from dry tropical aridity index 0 50 0 65 near luanda to arid aridity index 0 03 0 2 and hyper arid aridity index 0 03 in the namib desert the precipitation decreases towards the south and southwest where the climate is dry tropical aridity index 0 50 0 65 and semi arid aridity index 0 20 0 50 the interior plateau regions where the altitude is 800 m and annual precipitation reaches values above 800 mm are drained by nine large catchments seven of which are shared with neighboring countries the coastal region below 100 m where precipitation is generally 500 mm with the exception of the namibe region which can attain annual precipitation values of 50 mm is where coastal rivers that drain the central and western highlands have penetrated the steep escarpment of the atlantic ocean pombo et al 2017 the national hydrometric network with records from 1951 1952 up to the present day was practically dismantled during the civil war period 1974 2002 despite the efforts made by the entities that manage the sector the national hydrometric network consisting of approximately 288 stations had 58 active stations in 2017 of which 38 began operating that same year it is therefore still necessary to refer to historical records that are mainly focused on the hydrological years of 1967 1968 and 1973 1974 nonetheless the datasets for some catchments cover a longer period bengo 1954 55 to 1968 69 catumbela 1961 62 to 1971 72 kwanza 1963 64 to 1973 74 cubal da hanha 1966 67 to 1979 80 cubango 1964 65 to 1973 74 cunene 1961 62 to 1973 74 m bridge 1966 67 to 1979 80 and zaire 1964 65 to 1977 78 fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the 121 stations considered in this study the records for which were provided by the angola national water institute of these approximately 41 are located in the interior plateau suggesting that the network was not optimized to reflect the geophysical complexity of the landscape the mean catchment area of these stations 4 684 km2 ranges from 178 km2 to 112 027 km2 and the daily streamflow time series length from 365 to 5 475 days μ 2190 days 3 methodology in this study the daily streamflow discharge records of 63 rivers observed at 121 stations fig 1 were analyzed the overall methodological approach is schematically represented in fig 2 as an initial approach the full year daily streamflow dataset was evaluated nevertheless considering the important serial stochastic structure of daily streamflow including issues such as serial dependence and seasonality the analysis was extended to different subsets of the daily streamflow therefore as a complementary assessment the initial full year dataset of daily streamflow was divided into a dry season that runs from may to september and a wet season comprising the remaining period lars 2004 pombo et al 2015 three more datasets were also defined in which a 30 day time lag fig 2 was imposed to the full year and seasonal streamflow data at this point the fdcs describing the six datasets full year dataset wet and dry season datasets full year dataset with a 30 day time lag wet and dry season datasets with a 30 day time lag were approximated by nine probability distribution functions 2 param exponential exp 2 param gumbel gum 3 param generalized extreme value gev 3 param generalized logistic glo 3 param generalized pareto gpa 3 param log normal ln 3 param pearson type iii pe3 4 param kappa kap and 5 param wakeby wak these were the chosen candidate probability distributions because they have already been considered for the approximation of daily streamflow in previous studies e g blum et al 2017 vogel and fennessey 1993 fennessey 1994 li et al 2020 and because the equations needed to estimate the l moments distributions were available in hosking s study 1990 all the above mentioned distributions were developed to model extreme datasets but are nevertheless able to approximate the shape of a full daily streamflow fdc reasonably well for an extensive description of each pdf refer to the appendix in the book regional frequency analysis hosking and wallis 1997 the parameters of each sample were estimated with the l moments approach defined by hosking 1990 and the fdc obtained for each site with the pdfs was compared to the corresponding empirical fdc fig 2 the goodness of fit was evaluated with the log nash sutcliffe efficiency measure lnse and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks fig 2 for the application of the ks test the datasets must be i i d therefore this test was only applied to the datasets with a 30 day time lag additionally the analysis of l moment ratio diagrams provided a complementary initial assessment to the identification of the candidate pdfs the remainder of the study concerned only the pdfs identified in the initial screening process and the datasets with a 30 day time lag full year wet and dry season datasets as mentioned previously some of the pdf parameters sets returned negative flows a limitation than can be addressed with the definition of a lower bound of zero nevertheless in light of the comments regarding this issue outlined in the introduction a different approach was considered the negative values were replaced by a value very close to zero 0 01 as a solution that enabled the fitting assessment with the lnse while penalizing the pdfs that predict negative flow values one of the main purposes of identifying a suitable pdf to describe the frequency distribution of river daily streamflow discharge record is the generalization of the fdc to ungauged catchments therefore homogenous regions were defined considering the well established regional frequency analysis approach based on l moment hosking and wallis 1997 following the approach defined by hosking and wallis 1997 the 121 sites were divided into clusters to form regions for the regional frequency analysis fig 2 after the formation of regions a discordance measure fig 2 was applied to the streamflow datasets and the heterogeneity measures h and the zdist goodness of fit measure were estimated regarding the gev glo gpa and pe3 distributions fig 2 this last process was repeated following the removal of several sites from the dataset additionally after the definition of homogenous regions 90 error bounds were estimated for each regional growth curve considering the algorithm for simulation of the regional l moments hosking and wallis 1997 fig 2 eight test sites were used to test the robustness of the regionalization process these sites were initially included in a different cluster however the fact that they are located close to one homogenous region makes them suitable for the analysis the index flood at each test site was obtained from a regression between the catchment area km2 and the index flood values previously estimated for the sites located in the homogenous region finally the log nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient lnse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the pearson correlation coefficient r and the relative root mean square error rrmse fig 2 were used to evaluate the similarities between the estimated and observed flow quantiles 3 1 daily streamflow time lag definition the serial dependence of daily streamflow data must be understood and reduced in order to make effective use of test statistics such as ks or the l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures in the simplest cases using data for every kth day represents a possible a solution provided that the serial dependence in streamflow has become negligible at a lag of k days in more complex cases it is necessary to build a time series model of daily streamflow and analyze the patterns of serial dependence implied by the model in this study the serial dependence reduction was evaluated by estimating the value of r between the observed series and its shifted self considering different time gaps 5 10 40 the value of r corresponding to a weak correlation 0 4 was considered as a benchmark for the identification of a suitable lag value to impose to the streamflow data series 3 2 empirical fdc when carrying out the frequency analysis of a sample specifically when it comes to identifying the statistical distributions that can be applied to that sample it is common to resort to visual adjustment based on the graphical representation of the sample points and the theoretical laws chosen to represent this sample therefore each point in the sample needs to be assigned an empirical probability of non exceedance f plotting position vogel and fennessey 1994 in this study the empirical fdc of daily streamflow was represented using the weibull plotting position eq 1 as it conceptualizes an unbiased estimate of the empirical distribution function regardless of the underlying probability distribution vogel and fennessey 1994 1 f i n 1 where n is the number of observations 3 3 goodness of fit measures 3 3 1 log nash sutcliffe efficiency lnse the nse was proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 as a normalized statistic that evaluates the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed data this statistic recommended for hydrograph modelling by asce 1993 legates and mccabe 1999 and moriasi et al 2007 is very commonly used by hydrologists and as such comparable performance results are not difficult to find in similar studies the nse coefficient ranges from minus infinity to one with one being the optimal value in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if the coefficient ranges from zero to one if nse is 0 then the observed mean value is a better predictor than the simulated value which suggests an unacceptable performance additionally in this study we have applied a log transformation on flows to put greater emphasis on the lower end of the fdcs oudin et al 2006 eq 2 it is important to mention that the lnse coefficient also ranges from minus infinity to one 2 lnse 1 i 1 n l o g y i obs l o g y i sim 2 i 1 n l o g y i obs l o g y i mean 2 where y i obs is the observation value y i sim is the simulated value y i mean is the mean of observed data and n is the number of observations model performance ratings are model and project specific e g moriasi et al 2007 therefore a visual comparison of observed versus simulated values was used for the definition of suitable performance ratings the fdcs obtained for sites where the distributions exhibit a similar performance as described by the lnse values were grouped and plotted against the observed fdcs then the performance of the distributions was evaluated across the different ratings namely the tails fitting 3 3 2 kolmogorov smirnov test ks the ks statistic is commonly used to test whether a set of observed data comes from a hypothesized continuous distribution lilliefors 1967 this test is less sensitive to deviations in the tails of the distributions mason and schuenemeyer 1983 nevertheless it is a good alternative to the chi square test for any sample size lilliefors 1967 and a good complement to the lnse statistic the ks test is defined by 3 d max 1 i n f y i i 1 n i n f y i where f is the cumulative distribution being tested if the parameters of a distribution are estimated from the sample then the ks test using the commonly tabulated critical points no longer applies crutcher 1975 to overcome this limitation the ks test critical points were derived for each of the pdfs this was achieved with a monte carlo simulation of 10 000 samples generated from the pdf population for each streamgage the length of the samples is the same as the streamflow time series the samples were approximated with the pdf and the corresponding value of the critical point corresponding to the quantile 1 significance level α was computed α 0 05 3 3 3 goodness of fit measure zdist the suitability of each theorical distribution was evaluated using the z statistic suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 eq 4 4 zdist τ 4 d i s t τ 4 r b 4 σ 4 where τ 4 d i s t is the l skewness of the distribution τ 4 r is the l kurtosis weighted proportional to the sites recorded length b 4 and σ 4 are the bias and the standard deviation of τ 4 r respectively all distributions for which z 1 64 were considered as acceptable candidates considering a 90 confidence interval 3 3 4 pearson correlation coefficient r the strength of the correlation between observed daily streamflow and its shifted self was assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient r eq 5 5 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 4 l moments the l moments defined by hosking 1990 are linear functions of probability weighted moments pwm vide greenwood et al 1979 that like conventional moments quantify the location dispersion and shape of a data sample nevertheless unlike conventional moments the moment estimators are unbiased do not depend on the sample size hosking 1990 and are less sensitive to outlier values vogel and fennessey 1993 thus the identification of suitable distributions is more easily achieved by using l moments especially if the distributions exhibit extraordinary skewness such as daily streamflow vide hosking 1990 vogel and fennessey 1993 the first four l moments are as follows 6 λ 1 β 0 7 λ 2 2 β 1 β 0 8 λ 3 6 β 2 2 β 1 β 0 9 λ 4 2 0 β 3 3 0 β 2 1 2 β 1 β 0 where βo β1 β2 and β3 are the first four pwms analogous to the conventional moments hosking 1990 defines the l moments ratios 10 τ 2 λ 2 λ 1 l c o e f f i c i e n t o f var i a t i o n 11 τ 3 λ 3 λ 2 l s k e w n e s s 12 τ 4 λ 4 λ 2 l kurtosis additionally hosking 1990 introduced the l moment ratio diagrams a graphical plot of theorical τ 3 and τ 4 values for a range of selected distributions against sample estimates of the same variables these graphs are very useful for identifying an acceptable approximation to the distribution of a hydrological variable vogel and fennessey 1993 3 5 regional frequency analysis rfa hosking 1990 defines the following steps for implementing the regional frequency analysis rfa 1 formation of regions 2 implement discordancy and heterogeneity tests 3 choice of distribution with the zdist goodness of fit statistic 4 quantile estimate and accuracy 3 5 1 formation of regions the initial formation of regions was achieved with a cluster analysis considering the ward s method ward 1963 and the standardization of the following site characteristics latitude longitude log catchment area log mean total annual precipitation coba 2016 fig 9 square root mean catchment elevation log catchment length log catchment slope log catchment aridity index zomer et al 2008 fig 7b log catchment evapotranspiration coba 2016 and log catchment runoff coefficient fig 7a the mean catchment runoff coefficient of each catchment was estimated from the potential runoff coefficient table incorporated in the wetspa water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere extension model liu and de smedt 2004 which incorporates different land use and land cover types fao 2014 slope and soil texture classes fao 2003 3 5 2 discordancy di and heterogeneity h tests initially the discordancy test hosking and wallis 1997 was used to evaluate the suitability of the flow time series this test enabled the identification of data irregularities e g outliers trends the sites with values of di 3 were analyzed for correction of errors or deleted after the initial screening the inter site heterogeneity was evaluated with the following equation hosking and wallis 1997 13 h v μ v σ v where v is the weighted standard deviation of the at site sample lcv and σv and μv are the standard deviation and the mean estimated from simulated region lcv the four parameter kappa distribution fitted to the regional weighted average l moment ratio enabled the regional simulation the regions were declared acceptably homogeneous if h 1 possibly heterogeneous if 1 h 2 and definitely heterogeneous if h 2 hosking and wallis 1997 3 5 3 quantile estimate and accuracy the flow quantiles of each site were estimated with the index flood procedure dalrymple 1960 this approach considered that if the sites form a homogeneous region then the frequency distributions of all sites are equal except for a site specific scaling factor this assumption can be described by the following equation 14 q i f μ i q f where q i f is the quantile function μ i is the index flood and q f is the growth factor the value of μ i is estimated from the sample mean of the data observed at each site and q f is estimated from the fitted pdf hosking and wallis 1997 define the accuracy of the flow quantiles as a regional average of the rrmse eq 15 between the flow quantiles estimated for the actual and the simulated region the monte carlo simulation of a region with the same number of sites record length and regional average l moments enables the definition of quantile error bounds 15 rrmse 1 m m 1 m q i m f q i f q i f 2 where m is the total number of repetitions q i m is the estimated growth curve at site i and the mth repetition and q i f is the real growth curve at site i the regional growth curves for homogeneous regions are all equal therefore the index of q i m and q i f can be removed hence hosking and wallis 1997 define 90 error bounds for the estimated growth curve with the eq 16 where l 05 f and u 05 f are some values defining the 5 limit for the ratio q f q f 16 q f u 05 f q f q f l 05 f additionally the normalized standard deviation σn eq 17 was used to evaluate the variation of the daily streamflow datasets 17 σ n 1 n 1 i 1 n x i μ 2 μ where x i is the observation value μ is the mean of observed data 3 6 software the pdf fitting and the rfa were computed using the lmom hosking 2019a and lmomrfa hosking 2019b r packages respectively whereas the monte carlo simulation of the ks critical values was performed with a python code specifically developed for this purpose 4 results 4 1 daily streamflow time lag definition from a theoretical point of view both dependence and non identical distributions increase the sampling variability of l moments in the l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures the simulations that estimate this sampling variability assume i i d data and therefore underestimate the sampling variability fig 3 a shows an example of the evolution of h and z statistics after treating the set of 121 sites as a single region with different subsets of daily streamflow and considering the pe3 and gpa distributions the estimated sampling variability contributes to the denominator of the measures so the measures end up with very large values fig 3a significantly beyond a time lag of 15 days the variation of the h zpe3 and zgpa values is much smaller suggesting that this is a transition point for the flow regime fig 3a in fact several authors have concluded that river flow fluctuations exhibit two different regimes one over short time scales and the other over long time scales e g tessier et al 1996 hirpa et al 2010 fig 3b 3c and 3d illustrate the pearson correlation coefficient r obtained for each streamgage after the definition of a time lag of 5 and 30 days to the full year dataset observed and to the wet and dry season datasets observed following the conversion of the daily streamflow datasets the results obtained show that with a lag of 30 days the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the r statistic obtained for the full year dataset was reduced to 0 60 and 0 15 respectively fig 3b a value that still indicates the existence of a moderate correlation fig 3c and 3d illustrate the results obtained for the wet and dry seasons with a lag of 30 days the mean r values obtained for the wet and dry seasons 0 36 σ 0 20 and 0 30 σ 0 22 indicate that the serial dependence of the daily streamflow was considerably reduced the increase in the time gap beyond 30 days would further reduce the value of r nonetheless the mean datasets record length has already been reduced 30 times table 1 and six sites were excluded from the analysis from this point forward a considerable number of sites would be excluded from the analyses therefore the time gap of 30 days was accepted as the final reference value 4 2 initial screening of candidate distributions l moment ratio diagrams fig 4 shows the l moments diagrams obtained for different datasets of daily streamflow of all distributions considered the gpa and kap distributions provide the best approximation to the observed daily streamflow regardless of the dataset considered nevertheless the graphical analysis of the l moments also suggests that the pe3 model can in some cases be the candidate distribution generally considering only the two and three parameter distributions the sample estimates of τ3 and τ4 are located in the area that is crossed by the gpa and pe3 theorical l moments fig 4 it is also relevant to mention that the variability of the sample estimates of τ3 and τ4 increased significantly from the full year dataset fig 4a to the wet and dry season datasets fig 4b and 4c and even more when considering the same datasets with a 30 day lag fig 4d 4e and 4f it is important to mention that the full year sample will always have the effect of a larger sample reducing the variability of its sample l moments as such the full year dataset shows less complexity than those associated with its isolated parts wet and dry seasons l moments estimates are not affected by the sample size if the samples are from the same distribution vogel and fennessey 1993 hosking and wallis 1997 therefore this variability increment is clearly illustrating the complexity of daily streamflow frequency distribution namely the mixing effect of different distributions over the sample l moments 4 3 goodness of fit assessment the results obtained with the lnse statistic closely correlate with the l moments diagrams analysis regardless of the dataset the best approximation to daily streamflow considering the lnse mean value across all datasets was obtained with the kap distribution μ 0 988 closely followed by the wak μ 0 986 gpa μ 0 982 and pe3 μ 0 977 distributions fig 5 of all distributions gum gev glo and ln results were significantly affected by the prediction of negative flows considering the full year fig 5a and seasonal datasets fig 5b and 5c the mean number of sites with predicted negative flows reached 78 4 63 3 and 66 1 for gum gev and glo distributions respectively conversely a much smaller number of sites in the remaining distributions were affected by this constraint exp 3 8 gpa 7 1 ln 0 0 pe3 23 3 kap 6 2 wak 15 6 as the lnse statistic is highly sensitive to small differences at the lower end of the fdcs distributions performance was significantly affected by the prediction of negative flows fig 5a 5b and 5c this is the reason why the gpa kap and pe3 results include at least one site with an lnse value of 0 2 fig 5b not surprisingly the sample size reduction imposed on the full year and seasonal datasets with a 30 day lag fig 5d 5e and 5f significantly improved the results obtained for these datasets when compared with the full year and seasonal datasets additionally it is relevant to mention that the exp and wak distributions could not be fitted at approximately half of the sites this limitation of the wak distribution was also acknowledged by both archfield 2009 and blum et al 2017 for the us the wak distribution is flexible but there are some shapes that it does not model particularly distributions with strong u shaped probability densities therefore regardless of the performance these two distributions were removed for further consideration with the aim of improving the analysis the lnse values obtained for the best models kap gpa and pe3 and for each site were classified according to a predefined criterion and plotted against the conterminous angola the criterion was defined through the visual assessment of the fdcs fitting poor fit lnse 0 94 median fit 0 94 lnse 0 99 good fit 0 99 while fitting pdfs to daily streamflow blum et al 2017 defined a similar classification observed in nearly 400 unregulated perennial streams in the us which varied only at the lower end of the range poor fit 0 93 fig 6 shows the classification results obtained with the gpa pe3 and kap distributions considering the lnse value obtained for each site and for the full year wet and dry season datasets all with a 30 day lag generally while considering the number of sites included in the good fit classification range the results follow the pattern of the σn values obtained for each dataset which means that less variation implies a better fit in more sites the mean value of σn obtained for the full year fig 6a 6b and 6c wet fig 6d 6e and 6f and dry season fig 6g 6h and 6i datasets was 1 48 max 4 63 min 0 70 1 61 max 5 46 min 0 81 and 2 45 max 11 44 min 1 05 respectively hence the model s performance decreased from the full year fig 6a 6b and 6c to the dry season datasets results fig 6g 6h and 6i the only exception were the results obtained with the pe3 distribution since the distribution predicted negative flows at 21 of the sites regarding the wet season modeling the performance of this distribution was better for the dry season overall the number of sites excluded due to the ks test was very small with the mean value across all data series reaching 4 1 2 5 and 1 9 regarding the kap gpa and the pe3 approximation to the daily streamflow fdcs respectively it is also relevant to mention that 16 3 of the sites randomly distributed in the study area exhibited infeasible kap parameters across the three datasets thus the initial number of sites 121 was reduced to 108 100 and 96 considering the full year and the wet and dry seasons respectively as expected the additional parameter of the kap distribution considerably increased the accuracy of the results the kap distribution performance was impressive with the mean number of good fits reaching 29 1 across all datasets and only 3 8 of the sites included in the poor fit range the gpa distribution performed well with 16 8 of the sites classified as good fits nevertheless because of the prediction of negative flows 10 of the sites during the wet season dataset simulation 15 2 of the sites datasets had lnse values of 0 94 this was also the main reason why the pe3 distribution accuracy was inferior to the results obtained from the other two distributions in fact 10 and 21 of the simulations of the full year and wet season datasets respectively resulted in the prediction of negative flows which increased the number of sites classified as poor fits to a mean value of 22 5 due to this limitation the mean value of good fits obtained with the pe3 distribution across all datasets was only 9 9 the majority of the poor fits obtained with the three distributions are generally related to the prediction of negative flows the occurrence of subzero quantiles in the fdc predicted by a pdf that is not bounded below zero is primarily determined by the specified functional form of the predicted fdc nevertheless the shape of observed fdcs also has an obvious role in this limitation and it would therefore be quite relevant to evaluate whether there is a link between the sites with poor fits and the climate and catchment characteristics this was achieved with the analysis of figs 7 and 8 which show the spatial distribution of the land cover versus the estimated runoff coefficient fig 7a the aridity index versus the cluster analysis output fig 7b the mean fdc normalized min max of each cluster considering the wet fig 8a and dry fig 8b seasons datasets with a 30 day lag and the mean fdc normalized by the mean daily streamflow regarding each cluster considering the wet fig 8c and dry fig 8d seasons datasets with a 30 day lag in general terms from the analysis of these figures we have concluded that the runoff coefficients previously aggregated into different classes low mean high form three very defined regions it is relevant to mention that the mean estimated runoff coefficient regarding the 121 catchments 0 17 σ 0 05 max 0 26 min 0 06 closely correlates with the results obtained for angola by pombo 2016 furthermore a good correlation was observed r 0 993 between the estimated values of full year daily streamflow considering the runoff coefficients and the mean annual precipitation and the observed daily streamflow almost all sites included in the high and mean classes can be found in the west central humid ai 0 65 region angolan miombo woodlands where the soils are mostly well drained ferrasols and luvisols 55 of the sites included in the median class are located in the kwanza river catchment the largest river catchment in western angola which drains a large portion of the central plateau significantly 70 of the sites included in the high class are located within or near the dry sub humid and semi arid regions while the remaining 30 are mostly located in the central plateau region close to the kwanza river catchment in general terms the results suggested that the difference between the two classes of runoff coefficients are influenced by land cover and catchment area the sites included in the high class are located in regions with less dense tree cover and catchments on average three times smaller than the catchments of the sites include in the mean class fig 7a some authors have observed a decrease in the runoff coefficient with the increase in the catchment area e g joel et al 2002 cerdan et al 2004 unsurprisingly the sites included in the low class are mostly located in the southern semi arid region where soils are mainly composed of arenosols ferrasols and luvisols at this point the results suggest that the distribution of the runoff coefficients is not linked with the locations of sites with poor fits therefore an additional effort was made through the analysis of the spatial distribution of the regions formed by the different cluster groups the cluster analysis enabled the identification of nine different regions fig 7b depicting the aggregated contribution of the catchments climatic and physiographic characteristics a closer look at fig 6d and 6e regarding the gpa and the pe3 results for the wet season and fig 7b reveals that the sites with poor fits are mostly located within clusters 2 and 4 significantly the mean fdc normalized by the maximum and minimum values obtained for these clusters and for the wet season fig 8a has a less pronounced curvature than the fdc obtained for regions 6 7 8 and 9 this difference is due to the dominance of fast flow surface runoff processes in the catchments included in regions 6 7 8 and 9 when compared with the remaining regions the slope of the middle part of the fdcs which is related to the variance of daily streamflow and controlled by sub surface runoffs yokoo and sivapalan 2011 is similar fig 8a and 8c nevertheless the upper part of the fdcs which reflects the fast flow surface runoff yokoo and sivapalan 2011 is quite different fig 8b indicating that the catchments included in regions 1 2 3 4 and 5 have a slower response to near surface processes than the catchments included in the remaining clusters this fact is illustrated by the gentler curve in the upper part of the fdcs consequently the wet season datasets of daily streamflow which comprise regions 2 and 4 have a lower standard deviation and the fdcs are relatively linear fig 8c a distinctive feature that correlates with the locations of sites with poor fits conversely during the dry season the normalized fdcs are similar across all clusters fig 8b and are comparable with the fdcs for clusters 1 2 3 4 and 5 namely in the upper part of the fdcs however the curves show a dip at the lower tail that is typical of catchments in arid climates due to increased evapotranspiration from saturated surfaces yokoo and sivapalan 2011 this is a characteristic that combined with the relatively lower flows of the dry season was not influential in the prediction of negative flows 4 4 regional homogeneity evaluation 4 4 1 defining homogeneous regions the l moments methodology is not typically used in the definition of homogeneous regions regarding the frequency distributions of daily streamflow this is because in the l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures the simulations that estimate this sampling variability assume i i d data and therefore underestimate the sampling variability in this study however the reduction of the daily streamflow serial dependency presented an opportunity to evaluate the performance of the l moments method while improving the research results after forming the regions which resulted in the definition of nine clusters fig 7b the initial discordancy test screening allowed for the list of sites being studied to be further reduced this part of the process resulted in the removal of some sites from the initial clusters vide table 2 and the division of cluster 2 into three smaller clusters 2a 2b and 2c then l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures were applied to the wet and dry season datasets with a lag of 30 days table 2 shows the results obtained for each cluster namely the candidate distributions from which the distributions with the lower value of z were selected and considered for the definition of homogeneous regions table 3 the gpa and pe3 distributions were identified as candidate distributions in 68 of the regions reinforcing their potential to approximate daily streamflow the analysis of the values obtained for h facilitated the identification of two and six acceptable regions respectively for the wet season cluster 2b and 5 and dry season cluster 2a 2b 2c 3 5 and 6 datasets fig 9 except for cluster1 which can be classified as possibly heterogeneous regarding the dry season dataset all the remaining clusters are heterogenous the spatial distribution of the homogeneous regions was plotted against the total annual precipitation map for angola clearly showing that most of these areas are located within a single precipitation range 1200 mm to 1400 mm cluster 6 situated near the coast is the only homogeneous region located in an annual precipitation range 600 mm in the dry sub humid zone 4 4 2 quantile estimate and accuracy following the definition of the homogeneous regions the magnitude of the results uncertainty was evaluated through the definition of confidence intervals this was achieved using a monte carlo simulation 500 replications of artificial regions with the kappa distribution each one of these artificial regions share the following statistics with the actual regions number of sites record length site means the mean l cv value is equal to the regional average l cv and varies linearly across sites l skewness is the same at each site and is equal to the regional average l skewness fig 10 shows the regional growth curves with upper and lower error bounds estimated by eq 16 as expected results show that the widths of the error bounds for a 1 and 100 year return period are quite different among the different regions these differences were quantified with the relative rmse for the wet season the widths of the error bounds range from 18 4 to 26 1 μ 22 3 σ 5 5 for the lower quantile and from 11 8 to 12 7 μ 12 2 σ 0 6 fig 11 a for the upper quantile as illustrated in fig 10b the relative rmse obtained for the dry season ranges from 5 5 to 30 5 μ 17 3 σ 9 7 for the one year return period quantile and from 13 3 to 23 5 μ 17 3 σ 4 0 for the 100 year return period additionally to further evaluate the robustness of the regional frequency analysis the regional pdf obtained for the homogeneous region 2a which includes the highest number of sites 11 was used to estimate flow quantiles for eight sites for the dry season these sites identified in fig 9 are situated near the sites that form region 2a and were initially included within cluster 2 test sites 2 cluster 4 test sites 3 and 4 and cluster 7 test site 1 fig 7 this approach is equivalent to the estimation of daily streamflow quantiles for ungauged sites in this case however the accuracy of the method can be tested the flow quantiles of each site within a homogeneous region were estimated by eq 14 while the corresponding index flood values were estimated by averaging the daily streamflow at each site nevertheless for ungauged sites the index flood needs to be estimated indirectly from other variables in this study the index flood regionalization was developed using a regression between the catchment area km2 and the index flood m3 s 1 of the sites located in the homogenous region 2a a significant correlation between the two datasets table 4 was obtained and after some initial tests the final values of the index flood were estimated nonetheless the final value of index flood for catchments with an area of 2000 km2 had to be divided by a factor of 1 5 by way of a correction that considerably improved the results fig 12 shows the observed and estimated daily streamflow quantiles obtained for each test site in general terms the results show that the estimated daily streamflow quantiles are quite accurate considering that the test sites were not initially included in any of the homogeneous regions in fact of the eight sites considered only two have a relative rmse 45 with the others remaining very close to the maximum error bound estimated for the dry season 30 5 even so a closer look at the results obtained for test sites 2 and 8 revealed that the cause of the differences between observed and estimated quantiles appeared in the lower end of the fdcs where the observed values were very close to zero on the one hand as expected the lnse metric reflects the relative rmse characterization of the model s performance but on the other the nse values are quite high table 5 this difference is quite relevant as it highlights the advantages of using lnse as an alternative to the nse when the objective is to evaluate a model s performance in relation to low flow predictions 5 discussion and conclusions overall the results of this study enabled the identification of the most suitable pdf to approximate daily streamflow of perennial rivers in contiguous angola and to evaluate the performance of the regional frequency analysis of daily streamflow based on the l moments approach the results show that in relation to the pdfs under evaluation kap distribution is undoubtedly the best model for approximating the onsite distributions of daily streamflow in angola regardless of the dataset used annual full dataset wet and dry seasons with four parameters this distribution is quite flexible particularly when modelling distributions with significantly u shaped probability densities in addition to accuracy the model also needs to be parsimonious the gpa distribution using three parameters was therefore also identified as a good alternative to the kap distribution this conclusion is in line with the results of several other studies which identified the kap and the gpa distributions as the best models for approximating daily streamflow both in europe castellarin et al 2004 castellarin et al 2007 mendicino and senatore 2013 and in north america archfield 2009 vogel and fennessey 1993 blum et al 2017 as such the results of this study extend the proposed applicability range of these two distributions to the southern africa region surprisingly the results revealed that the models exhibited considerable difficulties in predicting the lower ends of the fdcs often predicting negative flows this mainly affected the results of the two parameter pdfs gum gev glo and ln and to a lesser degree the remaining and more complex distributions this is a limitation that has already been discussed in previous studies e g archfield 2009 blum et al 2017 and can be quite detrimental to the overall performance of some specific pdfs significantly the results obtained withthe cluster analysis combined with the definition of meannormalized fdcs for each region cluster show that when the fdcs observed during the wet season are relatively linear the pe3 distribution predicted negative flows this attribute was primarily related to the lack of dominance of fast flow surface runoff processes in the catchments and can be used as an initial screening condition to support the selection of suitable pdfs regardless of the models used in view of the impressive heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties there are still difficulties and uncertainties to be tackled in the prediction of flows from ungauged catchments sivapalan et al 2003 in general the results of this study suggest that the spatial distribution of precipitation is highly irregular across all the catchments in fact the relevant literature indicates that the climate of southern africa of which angola is a part is highly variable complex and marked by a high degree of interannual and decadal precipitation variability reason et al 2006 dieppois et al 2015 washington and preston 2006 leading to widespread drought in some areas pascale et al 2019 and widespread flooding in others pascale et al 2019 kupika et al 2018 it is a variability that had a significant affect with regard to the definition of homogeneous regions only 36 of the initial set of clusters were identified as homogeneous regions a value which is very low in comparison with the results of other studies nyeko ogiramoi et al 2012 nilo river catchment africa cassalho et al 2019 rio grande do sul catchment south america and drissia et al 2019 kerala state asia concluded that 67 50 and 100 of the total number of regions were homogeneous respectively as such our results suggest that the frequency distribution of daily streamflow observed during both seasons but particularly for the wet season across the different regions considered in the analysis is quite heterogeneous this is even more evident in the southern regions located in southern semi arid and dry sub humid zones significantly the daily streamflow quantiles estimated using the regional frequency analysis for eight test sites revealed the method s remarkable accuracy nse μ 0 86 σ 0 10 r μ 0 97 σ 0 02 when compared with previous attempts to estimate daily streamflow for ungauged sites with statistical methods in africa smakhtin et al 1997 nse μ 0 51 σ 0 15 and asia yilmaz and onoz 2020 μ 0 68 σ 0 23 and with physically based models in southern africa love et al 2011 nse μ 0 29 σ 0

nse 0 86 oudin et al 2008 nse 0 70 to 0 80 overall the results suggest that in the simplest cases the serial dependence of daily streamflow can be substantially reduced with the definition of a time lag it is important to mention that this approach significantly reduced the size of the initial datasets nonetheless if needed the removed datasets can still be considered in the analysis as they are a valid and valuable sample of the observed fdcs in more complex cases a time series model of daily streamflow can be used to analyze the patterns of serial dependence implied by the model thus allowing the use of l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit statistics for the definition of homogenous regions considering different subsets of daily streamflow samples this means that the regional frequency analysis of daily streamflow based on the l moments approach is a plausible alternative to the use of physically based models that usually require considerable amounts of data and human effort both of which are in scant supply in africa due primarily to the lack of economic resources and consequently research personnel it is worth mentioning that while working on this project we have concluded that further research is needed in three specific areas the combined effect of different distributions on the l moments sample the testing of different cluster analysis methods and the evaluation of different methods to assess and reduce streamflow serial dependence hopefully these questions will soon be addressed if possible with longer daily streamflow datasets the study of fdcs characteristics must be expanded to other regions as a mean of improving our understanding of the impressive heterogeneity of their hydroclimatic characteristics credit authorship contribution

4120,hydrological observations in angola are quite scarce and as such the water allocation process one of the main components of water resources management is commonly undertaken with a high degree of uncertainty it is therefore vital to increase our understanding of the hydrological processes namely the frequency distribution of daily streamflow in this part of southern africa and validate efficient methods that facilitate the extrapolation of information from gauged to ungauged catchments all the components of this study were carefully designed to address all the above mentioned goals this was achieved with the modelling of 121 flow duration curve samples observed in different parts of the country including large datasets e g 1954 55 to 1968 69 but mainly focused on the hydrological years of 1967 1968 and 1973 1974 and the implementation of regional frequency analysis based on the l moments approach the frequency distribution of daily streamflow was approximated with nine different probability distribution functions considering different subsets of the daily streamflow time series i daily streamflow ii different subsets of daily streamflow divided into two flows seasons wet and dry iii and the previous subsets transformed with the definition of a thirty day time lag thereby reducing the serial dependency of daily streamflow and enabling the use of the l moments approach overall the results enabled two probability distribution functions to be identified able to provide a remarkable approximation to all the above mentioned daily streamflow datasets the four parameter kappa and three parameter generalized pareto distributions furthermore the regional frequency analysis supported the prediction of daily streamflow quantiles for eight test catchments with impressive accuracy nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient μ 0 86 σ 0 10 pearson correlation coefficient μ 0 97 σ 0 02 clearly showing that this approach represents a sound alternative for the prediction of daily streamflow in ungauged catchments located in this region keywords daily streamflow frequency distribution ungauged catchment l moments 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is a graphic illustration of the relationship between the exceedance probability of streamflow and its magnitude vogel and fennessey 1994 fdcs are used to describe hydrologic regimes and are therefore crucial for water resources management planning and analysis vogel and fennessey 1995 archfield and vogel 2010 blöschl et al 2013 historically fdcs have been used for water allocation mcmahon 1993 water quality assessments vogel and fennessey 1995 river sedimentation studies torizzo and pitlick 2004 flood control and hydropower design schemes warnick 1984 vogel and fennessey 1995 in regions where water is scarce and climate change is affecting the lives and livelihoods of people it is vital to quantify the annual and seasonal streamflow variability nevertheless most of the watercourses in the world are ungauged sivapalan et al 2003 mishra and coulibaly 2009 hrachowitz et al 2013 especially those located in developing countries kanishka and eldho 2020 this is a limitation that can be difficult to overcome even with the combination of conventional monitoring methods and state of the art technology like remote sensing the accuracy of remote sensing methods for flow prediction in data scarce regions depends on the reliability of ground information such as the river bathymetry rating curves samboko et al 2020 and rainfall brocca et al 2020 which can still be difficult to obtain for remote regions therefore it is still common to rely on classical methods to estimate fdcs in ungauged catchments as described by blöschl et al 2013 these methods can be divided into two general groups statistical and process based methods the first group includes regression index flow and geostatistical methods e g nathan and mcmahon 1992 vandewiele and elias 1995 smakhtin et al 1997 bocchiola et al 2010 li et al 2010 viola et al 2011 yilmaz and onoz 2020 while the second comprises derived distribution methods and continuous models e g sefton and howartm 1998 jin et al 2009 li et al 2009 reichl et al 2009 love et al 2011 kanishka and eldho 2020 due to their relative simplicity the empirical methods included in the first group are a common choice for predicting fdcs at ungauged sites blöschl et al 2013 some of these methods comprise two steps the definition of the fdc shape through the estimation of statistical parameters and the correlation of shape parameters with the catchment characteristics booker and snelder 2012 regardless of the chosen method the identification of an acceptable probability distribution of daily streamflow is especially relevant for the process of fdcs generalization in the literature there are some examples of attempts to approximate the frequency distribution of daily streamflow using probability distribution functions pdf blum et al 2017 concluded that kappa distribution kap is a good alternative for modelling daily streamflow across the conterminous united states us while the three parameter generalized pareto gpa and lognormal distributions ln can also be applied in some us regions kap and gpa distributions were also acceptable solutions to approximate fdcs in the northeastern us vogel and fennessey 1993 fennessey 1994 leboutillier and waylen 1993 applied a two component ln distribution to daily streamflow at 182 stations located in canada and concluded that it was reasonably adept at representing the frequency distribution of fdc high and low discharge ends in southern australia li et al 2010 while defining a new regionalization approach successfully applied the three parameter ln distribution to daily streamflow despite the proven effectiveness of these models certain challenges exist that need to be overcome it is worth mentioning that the fitted distributions parameter sets can sometimes result in the prediction of negative flows this happens because the values of these parameters generate theoretical lower bounds that are less than zero archfield 2009 blum et al 2017 therefore to avoid negative flows it is a common practice to constrain the pdf lower bound to zero blum et al 2017 svensson et al 2017 this approach will typically result in a model which gives values that are arbitrarily close to zero and with a specified functional form for the distribution of near zero values hence the formation of the upper tail can be affected as mentioned by klemeš 2000 the shape of the upper tail is determined by the physical regime prevailing in the formation of the lower tail it is unusual for these conditions to be satisfied in practice when considering perennial rivers therefore for some flow regimes the option to impose a lower bound of zero can be detrimental to the fitting accuracy it is also important to mention the stochastic nature of daily streamflow that includes serial dependency and seasonality hurst 1951 montanari et al 1997 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 daily streamflows are not independent and identically distributed i i d therefore the complex nature of these datasets should in theory be explained by a mixture of fdcs of monthly or seasonal subsets to overcome this condition bowers et al 2012 divided the hydrological year of nine rivers across the us into three seasons wet dry and transitional and then applied different distributions to the different regimes the results show that the power law and ln distributions fit each of the seasons reasonably well and that the statistical properties of each season vary significantly across all rivers this variability highlights the complexity of the physical process that regulates daily streamflow despite the substantial heterogeneity of the different river flow regimes displayed by observations and modeling efforts it is well established that simple models with a small number of parameters can have a significantly explanatory power regarding catchment responses sivapalan et al 2003 this has driven the attempts to identify homogeneous regions considering a reduced number of explanatory variables to improve the global understanding of river flow regimes coopersmith et al 2012 and to predict runoff in ungauged catchments the well established l moments regional frequency analysis based on the l moments approach hosking and wallis 1997 which is commonly used for extreme value analysis such as flood frequency estimates for ungauged catchments e g nyeko ogiramoi et al 2012 drissia et al 2019 lee and kim 2019 cassalho et al 2019 is not usually applied to daily streamflow datasets this is an obvious consequence of the important serial stochastic structure of daily streamflow e g autocorrelation and seasonality which prevents the use of l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures nonetheless if both serial dependence and seasonality are reduced the l moments approach can in theory be applied to daily streamflow datasets the validation of this approach is the second of the two primary motives for the development of this research the first being to contribute to the characterization of the daily streamflow frequency distribution in this part of southern africa therefore the main objective of this paper is to answer the following questions i can an existing probability distribution approximate the frequency distribution of 120 fdcs observed in perennial rivers across angola based on the full year wet and dry season datasets ii is it possible to identify physiographic and climate regions where the performance of the probability distributions is most successful iii how does the variability of the samples l moments ratio change in relation to the different daily streamflow datasets full year wet and dry season iv is it possible to relate fdc characteristics with probability distribution performance v can regional frequency analysis based on the l moments approach serve as a sound alternative to predicting daily streamflow in ungauged catchments if daily streamflow autocorrelation and seasonality are reduced to that end probability distributions were systematically fitted to i daily streamflow ii different subsets of daily streamflow divided into two flows seasons wet and dry iii the previous subsets transformed with the definition of a thirty day time lag additionally the possibility of defining homogeneous regions where a single distribution can be used to predict daily streamflow in ungauged sites with the l moments method was explored the regional l moments approach was validated by predicting daily streamflow quantiles for eight test catchments the results of this study will hopefully not only prove useful from a practical perspective in terms of characterizing the region s water resources but also help to increase the ability to estimate streamflow at ungauged sites the definition of theories with a higher range of applicability relies on our understanding of the massive spatial temporal heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties fdcs encapsulate this information and as such it is important to gain a deeper knowledge regarding their characteristics across different latitudes 2 angola hydrometric monitoring network the republic of angola is located on the southwest coast of africa between 4 22 and 18 02 south latitude and 11 41 and 24 05 east longitude and is the fifth largest african country with an area of 1 246 700 km2 fig 1 it is bounded by the forest ecosystem of the republic of congo and the democratic republic of congo drc in the north by the arid woodlands and desert of namibia in the south by the moist savanna and the woodland ecosystem of the drc and zambia in the east and by the atlantic ocean in the west huntley et al 2019 angola s climate is primarily controlled by the annual migration of the congo air boundary low pressure across the mainland and by the south atlantic cyclonic gyre dupont et al 2008 the northern eastern and central regions have a humid tropical climate aridity index 0 65 with a rainy season running from october to april pombo et al 2015 along the coast the climate varies from dry tropical aridity index 0 50 0 65 near luanda to arid aridity index 0 03 0 2 and hyper arid aridity index 0 03 in the namib desert the precipitation decreases towards the south and southwest where the climate is dry tropical aridity index 0 50 0 65 and semi arid aridity index 0 20 0 50 the interior plateau regions where the altitude is 800 m and annual precipitation reaches values above 800 mm are drained by nine large catchments seven of which are shared with neighboring countries the coastal region below 100 m where precipitation is generally 500 mm with the exception of the namibe region which can attain annual precipitation values of 50 mm is where coastal rivers that drain the central and western highlands have penetrated the steep escarpment of the atlantic ocean pombo et al 2017 the national hydrometric network with records from 1951 1952 up to the present day was practically dismantled during the civil war period 1974 2002 despite the efforts made by the entities that manage the sector the national hydrometric network consisting of approximately 288 stations had 58 active stations in 2017 of which 38 began operating that same year it is therefore still necessary to refer to historical records that are mainly focused on the hydrological years of 1967 1968 and 1973 1974 nonetheless the datasets for some catchments cover a longer period bengo 1954 55 to 1968 69 catumbela 1961 62 to 1971 72 kwanza 1963 64 to 1973 74 cubal da hanha 1966 67 to 1979 80 cubango 1964 65 to 1973 74 cunene

angola national water institute of these approximately 41 are located in the interior plateau suggesting that the network was not optimized to reflect the geophysical complexity of the landscape the mean catchment area of these stations 4 684 km2 ranges from 178 km2 to 112 027 km2 and the daily streamflow time series length from 365 to 5 475 days μ 2190 days 3 methodology in this study the daily streamflow discharge records of 63 rivers observed at 121 stations fig 1 were analyzed the overall methodological approach is schematically represented in fig 2 as an initial approach the full year daily streamflow dataset was evaluated nevertheless considering the important serial stochastic structure of daily streamflow including issues such as serial dependence and seasonality the analysis was extended to different subsets of the daily streamflow therefore as a complementary assessment the initial full year dataset of daily streamflow was divided into a dry season that runs from may to september and a wet season comprising the remaining period lars 2004 pombo et al 2015 three more datasets were also defined in which a 30 day time lag fig 2 was imposed to the full year and seasonal streamflow data at this point the fdcs describing the six datasets full year dataset wet and dry season datasets full year dataset with a 30 day time lag wet and dry season datasets with a 30 day time lag were approximated by nine probability distribution functions 2 param exponential exp 2 param gumbel gum 3 param generalized extreme value gev 3 param generalized logistic glo 3 param generalized pareto gpa 3 param log normal ln 3 param pearson type iii pe3 4 param kappa kap and 5 param wakeby wak these were the chosen candidate probability distributions because they have already been considered for the approximation of daily streamflow in previous studies e g blum et al 2017 vogel and fennessey 1993 fennessey 1994 li et al 2020 and because the equations needed to estimate the l moments distributions were available in hosking s study 1990 all the above mentioned distributions were developed to model extreme datasets but are nevertheless able to approximate the shape of a full daily streamflow fdc reasonably well for an extensive description of each pdf refer to the appendix in the book regional frequency analysis hosking and wallis 1997 the parameters of each sample were estimated with the l moments approach defined by hosking 1990 and the fdc obtained for each site with the pdfs was compared to the corresponding empirical fdc fig 2 the goodness of fit was evaluated with the log nash sutcliffe efficiency measure lnse and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks fig 2 for the application of the ks test the datasets must be i i d therefore this test was only applied to the datasets with a 30 day time lag additionally the analysis of l moment ratio diagrams provided a complementary initial assessment to the identification of the candidate pdfs the remainder of the study concerned only the pdfs identified in the initial screening process and the datasets with a 30 day time lag full year wet and dry season datasets as mentioned previously some of the pdf parameters sets returned negative flows a limitation than can be addressed with the definition of a lower bound of zero nevertheless in light of the comments regarding this issue outlined in the introduction a different approach was considered the negative values were replaced by a value very close to zero 0 01 as a solution that enabled the fitting assessment with the lnse while penalizing the pdfs that predict negative flow values one of the main purposes of identifying a suitable pdf to describe the frequency distribution of river daily streamflow discharge record is the generalization of the fdc to ungauged catchments therefore homogenous regions were defined considering the well established regional frequency analysis approach based on l moment hosking and wallis 1997 following the approach defined by hosking and wallis 1997 the 121 sites were divided into clusters to form regions for the regional frequency analysis fig 2 after the formation of regions a discordance measure fig 2 was applied to the streamflow datasets and the heterogeneity measures h and the zdist goodness of fit measure were estimated regarding the gev glo gpa and pe3 distributions fig 2 this last process was repeated following the removal of several sites from the dataset additionally after the definition of homogenous regions 90 error bounds were estimated for each regional growth curve considering the algorithm for simulation of the regional l moments hosking and wallis 1997 fig 2 eight test sites were used to test the robustness of the regionalization process these sites were initially included in a different cluster however the fact that they are located close to one homogenous region makes them suitable for the analysis the index flood at each test site was obtained from a regression between the catchment area km2 and the index flood values previously estimated for the sites located in the homogenous region finally the log nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient lnse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the pearson correlation coefficient r and the relative root mean square error rrmse fig 2 were used to evaluate the similarities between the estimated and observed flow quantiles 3 1 daily streamflow time lag definition the serial dependence of daily streamflow data must be understood and reduced in order to make effective use of test statistics such as ks or the l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures in the simplest cases using data for every kth day represents a possible a solution provided that the serial dependence in streamflow has become negligible at a lag of k days in more complex cases it is necessary to build a time series model of daily streamflow and analyze the patterns of serial dependence implied by the model in this study the serial dependence reduction was evaluated by estimating the value of r between the observed series and its shifted self considering different time gaps 5 10 40 the value of r corresponding to a weak correlation 0 4 was considered as a benchmark for the identification of a suitable lag value to impose to the streamflow data series 3 2 empirical fdc when carrying out the frequency analysis of a sample specifically when it comes to identifying the statistical distributions that can be applied to that sample it is common to resort to visual adjustment based on the graphical representation of the sample points and the theoretical laws chosen to represent this sample therefore each point in the sample needs to be assigned an empirical probability of non exceedance f plotting position vogel and fennessey 1994 in this study the empirical fdc of daily streamflow was represented using the weibull plotting position eq 1 as it conceptualizes an unbiased estimate of the empirical distribution function regardless of the underlying probability distribution vogel and fennessey 1994 1 f i n 1 where n is the number of observations 3 3 goodness of fit measures 3 3 1 log nash sutcliffe efficiency lnse the nse was proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 as a normalized statistic that evaluates the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed data this statistic recommended for hydrograph modelling by asce 1993 legates and mccabe 1999 and moriasi et al 2007 is very commonly used by hydrologists and as such comparable performance results are not difficult to find in similar studies the nse coefficient ranges from minus infinity to one with one being the optimal value in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if the coefficient ranges from zero to one if nse is 0 then the observed mean value is a better predictor than the simulated value which suggests an unacceptable performance additionally in this study we have applied a log transformation on flows to put greater emphasis on the lower end of the fdcs oudin et al 2006 eq 2 it is important to mention that the lnse coefficient also ranges from minus infinity to one 2 lnse 1 i 1 n l o g y i obs l o g y i sim 2 i 1 n l o g y i obs l o g y i mean 2 where y i obs is the observation value y i sim is the simulated value y i mean is the mean of observed data and n is the number of observations model performance ratings are model and project specific e g moriasi et al 2007 therefore a visual comparison of observed versus simulated values was used for the definition of suitable performance ratings the fdcs obtained for sites where the distributions exhibit a similar performance as described by the lnse values were grouped and plotted against the observed fdcs then the performance of the distributions was evaluated across the different ratings namely the tails fitting 3 3 2 kolmogorov smirnov test ks the ks statistic is commonly used to test whether a set of observed data comes from a hypothesized continuous distribution lilliefors 1967 this test is less sensitive to deviations in the tails of the distributions mason and schuenemeyer 1983 nevertheless it is a good alternative to the chi square test for any sample size lilliefors 1967 and a good complement to the lnse statistic the ks test is defined by 3 d max 1 i n f y i i 1 n i n f y i where f is the cumulative distribution being tested if the parameters of a distribution are estimated from the sample then the ks test using the commonly tabulated critical points no longer applies crutcher 1975 to overcome this limitation the ks test critical points were derived for each of the pdfs this was achieved with a monte carlo simulation of 10 000 samples generated from the pdf population for each streamgage the length of the samples is the same as the streamflow time series the samples were approximated with the pdf and the corresponding value of the critical point corresponding to the quantile 1 significance level α was computed α 0 05 3 3 3 goodness of fit measure zdist the suitability of each theorical distribution was evaluated using the z statistic suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 eq 4 4 zdist τ 4 d i s t τ 4 r b 4 σ 4 where τ 4 d i s t is the l skewness of the distribution τ 4 r is the l kurtosis weighted proportional to the sites recorded length b 4 and σ 4 are the bias and the standard deviation of τ 4 r respectively all distributions for which z 1 64 were considered as acceptable candidates considering a 90 confidence interval 3 3 4 pearson correlation coefficient r the strength of the correlation between observed daily streamflow and its shifted self was assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient r eq 5 5 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 4 l moments the l moments defined by hosking 1990 are linear functions of probability weighted moments pwm vide greenwood et al 1979 that like conventional moments quantify the location dispersion and shape of a data sample nevertheless unlike conventional moments the moment estimators are unbiased do not depend on the sample size hosking 1990 and are less sensitive to outlier values vogel and fennessey 1993 thus the identification of suitable distributions is more easily achieved by using l moments especially if the distributions exhibit extraordinary skewness such as daily streamflow vide hosking 1990 vogel and fennessey 1993 the first four l moments are as follows 6 λ 1 β 0 7 λ 2 2 β 1 β 0 8 λ 3 6 β 2 2 β 1 β 0 9 λ 4 2 0 β 3 3 0 β 2 1 2 β 1 β 0 where βo β1 β2 and β3 are the first four pwms analogous to the conventional moments hosking 1990 defines the l moments ratios 10 τ 2 λ 2 λ 1 l c o e f f i c i e n t o f var i a t i o n 11 τ 3 λ 3 λ 2 l s k e w n e s s 12 τ 4 λ 4 λ 2 l kurtosis additionally hosking 1990 introduced the l moment ratio diagrams a graphical plot of theorical τ 3 and τ 4 values for a range of selected distributions against sample estimates of the same variables these graphs are very useful for identifying an acceptable approximation to the distribution of a hydrological variable vogel and fennessey 1993 3 5 regional frequency analysis rfa hosking 1990 defines the following steps for implementing the regional frequency analysis rfa 1 formation of regions 2 implement discordancy and heterogeneity tests 3 choice of distribution with the zdist goodness of fit statistic 4 quantile estimate and accuracy 3 5 1 formation of regions the initial formation of regions was achieved with a cluster analysis considering the ward s method ward 1963 and the standardization of the following site characteristics latitude longitude log catchment area log mean total annual precipitation coba 2016 fig 9 square root mean catchment elevation log catchment length log catchment slope log catchment aridity index zomer et al 2008 fig 7b log catchment evapotranspiration coba 2016 and log catchment runoff coefficient fig 7a the mean catchment runoff coefficient of each catchment was estimated from the potential runoff coefficient table incorporated in the wetspa water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere extension model liu and de smedt 2004 which incorporates different land use and land cover types fao 2014 slope and soil texture classes fao 2003 3 5 2 discordancy di and heterogeneity h tests initially the discordancy test hosking and wallis 1997 was used to evaluate the suitability of the flow time series this test enabled the identification of data irregularities e g outliers trends the sites with values of di 3 were analyzed for correction of errors or deleted after the initial screening the inter site heterogeneity was evaluated with the following equation hosking and wallis 1997 13 h v μ v σ v where v is the weighted standard deviation of the at site sample lcv and σv and μv are the standard deviation and the mean estimated from simulated region lcv the four parameter kappa distribution fitted to the regional weighted average l moment ratio enabled the regional simulation the regions were declared acceptably homogeneous if h 1 possibly heterogeneous if 1 h 2 and definitely heterogeneous if h 2 hosking and wallis 1997 3 5 3 quantile estimate and accuracy the flow quantiles of each site were estimated with the index flood procedure dalrymple 1960 this approach considered that if the sites form a homogeneous region then the frequency distributions of all sites are equal except for a site specific scaling factor this assumption can be described by the following equation 14 q i f μ i q f where q i f is the quantile function μ i is the index flood and q f is the growth factor the value of μ i is estimated from the sample mean of the data observed at each site and q f is estimated from the fitted pdf hosking and wallis 1997 define the accuracy of the flow quantiles as a regional average of the rrmse eq 15 between the flow quantiles estimated for the actual and the simulated region the monte carlo simulation of a region with the same number of sites record length and regional average l moments enables the definition of quantile error bounds 15 rrmse 1 m m 1 m q i m f q i f q i f 2 where m is the total number of repetitions q i m is the estimated growth curve at site i and the mth repetition and q i f is the real growth curve at site i the regional growth curves for homogeneous regions are all equal therefore the index of q i m and q i f can be removed hence hosking and wallis 1997 define 90 error bounds for the estimated growth curve with the eq 16 where l 05 f and u 05 f are some values defining the 5 limit for the ratio q f q f 16 q f u 05 f q f q f l 05 f additionally the normalized standard deviation σn eq 17 was used to evaluate the variation of the daily streamflow datasets 17 σ n 1 n 1 i 1 n x i μ 2 μ where x i is the observation value μ is the mean of observed data 3 6 software the pdf fitting and the rfa were computed using the lmom hosking 2019a and lmomrfa hosking 2019b r packages respectively whereas the monte carlo simulation of the ks critical values was performed with a python code specifically developed for this purpose 4 results 4 1 daily streamflow time lag definition from a theoretical point of view both dependence and non identical distributions increase the sampling variability of l moments in the l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures the simulations that estimate this sampling variability assume i i d data and therefore underestimate the sampling variability fig 3 a shows an example of the evolution of h and z statistics after treating the set of 121 sites as a single region with different subsets of daily streamflow and considering the pe3 and gpa distributions the estimated sampling variability contributes to the denominator of the measures so the measures end up with very large values fig 3a significantly beyond a time lag of 15 days the variation of the h zpe3 and zgpa values is much smaller suggesting that this is a transition point for the flow regime fig 3a in fact several authors have concluded that river flow fluctuations exhibit two different regimes one over short time scales and the other over long time scales e g tessier et al 1996 hirpa et al 2010 fig 3b 3c and 3d illustrate the pearson correlation coefficient r obtained for each streamgage after the definition of a time lag of 5 and 30 days to the full year dataset observed and to the wet and dry season datasets observed following the conversion of the daily streamflow datasets the results obtained show that with a lag of 30 days the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the r statistic obtained for the full year dataset was reduced to 0 60 and 0 15 respectively fig 3b a value that still indicates the existence of a moderate correlation fig 3c and 3d illustrate the results obtained for the wet and dry seasons with a lag of 30 days the mean r values obtained for the wet and dry seasons 0 36 σ 0 20 and 0 30 σ 0 22 indicate that the serial dependence of the daily streamflow was considerably reduced the increase in the time gap beyond 30 days would further reduce the value of r nonetheless the mean datasets record length has already been reduced 30 times table 1 and six sites were excluded from the analysis from this point forward a considerable number of sites would be excluded from the analyses therefore the time gap of 30 days was accepted as the final reference value 4 2 initial screening of candidate distributions l moment ratio diagrams fig 4 shows the l moments diagrams obtained for different datasets of daily streamflow of all distributions considered the gpa and kap distributions provide the best approximation to the observed daily streamflow regardless of the dataset considered nevertheless the graphical analysis of the l moments also suggests that the pe3 model can in some cases be the candidate distribution generally considering only the two and three parameter distributions the sample estimates of τ3 and τ4 are located in the area that is crossed by the gpa and pe3 theorical l moments fig 4 it is also relevant to mention that the variability of the sample estimates of τ3 and τ4 increased significantly from the full year dataset fig 4a to the wet and dry season datasets fig 4b and 4c and even more when considering the same datasets with a 30 day lag fig 4d 4e and 4f it is important to mention that the full year sample will always have the effect of a larger sample reducing the variability of its sample l moments as such the full year dataset shows less complexity than those associated with its isolated parts wet and dry seasons l moments estimates are not affected by the sample size if the samples are from the same distribution vogel and fennessey 1993 hosking and wallis 1997 therefore this variability increment is clearly illustrating the complexity of daily streamflow frequency distribution namely the mixing effect of different distributions over the sample l moments 4 3 goodness of fit assessment the results obtained with the lnse statistic closely correlate with the l moments diagrams analysis regardless of the dataset the best approximation to daily streamflow considering the lnse mean value across all datasets was obtained with the kap distribution μ 0 988 closely followed by the wak μ 0 986 gpa μ 0 982 and pe3 μ 0 977 distributions fig 5 of all distributions gum gev glo and ln results were significantly affected by the prediction of negative flows considering the full year fig 5a and seasonal datasets fig 5b and 5c the mean number of sites with predicted negative flows reached 78 4 63 3 and 66 1 for gum gev and glo distributions respectively conversely a much smaller number of sites in the remaining distributions were affected by this constraint exp 3 8 gpa 7 1 ln 0 0 pe3 23 3 kap 6 2 wak 15 6 as the lnse statistic is highly sensitive to small differences at the lower end of the fdcs distributions performance was significantly affected by the prediction of negative flows fig 5a 5b and 5c this is the reason why the gpa kap and pe3 results include at least one site with an lnse value of 0 2 fig 5b not surprisingly the sample size reduction imposed on the full year and seasonal datasets with a 30 day lag fig 5d 5e and 5f significantly improved the results obtained for these datasets when compared with the full year and seasonal datasets additionally it is relevant to mention that the exp and wak distributions could not be fitted at approximately half of the sites this limitation of the wak distribution was also acknowledged by both archfield 2009 and blum et al 2017 for the us the wak distribution is flexible but there are some shapes that it does not model particularly distributions with strong u shaped probability densities therefore regardless of the performance these two distributions were removed for further consideration with the aim of improving the analysis the lnse values obtained for the best models kap gpa and pe3 and for each site were classified according to a predefined criterion and plotted against the conterminous angola the criterion was defined through the visual assessment of the fdcs fitting poor fit lnse 0 94 median fit 0 94 lnse 0 99 good fit 0 99 while fitting pdfs to daily streamflow blum et al 2017 defined a similar classification observed in nearly 400 unregulated perennial streams in the us which varied only at the lower end of the range poor fit 0 93 fig 6 shows the classification results obtained with the gpa pe3 and kap distributions considering the lnse value obtained for each site and for the full year wet and dry season datasets all with a 30 day lag generally while considering the number of sites included in the good fit classification range the results follow the pattern of the σn values obtained for each dataset which means that less variation implies a better fit in more sites the mean value of σn obtained for the full year fig 6a 6b and 6c wet fig 6d 6e and 6f and dry season fig 6g 6h and 6i datasets was 1 48 max 4 63 min 0 70 1 61 max 5 46 min 0 81 and 2 45 max 11 44 min 1 05 respectively hence the model s performance decreased from the full year fig 6a 6b and 6c to the dry season datasets results fig 6g 6h and 6i the only exception were the results obtained with the pe3 distribution since the distribution predicted negative flows at 21 of the sites regarding the wet season modeling the performance of this distribution was better for the dry season overall the number of sites excluded due to the ks test was very small with the mean value across all data series reaching 4 1 2 5 and 1 9 regarding the kap gpa and the pe3 approximation to the daily streamflow fdcs respectively it is also relevant to mention that 16 3 of the sites randomly distributed in the study area exhibited infeasible kap parameters across the three datasets thus the initial number of sites 121 was reduced to 108 100 and 96 considering the full year and the wet and dry seasons respectively as expected the additional parameter of the kap distribution considerably increased the accuracy of the results the kap distribution performance was impressive with the mean number of good fits reaching 29 1 across all datasets and only 3 8 of the sites included in the poor fit range the gpa distribution performed well with 16 8 of the sites classified as good fits nevertheless because of the prediction of negative flows 10 of the sites during the wet season dataset simulation 15 2 of the sites datasets had lnse values of 0 94 this was also the main reason why the pe3 distribution accuracy was inferior to the results obtained from the other two distributions in fact 10 and 21 of the simulations of the full year and wet season datasets respectively resulted in the prediction of negative flows which increased the number of sites classified as poor fits to a mean value of 22 5 due to this limitation the mean value of good fits obtained with the pe3 distribution across all datasets was only 9 9 the majority of the poor fits obtained with the three distributions are generally related to the prediction of negative flows the occurrence of subzero quantiles in the fdc predicted by a pdf that is not bounded below zero is primarily determined by the specified functional form of the predicted fdc nevertheless the shape of observed fdcs also has an obvious role in this limitation and it would therefore be quite relevant to evaluate whether there is a link between the sites with poor fits and the climate and catchment characteristics this was achieved with the analysis of figs 7 and 8 which show the spatial distribution of the land cover versus the estimated runoff coefficient fig 7a the aridity index versus the cluster analysis output fig 7b the mean fdc normalized min max of each cluster considering the wet fig 8a and dry fig 8b seasons datasets with a 30 day lag and the mean fdc normalized by the mean daily streamflow regarding each cluster considering the wet fig 8c and dry fig 8d seasons datasets with a 30 day lag in general terms from the analysis of these figures we have concluded that the runoff coefficients previously aggregated into different classes low mean high form three very defined regions it is relevant to mention that the mean estimated runoff coefficient regarding the 121 catchments 0 17 σ 0 05 max 0 26 min 0 06 closely correlates with the results obtained for angola by pombo 2016 furthermore a good correlation was observed r 0 993 between the estimated values of full year daily streamflow considering the runoff coefficients and the mean annual precipitation and the observed daily streamflow almost all sites included in the high and mean classes can be found in the west central humid ai 0 65 region angolan miombo woodlands where the soils are mostly well drained ferrasols and luvisols 55 of the sites included in the median class are located in the kwanza river catchment the largest river catchment in western angola which drains a large portion of the central plateau significantly 70 of the sites included in the high class are located within or near the dry sub humid and semi arid regions while the remaining 30 are mostly located in the central plateau region close to the kwanza river catchment in general terms the results suggested that the difference between the two classes of runoff coefficients are influenced by land cover and catchment area the sites included in the high class are located in regions with less dense tree cover and catchments on average three times smaller than the catchments of the sites include in the mean class fig 7a some authors have observed a decrease in the runoff coefficient with the increase in the catchment area e g joel et al 2002 cerdan et al 2004 unsurprisingly the sites included in the low class are mostly located in the southern semi arid region where soils are mainly composed of arenosols ferrasols and luvisols at this point the results suggest that the distribution of the runoff coefficients is not linked with the locations of sites with poor fits therefore an additional effort was made through the analysis of the spatial distribution of the regions formed by the different cluster groups the cluster analysis enabled the identification of nine different regions fig 7b depicting the aggregated contribution of the catchments climatic and physiographic characteristics a closer look at fig 6d and 6e regarding the gpa and the pe3 results for the wet season and fig 7b reveals that the sites with poor fits are mostly located within clusters 2 and 4 significantly the mean fdc normalized by the maximum and minimum values obtained for these clusters and for the wet season fig 8a has a less pronounced curvature than the fdc obtained for regions 6 7 8 and 9 this difference is due to the dominance of fast flow surface runoff processes in the catchments included in regions 6 7 8 and 9 when compared with the remaining regions the slope of the middle part of the fdcs which is related to the variance of daily streamflow and controlled by sub surface runoffs yokoo and sivapalan 2011 is similar fig 8a and 8c nevertheless the upper part of the fdcs which reflects the fast flow surface runoff yokoo and sivapalan 2011 is quite different fig 8b indicating that the catchments included in regions 1 2 3 4 and 5 have a slower response to near surface processes than the catchments included in the remaining clusters this fact is illustrated by the gentler curve in the upper part of the fdcs consequently the wet season datasets of daily streamflow which comprise regions 2 and 4 have a lower standard deviation and the fdcs are relatively linear fig 8c a distinctive feature that correlates with the locations of sites with poor fits conversely during the dry season the normalized fdcs are similar across all clusters fig 8b and are comparable with the fdcs for clusters 1 2 3 4 and 5 namely in the upper part of the fdcs however the curves show a dip at the lower tail that is typical of catchments in arid climates due to increased evapotranspiration from saturated surfaces yokoo and sivapalan 2011 this is a characteristic that combined with the relatively lower flows of the dry season was not influential in the prediction of negative flows 4 4 regional homogeneity evaluation 4 4 1 defining homogeneous regions the l moments methodology is not typically used in the definition of homogeneous regions regarding the frequency distributions of daily streamflow this is because in the l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures the simulations that estimate this sampling variability assume i i d data and therefore underestimate the sampling variability in this study however the reduction of the daily streamflow serial dependency presented an opportunity to evaluate the performance of the l moments method while improving the research results after forming the regions which resulted in the definition of nine clusters fig 7b the initial discordancy test screening allowed for the list of sites being studied to be further reduced this part of the process resulted in the removal of some sites from the initial clusters vide table 2 and the division of cluster 2 into three smaller clusters 2a 2b and 2c then l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit measures were applied to the wet and dry season datasets with a lag of 30 days table 2 shows the results obtained for each cluster namely the candidate distributions from which the distributions with the lower value of z were selected and considered for the definition of homogeneous regions table 3 the gpa and pe3 distributions were identified as candidate distributions in 68 of the regions reinforcing their potential to approximate daily streamflow the analysis of the values obtained for h facilitated the identification of two and six acceptable regions respectively for the wet season cluster 2b and 5 and dry season cluster 2a 2b 2c 3 5 and 6 datasets fig 9 except for cluster1 which can be classified as possibly heterogeneous regarding the dry season dataset all the remaining clusters are heterogenous the spatial distribution of the homogeneous regions was plotted against the total annual precipitation map for angola clearly showing that most of these areas are located within a single precipitation range 1200 mm to 1400 mm cluster 6 situated near the coast is the only homogeneous region located in an annual precipitation range 600 mm in the dry sub humid zone 4 4 2 quantile estimate and accuracy following the definition of the homogeneous regions the magnitude of the results uncertainty was evaluated through the definition of confidence intervals this was achieved using a monte carlo simulation 500 replications of artificial regions with the kappa distribution each one of these artificial regions share the following statistics with the actual regions number of sites record length site means the mean l cv value is equal to the regional average l cv and varies linearly across sites l skewness is the same at each site and is equal to the regional average l skewness fig 10 shows the regional growth curves with upper and lower error bounds estimated by eq 16 as expected results show that the widths of the error bounds for a 1 and 100 year return period are quite different among the different regions these differences were quantified with the relative rmse for the wet season the widths of the error bounds range from 18 4 to 26 1 μ 22 3 σ 5 5 for the lower quantile and from 11 8 to 12 7 μ 12 2 σ 0 6 fig 11 a for the upper quantile as illustrated in fig 10b the relative rmse obtained for the dry season ranges from 5 5 to 30 5 μ 17 3 σ 9 7 for the one year return period quantile and from 13 3 to 23 5 μ 17 3 σ 4 0 for the 100 year return period additionally to further evaluate the robustness of the regional frequency analysis the regional pdf obtained for the homogeneous region 2a which includes the highest number of sites 11 was used to estimate flow quantiles for eight sites for the dry season these sites identified in fig 9 are situated near the sites that form region 2a and were initially included within cluster 2 test sites 2 cluster 4 test sites 3 and 4 and cluster 7 test site 1 fig 7 this approach is equivalent to the estimation of daily streamflow quantiles for ungauged sites in this case however the accuracy of the method can be tested the flow quantiles of each site within a homogeneous region were estimated by eq 14 while the corresponding index flood values were estimated by averaging the daily streamflow at each site nevertheless for ungauged sites the index flood needs to be estimated indirectly from other variables in this study the index flood regionalization was developed using a regression between the catchment area km2 and the index flood m3 s 1 of the sites located in the homogenous region 2a a significant correlation between the two datasets table 4 was obtained and after some initial tests the final values of the index flood were estimated nonetheless the final value of index flood for catchments with an area of 2000 km2 had to be divided by a factor of 1 5 by way of a correction that considerably improved the results fig 12 shows the observed and estimated daily streamflow quantiles obtained for each test site in general terms the results show that the estimated daily streamflow quantiles are quite accurate considering that the test sites were not initially included in any of the homogeneous regions in fact of the eight sites considered only two have a relative rmse 45 with the others remaining very close to the maximum error bound estimated for the dry season 30 5 even so a closer look at the results obtained for test sites 2 and 8 revealed that the cause of the differences between observed and estimated quantiles appeared in the lower end of the fdcs where the observed values were very close to zero on the one hand as expected the lnse metric reflects the relative rmse characterization of the model s performance but on the other the nse values are quite high table 5 this difference is quite relevant as it highlights the advantages of using lnse as an alternative to the nse when the objective is to evaluate a model s performance in relation to low flow predictions 5 discussion and conclusions overall the results of this study enabled the identification of the most suitable pdf to approximate daily streamflow of perennial rivers in contiguous angola and to evaluate the performance of the regional frequency analysis of daily streamflow based on the l moments approach the results show that in relation to the pdfs under evaluation kap distribution is undoubtedly the best model for approximating the onsite distributions of daily streamflow in angola regardless of the dataset used annual full dataset wet and dry seasons with four parameters this distribution is quite flexible particularly when modelling distributions with significantly u shaped probability densities in addition to accuracy the model also needs to be parsimonious the gpa distribution using three parameters was therefore also identified as a good alternative to the kap distribution this conclusion is in line with the results of several other studies which identified the kap and the gpa distributions as the best models for approximating daily streamflow both in europe castellarin et al 2004 castellarin et al 2007 mendicino and senatore 2013 and in north america archfield 2009 vogel and fennessey 1993 blum et al 2017 as such the results of this study extend the proposed applicability range of these two distributions to the southern africa region surprisingly the results revealed that the models exhibited considerable difficulties in predicting the lower ends of the fdcs often predicting negative flows this mainly affected the results of the two parameter pdfs gum gev glo and ln and to a lesser degree the remaining and more complex distributions this is a limitation that has already been discussed in previous studies e g archfield 2009 blum et al 2017 and can be quite detrimental to the overall performance of some specific pdfs significantly the results obtained withthe cluster analysis combined with the definition of meannormalized fdcs for each region cluster show that when the fdcs observed during the wet season are relatively linear the pe3 distribution predicted negative flows this attribute was primarily related to the lack of dominance of fast flow surface runoff processes in the catchments and can be used as an initial screening condition to support the selection of suitable pdfs regardless of the models used in view of the impressive heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties there are still difficulties and uncertainties to be tackled in the prediction of flows from ungauged catchments sivapalan et al 2003 in general the results of this study suggest that the spatial distribution of precipitation is highly irregular across all the catchments in fact the relevant literature indicates that the climate of southern africa of which angola is a part is highly variable complex and marked by a high degree of interannual and decadal precipitation variability reason et al 2006 dieppois et al 2015 washington and preston 2006 leading to widespread drought in some areas pascale et al 2019 and widespread flooding in others pascale et al 2019 kupika et al 2018 it is a variability that had a significant affect with regard to the definition of homogeneous regions only 36 of the initial set of clusters were identified as homogeneous regions a value which is very low in comparison with the results of other studies nyeko ogiramoi et al 2012 nilo river catchment africa cassalho et al 2019 rio grande do sul catchment south america and drissia et al 2019 kerala state asia concluded that 67 50 and 100 of the total number of regions were homogeneous respectively as such our results suggest that the frequency distribution of daily streamflow observed during both seasons but particularly for the wet season across the different regions considered in the analysis is quite heterogeneous this is even more evident in the southern regions located in southern semi arid and dry sub humid zones significantly the daily streamflow quantiles estimated using the regional frequency analysis for eight test sites revealed the method s remarkable accuracy nse μ 0 86 σ 0 10 r μ 0 97 σ 0 02 when compared with previous attempts to estimate daily streamflow for ungauged sites

nse 0 86 oudin et al 2008 nse 0 70 to 0 80 overall the results suggest that in the simplest cases the serial dependence of daily streamflow can be substantially reduced with the definition of a time lag it is important to mention that this approach significantly reduced the size of the initial datasets nonetheless if needed the removed datasets can still be considered in the analysis as they are a valid and valuable sample of the observed fdcs in more complex cases a time series model of daily streamflow can be used to analyze the patterns of serial dependence implied by the model thus allowing the use of l moment based heterogeneity and goodness of fit statistics for the definition of homogenous regions considering different subsets of daily streamflow samples this means that the regional frequency analysis of daily streamflow based on the l moments approach is a plausible alternative to the use of physically based models that usually require considerable amounts of data and human effort both of which are in scant supply in africa due primarily to the lack of economic resources and consequently research personnel it is worth mentioning that while working on this project we have concluded that further research is needed in three specific areas the combined effect of different distributions on the l moments sample the testing of different cluster analysis methods and the evaluation of different methods to assess and reduce streamflow serial dependence hopefully these questions will soon be addressed if possible with longer daily streamflow datasets the study of fdcs characteristics must be expanded to other regions as a mean of improving our understanding of the impressive heterogeneity of their hydroclimatic characteristics credit authorship contribution

4121,changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events floods and droughts are one of the most significance consequences of the climate change and their monitoring is therefore essential in many fields however the number of the global in situ discharge measurements has been declining since the eighties and the global supply of available data is often restricted in many parts of world all these reasons have fostered in the last decades the exploitation of new technologies such as satellite data in the estimation of river discharge in this study satellite altimetry water level data are used to set up a consistent and up to date river discharge dataset by means of rating curves for different sites across the world long continuous river discharge time series so obtained are used to perform a trend analysis on extreme hydrological events specifically peak over threshold values are extracted from the discharge time series as proxy variables of independent extreme events and the trend analysis is then carried out to identify changes in the magnitude of extreme events the analysis permits to identify areas of the world prone to floods like the west africa or drought so that appropriate actions for disaster risk mitigation and continuous improvement in disaster preparedness response and recovery practices can be adopted keywords satellite altimetry water level products river discharge trend analysis of extreme hydrological events 1 introduction the surface water monitoring is crucial to estimate the volume of flow into the channel and quantify the available water resource to supply the human needs the global climate observing system gcos 2016 experts recognized the river discharge as an essential climate variable e g a physical variable that critically contributes to the characterization of earth s climate indeed river discharge beside the direct applications for water resources management kundzewicz et al 2008 flood forecasting masseroni et al 2017 and drought monitoring wanders et al 2015 it is implicated in the identification and adaptation of the most significant potential effects of climate change blöschl et al 2019 camici et al 2014 2017 the importance to quantify the flow of freshwater from rivers into the oceans is fundamental to the reduction of the ocean salinity and to the influence of thermohaline circulation gcos 2016 traditionally river discharge is obtained from ground based monitoring networks that indirectly quantify the instantaneous water volume flowing into the river channels through a simultaneous measure of water level river flow velocity and cross section geometry however the traditional ground based monitoring networks are expensive to install and maintain and they require considerable effort to produce reliable measurements these reasons induced the growing reduction of hydrometric monitoring networks over the world shiklomanov et al 2002 sneeuw et al 2014 above all after the 1980s crochemore et al 2020 that along with the inaccessibility of many remote areas and the difficulties for data sharing among developing countries biancamaria et al 2011 feed the need to develop new procedures for river discharge estimation based also on remote sensing technology the major challenge is the development of new methodologies and or new way to monitor river integrating remote sensing and in situ information for improving the actual conditions of river discharge monitoring on regional and global scales the most direct method of deriving such information on a global scale involves satellite earth observations over the last decade the possibility to obtain river discharge estimates from the monitoring of the hydraulic variables through satellite sensors has reached considerable interest smith 1997 alsdorf et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2019 gleason and durand 2020 the most common technique is the radar altimetry that provides water level measurements as a function of the two way return time of a radar pulse emitted from the satellite and backscattered by the liquid surface originally designed for ocean and ice covered areas monitoring almost two decades of research on the application of radar altimetry has demonstrated its advantages also for monitoring inland water providing global coverage and regular temporal sampling coe and birkett 2004 frappart et al 2006 becker et al 2014 the high accuracy of altimetry data provided by the latest spatial missions sentinel 3 and crosat 2 and the recent re elaboration of past and current satellite missions focusing on inland water see fdr4alt shape hydrocoastal projects funded by esa suggest that these data may be employed more and more for hydraulic hydrological applications with encouraging expectations birkinshaw et al 2010 getirana 2010 michailovsky et al 2013 domeneghetti et al 2021 tarpanelli et al 2013 the main advantage of radar altimetry lies on its availability on a global scale with a high spatial coverage and for a long time period from the first satellite missions skylab geos 3 seasat geosat in the seventies eighties the continuity of the monitoring was guaranteed by many satellites also coexistent i e ers 1 ers 2 topex poseidon geosat follow on jason 1 envisat jason 2 and currently hy 2a saral altika jason 3 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 the global coverage and the continuity in time favour the monitoring also for ungauged or poorly gauged catchments where sufficiently long time series of water level are missing indeed altimetry data have been available since the seventies and thanks to their high spatial coverage they can provide data on a global scale even for ungauged or poorly monitored catchments moreover its inherent constraint related to its inadequate temporal revisit time from 10 to 35 days and spatial resolution from 80 to 300 km inter track distance for hydrological applications on smaller basins was recently overcome thanks to the development of different multi mission merging approaches tourian et al 2016 2017 zakharova et al 2020 boergens et al 2017 2019 schwatke et al 2015 these approaches allow to obtain data with improved temporal and spatial resolutions through the combination of a variety of altimetry missions overcoming the limitation of poor resolutions offered by a single altimeter in addition nowadays already processed water level time series over many inland water bodies across the world are provided from different laboratories e g grrats coss et al 2016 2020 dahiti schwatke et al 2015 hydroweb theia da silva et al 2010 and from the copernicus global land service developed with the objective to provide freely accessible and easy to use satellite data to the user hydrology community the main limitation of radar altimetry is related to temporal resolution of water level time series at the virtual stations i e the intersection point between the river and the satellite altimetry track that is ranging from 10 topex poseidon and jason s family to 35 days envisat ers and saral altika for single altimeters without considering 369 days of cryosat 2 altimetry has demonstrated its potential for river discharge estimation through the use of approaches based on empirical formulas negrel et al 2011 hydraulic models domeneghetti et al 2014 assimilation techniques michailovsky et al 2013 and rating curve kouraev et al 2004 leon et al 2006 rating curve is a functional law linking the water levels to the river discharges for a specific section of the river the rating curve is strictly related to a specific section of the river where data of water level and discharge are available if the periods of data availability are not coincident condition quite common if satellite and ground data are used other techniques were developed that match the probability density function of both the time series tourian et al 2013 in order to obtain discharge value from altimetry water level in view of recent dramatic floods and drought events detection of trends in the magnitude of long time series of flood data is of scientific interest and practical importance it is essential for the planning of future water resources and flood protection systems where system design is traditionally based on the assumption of stationarity in hydrological processes such as river stage or discharge besides the large interest in this topic most studies have only analysed a few rivers e g bacová mitková and halmová 2014 or at most a region e g bard et al 2012 or a single country e g petrow and merz 2009 and overall it is difficult to issue a general statement on flood changes across the world due to the diversity of processes different observation periods and the variety of methods applied for trend detection hall et al 2014 furthermore little work has been published for the global scale or for several important landmasses including africa and large parts of eurasia single exceptions were recently presented by do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2019 and crochemore et al 2020 in particular crochemore et al 2020 proposed a method for assessing the quality of freely accessible ground based river flow time series worldwide 21 586 time series from 13 data providers by means of a composite indicator obtained by estimating a range of quality assurance characteristics availability homogeneity outliers and trends the outcomes showed that the data availability is the first limitation of the quality assurance with more than half of the stations with low availability in particular about 6 908 stations 32 did not have long enough records to perform a trend analysis within the period of interest 1961 2019 these results reflect the drastic downward trend in discharge data availability which has been affecting all continents starting from 1980s and represent an important limitation for reliable statistical analyses of hydrologic variables indeed according to yue et al 2002 who investigated the power of the hypothesis tests commonly used in hydrological studies to detect monotonic trends mann kendall test and spearman s rho test the power of the test to properly assess trends in a time series is an increasing function of the sample size of the random variable generally large scale flood studies fill the gaps in measurements with modelled river flows i e by using rainfall runoff models rojas et al 2012 alfieri et al 2014 winsemius et al 2013 or statistical methods e g smith et al 2015 whereas the exploitation of satellite observations and in particular of altimetry data for this purpose is actually at infancy state few examples are available for orinoco león et al 2011 gange brahmaputra papa et al 2012 amazon zakharova et al 2006 ob kouraev et al 2004 rivers and regard the use of rating curve to derive river discharge by the altimetry nowadays no studies addressed the statistical analyses of long time series of altimetry derived river discharge with the purpose of detect trends on extreme events compared with the large amount of studies focused on oceanographic field for the evaluation of the global mean sea level trends ablain et al 2009 the number of available analyses on the altimetry global trend on inland water is considerably reduced and it is mainly dedicated to the continuous monitoring of lakes and inland seas e g crétaux and birkett 2006 hwang et al 2016 tan et al 2017 in this study satellite altimetry water level data are used to set up a consistent continuous and up to date up to 2019 river discharge dataset for different sites across the world in the attempt to overcome the lack of in situ observed time series satellite derived water levels provided by publicly available datasets grrats dahiti river lake hydroweb and theia are used along with available ground observed river discharge data to estimate rating curves once validated the rating curves are used to fill and extrapolate river discharge data over the whole period of altimetry water level observations the exploitation of water level observations provided by the various datasets allowed to take advantage of the different spatial and temporal resolutions and coverages of the provided data enabling to extend the study on a global scale and to efficiently perform the analysis even for small to medium sized basins in the end long continuous river discharge time series so obtained were used to perform a trend analysis on extreme flood events occurred up to 2019 overcoming the issue of data availability typical of the in situ river discharge observation networks the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the datasets of in situ discharge data and altimetry water level time series collected to perform the analysis section 3 describes the methods employed to reconstruct river discharge data from altimetry derived water level time series and to perform the trend analysis within the period of interest 1970 2019 section 4 discusses the results obtained also illustrating the performances of the method applied and finally section 5 presents the conclusions of the study 2 datasets 2 1 the datasets collected in this study comprise in situ daily river discharge data and altimetry water level time series in situ observations of daily river discharge m3 s were collected for several pilot sites all over the world to perform a global trend analysis involving different basin sizes and climatic areas in particular the pilot sites were selected considering stations with a remarkable lack of in situ rive discharge observations and taking into account the simultaneous availability of satellite data for the discharge reconstruction from that a total amount of 58 pilot sites belonging to many of the major river catchments across the world were considered in the analysis the geographical locations of the ground stations considered in the study are shown in fig 1 no stations have been considered for the analysis in oceania central and north america and europe except for very few sites where up to date river discharge data were not available according to crochemore et al 2020 indeed these countries have the best data availability oceania is the continent with the highest amount of available data with 60 of its stations with more than 35 years of observations within the reference period of their study 1961 2019 followed by europe and north and central america with almost 30 of their stations spanning 35 years of records in contrast in asia and africa the data availability and station density are strongly reduced especially since the 1980s where the number of active stations drastically dropped to almost zero and to 20 respectively in situ river discharge measurements were collected from two freely accessible databases the global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de grdc a unique collection of river discharge data on a global scale operating under the auspices of the world meteorological organization and the hydro geochemistry of amazonian basin hybam https hybam obs mip fr focused on monitoring rivers and water resources in the amazon the data collected consist of very heterogeneous discharge observations in terms of temporal continuity and coverage as highlighted in fig 2 ground stations with up to date observations were included in the analysis to validate the methodology applied for the river discharge estimation table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the pilot sites selected for the analysis in particular the stations were grouped depending on the climate classification proposed by köppen 1936 and information about their geographical location and the available observation period of river discharge time series are provided the observation period refers to the overall data availability without considering gaps within the records information provided in fig 2 in this study satellite derived water level time series were collected from five datasets the global river radar altimeter time series grrats developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and freely available through the physical oceanography distributed active archive center po daac coss et al 2016 2020 database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti developed by the deutsches geodätisches forschungsinstitut der technischen universität münchen schwatke et al 2015 river lake product developed by the european space agency berry et al 1997 hydroweb developed by the laboratoire d etudes en geophysique et oceanographie spatiales crétaux et al 2011 da silva et al 2010 theia data and service center where hydroweb water level products are now a fully operational service table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the datasets described above satellite derived river water level time series are provided at specific locations called virtual stations vss corresponding to the intersection of the satellite track with the river reach those available in the considered datasets are all illustrated in fig 1 3 method the approach here proposed is based on three main steps 1 the selection procedure of the altimetry water level time series based on the location of the in situ discharge gauging stations 2 the estimation of river discharge time series through statistical and empirical rating curves 3 evaluation of the climatic trend 3 1 selection of altimetry water level time series in order to extend and fill the river discharge time series at the selected ground sites all virtual stations located along the main river course and close to the gauging station were chosen with a specific selection criterion in particular all available information provided by the different altimetric datasets of the close virtual stations due to their heterogeneous spatiotemporal coverage was exploited to reconstruct the single river discharge series at the in situ station specifically the selection process consisted in the identification from each altimetry dataset of all the nearest vss to the in situ river discharge gauging station within a maximum distance from the reference location of about 300 km both upstream and downstream all the vss located upstream or downstream of river confluences and bifurcations or located over possible tributaries and distributaries were excluded whereas for those selected it was assumed that the contribution of the intermediate drainage areas between the gauging station and each vs was proportional to the contribution at the gauging station as a result depending on the altimetry dataset considered water level time series with different temporal coverages and resolution were obtained fig 3 is an example of the selection process carried out for the kandaji gauging station in the niger river the red dot identifies the position of the in situ station the crosses with different colours identify the vss extracted from different altimetry datasets fig 3a the altimetry water level and the river discharge time series with different temporal coverages so obtained are illustrated in fig 3b and fig 3c respectively in this case as in many others satellite water level time series from different vss overlap each other for several time spans see fig 3 and in two cases they are simultaneous with the river discharge time series e g with vs1 for the period 1995 2002 and with vs5 for the period 1993 2002 3 2 rating curves rating curves rc traditionally are empirical functional relations hereafter empirical rating curves obtained from a power law equation applied between simultaneous river discharge q and water depth measurements h specifically q m3 s can be expressed as 1 q f h α h h 0 β where h m is the water level above a vertical reference h 0 m is the level corresponding to zero flow rate above the same reference α m3 β s and β are two parameters to be estimated this relation strictly depends upon the geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the reference river cross section and allows to indirectly obtain continuous streamflow records from water level ones the main limitation of such a procedure is that the requirement of simultaneous availability of river discharge and water level measurements is rarely fulfilled when satellite altimetry is involved in the definition of rating curves to cope with this issue tourian et al 2013 proposed a statistical modelling approach based on the demonstration that if water level and discharge data are highly interdependent their relationship is a non decreasing function based on that they proposed to model the functional relationship between water level and discharge by means of their quantile functions q instead of employing the data itself 2 q q f q h the quantile function is obtained by coupling the sorted ascendingly water level and river discharge data with the probability p 3 p i k i n 1 where k i is the rank value assigned to each i element of the sorted sample of measurements and n represents the respective sample size the main steps of the procedure to obtain statistical rating curves are schematized in fig 4 in order to obtain the quantile functions of water level and river discharge data the measurements were sorted in ascending order independently from each other and then were evaluated the probabilities of the sorted water level and discharge values were computed the statistical rating curve is then achieved by fitting a quadratic curve over water level and discharge data extrapolated from their corresponding quantile functions at assigned probability values the requirement of simultaneous measurements is therefore eliminated providing the capability of estimate river flow from satellite altimetry even for those sites where this requirement is not fulfilled in this study both empirical and statistical approaches are used to estimate rating curves coupling in situ daily discharge measurements and satellite derived water level time series specifically for those vss where synchronous data of water level and in situ river discharge measurements were available both empirical and statistical rcs were estimated this allowed to make a comparison between the two approaches conversely for sites where concurrent water level and river discharge measurements were not available only the statistical rc were estimated radar altimetry provides instantaneous water level measurements relative to a reference ellipsoid however as it can be seen in fig 3 the altimeter satellite tracks almost never intersect the river reach at the location of the gauging station producing and offset among the different time series proportional to the relative geographical location of each vs therefore to simplify the comparisons of the regression analysis results both statistical and empirical rating curves are obtained considering water level anomalies at each vs instead of their absolute values 3 3 reconstruction of river discharge time series for every vs selected at session 3 1 rcs empirical and or statistical were independently defined to reconstruct the river discharge time series within the altimetry time period this procedure provides several discontinuous river discharge time series one for each vs spanning the period 1993 2019 with some overlapping periods depending on the altimetry dataset used therefore a merging procedure was applied to combine the satellite derived discharge time series and therefore obtain a single long consistent river discharge time series fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 are reported to clarify the applied procedure the plots of fig 5 show the statistical and the empirical rcs estimated for the six vss selected near the kandaji gauging station in the niger river see fig 3 as it can be noted for vs1 and vs5 both the statistical and empirical rcs were estimated consequently two satellite derived river discharge time series were obtained for the same vs for the other vss due to the lack of synchronous water level and river discharge measurements only statistical rcs and therefore one satellite derived river discharge time series were derived all the rating curves built for the different vss are referred to the same in situ river discharge both in the empirical and the statistical approaches rating curves are achieved by fitting a quadratic curve over discharge and water level data however in many cases the regression analysis returned results of physical meaningless where negative river discharge values correspond to the smallest water level data range this was the case for example of the statistical rating curves obtained for vs1 vs3 and vs5 of kandaji gauging station fig 6 to overcome this issue the following iterative procedure was applied the sample of water level and the corresponding satellite derived discharge data obtained by fitting a quadratic curve rc over the whole data sample blue dashed lines in fig 6 was firstly sorted in ascending order with respect to water level data and then divided into two groups considering as a threshold value the water level corresponding to the first positive discharge value two different rcs were then fitted over the two data samples so obtained and it was verified that there were no longer negative satellite derived discharge values if this condition was not fulfilled the water level threshold value was iteratively shifted towards larger values until no negative discharge data were obtained from both the two rating curves for reasons of continuity and regularity the overall rc used to extrapolate satellite derived discharge values at each iteration was obtained by imposing the continuity of the two rcs at the threshold value red markers in fig 6 at which the same tangent for the two quadratic curves was imposed black straight lines in fig 6 the red dashed lines in fig 6 represent the final rcs obtained at the end of the iterative procedure the plots in fig 6 summarized the results of the iterative procedure applied to the statistical rcs however the same method was used to the empirical ones when necessary the satellite derived river discharge time series finally estimated by using both the empirical and the statistical rcs for the kandaji gauging station over the period 1993 2019 are illustrated in fig 7 grey lines in the figure delineate the limits of the overlapping periods yellow highlighted areas occurring among the satellite derived river discharge time series the altimetry water level time series could exhibit relative differences between various datasets those inconsistencies can be attributed to multiple reasons the most obvious regard the different satellite missions considered in each dataset see table 2 and the distinct processing strategies applied to the raw satellite data therefore if not accurately investigated and resolved before performing a data merging process they could lead to a highly noisy time series therefore in order to obtain a single and consistent satellite derived discharge time series at each gauging station a single representative time series for every overlapping period was considered among those obtained from the different datasets the choice was simply based on a trade off between the number of reconstructed discharge data within the reference period and the overall error budget of each satellite derived time series with the aim to obtain a dense and accurate time series from a quantitative point of view the mean absolute error mae was firstly computed for each satellite derived discharge data sample and then the minimum value of the ratio between the squared mae and the discharge data size was used to choose the best reconstructed discharge time series within each overlapping period this procedure was independently applied for both the time series obtained through the two approaches statistical and empirical see fig 7 in this regard for what concern the discharge time series obtained from the statistical rcs the mae was computed through a comparison between the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and reconstructed river discharge obtained considering the entire observation period whereas for those obtained with the empirical approach the error was estimated just by considering the observed and satellite derived discharge values within the intersection period of altimetry and in situ measurements where synchronous values of reconstructed and observed river discharge were available in the end to obtain the final satellite derived discharge time series a comparison between the performances of the empirical and statistical approaches was made this analysis was performed considering the discharge time series obtained for all the vss where both methods could be applied at the same time e g vs1 and vs5 for kandaji gauging station see fig 5 in order to allow a direct comparison of the two approaches the performances of the empirical and the statistical methods were evaluated computing the relative root mean square error rrmse i e the root mean square error normalized with respect to the range of in situ discharge measurements max min it is evaluated between the ground observed and satellite derived discharge time series obtained through the two approaches within the overlapping period synchronous data the same metric was employed to evaluate the overall error budget of the final reconstructed discharge time series in this case the error metric was calculated considering the cumulative distribution functions of the in situ and satellite derived discharge data to make the results comparable among all the satellite derived discharge time series fig 8 summarized the presented methodology to estimate satellite derived discharge time series from multiple satellite altimetry water level datasets at a reference location 3 4 trend analysis to perform the trend analysis peak over threshold pot values were extracted from the river discharge time series as proxy variables of extreme events as pot series should contain independent peak flows greater than a given threshold cunnane 1973 madsen et al 1997 mangini et al 2018 a criterion to correctly extract flow values has to be defined following previous studies mallakpour and villarini 2015 a minimum period of 15 days was chosen to classify as independent two successive events the threshold was set equal to the 80th 50th and 20th percentiles to perform the trend analysis on high median and low flood events respectively it has to be noted that the choice of pot80 and pot20 instead of pot 90 95 and pot 10 5 see e g gudmundsson et al 2019 to represent high and low flow conditions has been driven by the fact that the river discharge time series reconstructed through the altimetry water level can have a temporal resolution ranging from a minimum of about 10 days to a maximum of about 45 days for that the reconstructed river discharge time series can underestimate overestimate the real observed maximum minimum flood peak the trend analysis was carried out to identify changes in the magnitude of extreme events for that the mann kendall m k mann 1945 kendall 1975 test was performed to statistically assess if there is a monotonic trend of the variable of interest over time for the m k test the s statistic have to be computed as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where n is the number of data points x j and x i are the data values at times i and j j i and sgn x j x i is the sign function equal to 1 if x j is greater than x i and 1 if x j is less than x i the mean of s is zero and the variance can be computed as kendall 1975 5 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t t 1 2 t 5 18 where m is the number of group of tied ranks each with t tied observations finally m k is designated by z douglas et al 2000 6 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 the existence of a trend was assessed at the significance level of 10 i e the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z 1 645 to determine the magnitude of the trend the sen theil slope estimator sen 1968 was applied 7 β m e d i a n x j x i j i where β is the sen s slope estimate positive β values indicate the presence of upward trend in the time series the opposite occurs for negative β values to make trend estimates from catchments with different sizes and from different climates comparable following previous studies stahl et al 2012 gudmundsson et al 2019 the trend t for each time series was expressed as the percent change over the period of record of n years as 8 t mn x 100 where m m3 s is the slope of the trend and x m3 s is the mean of pot time series for the period 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of altimetry virtual stations with respect to the initial criterion for the selection of virtual stations within a maximum distance of about 300 km the automatic procedure excluded the satellite derived discharge time series less performing providing the final average distance between the vss and the in situ stations of about 100 km this means that for most of the cases the more representative vss are located quite close to the reference in situ station only 7 pilot sites out of the 58 selected for the analysis required time series of vss located at a distance bigger than 300 km from the in situ stations this was mainly due to an insufficient number of closer vss with available water level data adequate to extend the discharge time series these 7 pilot sites are listed below ob river at belogor ye two vss at a distance of around 500 km orinoco river

for those virtual stations where synchronous data of water level and in situ discharge measurements were available both empirical and statistical rating curves were created to make a comparison between the two approaches fig 5 the traditional empirical approach as expected always showed better performances than the statistical one for example fig 9 shows the results obtained for vs1 and vs5 selected for the kandaji gauging station niger river in both cases the empirical approach exhibits better performance with respect to the statistical one with a rrmse value of 16 94 of the empirical approach versus 19 07 of the statistical one for vs1 and 16 5 versus 20 28 respectively for vs5 fig 10 summarizes the difference between the mean rrmse values obtained for the two approaches considering that for every site multiple vss were potentially selected to reconstruct the final discharge time series the mean values of the rrmse were used to summarize the outcomes of the two approaches for each pilot site as stated above all the investigated stations show better performances for the empirical approach which always has reduced mean rrmse values with respect to the statistical one negative differences however the comparison reveals a good potential of the statistical approach whose mean rrmse values differ little from those obtained with the empirical one with all the performance differences lower than 0 12 white circles in the figure correspond to pilot sites where there were no synchronous measurements therefore the comparison between the two methods was not allowed considering the results shown above to obtain the final satellite derived discharge time series statistical derived discharge data were only used to fill gaps and extend river flow time series obtained with the empirical approach for example in fig 11 is illustrated the final discharge time series reconstructed for the kandaji gauging station 4 3 reconstruction of river discharge time series in this section river discharge time series resulting from the methodology described in section 3 3 are presented for almost all the pilot sites discharge data were reconstructed over a period from 14 years 2002 2016 whereas it reaches 27 years 1993 2019 for those gauging stations where a notable amount of altimetry water level data was available fig 12 concerning the average temporal resolution it ranges from a minimum of about 10 days to a maximum of about 45 days depending on the satellite water level time series involved in the reconstruction of the discharge time series because of the numerous pilot sites considered in the analysis 58 hereinafter only the results obtained for some representative locations are illustrated and described more in detail these locations were selected in order to illustrate the outcomes of this analysis for a representative sample of stations located over different climatic areas tropical temperate continental and dry fig 13 shows the outcomes obtained in situ discharge observations are plotted in blue whereas the overall reconstructed discharge time series are shown in red the computation of the error was carried out comparing the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and reconstructed discharge data in order to allow the estimate even for the time series reconstructed with the statistical approach only fig 14 shows the results for all the pilot sites involved in the analysis and the outcomes demonstrate the good potential of altimetry data in the estimation of river discharge with a median rrmse value equal to 0 04 4 4 trend analysis in this section the results of the trend magnitude analysis are presented the study was performed considering two different periods the former from 1970 to 1999 in which the analysis was carried out taking into account mainly in situ river discharge observations the latter from 1990 to 2019 where only the satellite derived discharge time series were involved in the trend magnitude assessment results are illustrated in fig 15 the first column illustrates the trend magnitude of high flow events 80th percentile median flow 50th percentile and low flow 20th percentile for the period 1970 1999 whereas the second column refers to the second period the crosses in the images indicate sites with no significant trend pvalue in the m k test greater than 0 1 whereas the red and blues triangles indicate sites with significant negative or positive trend negative or positive t values respectively significant trends are obtained only for a few stations among the ones analysed in particular a predominant negative trend can be noted in the period 1970 1999 especially in africa and for some stations in north asia for pot80 and pot50 no clear picture emerged from pot20 for the same period some stations in west africa in southeastern south america and east asia show a wetting trend whereas significant decreasing trends are present in central part of south america west and south africa although for analysis periods slightly different the patterns here obtained for pot 80 and pot50 are in agreement with the ones found by gudmundsson et al 2019 and crochemore et al 2020 with a decreasing trend for west africa and a no consistent pattern for the stations in south america interesting is the reversed trend pattern obtained in the more recent analysis period for pot80 and pot50 in particular remarkable results were obtained over west africa where the inversion of trend from negative about 35 in the period 1970 1999 to positive about 43 in the period 1990 2019 values for high and median flows corroborates the already known sahelian paradox descroix et al 2013 the findings obtained by tramblay et al 2020 and sidibe et al 2018 for the area in particular sidibe et al 2018 reconstructed a streamflow dataset for 152 gauging stations located in west and central africa to quantify flow changes over the 1950 2005 period they found negative trends in sahelian regions over the period 1970 1993 and a reversed pattern during the successive 13 year period 1993 2005 mainly linked to increased extreme rainfall and changes in land use in these regions the work of tramblay et al 2020 demonstrates the existence of change points around 1980s on the annual maximum river discharge time series observed in west africa and highlights an upward trend on the time series for the period 1980 2010 with respect to these two studies the present work confirms for the more recent period up to 2019 the existence of a significant wetter trend in west africa as floods represent one of the most important cause of fatalities in africa the results of this study clearly point out the potential in the use of the altimeter data for flood risk monitoring and communication 5 conclusions in this study satellite altimetry water level data are used to set up a consistent and up to date discharge dataset for different sites across the world satellite derived river discharge data are obtained by means of rating curves functional relations linking the water levels to the river discharges for a specific section of the river in this regard two different approaches are used the empirical traditional approach where rating curves are obtained by fitting a quadratic curve over a data sample of synchronous measurements of water level and discharge empirical rating curve the statistical approach where the rating curves are achieved employing the quantile functions of the two datasets instead of the data itself statistical rating curve considering the better performances of the empirical method the statistical approach was used just to extend and fill gaps of the empirical derived discharge time series when synchronous data of satellite derived water level and in situ discharge were not available long robust river discharge time series so obtained are then used to perform a trend analysis on extreme hydrological events on this purpose the mann kendall m k test was performed to statistically assess if there is a monotonic trend whereas the sen theil slope estimator was applied to determine the magnitude of trend if present the outcomes demonstrate the good potential of altimetry data to reconstruct river discharge even for those sites where a remarkable lack of in situ available data is present for almost all the pilot sites discharge data were reconstructed over a period from 14 years 2002 2016 to about 27 years 1993 2019 for those gauging stations where a notable amount of altimetry water level data was available the good performances of altimetry data are furthermore highlighted by the good agreements obtained in terms of rrmse with all values less than 15 showing a good consistency between the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and the estimated discharge values finally for what concerns the trend magnitude analysis remarkable results were obtained in west africa where consistently with studies based solely on in situ data an inversion of trend was observed between 1970 1999 and 1990 2019 periods offering the possibility to continuously monitor the terrestrial water dynamics the trend analysis based on altimeter data allow trend analysis studies to be extended into the more recent period overcoming the critical issue of data availability of the in situ river discharge observation networks this approach will be highly relevant for all sites where the traditional monitoring is dismissed and in particular for developing countries in which the risk of extreme events and the water management are more relevant future efforts will be made to improve satellite derived discharge dataset collecting a larger number of sites across the world and implementing a

4121,changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events floods and droughts are one of the most significance consequences of the climate change and their monitoring is therefore essential in many fields however the number of the global in situ discharge measurements has been declining since the eighties and the global supply of available data is often restricted in many parts of world all these reasons have fostered in the last decades the exploitation of new technologies such as satellite data in the estimation of river discharge in this study satellite altimetry water level data are used to set up a consistent and up to date river discharge dataset by means of rating curves for different sites across the world long continuous river discharge time series so obtained are used to perform a trend analysis on extreme hydrological events specifically peak over threshold values are extracted from the discharge time series as proxy variables of independent extreme events and the trend analysis is then carried out to identify changes in the magnitude of extreme events the analysis permits to identify areas of the world prone to floods like the west africa or drought so that appropriate actions for disaster risk mitigation and continuous improvement in disaster preparedness response and recovery practices can be adopted keywords satellite altimetry water level products river discharge trend analysis of extreme hydrological events 1 introduction the surface water monitoring is crucial to estimate the volume of flow into the channel and quantify the available water resource to supply the human needs the global climate observing system gcos 2016 experts recognized the river discharge as an essential climate variable e g a physical variable that critically contributes to the characterization of earth s climate indeed river discharge beside the direct applications for water resources management kundzewicz et al 2008 flood forecasting masseroni et al 2017 and drought monitoring wanders et al 2015 it is implicated in the identification and adaptation of the most significant potential effects of climate change blöschl et al 2019 camici et al 2014 2017 the importance to quantify the flow of freshwater from rivers into the oceans is fundamental to the reduction of the ocean salinity and to the influence of thermohaline circulation gcos 2016 traditionally river discharge is obtained from ground based monitoring networks that indirectly quantify the instantaneous water volume flowing into the river channels through a simultaneous measure of water level river flow velocity and cross section geometry however the traditional ground based monitoring networks are expensive to install and maintain and they require considerable effort to produce reliable measurements these reasons induced the growing reduction of hydrometric monitoring networks over the world shiklomanov et al 2002 sneeuw et al 2014 above all after the 1980s crochemore et al 2020 that along with the inaccessibility of many remote areas and the difficulties for data sharing among developing countries biancamaria et al 2011 feed the need to develop new procedures for river discharge estimation based also on remote sensing technology the major challenge is the development of new methodologies and or new way to monitor river integrating remote sensing and in situ information for improving the actual conditions of river discharge monitoring on regional and global scales the most direct method of deriving such information on a global scale involves satellite earth observations over the last decade the possibility to obtain river discharge estimates from the monitoring of the hydraulic variables through satellite sensors has reached considerable interest smith 1997 alsdorf et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2019 gleason and durand 2020 the most common technique is the radar altimetry that provides water level measurements as a function of the two way return time of a radar pulse emitted from the satellite and backscattered by the liquid surface originally designed for ocean and ice covered areas monitoring almost two decades of research on the application of radar altimetry has demonstrated its advantages also for monitoring inland water providing global coverage and regular temporal sampling coe and birkett 2004 frappart et al 2006 becker et al 2014 the high accuracy of altimetry data provided by the latest spatial missions sentinel 3 and crosat 2 and the recent re elaboration of past and current satellite missions focusing on inland water see fdr4alt shape hydrocoastal projects funded by esa suggest that these data may be employed more and more for hydraulic hydrological applications with encouraging expectations birkinshaw et al 2010 getirana 2010 michailovsky et al 2013 domeneghetti et al 2021 tarpanelli et al 2013 the main advantage of radar altimetry lies on its availability on a global scale with a high spatial coverage and for a long time period from the first satellite missions skylab geos 3 seasat geosat in the seventies eighties the continuity of the monitoring was guaranteed by many satellites also coexistent i e ers 1 ers 2 topex poseidon geosat follow on jason 1 envisat jason 2 and currently hy 2a saral altika jason 3 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 the global coverage and the continuity in time favour the monitoring also for ungauged or poorly gauged catchments where sufficiently long time series of water level are missing indeed altimetry data have been available since the seventies and thanks to their high spatial coverage they can provide data on a global scale even for ungauged or poorly monitored catchments moreover its inherent constraint related to its inadequate temporal revisit time from 10 to 35 days and spatial resolution from 80 to 300 km inter track distance for hydrological applications on smaller basins was recently overcome thanks to the development of different multi mission merging approaches tourian et al 2016 2017 zakharova et al 2020 boergens et al 2017 2019 schwatke et al 2015 these approaches allow to obtain data with improved temporal and spatial resolutions through the combination of a variety of altimetry missions overcoming the limitation of poor resolutions offered by a single altimeter in addition nowadays already processed water level time series over many inland water bodies across the world are provided from different laboratories e g grrats coss et al 2016 2020 dahiti schwatke et al 2015 hydroweb theia da silva et al 2010 and from the copernicus global land service developed with the objective to provide freely accessible and easy to use satellite data to the user hydrology community the main limitation of radar altimetry is related to temporal resolution of water level time series at the virtual stations i e the intersection point between the river and the satellite altimetry track that is ranging from 10 topex poseidon and jason s family to 35 days envisat ers and saral altika for single altimeters without considering 369 days of cryosat 2 altimetry has demonstrated its potential for river discharge estimation through the use of approaches based on empirical formulas negrel et al 2011 hydraulic models domeneghetti et al 2014 assimilation techniques michailovsky et al 2013 and rating curve kouraev et al 2004 leon et al 2006 rating curve is a functional law linking the water levels to the river discharges for a specific section of the river the rating curve is strictly related to a specific section of the river where data of water level and discharge are available if the periods of data availability are not coincident condition quite common if satellite and ground data are used other techniques were developed that match the probability density function of both the time series tourian et al 2013 in order to obtain discharge value from altimetry water level in view of recent dramatic floods and drought events detection of trends in the magnitude of long time series of flood data is of scientific interest and practical importance it is essential for the planning of future water resources and flood protection systems where system design is traditionally based on the assumption of stationarity in hydrological processes such as river stage or discharge besides the large interest in this topic most studies have only analysed a few rivers e g bacová mitková and halmová 2014 or at most a region e g bard et al 2012 or a single country e g petrow and merz 2009 and overall it is difficult to issue a general statement on flood changes across the world due to the diversity of processes different observation periods and the variety of methods applied for trend detection hall et al 2014 furthermore little work has been published for the global scale or for several important landmasses including africa and large parts of eurasia single exceptions were recently presented by do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2019 and crochemore et al 2020 in particular crochemore et al 2020 proposed a method for assessing the quality of freely accessible ground based river flow time series worldwide 21 586 time series from 13 data providers by means of a composite indicator obtained by estimating a range of quality assurance characteristics availability homogeneity outliers and trends the outcomes showed that the data availability is the first limitation of the quality assurance with more than half of the stations with low availability in particular about 6 908 stations 32 did not have long enough records to perform a trend analysis within the period of interest 1961 2019 these results reflect the drastic downward trend in discharge data availability which has been affecting all continents starting from 1980s and represent an important limitation for reliable statistical analyses of hydrologic variables indeed according to yue et al 2002 who investigated the power of the hypothesis tests commonly used in hydrological studies to detect monotonic trends mann kendall test and spearman s rho test the power of the test to properly assess trends in a time series is an increasing function of the sample size of the random variable generally large scale flood studies fill the gaps in measurements with modelled river flows i e by using rainfall runoff models rojas et al 2012 alfieri et al 2014 winsemius et al 2013 or statistical methods e g smith et al 2015 whereas the exploitation of satellite observations and in particular of altimetry data for this purpose is actually at infancy state few examples are available for orinoco león et al 2011 gange brahmaputra papa et al 2012 amazon zakharova et al 2006 ob kouraev et al 2004 rivers and regard the use of rating curve to derive river discharge by the altimetry nowadays no studies addressed the statistical analyses of long time series of altimetry derived river discharge with the purpose of detect trends on extreme events compared with the large amount of studies focused on oceanographic field for the evaluation of the global mean sea level trends ablain et al 2009 the number of available analyses on the altimetry global trend on inland water is considerably reduced and it is mainly dedicated to the continuous monitoring of lakes and inland seas e g crétaux and birkett 2006 hwang et al 2016 tan et al 2017 in this study satellite altimetry water level data are used to set up a consistent continuous and up to date up to 2019 river discharge dataset for different sites across the world in the attempt to overcome the lack of in situ observed time series satellite derived water levels provided by publicly available datasets grrats dahiti river lake hydroweb and theia are used along with available ground observed river discharge data to estimate rating curves once validated the rating curves are used to fill and extrapolate river discharge data over the whole period of altimetry water level observations the exploitation of water level observations provided by the various datasets allowed to take advantage of the different spatial and temporal resolutions and coverages of the provided data enabling to extend the study on a global scale and to efficiently perform the analysis even for small to medium sized basins in the end long continuous river discharge time series so obtained were used to perform a trend analysis on extreme flood events occurred up to 2019 overcoming the issue of data availability typical of the in situ river discharge observation networks the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the datasets of in situ discharge data and altimetry water level time series collected to perform the analysis section 3 describes the methods employed to reconstruct river discharge data from altimetry derived water level time series and to perform the trend analysis within the period of interest 1970 2019 section 4 discusses the results obtained also illustrating the performances of the method applied and finally section 5 presents the conclusions of the study 2 datasets 2 1 the datasets collected in this study comprise in situ daily river discharge data and altimetry water level time series in situ observations of daily river discharge m3 s were collected for several pilot sites all over the world to perform a global trend analysis involving different basin sizes and climatic areas in particular the pilot sites were selected considering stations with a remarkable lack of in situ rive discharge observations and taking into account the simultaneous availability of satellite data for the discharge reconstruction from that a total amount of 58 pilot sites belonging to many of the major river catchments across the world were considered in the analysis the geographical locations of the ground stations considered in the study are shown in fig 1 no stations have been considered for the analysis in oceania central and north america and europe except for very few sites where up to date river discharge data were not available according to crochemore et al 2020 indeed these countries have the best data availability oceania is the continent with the highest amount of available data with 60 of its stations with more than 35 years of observations within the reference period of their study 1961 2019 followed by europe and north and central america with almost 30 of their stations spanning 35 years of records in contrast in asia and africa the data availability and station density are strongly reduced especially since the 1980s where the number of active stations drastically dropped to almost zero and to 20 respectively in situ river discharge measurements were collected from two freely accessible databases the global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de grdc a unique collection of river discharge data on a global scale operating under the auspices of the world meteorological organization and the hydro geochemistry of amazonian basin hybam https hybam obs mip fr focused on monitoring rivers and water resources in the amazon the data collected consist of very heterogeneous discharge observations in terms of temporal continuity and coverage as highlighted in fig 2 ground stations with up to date observations were included in the analysis to validate the methodology applied for the river discharge estimation table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the pilot sites selected for the analysis in particular the stations were grouped depending on the climate classification proposed by köppen 1936 and information about their geographical location and the available observation period of river discharge time series are provided the observation period refers to the overall data availability without considering gaps within the records information provided in fig 2 in this study satellite derived water level time series were collected from five datasets the global river radar altimeter time series grrats developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and freely available through the physical oceanography distributed active archive center po daac coss et al 2016 2020 database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti developed by the deutsches geodätisches forschungsinstitut der technischen universität münchen schwatke et al 2015 river lake product developed by the european space agency berry et al 1997 hydroweb developed by the laboratoire d etudes en geophysique et oceanographie spatiales crétaux et al 2011 da silva et al 2010 theia data and service center where hydroweb water level products are now a fully operational service table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the datasets described above satellite derived river water level time series are provided at specific locations called virtual stations vss corresponding to the intersection of the satellite track with the river reach those available in the considered datasets are all illustrated in fig 1 3 method the approach here proposed is based on three main steps 1 the selection procedure of the altimetry water level time series based on the location of the in situ discharge gauging stations 2 the estimation of river discharge time series through statistical and empirical rating curves 3 evaluation of the climatic trend 3 1 selection of altimetry water level time series in order to extend and fill the river discharge time series at the selected ground sites all virtual stations located along the main river course and close to the gauging station were chosen with a specific selection criterion in particular all available information provided by the different altimetric datasets of the close virtual stations due to their heterogeneous spatiotemporal coverage was exploited to reconstruct the single river discharge series at the in situ station specifically the selection process consisted in the identification from each altimetry dataset of all the nearest vss to the in situ river discharge gauging station within a maximum distance from the reference location of about 300 km both upstream and downstream all the vss located upstream or downstream of river confluences and bifurcations or located over possible tributaries and distributaries were excluded whereas for those selected it was assumed that the contribution of the intermediate drainage areas between the gauging station and each vs was proportional to the contribution at the gauging station as a result depending on the altimetry dataset considered water level time series with different temporal coverages and resolution were obtained fig 3 is an example of the selection process carried out for the kandaji gauging station in the niger river the red dot identifies the position of the in situ station the crosses with different colours identify the vss extracted from different altimetry datasets fig 3a the altimetry water level and the river discharge time series with different temporal coverages so obtained are illustrated in fig 3b and fig 3c respectively in this case as in many others satellite water level time series from different vss overlap each other for several time spans see fig 3 and in two cases they are simultaneous with the river discharge time series e g with vs1 for the period 1995 2002 and with vs5 for the period 1993 2002 3 2 rating curves rating curves rc traditionally are empirical functional relations hereafter empirical rating curves obtained from a power law equation applied between simultaneous river discharge q and water depth measurements h specifically q m3 s can be expressed as 1 q f h α h h 0 β where h m is the water level above a vertical reference h 0 m is the level corresponding to zero flow rate above the same reference α m3 β s and β are two parameters to be estimated this relation strictly depends upon the geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the reference river cross section and allows to indirectly obtain continuous streamflow records from water level ones the main limitation of such a procedure is that the requirement of simultaneous availability of river discharge and water level measurements is rarely fulfilled when satellite altimetry is involved in the definition of rating curves to cope with this issue tourian et al 2013 proposed a statistical modelling approach based on the demonstration that if water level and discharge data are highly interdependent their relationship is a non decreasing function based on that they proposed to model the functional relationship between water level and discharge by means of their quantile functions q instead of employing the data itself 2 q q f q h the quantile function is obtained by coupling the sorted ascendingly water level and river discharge data with the probability p 3 p i k i n 1 where k i is the rank value assigned to each i element of the sorted sample of measurements and n represents the respective sample size the main steps of the procedure to obtain statistical rating curves are schematized in fig 4 in order to obtain the quantile functions of water level and river discharge data the measurements were sorted in ascending order independently from each other and then were evaluated the probabilities of the sorted water level and discharge values were computed the statistical rating curve is then achieved by fitting a quadratic curve over water level and discharge data extrapolated from their corresponding quantile functions at assigned probability values the requirement of simultaneous measurements is therefore eliminated providing the capability of estimate river flow from satellite altimetry even for those sites where this requirement is not fulfilled in this study both empirical and statistical approaches are used to estimate rating curves coupling in situ daily discharge measurements and satellite derived water level time series specifically for those vss where synchronous data of water level and in situ river discharge measurements were available both empirical and statistical rcs were estimated this allowed to make a comparison between the two approaches conversely for sites where concurrent water level and river discharge measurements were not available only the statistical rc were estimated radar altimetry provides instantaneous water level measurements relative to a reference ellipsoid however as it can be seen in fig 3 the altimeter satellite tracks almost never intersect the river reach at the location of the gauging station producing and offset among the different time series proportional to the relative geographical location of each vs therefore to simplify the comparisons of the regression analysis results both statistical and empirical rating curves are obtained considering water level anomalies at each vs instead of their absolute values 3 3 reconstruction of river discharge time series for every vs selected at session 3 1 rcs empirical and or statistical were independently defined to reconstruct the river discharge time series within the altimetry time period this procedure provides several discontinuous river discharge time series one for each vs spanning the period 1993 2019 with some overlapping periods depending on the altimetry dataset used therefore a merging procedure was applied to combine the satellite derived discharge time series and therefore obtain a single long consistent river discharge time series fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 are reported to clarify the applied procedure the plots of fig 5 show the statistical and the empirical rcs estimated for the six vss selected near the kandaji gauging station in the niger river see fig 3 as it can be noted for vs1 and vs5 both the statistical and empirical rcs were estimated consequently two satellite derived river discharge time series were obtained for the same vs for the other vss due to the lack of synchronous water level and river discharge measurements only statistical rcs and therefore one satellite derived river discharge time series were derived all the rating curves built for the different vss are referred to the same in situ river discharge both in the empirical and the statistical approaches rating curves are achieved by fitting a quadratic curve over discharge and water level data however in many cases the regression analysis returned results of physical meaningless where negative river discharge values correspond to the smallest water level data range this was the case for example of the statistical rating curves obtained for vs1 vs3 and vs5 of kandaji gauging station fig 6 to overcome this issue the following iterative procedure was applied the sample of water level and the corresponding satellite derived discharge data obtained by fitting a quadratic curve rc over the whole data sample blue dashed lines in fig 6 was firstly sorted in ascending order with respect to water level data and then divided into two groups considering as a threshold value the water level corresponding to the first positive discharge value two different rcs were then fitted over the two data samples so obtained and it was verified that there were no longer negative satellite derived discharge values if this condition was not fulfilled the water level threshold value was iteratively shifted towards larger values until no negative discharge data were obtained from both the two rating curves for reasons of continuity and regularity the overall rc used to extrapolate satellite derived discharge values at each iteration was obtained by imposing the continuity of the two rcs at the threshold value red markers in fig 6 at which the same tangent for the two quadratic curves was imposed black straight lines in fig 6 the red dashed lines in fig 6 represent the final rcs obtained at the end of the iterative procedure the plots in fig 6 summarized the results of the iterative procedure applied to the statistical rcs however the same method was used to the empirical ones when necessary the satellite derived river discharge time series finally estimated by using both the empirical and the statistical rcs for the kandaji gauging station over the period 1993 2019 are illustrated in fig 7 grey lines in the figure delineate the limits of the overlapping periods yellow highlighted areas occurring among the satellite derived river discharge time series the altimetry water level time series could exhibit relative differences between various datasets those inconsistencies can be attributed to multiple reasons the most obvious regard the different satellite missions considered in each dataset see table 2 and the distinct processing strategies applied to the raw satellite data therefore if not accurately investigated and resolved before performing a data merging process they could lead to a highly noisy time series therefore in order to obtain a single and consistent satellite derived discharge time series at each gauging station a single representative time series for every overlapping period was considered among those obtained from the different datasets the choice was simply based on a trade off between the number of reconstructed discharge data within the reference period and the overall error budget of each satellite derived time series with the aim to obtain a dense and accurate time series from a quantitative point of view the mean absolute error mae was firstly computed for each satellite derived discharge data sample and then the minimum value of the ratio between the squared mae and the discharge data size was used to choose the best reconstructed discharge time series within each overlapping period this procedure was independently applied for both the time series obtained through the two approaches statistical and empirical see fig 7 in this regard for what concern the discharge time series obtained from the statistical rcs the mae was computed through a comparison between the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and reconstructed river discharge obtained considering the entire observation period whereas for those obtained with the empirical approach the error was estimated just by considering the observed and satellite derived discharge values within the intersection period of altimetry and in situ measurements where synchronous values of reconstructed and observed river discharge were available in the end to obtain the final satellite derived discharge time series a comparison between the performances of the empirical and statistical approaches was made this analysis was performed considering the discharge time series obtained for all the vss where both methods could be applied at the same time e g vs1 and vs5 for kandaji gauging station see fig 5 in order to allow a direct comparison of the two approaches the performances of the empirical and the statistical methods were evaluated computing the relative root mean square error rrmse i e the root mean square error normalized with respect to the range of in situ discharge measurements max min it is evaluated between the ground observed and satellite derived discharge time series obtained through the two approaches within the overlapping period synchronous data the same metric was employed to evaluate the overall error budget of the final reconstructed discharge time series in this case the error metric was calculated considering the cumulative distribution functions of the in situ and satellite derived discharge data to make the results comparable among all the satellite derived discharge time series fig 8 summarized the presented methodology to estimate satellite derived discharge time series from multiple satellite altimetry water level datasets at a reference location 3 4 trend analysis to perform the trend analysis peak over threshold pot values were extracted from the river discharge time series as proxy variables of extreme events as pot series should contain independent peak flows greater than a given threshold cunnane 1973 madsen et al 1997 mangini et al 2018 a criterion to correctly extract flow values has to be defined following previous studies mallakpour and villarini 2015 a minimum period of 15 days was chosen to classify as independent two successive events the threshold was set equal to the 80th 50th and 20th percentiles to perform the trend analysis on high median and low flood events respectively it has to be noted that the choice of pot80 and pot20 instead of pot 90 95 and pot 10 5 see e g gudmundsson et al 2019 to represent high and low flow conditions has been driven by the fact that the river discharge time series reconstructed through the altimetry water level can have a temporal resolution ranging from a minimum of about 10 days to a maximum of about 45 days for that the reconstructed river discharge time series can underestimate overestimate the real observed maximum minimum flood peak the trend analysis was carried out to identify changes in the magnitude of extreme events for that the mann kendall m k mann 1945 kendall 1975 test was performed to statistically assess if there is a monotonic trend of the variable of interest over time for the m k test the s statistic have to be computed as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where n is the number of data points x j and x i are the data values at times i and j j i and sgn x j x i is the sign function equal to 1 if x j is greater than x i and 1 if x j is less than x i the mean of s is zero and the variance can be computed as kendall 1975 5 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t t 1 2 t 5 18 where m is the number of group of tied ranks each with t tied observations finally m k is designated by z douglas et al 2000 6 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 the existence of a trend was assessed at the significance level of 10 i e the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z 1 645 to determine the magnitude of the trend the sen theil slope estimator sen 1968 was applied 7 β m e d i a n x j x i j i where β is the sen s slope estimate positive β values indicate the presence of upward trend in the time series the opposite occurs for negative β values to make trend estimates from catchments with different sizes and from different climates comparable following previous studies stahl et al 2012 gudmundsson et al 2019 the trend t for each time series was expressed as the percent change over the period of record of n years as 8 t mn x 100 where m m3 s is the slope of the trend and x m3 s is the mean of pot time series for the period 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of altimetry virtual stations with respect to the initial criterion for the selection of virtual stations within a maximum distance of about 300 km the automatic procedure excluded the satellite derived discharge time series less performing providing the final average distance between the vss and the in situ stations of about 100 km this means that for most of the cases the more representative vss are located quite close to the reference in situ station only 7 pilot sites out of the 58 selected for the analysis required time series of vss located at a distance bigger than 300 km from the in situ stations this was mainly due to an insufficient number of closer vss with available water level data adequate to extend the discharge time series these 7 pilot sites are listed below ob river at belogor ye two vss at a distance of around 500 km orinoco river at ciudad bolivar two vss at a distance of around 300 km congo river at brazzaville two vss at a distance of around 330 km congo river at kindu one vs at a distance of around 340 km ob river at kolpashevo one vs at a distance of around 380 km congo river at port francqui kasai one vs at a distance of around 380 km and lena river at tabaga one vs at a distance of about 450 km 4 2 rating curve for those virtual stations where synchronous data of water level and in situ discharge measurements were available both empirical and statistical rating curves were created to make a comparison between the two approaches fig 5 the traditional empirical approach as expected always showed better performances than the statistical one for example fig 9 shows the results obtained for vs1 and vs5 selected for the kandaji gauging station niger river in both cases the empirical approach exhibits better performance with respect to the statistical one with a rrmse value of 16 94 of the empirical approach versus 19 07 of the statistical one for vs1 and 16 5 versus 20 28 respectively for vs5 fig 10 summarizes the difference between the mean rrmse values obtained for the two approaches considering that for every site multiple vss were potentially selected to reconstruct the final discharge time series the mean values of the rrmse were used to summarize the outcomes of the two approaches for each pilot site as stated above all the investigated stations show better performances for the empirical approach which always has reduced mean rrmse values with respect to the statistical one negative differences however the comparison reveals a good potential of the statistical approach whose mean rrmse values differ little from those obtained with the empirical one with all the performance differences lower than 0 12 white circles in the figure correspond to pilot sites where there were no synchronous measurements therefore the comparison between the two methods was not allowed considering the results shown above to obtain the final satellite derived discharge time series statistical derived discharge data were only used to fill gaps and extend river flow time series obtained with the empirical approach for example in fig 11 is illustrated the final discharge time series reconstructed for the kandaji gauging station 4 3 reconstruction of river discharge time series in this section river discharge time series resulting from the methodology described in section 3 3 are presented for almost all the pilot sites discharge data were reconstructed over a period from 14 years 2002 2016 whereas it reaches 27 years 1993 2019 for those gauging stations where a notable amount of altimetry water level data was available fig 12 concerning the average temporal resolution it ranges from a minimum of about 10 days to a maximum of about 45 days depending on the satellite water level time series involved in the reconstruction of the discharge time series because of the numerous pilot sites considered in the analysis 58 hereinafter only the results obtained for some representative locations are illustrated and described more in detail these locations were selected in order to illustrate the outcomes of this analysis for a representative sample of stations located over different climatic areas tropical temperate continental and dry fig 13 shows the outcomes obtained in situ discharge observations are plotted in blue whereas the overall reconstructed discharge time series are shown in red the computation of the error was carried out comparing the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and reconstructed discharge data in order to allow the estimate even for the time series reconstructed with the statistical approach only fig 14 shows the results for all the pilot sites involved in the analysis and the outcomes demonstrate the good potential of altimetry data in the estimation of river discharge with a median rrmse value equal to 0 04 4 4 trend analysis in this section the results of the trend magnitude analysis are presented the study was performed considering two different periods the former from 1970 to 1999 in which the analysis was carried out taking into account mainly in situ river discharge observations the latter from 1990 to 2019 where only the satellite derived discharge time series were involved in the trend magnitude assessment results are illustrated in fig 15 the first column illustrates the trend magnitude of high flow events 80th percentile median flow 50th percentile and low flow 20th percentile for the period 1970 1999 whereas the second column refers to the second period the crosses in the images indicate sites with no significant trend pvalue in the m k test greater than 0 1 whereas the red and blues triangles indicate sites with significant negative or positive trend negative or positive t values respectively significant trends are obtained only for a few stations among the ones analysed in particular a predominant negative trend can be noted in the period 1970 1999 especially in africa and for some stations in north asia for pot80 and pot50 no clear picture emerged from pot20 for the same period some stations in west africa in southeastern south america and east asia show a wetting trend whereas significant decreasing trends are present in central part of south america west and south africa although for analysis periods slightly different the patterns here obtained for pot 80 and pot50 are in agreement with the ones found by gudmundsson et al 2019 and crochemore et al 2020 with a decreasing trend for west africa and a no consistent pattern for the stations in south america interesting is the reversed trend pattern obtained in the more recent analysis period for pot80 and pot50 in particular remarkable results were obtained over west africa where the inversion of trend from negative about 35 in the period 1970 1999 to positive about 43 in the period 1990 2019 values for high and median flows corroborates the already known sahelian paradox descroix et al 2013 the findings obtained by tramblay et al 2020 and sidibe et al 2018 for the area in particular sidibe et al 2018 reconstructed a streamflow dataset for 152 gauging stations located in west and central africa to quantify flow changes over the 1950 2005 period they found negative trends in sahelian regions over the period 1970 1993 and a reversed pattern during the successive 13 year period 1993 2005 mainly linked to increased extreme rainfall and changes in land use in these regions the work of tramblay et al 2020 demonstrates the existence of change points around 1980s on the annual maximum river discharge time series observed in west africa and highlights an upward trend on the time series for the period 1980 2010 with respect to these two studies the present work confirms for the more recent period up to 2019 the existence of a significant wetter trend in west africa as floods represent one of the most important cause of fatalities in africa the results of this study clearly point out the potential in the use of the altimeter data for flood risk monitoring and communication 5 conclusions in this study satellite altimetry water level data are used to set up a consistent and up to date discharge dataset for different sites across the world satellite derived river discharge data are obtained by means of rating curves functional relations linking the water levels to the river discharges for a specific section of the river in this regard two different approaches are used the empirical traditional approach where rating curves are obtained by fitting a quadratic curve over a data sample of synchronous measurements of water level and discharge empirical rating curve the statistical approach where the rating curves are achieved employing the quantile functions of the two datasets instead of the data itself statistical rating curve considering the better performances of the empirical method the statistical approach was used just to extend and fill gaps of the empirical derived discharge time series when synchronous data of satellite derived water level and in situ discharge were not available long robust river discharge time series so obtained are then used to perform a trend analysis on extreme hydrological events on this purpose the mann kendall m k test was performed to statistically assess if there is a monotonic trend whereas the sen theil slope estimator was applied to determine the magnitude of trend if present the outcomes demonstrate the good potential of altimetry data to reconstruct river discharge even for those sites where a remarkable lack of in situ available data is present for almost all the pilot sites discharge data were reconstructed over a period from 14 years 2002 2016 to about 27 years 1993 2019 for those gauging stations where a notable amount of altimetry water level data was available the good performances of altimetry data are furthermore highlighted by the good agreements obtained in terms of rrmse with all values less than 15 showing a good consistency between the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and the estimated discharge values finally for what concerns the trend magnitude analysis remarkable results were obtained in west africa where consistently with studies based solely on in situ data an inversion of trend was observed between 1970 1999 and 1990 2019 periods offering the possibility to continuously monitor the terrestrial water dynamics the trend analysis based on altimeter data allow trend analysis studies to be extended into the more recent period overcoming the critical issue of data availability of the in situ river discharge observation networks this approach will be highly relevant for all sites where the traditional monitoring is dismissed and in particular for developing countries in which the risk of extreme events and the water management are more relevant future efforts will be made to improve satellite derived discharge dataset collecting a larger number of sites across the world and implementing a multi mission approaches among the satellite data provided by the different datasets to strengthen the analysis for the smaller river basins credit authorship contribution statement rossella belloni

4122,the construction of cascade reservoirs upstream of the three gorges reservoir tgr has been greatly intensified in the 21st century while research attention is dedicated to the downstream effects of the tgr few studies have been focused on the radical change of upstream inflows to the tgr in this study we reveal the impact of upstream cascade reservoirs on the annual runoff and sediment load inflows to the tgr based on the data in 1956 2016 the measured sediment load at control hydrological stations shows a drastic decrease 59 while the runoff only had a slight decrease 6 the similarity of these characteristics for that measured at yichang indicates the leading effects of tgr inflows on its outflow we develop a macroscopic quantification method utilizing double mass curves to separate the contribution from climate effects and human activities results show that precipitation climate factors dominated the runoff change while human activities were the main driving factors for sediment load reduction in the studied area in the four sub basins upstream of the tgr the sediment retention induced by large reservoirs was the major reason for sediment load reduction especially in the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin which contributed 70 or 347 mt yr of the total sediment retention in the whole upper yangtze river basin yrb since 2015 much larger than that of the tgr 19 or 94 mt yr as the total storage capacity of the cascade reservoirs increased to more than twice the tgr s capacity in the 2010s the regression relationship between runoff and sediment load broke down the unprecedented situation in the upper yrb may have profound impacts on the morphology and ecology of the tgr as well as the downstream yangtze river including its delta keywords runoff sediment load inflow the three gorges reservoir cascade reservoirs 1 introduction rivers are the major pathways to deliver water and sediment from land to oceans supplying 36000 km3 of freshwater and more than 20 billion tons of solid and dissolved materials per year milliman and farnsworth 2013 while they play a key role in the earth s surface system human activities have been exerting intensive interference in recent decades according to the world commission on dams wcd about 45000 large dams over 15 m high and an estimated 8 10 5 small dams had been built worldwide in the second half of the 20th century world commission on dams 2000 holding back more than 6500 km3 freshwater about 18 of the total annual runoff and intercepting 4 5 billion tons sediment load 25 30 of the total value in the reservoirs annually according to the statistics investigated in the early 21st century vörösmarty et al 2003 nilsson et al 2005 side impacts may be arisen in a riverine and coastal environment with intensive damming for example freshwater impoundment influences the hydrologic pattern and alter the regional biological cycle yuan et al 2015 declining sediment supply leads to the erosion of channels and coastal deltas and may also disturb the ecosystem syvitski et al 2005 yang et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 2016 china has been in full swing of dam construction since 1950 for electricity power generation flood control as well as water supply etc yang and lu 2014 most of the reservoirs with high dams were built in the yangtze river which is the largest river in asia and also ranks third in the world besides the hydropower resource endowment in the yangtze river basin yrb accounts for almost half of the total potential capacity of technically exploitable hydropower in china and ranks first in the world and most of which is contributed by the upper reach where there is large elevation drop zhang et al 2014 chu et al 2019 there exist over 5000 reservoirs in the yrb gao et al 2018 and the construction of large reservoirs capacity 10 8 m3 has been greatly intensified since the late 1990s especially in its upper reach with a prospective persistence in future chu et al 2019 a great amount of research effort has been paid to reveal the critical influence of dams reservoirs on the hydrology patterns in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb including the yangtze delta particularly in terms of annual runoff and sediment load hu et al 2009 yang et al 2011 2014 2015 dai et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 guo et al 2018 the construction and operation of large dams reservoirs are identified as the main reason for the drastic decline of sediment flux to the downstream yangtze and even to the east china sea hu et al 2009 yang et al 2015 2011 in recent years growing research attention is being attached to the cascade reservoirs in the upper yrb including the tgr in altering the runoff and sediment load pattern guo et al 2020 investigated the cumulative effect of newly constructed dams and observed the accelerated reduction of annual sediment load as well as the decrease of mean sediment particle diameter with the data only up to 2013 zhao et al 2017 quantitatively assessed the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factors on water discharge and sediment load for the whole yrb and found that for the upper yrb after 1987 there was no significant abrupt change of runoff while the sediment load dropped more than 50 and human induced drivers explained 86 of the change chen and wang 2019 estimated the contribution of human activities to sediment reduction for the main sub basins in the upper yrb in each decade since the 1970s using the hydrologic regression method although quite a few large reservoirs constructed in recent 10 years were not considered e g the cascade reservoirs in the middle reach of the jinsha river basin it showed that the reservoirs overall accounted for 88 of the sediment reduction among the quantity induced by human activities way outstripping other factors such as soil conservation and river sand extraction there are also detailed studies on the jinsha river basin li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 where damming is the most booming among all sub basins but the studies for other sub basins seem to be scarce for the inter annual aspect ren et al 2020 revealed the fact that the construction of cascade reservoirs reduced the peak discharge while increased the peak sediment transport time the peak sediment hysteresis had become more obvious since the completion of the three gorges dam tgd in 2003 the study by wang et al 2019 showed that while annual inflow to the tgr reduced by 6 1990 2015 autumn inflow significantly decreased by 16 climate change was the main contributor to both decreases 78 and 63 respectively the above studies have already highlighted the overwhelming impact of cascade reservoirs on the hydrological environment in the upper yrb particularly to the sediment transport and provided essential knowledge for further study despite this considering the dramatic change of upstream water and sediment resources supplying the tgr a systematic investigation involving the interaction between upstream sub basins and the tgr under both spatial and temporal framework has yet to be reported by this stage the work presented by this paper tries to fill the above gap by first conducting hydrological analysis on the runoff and sediment load in recent 61 years 1956 2016 of main sub basins upstream of the tgr in terms of both annual and monthly variation the quantification of the contribution of different driving forces climate factors and human activities is then carried out based on the runoff sediment relationship in each sub basin in addition the quantitative impact of the large reservoirs on annual sediment load as the main component of human activities is estimated for each sub basin the roles of cascade reservoirs together with the tgr are discussed under a spatial temporal framework as a whole this study may serve as a piece of evidence to what extent upstream cascade reservoirs alter water and sediment supply regime to downstream the framework of which can also be a reference for the environmental assessment and management of other large river basins with decadal time scales 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area the yangtze river also called changjiang ranks the third in length and the fourth in mean annual discharge in the world it has a basin area of about 1 81 10 6 km2 18 8 of china s land area and an annual runoff of about 9600 10 8 m3 36 of china s total runoff it originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows 6387 km eastward to the east china sea its upper reach from river head to yichang station shown as fig 1 has a basin area of 1 10 6 km2 which is 4504 km in length covering a large elevation difference from over 5100 m to below 500 m near yichang with an average gradient of 1 1 yang et al 2007 therefore it contains abundant hydropower resources 89 of the whole basin 42 of that in china in terms of technical exploitability chu et al 2019 the upper reach is also the major source of sediment the mean sediment load at yichang is 406 mt year which is even 13 higher than that at datong station the control station of yangtze river mouth apart from the tgr basin there are four main sub basins upstream that constitute the upper reach jinsha river basin jialing river basin min river basin and wu river basin fig 1 numerous large dams reservoirs have been or are being constructed in the four sub basins table 1 summarizes the reservoirs with a capacity larger than 1 10 8 m3 that have been built or under construction as is seen the construction in the 21st century is greatly intensified compared to the 20th century the total reservoir storage capacity by the end of 2016 has been already exceeded twice of the tgr 393 10 8 m3 and after the completeness of the baihetan 206 10 8 m3 wudongde 74 10 8 m3 and lianghekou 111 10 8 m3 projects in the jinsha river basin in the future decade this figure will even triple in light of this it is imperative to examine the impact of such human interference on water and sediment inflows to the downstream tgr 2 2 datasets in this study the precipitation data 1956 2016 downloaded from the website of the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn are processed by the surface average method the annual and monthly runoff and suspended sediment load data at pingshan xiangjiaba gaochang zhutuo beibei wulong and yichang in 1956 2016 are collected for hydrological analysis supported by the hydrological office of the yangtze water resources committee the pingshan xiangjiaba gaochang wulong beibei and yichang stations represent the control stations of the jinsha river basin the min river basin the jialing river basin the wu river basin and the tgr respectively the summation of the data at zhutuo beibei and wulong represent the inflows to the tgr 2 3 trend identification by mann kendall test the mann kendall m k test is adopted to identify the trend of hydrological time series annual runoff and sediment load in this study it is a rank based and nonparametric method commonly used in hydrological trend detection khaliq et al 2009 kumar and jain 2010 wu et al 2012 for a time series with independent identically distributed quantities x 1 x 2 x n n is the length of the time series the test statistic s is calculated by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn is the sign function the test statistic s approximately follows normal distribution when n 8 defining the standardized statistic value z 2 z s 1 σ s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 σ s 0 where the standard deviation σ is calculated as 3 σ n n 1 n 5 p 1 n t p p 1 2 p 5 18 where n is the number of tied groups and t p is the number of ties in the pth tied group for z if its absolute value is larger than the theoretical value z 1 α 2 where α is the significance level the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected positive z indicates an upward trend while negative z indicates a downward trend 2 4 macroscopic quantification of human and natural impacts by double mass curve the double mass curve method is applied to quantify in a macroscopic sense that to what extent human activities and climate change mainly the precipitation contribute to the variation of annual sediment load inflow to the tgr a double mass curve plots two cumulative quantities from a sequence of hydrologic observations which exhibits a straight line if the relation between the two variables stays to be a fixed ratio searcy and hardison 1960 a break in the slope within a double mass curve indicates that a change in the constant of proportionality occurred searcy and hardison 1960 li et al 2016 the double mass curve method has been extensively applied to assess the alternation of precipitation runoff and runoff sediment relations in large basins such as the yellow river basin the yangtze river basin and the pearl river basin where the proportionality assumption works reasonably well in terms of detecting the inconsistencies driven by climatic or anthropogenic factors xu 2009 gao et al 2013 li et al 2016 2018 zhao et al 2017 for example a counterclockwise turning of the upper yrb rainfall x sediment y double mass curve in the early 1980s was found to be associated with more frequent occurrence of landslide and debris flow in the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin while the clockwise turning in the early 1990s resulted from the water soil conservation measures xu 2009 an illustrative example of applying the double mass curve method in the macroscopic quantification is shown in fig 2 which plots cumulative annual runoff v s cumulative annual sediment load there are three time periods 1 2 and 3 with the identifiable transition of water sediment relation and three linear fitting curves of the discrete data points of the corresponding periods the slopes of which are β 1 β 2 and β 3 respectively period 1 is chosen as the base period in which the water sediment relation is assumed to be undisturbed by human or climatic changes by the end of period 2 we can obtain the total amount of sediment load in period 2 if the water sediment relation is unchanged following the actual amount of runoff in the same period δ s 1 as well as the actual total amount of sediment load in period 2 δ s 2 4 δ s 1 β 1 δ r 2 5 δ s 2 β 2 δ r 2 where δ r 2 is the actual amount of accumulative runoff in period 2 then the change of sediment load induced by the factors other than runoff δ s nr is given as 6 δ s nr δ s 1 δ s 2 note that positive value of δ s nr indicates effects of sediment reduction while negative value indicates sediment intensification further the expected total amount of runoff in period 2 based on the average annual runoff of the whole period is δ r m which may be different from the actual amount δ r 2 positive value of δ r m δ r 2 means that period 2 is relatively dry and vice versa then the amount of change sediment load due to the change of runoff as the result of climate change δ s r is given as 7 δ s r β 1 δ r m δ r 2 for a gross assessment if the runoff change is dominated by the variation of precipitation it is considered that the contribution of runoff can represent the natural driver of sediment change c p while the contribution of factors other than runoff precipitation is ascribed to human activities c h as adopted by zhao et al 2017 thus the two contribution rates are calculated as 8 c p δ s r δ s r δ s nr 100 δ s p δ s p δ s h 100 c h δ s nr δ s r δ s nr 100 δ s h δ s p δ s h 100 where s h mean annual change of sediment load by human activities c h contribution of human activities to the change of sediment load s p mean annual change of sediment load by precipitation c p contribution of precipitation to the change of sediment load respectively in later context sediment trapped in reservoirs per year on average i s will also be estimated for a reference to s h which will be introduced in the next sub section 2 5 reservoir trapping efficiency estimation by empirical formula in this study the cascade reservoirs upstream of the tgd play an important role in the reduction of annual sediment load besides the double mass curve it is necessary to particularly estimate the ratio of annual sediment deposition to total sediment input to the reservoirs or the trapping efficiency te the widely used empirical formula which is originally proposed by brune brune 1953 is applied in this study with an improved form vörösmarty et al 2003 garg and jothiprakash 2010 9 te 1 0 05 δ τ r 10 δ τ r i 1 n v i q where v i is the operational volume of the ith reservoir in the basin to be evaluated and there are n reservoirs in total q is the average annual runoff at the outlet of the most downstream reservoir of the basin δ τ r is the reservoir residence time of the basin the above equation deals with the situation that cascade reservoirs connect in series for tributaries with reservoirs that join in parallel the total trapping efficiency te k can be expressed as if there are k sub basins for example 11 te k j 1 k te j q j q k where q k is the mean annual runoff at the outlet of the most downstream reservoir more detailed application of the method in the upper yrb can be referred to li et al 2011 and zhang et al 2019 3 results and discussions in this section the annual variation of runoff as well as the suspended sediment load of the control stations upstream of the tgr are analyzed the characteristics of monthly distribution are also discussed then the drivers of runoff and sediment load change in the interested sub basins are identified and discussed with particular attention paid to the effect of cascade reservoirs 3 1 annual variation fig 3 shows the annual runoff and sediment load at yichang station the control station of the tgd both runoff and sediment load had a decreasing trend during the investigated period but the reduction of sediment load was much more significant especially after the year of the commencement of the impoundment of the tgr 2003 comparing p2 post tgd 2003 2015 to p1 pre tgd 1980 2002 the mean runoff decreased about 8 from 4365 10 8 m3 to 4005 10 8 m3 while the rate of mean sediment load reduction was about 91 tables 2 and 3 although the strength of sediment entrapment of tgd has been well illustrated hu et al 2009 tang et al 2014 it is not adequate to completely attribute these changes to the tgd without analyzing the sources of water sediment supply the three control stations of the upper sub basins namely zhutuo the jinsha river basin and the min river basin beibei the jialing river basin and wulong the wu river basin together contributed nearly 90 of the runoff and sediment load to yichang station annually in p1 the sum of the annual runoff and sediment load of the three stations which is regarded as the resources inflow to the tgr are plotted in fig 4 the runoff inflow only showed a slightly decreasing trend decreased 6 from 3818 10 8 m3 to 3582 10 8 m3 while the sediment load inflow decreased continuously and dramatically since the late 1990s comparing p2 with p1 the sediment inflow reduced 59 from 417 mt yr to 172 mt yr which accounted for nearly 60 of the sediment reduction of yichang on average in p2 according to table 3 therefore apart from the effect of tgr itself the variation of the upstream hydrology regime is also critical for the output of water and sediment at yichang the 3 stations are further analyzed individually as follows shown as fig 5 there was no obvious change of annual runoff at zhutuo station in 1980 2015 about its mean value 2615 10 8 m3 the maximum value was 3170 10 8 m3 in 1998 the lowest value occurred in 2011 1934 10 8 m3 however a salient downward trend of yearly sediment load could be observed after the 21st century and it decreased to the lowest value of 2120 10 4 t in 2015 while the highest value was about 24 times larger 48400 10 4 t in 1998 the m k trend test fig 5 consistently showed no significant trend of runoff but the sediment load was detected to decrease with a significance level α 0 05 since the year 2004 the runoff at beibei had a slight downward trend in the first half of the investigated period and then kept to be stable in the second half the maximum value 1070 10 8 m3 in 1983 was three times larger than the minimum value 308 10 8 m3 in 1997 the m k test justified the downward trend since the line broke through the significant level in 1995 for a period the sediment load reduced significantly since 1981 to less than 1900 10 4 t in 1994 and then remained at a low level except the year 1998 when the sediment load jumped to a peak of 9900 10 4 t the annual runoff and sediment load at wulong station are less than the other two tributaries on average 475 10 8 m3 and 1679 10 4 t respectively but the total reservoir capacity is larger table 1 similar to zhutuo station no significant trend of runoff could be observed or detected by m k test while the sediment load saw a decrease since the 21st century which was no more than 1000 10 4 t in the last 9 years and it remarkably dropped to only 94 10 4 t in 2013 in general the annual sediment load from the sub basins upstream of tgd went through a considerable decrease since the late 1990s while the annual runoff was relatively stable with a slight decline 3 2 monthly variation the change of monthly precipitation runoff and sediment load at zhutuo beibei wulong and yichang is shown in fig 6 the precipitation is the average value in the basin upstream of the corresponding hydrological stations comparisons were made between the mean values in p2 post tgd period and p1 pre tgd period and were presented in terms of percentage for precipitation there was a slightly larger amount in spring and less in summer in p2 a negative change rate can be observed in winter months december to february except wulong station but the total amount of precipitation in these months accounted for no more than 5 of the annual quantity on average there were no other obvious characteristics of the change of precipitation and the rate was fairly small compared to runoff and sediment load the runoff in the flood season decreased at all of the 4 stations while it increased in other seasons this can be explained by the operation of the cascade reservoirs in the upper yrb which evened the inner year distribution of water discharge in general the statistics of the change rate of precipitation and runoff offered an impression that the total amount of annual water resources supply roughly kept unchanged consistent with the annual data in the previous subsection which was significantly different from the sediment load the reduction of sediment load exhibited a more uniform manner compared to runoff it became at least 70 smaller for all the months at yichang while a large rate of reduction mainly appeared in the flood season at other 3 tributary stations and this is as expected because the reservoirs upstream of tgr could already intercept the major sediment supply mostly carried by the runoff in the flood season and hereby limited the further sediment retention in tgr these patterns highlight the great impact of human activities on regional hydrologic characteristics not only in terms of overall quantity but also in the temporal distribution 3 3 the driving factors of the runoff variation the annual runoff imported to the tgr had little change over the decades compared to the extent of sediment load the average annual runoff in 2003 2015 decreased 6 at zhutuo increases 2 at beibei and decreases 15 at wulong relative to the average value in 1980 2002 numerous studies have indicated the dominance of precipitation on basin runoff in the yrb chen et al 2014 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2011 this is indeed the case in the sub basins upstream of the tgr as revealed by our results fig 7 plots the double mass curves between the annual runoff and annual precipitation in the four sub basins upstream of tgr the jinsha river basin the min river basin the jialing river basin and the wu river basin respectively the fitted functions are all almost linear and exhibit perfect correlation with r 2 larger than 0 99 this shows that the annual precipitation was still the major explanatory driving factor of the variation of annual runoff while the influence of other factors were not identifiable in the first order sense although human activities in the upstream reach of the yrb have been playing an increasingly important role recently guo et al 2018 the impact of the operation of dams or reservoirs was unclear from the double mass curves a gross estimation of the total capacity of large reservoirs of the four sub basins is given in table 1 more than 600 10 8 m3 of the volume of impoundment had been exerted in the 21st century however as many of the reservoirs are seasonally regulated typically they impound water during the latter half of the wet season and release water during the driest months yang et al 2010 for a gross estimation they only influence the intra annual runoff except the first year of impoundment zhang et al 2019 this is consistent with the result in the last section that inflow runoff decreased in wet seasons while increased in dry seasons becoming more regulated as a whole the annual runoff inflow to the tgr was governed by the annual precipitation in the studied period 3 4 the driving factors of the sediment load variation we analyze the contribution of different driving factors to sediment load variation via the method introduced in section 2 based on the data in the four sub basins upstream of the tgr the driving factors that can be identified from the double mass curves are i the variation of annual runoff and ii the factors other than runoff mainly considered to be influenced by human activities as shown in section 3 3 annual precipitation continuously dominated the annual runoff with a linear relation in all sub basins within the studied period hence we consider runoff to represent the change of precipitation reasonably well so that the assumption in section 2 4 can be applied for each sub basin the studied period 1956 2016 is divided into 4 sub periods p1 to p4 demarcated by turning points observed in the double mass curve and the quantification of the contribution is carried out for each sub period additionally the empirical method by brune s formula is applied to estimate the trap efficiency of the cascade reservoirs in each sub basin the double mass curve is shown in fig 8 the corresponding results are summarized in tables 4 7 in the jinsha river basin the turning of sediment runoff relation mainly occurred in p3 and p4 first the sediment load increased slightly in p2 1963 1996 by 0 25 10 8 t yr on average despite the negative contribution of precipitation 21 which suggested that the increased sediment load due to human activities approximately equaled 6 times of the amount of sediment load reduction due to precipitation reduction this may be caused by the land surface disturbance such as land exploitation and road construction accompanied with the economic growth of china since the 1980s lu 2005 in the next period a considerable decrease of sediment load occurred 0 71 10 8 t yr and human activities contributed 118 covering the positive effects of precipitation in sediment increase this was probably because a series of soil conservation as well as afforestation projects were launched since the 1990s in the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river basin wei et al 2011 also the newly constructed dams and reservoirs trapped a large amount of sediment the gross estimation based on the empirical method showed that the large reservoirs on average trapped 31 mt sediment per year in p3 mainly due to ertan reservoir accounting for more than 40 of the mean annual reduction of the sediment load 71 mt actually an investigation conducted by regression method by feng et al 2008 demonstrated that the actual sediment load trapped in ertan reservoir between 1998 and 2004 was between 50 to 65 mt in alignment with the massive construction of large reservoirs after 2010 the sediment load dramatically decreased in p4 2012 2016 at a rate of 2 04 10 8 t yr with a trapping efficiency of 90 1 and 95 was ascribed to human activities the quantity roughly agreed with the value estimated sediment load trapped by the reservoirs 2 19 10 8 t yr in agreement with zhang et al 2019 indicating the dominating role of reservoirs in comparison the influence of precipitation change on sediment load was negligible in p3 and p4 the jialing river basin exhibited a continuous sediment reduction throughout the studied period p2 to p4 and the amount of the change was comparable with the jinsha river basin the influence of precipitation on sediment load was mainly observed in p2 when the increasing precipitation increased 9 1 mt sediment load annually on average but was still offset by the decreasing amount 20 8 mt yr on average due to human activities from p3 onward the influence of precipitation became less important which was similar to the jinsha river basin as for human activities in every 10 years from 1967 to 2016 there were large reservoirs dammed in the mainstream e g bikou 5 2 in 1971 shengzhong 13 4 in 1977 baozhusi 25 5 in 1991 caojie 22 2 in 2005 and tingzikou 41 2 in 2010 where the numbers in brackets are the volume in 10 8 m3 from p2 to p4 the estimated sediment load trapped by reservoirs roughly agreed with the annual rate of sediment reduction accordingly the estimated trap efficiency increased from about 40 to 70 and then to 90 the trapped sediment load per year was estimated to be comparable for the three sub periods and was even higher than the measured value despite the roughness of the empirical formula for trap efficiency the contribution of a series of water and soil conservation measures since 1989 named as changzhi project to the declining soil erosion and thus the sediment load could be the most probable reason xu 2007 dai and lu 2014 the conservation measures were estimated to reduce sediment load between 40 and 60 in the upper reaches and 15 to 20 in the lower reaches yang and he 2005 assuming 30 of the total sediment yield in the jialing river basin was reduced due to water and soil conservation the amount that was trapped in large reservoirs in p4 still took up 60 of the total amount of reduction 0 82 10 8 t yr v s 1 38 10 8 t yr which remained to be the major reason for sediment reduction for the min river basin the turning points in the double mass curve are not as evident as the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin however there still existed tractable effects of human activities while the impact of precipitation change was also a much smaller counterpart the sediment load decreased continuously in the three sub periods p2 p4 and more than half of this quantity can be attributed to reservoirs although the amount of the change was much less compared to the above two basins the trap efficiency increased steadily from 22 to 35 and then to 50 in the three sub periods 0 25 10 8 t out of 0 4 10 8 t of sediment load was trapped in large reservoirs per year in the recent scenario p4 2007 2016 the wu river basin had the second largest capacity of large reservoirs nearly 20 km3 among the four basins although its average annual runoff was the smallest the large reservoirs could explain the entire sediment reduction by comparing s h to i s in p2 1967 1983 while there were already reservoirs constructed with a trapping efficiency of 77 the rate of sediment load yielded by per unit volume of runoff still increased compared to p1 and the contribution from human activities accounted for 70 probably suggesting vigorous exploitation of land surface another 30 of sediment load increase was due to the increase of annual precipitation little information was available for soil and water conservation in this basin excessive land exploitation and river channel mining might continuously happen in p3 and p4 so that the sediment reduction was offset to some degree further in p4 2004 2016 after goupitan pengshui and shatuo reservoirs are completed the sediment trapping efficiency increased to 92 annually trapping 29 mt comparable with the result calculated by the double mass curve s h 23 mt indicating the dominant role of human activities mainly the cascade reservoirs on the sediment load to summarize the sediment load in the four sub basins went through a drastic decrease in the recent two sub periods which was most significant in p4 generally it covers the time range after 2000 when large reservoirs were being intensely constructed and operated and the total trap efficiency of the large reservoirs zoomed to nearly 90 for all of the four basins among them the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin especially played an important role since they on average contribute more than 80 of the total sediment load of the four basins 52 and 30 respectively based on the data in 1956 1980 precipitation was able to influence the sediment load as a secondary contributor compared to human activities especially since 2000 approximately 10 or even less of the sediment load variation in the four sub basins could be explained by precipitation 3 5 the altered sediment flux pattern across the upper yrb the pattern of sediment flux across the upper yrb which involves the sediment retention in the reservoirs as well as the sediment discharge downstream of the tgd has changed remarkably in response to the emerging cascade reservoirs fig 9 shows the gross estimation of the total reservoir capacity in the sub basins as well as the trapped sediment load it is obvious that the sediment trapped in the reservoirs increased in alignment with the capacity which especially jumps with the appearance of some super large reservoirs such as ertan xiangjiaba and xiluodu as the total reservoir storage capacity increased from 45 10 8 m3 in the 1980s to about 150 10 8 m3 in the 2000s and 790 10 8 m3 by the end of 2016 the sediment load trapped by large reservoirs upstream of the tgr roughly increased from 130 mt yr to 200 mt yr and to over 400 mt yr correspondingly the reservoirs could lead to a sediment reduction of 3 9 10 8 t yr by the end of 2016 accounting for 86 of the total sediment yield of the four basins in 1956 1980 and 96 of the human induced sediment reduction the contribution from the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin was 86 the overall relation between annual sediment load and runoff in the upstream basins has been evaluated in a normalized manner as shown in fig 10 the slopes of the curves which means the amount of sediment load carried per unit runoff tends to decrease over the three equal period time the correlation coefficient also tends to decrease this shows on one hand reservoirs significantly reduced the strength of sediment yield for the basin on the other hand they exerted disturbance to the runoff sediment relation owing to the dam operation as a result the resultant sediment load became more unpredictable and uncertain in the presence of the continuous sediment inflow reduction fig 4 the sectional sediment load across the tgr obtained by subtracting the inflows from the value at yichang went through an interesting alteration first from 2003 to 2010 the sectional sediment load dropped to a negative value and kept declining because of the sedimentation in the tgr however in the following years the upstream sediment supply kept declining even to below 1 10 8 t after 2014 although the sectional sediment load was still negative so that the sedimentation in the tgr is continuing such a trend started to rebound towards equilibrium and thus the situation of retention in the tgr could be mitigated in the meantime the contribution of the tgr in sediment retention among all the large reservoirs in the upper yangtze river was decreasing as shown in fig 11 the result is obtained by performing the trapping efficiency calculation for the whole upper yrb in 2003 2016 by the method introduced in section 2 5 historical pre dam mean annual runoff and sediment yield are used in 2005 the tgr contributed most of the total sediment retention i s while in 2015 this situation was overturned by the dramatic increase of trapping efficiency of upper cascade reservoirs especially the jinsha river basin which accounts for 45 and the sediment trapped in the tgr became less than one fifth of the total amount in the near future other huge reservoirs such as wudongde and baihetan will be constructed and put into operation the trap efficiency of the jinsha river basin will increase to 93 1 as estimated in zhang et al 2019 95 according to yang et al 2007 therefore the sediment load inflows to the tgr will further decrease so will the relative contribution of the tgr in sediment retention for the whole upper yangtze river under the current and future situation the strategy of the tgr operation may change correspondingly to adapt to the new pattern of sediment supply from upstream as suggested by dai and lu 2014 as an example water storage can start from july instead of september to allow the storage of more silty water nevertheless this may aggravate the riverbed incision downstream of the tgd comprehensive quantitative investigation for optimal management for the whole cascade reservoirs system requires future efforts 4 concluding remarks this study provides a systematic analysis of the influence of cascade reservoirs on the variation of annual runoff and sediment load inflows to the tgr the main conclusions are marked as follows 1 comparing post tgd years with pre tgd years a slight decrease 6 of annual runoff inflow to the tgr occurred together with a dramatic decrease of sediment load inflow nearly 60 of the pre tgd value while the monthly pattern of precipitation had no obvious change the runoff and sediment load both upstream control stations and downstream yichang all went through a significant decrease in wet seasons the runoff in dry seasons also saw an increase implying the consequence of intense regulation 2 perfect linear relationship between cumulative precipitation and cumulative runoff is found for all of the 4 sub basins indicating a reliable dominance of annual precipitation on annual runoff thus the influence of human activities on annual runoff can be considered insignificant for the studied area the annual runoff can be directly applied as an indicator of precipitation climate effects in the contribution analysis of sediment load 3 human activities are found to be the dominant contributor to the variation of sediment load for both inflows and outflows of the tgr the sediment load in all of the four sub basin went through a drastic decrease particularly since the 1990s with human activities explaining more than 90 of the reduction comparable to the annual sediment yield the amount of sediment load reduced in each sub period is consistent with the estimated reservoir sedimentation suggesting that the cascade reservoirs played a key role in human activities by 2016 roughly 400 mt yr sediment load was trapped by the cascade reservoirs upstream of tgr the relative contribution of the tgr in sediment retention for the whole upper yrb also decreased from 59 to less than 20 largely owing to the intensive damming in the jinsha river basin the cascade reservoirs upstream of the tgr not only cut down the sediment load inflows also break down the rating relation between annual runoff and sediment load credit

4122,the construction of cascade reservoirs upstream of the three gorges reservoir tgr has been greatly intensified in the 21st century while research attention is dedicated to the downstream effects of the tgr few studies have been focused on the radical change of upstream inflows to the tgr in this study we reveal the impact of upstream cascade reservoirs on the annual runoff and sediment load inflows to the tgr based on the data in 1956 2016 the measured sediment load at control hydrological stations shows a drastic decrease 59 while the runoff only had a slight decrease 6 the similarity of these characteristics for that measured at yichang indicates the leading effects of tgr inflows on its outflow we develop a macroscopic quantification method utilizing double mass curves to separate the contribution from climate effects and human activities results show that precipitation climate factors dominated the runoff change while human activities were the main driving factors for sediment load reduction in the studied area in the four sub basins upstream of the tgr the sediment retention induced by large reservoirs was the major reason for sediment load reduction especially in the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin which contributed 70 or 347 mt yr of the total sediment retention in the whole upper yangtze river basin yrb since 2015 much larger than that of the tgr 19 or 94 mt yr as the total storage capacity of the cascade reservoirs increased to more than twice the tgr s capacity in the 2010s the regression relationship between runoff and sediment load broke down the unprecedented situation in the upper yrb may have profound impacts on the morphology and ecology of the tgr as well as the downstream yangtze river including its delta keywords runoff sediment load inflow the three gorges reservoir cascade reservoirs 1 introduction rivers are the major pathways to deliver water and sediment from land to oceans supplying 36000 km3 of freshwater and more than 20 billion tons of solid and dissolved materials per year milliman and farnsworth 2013 while they play a key role in the earth s surface system human activities have been exerting intensive interference in recent decades according to the world commission on dams wcd about 45000 large dams over 15 m high and an estimated 8 10 5 small dams had been built worldwide in the second half of the 20th century world commission on dams 2000 holding back more than 6500 km3 freshwater about 18 of the total annual runoff and intercepting 4 5 billion tons sediment load 25 30 of the total value in the reservoirs annually according to the statistics investigated in the early 21st century vörösmarty et al 2003 nilsson et al 2005 side impacts may be arisen in a riverine and coastal environment with intensive damming for example freshwater impoundment influences the hydrologic pattern and alter the regional biological cycle yuan et al 2015 declining sediment supply leads to the erosion of channels and coastal deltas and may also disturb the ecosystem syvitski et al 2005 yang et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 2016 china has been in full swing of dam construction since 1950 for electricity power generation flood control as well as water supply etc yang and lu 2014 most of the reservoirs with high dams were built in the yangtze river which is the largest river in asia and also ranks third in the world besides the hydropower resource endowment in the yangtze river basin yrb accounts for almost half of the total potential capacity of technically exploitable hydropower in china and ranks first in the world and most of which is contributed by the upper reach where there is large elevation drop zhang et al 2014 chu et al 2019 there exist over 5000 reservoirs in the yrb gao et al 2018 and the construction of large reservoirs capacity 10 8 m3 has been greatly intensified since the late 1990s especially in its upper reach with a prospective persistence in future chu et al 2019 a great amount of research effort has been paid to reveal the critical influence of dams reservoirs on the hydrology patterns in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb including the yangtze delta particularly in terms of annual runoff and sediment load hu et al 2009 yang et al 2011 2014 2015 dai et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 guo et al 2018 the construction and operation of large dams reservoirs are identified as the main reason for the drastic decline of sediment flux to the downstream yangtze and even to the east china sea hu et al 2009 yang et al 2015 2011 in recent years growing research attention is being attached to the cascade reservoirs in the upper yrb including the tgr in altering the runoff and sediment load pattern guo et al 2020 investigated the cumulative effect of newly constructed dams and observed the accelerated reduction of annual sediment load as well as the decrease of mean sediment particle diameter with the data only up to 2013 zhao et al 2017 quantitatively assessed the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factors on water discharge and sediment load for the whole yrb and found that for the upper yrb after 1987 there was no significant abrupt change of runoff while the sediment load dropped more than 50 and human induced drivers explained 86 of the change chen and wang 2019 estimated the contribution of human activities to sediment reduction for the main sub basins in the upper yrb in each decade since the 1970s using the hydrologic regression method although quite a few large reservoirs constructed in recent 10 years were not considered e g the cascade reservoirs in the middle reach of the jinsha river basin it showed that the reservoirs overall accounted for 88 of the sediment reduction among the quantity induced by human activities way outstripping other factors such as soil conservation and river sand extraction there are also detailed studies on the jinsha river basin li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 where damming is the most booming among all sub basins but the studies for other sub basins seem to be scarce for the inter annual aspect ren et al 2020 revealed the fact that the construction of cascade reservoirs reduced the peak discharge while increased the peak sediment transport time the peak sediment hysteresis had become more obvious since the completion of the three gorges dam tgd in 2003 the study by wang et al 2019 showed that while annual inflow to the tgr reduced by 6 1990 2015 autumn inflow significantly decreased by 16 climate change was the main contributor to both decreases 78 and 63 respectively the above studies have already highlighted the overwhelming impact of cascade reservoirs on the hydrological environment in the upper yrb particularly to the sediment transport and provided essential knowledge for further study despite this considering the dramatic change of upstream water and sediment resources supplying the tgr a systematic investigation involving the interaction between upstream sub basins and the tgr under both spatial and temporal framework has yet to be reported by this stage the work presented by this paper tries to fill the above gap by first conducting hydrological analysis on the runoff and sediment load in recent 61 years 1956 2016 of main sub basins upstream of the tgr in terms of both annual and monthly variation the quantification of the contribution of different driving forces climate factors and human activities is then carried out based on the runoff sediment relationship in each sub basin in addition the quantitative impact of the large reservoirs on annual sediment load as the main component of human activities is estimated for each sub basin the roles of cascade reservoirs together with the tgr are discussed under a spatial temporal framework as a whole this study may serve as a piece of evidence to what extent upstream cascade reservoirs alter water and sediment supply regime to downstream the framework of which can also be a reference for the environmental assessment and management of other large river basins with decadal time scales 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area the yangtze river also called changjiang ranks the third in length and the fourth in mean annual discharge in the world it has a basin area of about 1 81 10 6 km2 18 8 of china s land area and an annual runoff of about 9600 10 8 m3 36 of china s total runoff it originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows 6387 km eastward to the east china sea its upper reach from river head to yichang station shown as fig 1 has a basin area of 1 10 6 km2 which is 4504 km in length covering a large elevation difference from over 5100 m to below 500 m near yichang with an average gradient of 1 1 yang et al 2007 therefore it contains abundant hydropower resources 89 of the whole basin 42 of that in china in terms of technical exploitability chu et al 2019 the upper reach is also the major source of sediment the mean sediment load at yichang is 406 mt year which is even 13 higher than that at datong station the control station of yangtze river mouth apart from the tgr basin there are four main sub basins upstream that constitute the upper reach jinsha river basin jialing river basin min river basin and wu river basin fig 1 numerous large dams reservoirs have been or are being constructed in the four sub basins table 1 summarizes the reservoirs with a capacity larger than 1 10 8 m3 that have been built or under construction as is seen the construction in the 21st century is greatly intensified compared to the 20th century the total reservoir storage capacity by the end of 2016 has been already exceeded twice of the tgr 393 10 8 m3 and after the completeness of the baihetan 206 10 8 m3 wudongde 74 10 8 m3 and lianghekou 111 10 8 m3 projects in the jinsha river basin in the future decade this figure will even triple in light of this it is imperative to examine the impact of such human interference on water and sediment inflows to the downstream tgr 2 2 datasets in this study the precipitation data 1956 2016 downloaded from the website of the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn are processed by the surface average method the annual and monthly runoff and suspended sediment load data at pingshan xiangjiaba gaochang zhutuo beibei wulong and yichang in 1956 2016 are collected for hydrological analysis supported by the hydrological office of the yangtze water resources committee the pingshan xiangjiaba gaochang wulong beibei and yichang stations represent the control stations of the jinsha river basin the min river basin the jialing river basin the wu river basin and the tgr respectively the summation of the data at zhutuo beibei and wulong represent the inflows to the tgr 2 3 trend identification by mann kendall test the mann kendall m k test is adopted to identify the trend of hydrological time series annual runoff and sediment load in this study it is a rank based and nonparametric method commonly used in hydrological trend detection khaliq et al 2009 kumar and jain 2010 wu et al 2012 for a time series with independent identically distributed quantities x 1 x 2 x n n is the length of the time series the test statistic s is calculated by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn is the sign function the test statistic s approximately follows normal distribution when n 8 defining the standardized statistic value z 2 z s 1 σ s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 σ s 0 where the standard deviation σ is calculated as 3 σ

α is the significance level the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected positive z indicates an upward trend while negative z indicates a downward trend 2 4 macroscopic quantification of human and natural impacts by double mass curve the double mass curve method is applied to quantify in a macroscopic sense that to what extent human activities and climate change mainly the precipitation contribute to the variation of annual sediment load inflow to the tgr a double mass curve plots two cumulative quantities from a sequence of hydrologic observations which exhibits a straight line if the relation between the two variables stays to be a fixed ratio searcy and hardison 1960 a break in the slope within a double mass curve indicates that a change in the constant of proportionality occurred searcy and hardison 1960 li et al 2016 the double mass curve method has been extensively applied to assess the alternation of precipitation runoff and runoff sediment relations in large basins such as the yellow river basin the yangtze river basin and the pearl river basin where the proportionality assumption works reasonably well in terms of detecting the inconsistencies driven by climatic or anthropogenic factors xu 2009 gao et al 2013 li et al 2016 2018 zhao et al 2017 for example a counterclockwise turning of the upper yrb rainfall x sediment y double mass curve in the early 1980s was found to be associated with more frequent occurrence of landslide and debris flow in the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin while the clockwise turning in the early 1990s resulted from the water soil conservation measures xu 2009 an illustrative example of applying the double mass curve method in the macroscopic quantification is shown in fig 2 which plots cumulative annual runoff v s cumulative annual sediment load there are three time periods 1 2 and 3 with the identifiable transition of water sediment relation and three linear fitting curves of the discrete data points of the corresponding periods the slopes of which are β 1 β 2 and β 3 respectively period 1 is chosen as the base period in which the water sediment relation is assumed to be undisturbed by human or climatic changes by the end of period 2 we can obtain the total amount of sediment load in period 2 if the water sediment relation is unchanged following the actual amount of runoff in the same period δ s 1 as well as the actual total amount of sediment load in period 2 δ s 2 4 δ s 1 β 1 δ r 2 5 δ s 2 β 2 δ r 2 where δ r 2 is the actual amount of accumulative runoff in period 2 then the change of sediment load induced by the factors other than runoff δ s nr is given as 6 δ s nr δ s 1 δ s 2 note that positive value of δ s nr indicates effects of sediment reduction while negative value indicates sediment intensification further the expected total amount of runoff in period 2 based on the average annual runoff of the whole period is δ r m which may be different from the actual amount δ r 2 positive value of δ r m δ r 2 means that period 2 is relatively dry and vice versa then the amount of change sediment load due to the change of runoff as the result of climate change δ s r is given as 7 δ s r β 1 δ r m δ r 2 for a gross assessment if the runoff change is dominated by the variation of precipitation it is considered that the contribution of runoff can represent the natural driver of sediment change c p while the contribution of factors other than runoff precipitation is ascribed to human activities c h as adopted by zhao et al 2017 thus the two contribution rates are calculated as 8 c p δ s r δ s r δ s nr 100 δ s p δ s p δ s h 100 c h δ s nr δ s r δ s nr 100 δ s h δ s p δ s h 100 where s h mean annual change of sediment load by human activities c h contribution of human activities to the change of sediment load s p mean annual change of sediment load by precipitation c p contribution of precipitation to the change of sediment load respectively in later context sediment trapped in reservoirs per year on average i s will also be estimated for a reference to s h which will be introduced in the next sub section 2 5 reservoir trapping efficiency estimation by empirical formula in this study the cascade reservoirs upstream of the tgd play an important role in the reduction of annual sediment load besides the double mass curve it is necessary to particularly estimate the ratio of annual sediment deposition to total sediment input to the reservoirs or the trapping efficiency te the widely used empirical formula which is originally proposed by brune brune

yrb can be referred to li et al 2011 and zhang et al 2019 3 results and discussions in this section the annual variation of runoff as well as the suspended sediment load of the control stations upstream of the tgr are analyzed the characteristics of monthly distribution are also discussed then the drivers of runoff and sediment load change in the interested sub basins are identified and discussed with particular attention paid to the effect of cascade reservoirs 3 1 annual variation fig 3 shows the annual runoff and sediment load at yichang station the control station of the tgd both runoff and sediment load had a decreasing trend during the investigated period but the reduction of sediment load was much more significant especially after the year of the commencement of the impoundment of the tgr 2003 comparing p2 post tgd 2003 2015 to p1 pre tgd 1980 2002 the mean runoff decreased about 8 from 4365 10 8 m3 to 4005 10 8 m3 while the rate of mean sediment load reduction was about 91 tables 2 and 3 although the strength of sediment entrapment of tgd has been well illustrated hu et al 2009 tang et al 2014 it is not adequate to completely attribute these changes to the tgd without analyzing the sources of water sediment supply the three control stations of the upper sub basins namely zhutuo the jinsha river basin and the min river basin beibei the jialing river basin and wulong the wu river basin together contributed nearly 90 of the runoff and sediment load to yichang station annually in p1 the sum of the annual runoff and sediment load of the three stations which is regarded as the resources inflow to the tgr are plotted in fig 4 the runoff inflow only showed a slightly decreasing trend decreased 6 from 3818 10 8 m3 to 3582 10 8 m3 while the sediment load inflow decreased continuously and dramatically since the late 1990s comparing p2 with p1 the sediment inflow reduced 59 from 417 mt yr to 172 mt yr which accounted for nearly 60 of the sediment reduction of yichang on average in p2 according to table 3 therefore apart from the effect of tgr itself the variation of the upstream hydrology regime is also critical for the output of water and sediment at yichang the 3 stations are further analyzed individually as follows shown as fig 5 there was no obvious change of annual runoff at zhutuo station in 1980 2015 about its mean value 2615 10 8 m3 the maximum value was 3170 10 8 m3 in 1998 the lowest value occurred in 2011 1934 10 8 m3 however a salient downward trend of yearly sediment load could be observed after the 21st century and it decreased to the lowest value of 2120 10 4 t in 2015 while the highest value was about 24 times larger 48400 10 4 t in 1998 the m k trend test fig 5 consistently showed no significant trend of runoff but the sediment load was detected to decrease with a significance level α 0 05 since the year 2004 the runoff at beibei had a slight downward trend in the first half of the investigated period and then kept to be stable in the second half the maximum value 1070 10 8 m3 in 1983 was three times larger than the minimum value 308 10 8 m3 in 1997 the m k test justified the downward trend since the line broke through the significant level in 1995 for a period the sediment load reduced significantly since 1981 to less than 1900 10 4 t in 1994 and then remained at a low level except the year 1998 when the sediment load jumped to a peak of 9900 10 4 t the annual runoff and sediment load at wulong station are less than the other two tributaries on average 475 10 8 m3 and 1679 10 4 t respectively but the total reservoir capacity is larger table 1 similar to zhutuo station no significant trend of runoff could be observed or detected by m k test while the sediment load saw a decrease since the 21st century which was no more than 1000 10 4 t in the last 9 years and it remarkably dropped to only 94 10 4 t in 2013 in general the annual sediment load from the sub basins upstream of tgd went through a considerable decrease since the late 1990s while the annual runoff was relatively stable with a slight decline 3 2 monthly variation the change of monthly precipitation runoff and sediment load at zhutuo beibei wulong and yichang is shown in fig 6 the precipitation is the average value in the basin upstream of the corresponding hydrological stations comparisons were made between the mean values in p2 post tgd period and p1 pre tgd period and were presented in terms of percentage for precipitation there was a slightly larger amount in spring and less in summer in p2 a negative change rate can be observed in winter months december to february except wulong station but the total amount of precipitation in these months accounted for no more than 5 of the annual quantity on average there were no other obvious characteristics of the change of precipitation and the rate was fairly small compared to runoff and sediment load the runoff in the flood season decreased at all of the 4 stations while it increased in other seasons this can be explained by the operation of the cascade reservoirs in the upper yrb which evened the inner year distribution of water discharge in general the statistics of the change rate of precipitation and runoff offered an impression that the total amount of annual water resources supply roughly kept unchanged consistent with the annual data in the previous subsection which was significantly different from the sediment load the reduction of sediment load exhibited a more uniform manner compared to runoff it became at least 70 smaller for all the months at yichang while a large rate of reduction mainly appeared in the flood season at other 3 tributary stations and this is as expected because the reservoirs upstream of tgr could already intercept the major sediment supply mostly carried by the runoff in the flood season and hereby limited the further sediment retention in tgr these patterns highlight the great impact of human activities on regional hydrologic characteristics not only in terms of overall quantity but also in the temporal distribution 3 3 the driving factors of the runoff variation the annual runoff imported to the tgr had little change over the decades compared to the extent of sediment load the average annual runoff in 2003 2015 decreased 6 at zhutuo increases 2 at beibei and decreases 15 at wulong relative to the average value in 1980 2002 numerous studies have indicated the dominance of precipitation on basin runoff in the yrb chen et al 2014 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2011 this is indeed the case in the sub basins upstream of the tgr as revealed by our results fig 7 plots the double mass curves between the annual runoff and annual precipitation in the four sub basins upstream of tgr the jinsha river basin the min river basin the jialing river basin and the wu river basin respectively the fitted functions are all almost linear and exhibit perfect correlation with r 2 larger than 0 99 this shows that the annual precipitation was still the major explanatory driving factor of the variation of annual runoff while the influence of other factors were not identifiable in the first order sense although human activities in the upstream reach of the yrb have been playing an increasingly important role recently guo et al 2018 the impact of the operation of dams or reservoirs was unclear from the double mass curves a gross estimation of the total capacity of large reservoirs of the four sub basins is given in table 1 more than 600 10 8 m3 of the volume of impoundment had been exerted in the 21st century however as many of the reservoirs are seasonally regulated typically they impound water during the latter half of the wet season and release water during the driest months yang et al 2010 for a gross estimation they only influence the intra annual runoff except the first year of impoundment zhang et al 2019 this is consistent with the result in the last section that inflow runoff decreased in wet seasons while increased in dry seasons becoming more regulated as a whole the annual runoff inflow to the tgr was governed by the annual precipitation in the studied period 3 4 the driving factors of the sediment load variation we analyze the contribution of different driving factors to sediment load variation via the method introduced in section 2 based on the data in the four sub basins upstream of the tgr the driving factors that can be identified from the double mass curves are i the variation of annual runoff and ii the factors other than runoff mainly considered to be influenced by human activities as shown in section 3 3 annual precipitation continuously dominated the annual runoff with a linear relation in all sub basins within the studied period hence we consider runoff to represent the change of precipitation reasonably well so that the assumption in section 2 4 can be applied for each sub basin the studied period 1956 2016 is divided into 4 sub periods p1 to p4 demarcated by turning points observed in the double mass curve and the quantification of the contribution is carried out for each sub period additionally the empirical method by brune s formula is applied to estimate the trap efficiency of the cascade reservoirs in each sub basin the double mass curve is shown in fig 8 the corresponding results are summarized in tables 4 7 in the jinsha river basin the turning of sediment runoff relation mainly occurred in p3 and p4 first the sediment load increased slightly in p2 1963 1996 by 0 25 10 8 t yr on average despite the negative contribution of precipitation 21 which suggested that the increased sediment load due to human activities approximately equaled 6 times of the amount of sediment load reduction due to precipitation reduction this may be caused by the land surface disturbance such as land exploitation and road construction accompanied with the economic growth of china since the 1980s lu 2005 in the next period a considerable decrease of sediment load occurred 0 71 10 8 t yr and human activities contributed 118 covering the positive effects of precipitation in sediment increase this was probably because a series of soil conservation as well as afforestation projects were launched since the 1990s in the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river basin wei et al 2011 also the newly constructed dams and reservoirs trapped a large amount of sediment the gross estimation based on the empirical method showed that the large reservoirs on average trapped 31 mt sediment per year in p3 mainly due to ertan reservoir accounting for more than 40 of the mean annual reduction of the sediment load 71 mt actually an investigation conducted by regression method by feng et al 2008 demonstrated that the actual sediment load trapped in ertan reservoir between 1998 and 2004 was between 50 to 65 mt in alignment with the massive construction of large reservoirs after 2010 the sediment load dramatically decreased in p4 2012 2016 at a rate of 2 04 10 8 t yr with a trapping efficiency of 90 1 and 95 was ascribed to human activities the quantity roughly agreed with the value estimated sediment load trapped by the reservoirs 2 19 10 8 t yr in agreement with zhang et al 2019 indicating the dominating role of reservoirs in comparison the influence of precipitation change on sediment load was negligible in p3 and p4 the jialing river basin exhibited a continuous sediment reduction throughout the studied period p2 to p4 and the amount of the change was comparable with the jinsha river basin the influence of precipitation on sediment load was mainly observed in p2 when the increasing precipitation increased 9 1 mt sediment load annually on average but was still offset by the decreasing amount 20 8 mt yr on average due to human activities from p3 onward the influence of precipitation became less important which was similar to the jinsha river basin as for human activities in every 10 years from 1967 to 2016 there were large reservoirs dammed in the mainstream e g bikou 5 2 in 1971 shengzhong 13 4 in 1977 baozhusi 25 5 in 1991 caojie 22 2 in 2005 and tingzikou 41 2 in 2010 where the numbers in brackets are the volume in 10 8 m3 from p2 to p4 the estimated sediment load trapped by reservoirs roughly agreed with the annual rate of sediment reduction accordingly the estimated trap efficiency increased from about 40 to 70 and then to 90 the trapped sediment load per year was estimated to be comparable for the three sub periods and was even higher than the measured value despite the roughness of the empirical formula for trap efficiency the contribution of a series of water and soil conservation measures since 1989 named as changzhi project to the declining soil erosion and thus the sediment load could be the most probable reason xu 2007 dai and lu 2014 the conservation measures were estimated to reduce sediment load between 40 and 60 in the upper reaches and 15 to 20 in the lower reaches yang and he 2005 assuming 30 of the total sediment yield in the jialing river basin was reduced due to water and soil conservation the amount that was trapped in large reservoirs in p4 still took up 60 of the total amount of reduction 0 82 10 8 t yr v s 1 38 10 8 t yr which remained to be the major reason for sediment reduction for the min river basin the turning points in the double mass curve are not as evident as the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin however there still existed tractable effects of human activities while the impact of precipitation change was also a much smaller counterpart the sediment load decreased continuously in the three sub periods p2 p4 and more than half of this quantity can be attributed to reservoirs although the amount of the change was much less compared to the above two basins the trap efficiency increased steadily from 22 to 35 and then to 50 in the three sub periods 0 25 10 8 t out of 0 4 10 8 t of sediment load was trapped in large reservoirs per year in the recent scenario p4 2007 2016 the wu river basin had the second largest capacity of large reservoirs nearly 20 km3 among the four basins although its average annual runoff was the smallest the large reservoirs could explain the entire sediment reduction by comparing s h to i s in p2 1967 1983 while there were already reservoirs constructed with a trapping efficiency of 77 the rate of sediment load yielded by per unit volume of runoff still increased compared to p1 and the contribution from human activities accounted for 70 probably suggesting vigorous exploitation of land surface another 30 of sediment load increase was due to the increase of annual precipitation little information was available for soil and water conservation in this basin excessive land exploitation and river channel mining might continuously happen in p3 and p4 so that the sediment reduction was offset to some degree further in p4 2004 2016 after goupitan pengshui and shatuo reservoirs are completed the sediment trapping efficiency increased to 92 annually trapping 29 mt comparable with the result calculated by the double mass curve s h 23 mt indicating the dominant role of human activities mainly the cascade reservoirs on the sediment load to summarize the sediment load in the four sub basins went through a drastic decrease in the recent two sub periods which was most significant in p4 generally it covers the time range after 2000 when large reservoirs were being intensely constructed and operated and the total trap efficiency of the large reservoirs zoomed to nearly 90 for all of the four basins among them the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin especially played an important role since they on average contribute more than 80 of the total sediment load of the four basins 52 and 30 respectively based on the data in 1956 1980 precipitation was able to influence the sediment load as a secondary contributor compared to human activities especially since 2000 approximately 10 or even less of the sediment load variation in the four sub basins could be explained by precipitation 3 5 the altered sediment flux pattern across the upper yrb the pattern of sediment flux across the upper yrb which involves the sediment retention in the reservoirs as well as the sediment discharge downstream of the tgd has changed remarkably in response to the emerging cascade reservoirs fig 9 shows the gross estimation of the total reservoir capacity in the sub basins as well as the trapped sediment load it is obvious that the sediment trapped in the reservoirs increased in alignment with the capacity which especially jumps with the appearance of some super large reservoirs such as ertan xiangjiaba and xiluodu as the total reservoir storage capacity increased from 45 10 8 m3 in the 1980s to about 150 10 8 m3 in the 2000s and 790 10 8 m3 by the end of 2016 the sediment load trapped by large reservoirs upstream of the tgr roughly increased from 130 mt yr to 200 mt yr and to over 400 mt yr correspondingly the reservoirs could lead to a sediment reduction of 3 9 10 8 t yr by the end of 2016 accounting for 86 of the total sediment yield of the four basins in 1956 1980 and 96 of the human induced sediment reduction the contribution from the jinsha river basin and the jialing river basin was 86 the overall relation between annual sediment load and runoff in the upstream basins has been evaluated in a normalized manner as shown in fig 10 the slopes of the curves which means the amount of sediment load carried per unit runoff tends to decrease over the three equal period time the correlation coefficient also tends to decrease this shows on one hand reservoirs significantly reduced the strength of sediment yield for the basin on the other hand they exerted disturbance to the runoff sediment relation owing to the dam operation as a result the resultant sediment load became more unpredictable and uncertain in the presence of the continuous sediment inflow reduction fig 4 the sectional sediment load across the tgr obtained by subtracting the inflows from the value at yichang went through an interesting alteration first from 2003 to 2010 the sectional sediment load dropped to a negative value and kept declining because of the sedimentation in the tgr however in the following years the upstream sediment supply kept declining even to below 1 10 8 t after 2014 although the sectional sediment load was still negative so that the sedimentation in the tgr is continuing such a trend started to rebound towards equilibrium and thus the situation of retention in the tgr could be mitigated in the meantime the contribution of the tgr in sediment retention among all the large reservoirs in the upper yangtze river was decreasing as shown in fig 11 the result is obtained by performing the trapping efficiency calculation for the whole upper yrb in 2003 2016 by the method introduced in section 2 5 historical pre dam mean annual runoff and sediment yield are used in 2005 the tgr contributed most of the total sediment retention i s while in 2015 this situation was overturned by the dramatic increase of trapping efficiency of upper cascade reservoirs especially the jinsha river basin which accounts for 45 and the sediment trapped in the tgr became less than one fifth of the total amount in the near future other huge reservoirs such as wudongde and baihetan will be constructed and put into operation the trap efficiency of the jinsha river basin will increase to 93 1 as estimated in zhang et al 2019 95 according to yang et al 2007 therefore the sediment load inflows to the tgr will further decrease so will the relative contribution of the tgr in sediment retention for the whole upper yangtze river under the current and future situation the strategy of the tgr operation may change correspondingly to adapt to the new pattern of sediment supply from upstream as suggested by dai and lu 2014 as an example water storage can start from july instead of september to allow the storage of more silty water nevertheless this may aggravate the riverbed incision downstream of the tgd comprehensive quantitative investigation for optimal management for the whole cascade reservoirs system requires future efforts 4 concluding remarks this study provides a systematic analysis of the influence of cascade reservoirs on the variation of annual runoff and sediment load inflows to the tgr the main conclusions are marked as follows 1 comparing post tgd years with pre tgd years a slight decrease 6 of annual runoff inflow to the tgr occurred together with a dramatic decrease of sediment load inflow nearly 60 of the pre tgd value while the monthly pattern of precipitation had no obvious change the runoff and sediment load both upstream control stations and downstream yichang all went through a significant decrease in wet seasons the runoff in dry seasons also saw an increase implying the consequence of intense regulation 2 perfect linear relationship between cumulative precipitation and cumulative runoff is found for all of the 4 sub basins indicating a reliable dominance of annual precipitation on annual runoff thus the influence of human activities on annual runoff can be considered insignificant for the studied area the annual runoff can be directly applied as an indicator of precipitation climate effects in the contribution analysis of sediment load 3 human activities are found to be the dominant contributor to the variation of sediment load for both inflows and outflows of the tgr the sediment load in all of the four sub basin went through a drastic decrease particularly since the 1990s with human activities explaining more than 90 of the reduction comparable to the annual sediment yield the amount of sediment load reduced in each sub period is consistent with the estimated reservoir sedimentation suggesting that the cascade reservoirs played a key role in human activities by 2016 roughly 400 mt yr sediment load was trapped by the cascade reservoirs upstream of tgr the relative contribution of the tgr in sediment retention for the whole upper yrb also decreased from 59 to less than 20 largely owing to the intensive damming in the jinsha river basin the cascade reservoirs upstream of the tgr not only cut down the sediment load inflows also break down the rating relation between annual runoff and sediment load credit

4123,the complexity of pollutant mixing mechanism in open channels generates large uncertainty in estimation of longitudinal and lateral dispersion coefficients kx and ky therefore kx and ky estimation in rivers should be accompanied by an uncertainty analysis a subject mainly ignored in previous studies we introduce a method based on thorough analysis of different calibration datasets resampled from a global database of tracer studies to determine the uncertainty associated with five applicable intelligent models for estimation of kx and ky model tree evolutionary polynomial regression epr gene expression programming multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and support vector machine svm our findings suggest that svm gives least uncertainty in both kx and ky estimation while epr and mars generate most uncertainty in kx and ky estimation respectively by considering significant uncertainty in the model estimations we suggest that the methodology we introduce here for uncertainty determination of the models be incorporated in empirical studies on estimation of kx and ky in rivers keywords open channel machine learning models rates of mixing uncertainty 1 introduction anthropogenically driven pollutants discharged in rivers are a main concern that threaten freshwater supply for human and aquatic life bostanmaneshrad et al 2018 noori et al 2019 non reactive pollutant mixing in rivers a three dimensional 3d mechanism is complex due to inherent irregularities of river hydraulic geometric characteristics ghane et al 2016 since a river is usually much longer and wider than it is deep mixing takes place more quickly in river depth vertical mixing than in river width lateral mixing and in the stream wise direction longitudinal mixing manson and wallis 2015 barati moghaddam et al 2017 theoretically vertical mixing in rivers usually occurs quickly near the contamination field from the pollutant discharge point while lateral and longitudinal mixings take place in intermediate and distant fields from the point of pollutant release into rivers respectively therefore with respect to environmental ecological issues longitudinal and lateral dispersion quantified by the dispersion coefficients for both longitudinal and lateral directions kx and ky respectively are more important mechanisms than vertical mixing in rivers rutherford 1994 efforts to improve our understanding of kx and ky respectively date back to the studies conducted by taylor 1953 and taylor 1954 and elder 1959 taylor 1954 proposed a theoretical approach for kx prediction in pipes fischer and park 1967 introduced a simple equation for ky estimation in straight canals thereafter many laboratory and field studies have been conducted to develop methods for kx and ky estimation to a permissible level of accuracy see fischer 1969 fischer et al 1979 nokes and wood 1988 rutherford 1994 clark et al 1996 boxall and guymer 2001 although experimental studies are valuable for determination of kx and ky they are costly may produce toxic byproducts and are applicable only for the geometric hydraulic characteristics investigated ho et al 2002 kim 2012 as an alternative empirical methods such as machine learning models mlms are frequently used to predict ky and especially kx in natural rivers e g tayfur and singh 2005 riahi madvar et al 2009 toprak et al 2014 zeng and huai 2014 wang et al 2017 balf et al 2018 ghiasi et al 2019 memarzadeh et al 2020 azar et al 2021 however reported mlm based estimates of dispersion coefficients indicate that the precision level can vary significantly even when the mlms are fed by the same input output variables noori et al 2016 in other words since mlms are classified as data driven models a change in the model feed dataset can have a marked influence on model performance since kx and ky values estimated by these models are used in combination with two dimensional 2d numerical models in water quality studies the uncertainty in mlm results induced by variation in the calibration dataset obtained from tracer studies needs to be better investigated with respect to management practices the more certain in the results of mlms in the process of kx and ky estimation the more confidence in the characterization of pollutant transport in rivers therefore using kx and ky models that are associated with less uncertainty can indirectly result in more accurate simulation of pollutant discharged in rivers using 2d advection dispersion equation 2d ade on the contrary water quality management decisions based on poor kx and ky estimation could have detrimental effects on aquatic life in rivers and ultimately harm human health ramezani et al 2019 in noori et al 2016 the uncertainty of some mlms i e neural network nn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector machine svm were quantified but no detailed information exists on the uncertainty of other mlms that are widely used in water quality studies hence the aim of this study was to develop a method for uncertainty determination of a broad set of mlms to estimate dispersion coefficients in rivers i e kx and ky including the model tree mtree wang and witten 1996 evolutionary polynomial regression epr giustolisi and savic 2006 gene expression programming gep ferreira 2001 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars friedman 1991 and svm vapnik 1995 because the superior performance of svm compared to nn and anfis has already been established noori et al 2016 the latter mlms were not included in this study a notable feature of the present study is that the comprehensive analysis to determine the uncertainty of mlms is not limited to the specific case of estimation of kx and ky in rivers since the mlms are frequently used in science and engineering in general and hydrologic sciences in particular the findings of the comprehensive model uncertainty analysis could be used by researchers in other fields as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulation of dispersion coefficients geometric features and fluid hydraulic characteristics determine how a pollutant spreads in rivers in lateral and longitudinal directions the longitudinal and lateral dispersion coefficients i e kx and ky are formulated as seo and cheong 1998 aghababaei et al 2017 1 k x a n d k y g 1 μ ρ b h

dimensional and dimensionless functional relationships have been widely used to estimate kx and ky in rivers e g fischer 1975 jeon et al 2007 toprak 2016 noori et al 2016 aghababaei et al 2017 riahi madvar et al 2019 memarzadeh et al 2020 azar et al 2021 2 2 databases in this study we employed two databases associated with tracer studies performed for determination of kx and ky at both field and laboratory scales to drive the svm gep mtree epr and mars models the kx database which consists of 503 data points was compiled by riahi madvar et al 2019 also ky database which consists of 420 data points was compiled by ahmad 1997 jeon et al 2007 huai et al 2018 and aghababaei et al 2017 considering dimensional functional relationship 4 variables b h u and u were used to estimate kx and ky using the mlms table 1 indicates well known statistical properties of the databases for both k x and k y 2 3 machine learning models mlms we used five mlms to estimate kx and ky in channels including mtree epr gep mars and svm given sufficient supporting documents about these models in the literature friedman 1991 vapnik 1995 wang and witten 1996 ferreira 2001 giustolisi and savic 2006 we have provided a brief introduction separately for each model used in our study fig 1 illustrates a flowchart of different steps of the study the mtree utilizes classification operators of data points and divides the search space into several subspaces saghebian et al 2014 with the aid of gradient descent methodology multilinear regression relationship is fitted to the data points which are available in each subspace generally mtree is capable of formulating a complex system by using a set of if then rules in which multivariate linear regression can detect patterns of data points najafzadeh et al 2021 in this study mtree development was implemented in the weka software based on two rules i e two multivariable linear regression equations epr develops a mathematical formulation which includes various inner functions such as tangential exponential and natural logarithm moreover mathematical structure returned by epr has many optional setting parameters such as explored ranges of exponents number of algebraic terms and genetic algorithm operators giustolisi and savic 2006 in this way setting parameters of epr need to be optimized by using multi objective genetic algorithm the epr model is generally coded in the matlab software whose setting parameters are defined in the environment of excel in this study regression equation returned by the epr model contains five mathematical terms in order to estimate kx and ky and additionally 3600 generations were used for this purpose gep is developed based on characterization of chromosomes the structure of a gep model is developed based on the genetic algorithm along with using various genetic operators for optimization of gep driven formulation ferreira 2001 generally gep approach consists of several genes which are illustrated by tree like structures kaydani et al 2014 in this study gep is driven in the environment of genexprotools software three genes or subtrees were obtained for estimation of both kx and ky all the genes were combined together with an addition symbol known as the linking function furthermore in the model development a wide range of genetic operators such as mutation inversion and recombination were fixed as 0 00138 0 00546 and 0 00277 respectively mars technique utilizes a set of simple linear relationships which fits piecewise linear regression on each input variables for estimating both kx and ky in fact mars can divide the space of input variables i e b h u and u into different segments and then fit a spline function known as basis function on these segments generally previous applications of mars model in understanding of mixing process in rivers proved that the basis function with the second order polynomial provided the best results thus this typical basis function was used to develop the mars based equation in the matlab software and additionally particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to optimize weighting coefficients of the basis functions during the development of mars the number of basis functions was quantified in terms of overfitting process by using generalized cross validation svms are one of the most favorable learning techniques which have a wide range of applications in classification and regression problems vapnik 1995 sattari et al 2017 mirabbasi et al 2019 azar et al 2021 in svm input datasets are mapped into a higher dimensional feature space to separate the dataset patterns in this study svm model was developed by using kernel based radial basis function in the matlab software in svm setting parameters of kernel functions were tuned by means of grid search algorithm 2 4 uncertainty estimation the mlms were tuned to map input vector here b h u and u to target y here kx and ky based on a finite dataset e x z y z z 1 2 z f the number of data points in each tuning pattern i e f was selected to be 90 and 80 datapoints calibration data for kx and ky estimation respectively from a probabilistic viewpoint the dataset e is just one of an infinite number of probable tuning patterns which may be resampled from the given databases here global databases of tracer studies therefore each tuning pattern would result in a different set of mlm parameters being optimized during the calibration step leading to different outputs of kx and ky in this study l distinct tuning patterns e l l 1 2 l r were randomly resampled from the given databases the same number of input vector and target y values i e f was used to form each tuning pattern note that some members of the resampled tuning patterns may be as the same since sampling is performed with replacement the first tuning pattern e 1 was resampled to calibrate all the five mlms used svm gep mtree epr and mars thereafter another tuning pattern e 2 was resampled from the given databases and the mlms were calibrated using the architecture selected earlier this procedure was repeated many times to calibrate the mlms the number of repetitions i e r was selected to be 70 and 50 for kx and ky estimation respectively finally all the calibrated mlms were validated on a similar dataset set aside for model verification the number of data points for model verification was selected to be 38 and 35 data points for kx and ky estimation respectively the variation in model estimation in the verification step induced by changes in the tuning patterns can be used as a measure of mlm uncertainty srivastav et al 2007 therefore given a verification input vector an estimation interval can be calculated for outputs of kx and ky with an acceptable significance level here 95 in this study two statistical measures introduced as dfactor eq 5 and the number of data encapsulated by 95 of estimated uncertainties de95eu eq 6 were used to evaluate variations in the calibration patterns related to the mlms with respect to dfactor the values less than 1 represent an acceptable level of uncertainty abbaspour et al 2007 furthermore de95eu varies between 0 and 100 respectively indicating the largest and lowest uncertainty levels by these benchmarks we can evaluate the uncertainty in estimation of kx and ky using the mlms 5 d f a c t o r 1 n i 1 n x u x l σ x 6 d e 95 e u 1 n c o u n t

results fig 2 shows correlation coefficient r values of the tuned mlms in estimation of kx and ky in the verification step the number of tuned models with r value 0 80 for kx estimation was 61 45 44 25 and 10 out of 70 models for svm gep mtree mars and epr respectively only some tuned mars 9 out of 70 and epr 13 out of 70 models showed r value 0 60 for kx estimation the number of tuned models with r value 0 80 for ky estimation was 47 25 15 6 and 15 out of 50 models for svm gep mtree epr and mars respectively r value 0 60 was observed only for some tuned ky estimates by mtree 3 out of 50 mars 18 out of 50 and epr 22 out of 50 these results suggest the svm model performed better than the other four mlms tested with r values ranging from 0 75 to 0 98 and 0 71 0 97 for all kx and ky tuned models respectively the epr and mars models provided the lowest level of accuracy of all mlms tested for kx and ky estimation the r values for the epr mars model estimates ranged from 0 50 to 0 98 0 41 0 95 and 0 43 0 87 0 42 0 89 for kx and ky tuned models respectively the gep and mtree models showed moderate accuracy based on the r values obtained the tuned models for kx estimation seem to be superior than those for ky estimation based on changing the calibration input vector an estimation interval was obtained for kx and ky with 95 significance level as shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the factors used to quantify model uncertainty i e dfactor and number of de95eu for each tuned kx and ky estimation model are also depicted in these two figures as shown in the diagrams dfactor varied from 0 79 svm model to 1 41 epr model for kx estimation and from 0 87 svm model to 1 71 mars model for ky estimation the lower the dfactor the lower the uncertainty in model estimation therefore the results based on dfactor values revealed less uncertainty for tuned kx models than for ky models the number of de95eu was similar for all tuned kx and ky models therefore based on the dfactor and de95eu results svm was less uncertain than the other models in estimating both kx and ky in rivers furthermore the uncertainty in kx and ky estimation was highest for epr and mars respectively suggesting that these two models generated inferior estimates of kx and ky in rivers the gep mtree and mars models in that order were moderate in kx estimation while gep mtree and epr were moderate in ky estimation 4 discussion all tuned models showed some degree of error in both kx and ky estimation fig 2 in fact due to the complexity of mixing mechanism in rivers the exact estimation of kx and ky is not possible by empirical or theoretical approaches rutherford 1994 boxall and guymer 2007 in the present study an error of up to several orders of magnitude was observed in all models tuned for both kx and ky estimation which agrees with results in other studies deng et al 2002 ho et al 2002 therefore it can be concluded that the svm gep mtree epr and mars models are not highly accurate with respect to estimation of kx and ky in rivers in terms of model structure svm intrinsically includes three layers with a set of flexible selective inner functions leading to improved model performance in approximating complex and non linear functions gep uses optimal selection of generation number tuning various genetic operators and automatically defined inner functions to accurately estimate non linear functions danandeh mehr et al 2018 in contrast mtree model is based on a set of linear regression equations that may fail to accurately approximate non linear variables kx and ky in rivers additionally optimum number of generations is not a user defined variable and type of inner function remains unchangeable in the epr model leading to some limitations for users wishing to refine model structure with respect to the physical concept of the objective variable under study najafzadeh 2019 with the mars model there is no possibility of selecting any inner functions except polynomials leading to a lower degree of structural nonlinearity of mars compared with other models such as gep shiri et al 2017 the more variation in model estimation higher prediction errors the greater the model uncertainty srivastav et al 2007 given the higher prediction errors of mtree epr and mars than the svm and gep models in kx and ky estimation the svm and gep can be considered more reliable models for kx and ky estimation in river water quality studies while svm provides slightly better results than other models the dfactor shows significant uncertainty in the kx and ky model estimations figs 3 and 4 mainly due to other sources of error when seeking to account for model uncertainty in estimation we only investigated the uncertainty induced by changes in calibration patterns it should be noted that model uncertainty can also depend on other factors as described in detail as follows i longitudinal and lateral mixing mechanisms that are mainly induced by lateral velocity shear in the flow fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 is not yet fully understood thus exact kx and ky calculations for environmental applications are not possible by available theoretical or semi empirical approaches boxall and guymer 2001 boxall and guymer 2007 that are mainly derived from the theory developed by fischer et al 1979 therefore in some cases such as our results a large difference by several orders of magnitude can be seen between the field estimated and predicted kx and ky values boxall and guymer 2001 deng et al 2002 ho et al 2002 ii exclusion of some important factors affecting the longitudinal and lateral mixing in rivers due to the complexity of the integral forms suggested by fischer et al 1979 to determine dispersion coefficients for rivers many simplifying assumptions have been made to solve these functional forms negatively affecting the accuracy of kx and ky estimation sahin 2014 the difficulty of using these integral forms is in part due to the fact that exact information on lateral profiles of both cross sectional shape and velocity in rivers should be determined seo and cheong 1998 in this regard the river sinuosity i e sn was excluded from the analyses the sn which usually ranged between 1 and 3 in alluvial rivers schumm 1963 affects kx and ky through two different mechanisms rutherford 1994 1 it contributes to the cross sectional variability of flow velocity that increases decreases kx ky value in rivers and 2 it decreases increases kx ky by creating secondary currents that usually in rivers even in straight channels nezu et al 1993 boxall et al 2003 marion and zaramella 2006 nikora and roy 2012 river sinuosity plays a greater role in variation of ky than kx gu et al 2014 in addition the integral form suggested by fischer et al 1979 is based on the fact that the lateral velocity profile is 100 times or even up to 900 times papadimitrakis and orphanos 2004 more important than the vertical velocity profile in the production of longitudinal mixing in rivers possible dominance of vertical shear in some sections of rivers may add further complexity in kx and ky calculation papadimitrakis and orphanos 2004 kim 2012 bed shape factor sf dead zones froude number river discharge and even hydraulic radius are other important drivers on longitudinal and lateral mixing that have been excluded for simplification of the analyses liu 1977 deng et al 2002 boxall and guymer 2001 boxall and guymer 2007 shucksmith et al 2010 sahin 2014 disley et al 2015 lanzoni et al 2018 in fact the mlms were formulated based on b h u and u an ideal condition that is rarely fulfilled in natural rivers iii measurement uncertainty of the inputs i e b h u and u theoretically the functional relationships 3 and 4 are applicable to completely mixed rivers across the flow width however some data were obtained by tracer studies conducted on partially mixed streams e g mcquivey and keefer 1974 for which the width of completely mixed flow may be less than the river width kx and ky estimation methods use data from tracer experiments which usually fit observed data to the results obtained by solution of ade under proper initial and boundary conditions although kx and ky calculated by these experiments are usually used as the true value for appraisement of other approaches large uncertainties exist in the process of conducting such tracer studies in addition for example 1d ade solutions are only reliable after the initial advective dominant period a condition that is satisfied far downstream from the pollutant source deng et al 2001 albeit not fully quantified besides some data points might be measured in severely irregular rivers where the ade cannot fully capture the dispersion mechanism in such cases kx estimation will be largely uncertain due to skewness in actual concentration time curves compared to simulated concentration distribution using the ade seo and cheong 1998 finally soft hardware errors are also possible when measuring the hydraulic features of streams rutherford 1994 taken together these types of error induced by difficulties in tracer experiments palancar et al 2003 may contribute to poor estimation of kx and ky iv the techniques used for tuning the functional relationships 3 and 4 because some effective parameters are excluded from the functional relationships 3 and 4 these forms do not represent kx and ky variations well although the effects of some excluded parameters can be somewhat captured by the aspect ratio and friction term seo and cheong 1998 therefore more powerful techniques that are able to model highly complex input output relationships even when some important parameters are lacking would improve the accuracy in turn increasing the reliability of kx and ky estimations tayfur and singh 2005 toprak and savic 2007 toprak and cigizoglu 2008 sahay 2013 najafzadeh and tafarojnoruz 2016 noori et al 2017 azar et al 2021 v effect of outliers not present in the databases used the reported results pertain to the range of data within the used databases as concluded the change in the calibration datasets fed to the mlms has a marked influence on the models performance therefore the results presented here may change if the mlms are run on other databases especially those obtained from large rivers with significant irregularities in geometric hydraulic characteristics that result in very large kx and ky values this is important since the databases used in our study as well as other studies aimed to estimate dispersion coefficients do not contain very large kx and ky values for example while the maximum value of kx used in this study is less than 1800 m2 s tracer studies have recorded kx values even greater than 6000 m2 s calandro 1978 presence of rare outliers such as kx and ky values larger than maximum values in the current databases may further increase the estimation uncertainty 5 conclusions we aimed to determine the uncertainty associated with mtree epr gep mars and svm models for estimation of kx and ky in channels in general our study showed considerable uncertainty associated with these models which are commonly used for estimation of kx and ky the uncertainty associated with the mlms may further increase if we include the outliers in the databases used since these two coefficients are used in combination with 2d numerical models in water quality studies uncertainty in their estimation can result in unrealistic concentrations being simulated by the models downstream of pollutant release into rivers in this regard our results demonstrate the importance of uncertainty analysis of kx and ky estimation models as a vital issue that should not be overlooked in river water quality related studies therefore we suggest that the methodology we introduce here for uncertainty determination of these models becomes an essential component of empirical studies on estimation of kx and ky in rivers it should be noted that the presented methodology only accounts for model uncertainty induced by changes in calibration patterns whereas model uncertainty can also depend on other factors improved estimation of kx and ky in rivers can help water quality authorities and decision makers devise better plans for rehabilitating polluted rivers a way to improve estimation of kx and ky in rivers is to account for irregularities in geometric characteristics of rivers in the models in terms of bed shape factor and river sinuosity 6 data availability the data used in this study are

4123,the complexity of pollutant mixing mechanism in open channels generates large uncertainty in estimation of longitudinal and lateral dispersion coefficients kx and ky therefore kx and ky estimation in rivers should be accompanied by an uncertainty analysis a subject mainly ignored in previous studies we introduce a method based on thorough analysis of different calibration datasets resampled from a global database of tracer studies to determine the uncertainty associated with five applicable intelligent models for estimation of kx and ky model tree evolutionary polynomial regression epr gene expression programming multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and support vector machine svm our findings suggest that svm gives least uncertainty in both kx and ky estimation while epr and mars generate most uncertainty in kx and ky estimation respectively by considering significant uncertainty in the model estimations we suggest that the methodology we introduce here for uncertainty determination of the models be incorporated in empirical studies on estimation of kx and ky in rivers keywords open channel machine learning models rates of mixing uncertainty 1 introduction anthropogenically driven pollutants discharged in rivers are a main concern that threaten freshwater supply for human and aquatic life bostanmaneshrad et al 2018 noori et al 2019 non reactive pollutant mixing in rivers a three dimensional 3d mechanism is complex due to inherent irregularities of river hydraulic geometric characteristics ghane et al 2016 since a river is usually much longer and wider than it is deep mixing takes place more quickly in river depth vertical mixing than in river width lateral mixing and in the stream wise direction longitudinal mixing manson and wallis 2015 barati moghaddam et al 2017 theoretically vertical mixing in rivers usually occurs quickly near the contamination field from the pollutant discharge point while lateral and longitudinal mixings take place in intermediate and distant fields from the point of pollutant release into rivers respectively therefore with respect to environmental ecological issues longitudinal and lateral dispersion quantified by the dispersion coefficients for both longitudinal and lateral directions kx and ky respectively are more important mechanisms than vertical mixing in rivers rutherford 1994 efforts to improve our understanding of kx and ky respectively date back to the studies conducted by taylor 1953 and taylor 1954 and elder 1959 taylor 1954 proposed a theoretical approach for kx prediction in pipes fischer and park 1967 introduced a simple equation for ky estimation in straight canals thereafter many laboratory and field studies have been conducted to develop methods for kx and ky estimation to a permissible level of accuracy see fischer 1969 fischer et al 1979 nokes and wood 1988 rutherford 1994 clark et al 1996 boxall and guymer 2001 although experimental studies are valuable for determination of kx and ky they are costly may produce toxic byproducts and are applicable only for the geometric hydraulic characteristics investigated ho et al 2002 kim 2012 as an alternative empirical methods such as machine learning models mlms are frequently used to predict ky and especially kx in natural rivers e g tayfur and singh 2005 riahi madvar et al 2009 toprak et al 2014 zeng and huai 2014 wang et al 2017 balf et al 2018 ghiasi et al 2019 memarzadeh et al 2020 azar et al 2021 however reported mlm based estimates of dispersion coefficients indicate that the precision level can vary significantly even when the mlms are fed by the same input output variables noori et al 2016 in other words since mlms are classified as data driven models a change in the model feed dataset can have a marked influence on model performance since kx and ky values estimated by these models are used in combination with two dimensional 2d numerical models in water quality studies the uncertainty in mlm results induced by variation in the calibration dataset obtained from tracer studies needs to be better investigated with respect to management practices the more certain in the results of mlms in the process of kx and ky estimation the more confidence in the characterization of pollutant transport in rivers therefore using kx and ky models that are associated with less uncertainty can indirectly result in more accurate simulation of pollutant discharged in rivers using 2d advection dispersion equation 2d ade on the contrary water quality management decisions based on poor kx and ky estimation could have detrimental effects on aquatic life in rivers and ultimately harm human health ramezani et al 2019 in noori et al 2016 the uncertainty of some mlms i e neural network nn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector machine svm were quantified but no detailed information exists on the uncertainty of other mlms that are widely used in water quality studies hence the aim of this study was to develop a method for uncertainty determination of a broad set of mlms to estimate dispersion coefficients in rivers i e kx and ky including the model tree mtree wang and witten 1996 evolutionary polynomial regression epr giustolisi and savic 2006 gene expression programming gep ferreira 2001 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars friedman 1991 and svm vapnik 1995 because the superior performance of svm compared to nn and anfis has already been established noori et al 2016 the latter mlms were not included in this study a notable feature of the present study is that the comprehensive analysis to determine the uncertainty of mlms is not limited to the specific case of estimation of kx and ky in rivers since the mlms are frequently used in science and engineering in general and hydrologic sciences in particular the findings of the comprehensive model uncertainty analysis could be used by researchers in other fields as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulation of dispersion coefficients geometric features and fluid hydraulic characteristics determine how a pollutant spreads in rivers in lateral and longitudinal directions the longitudinal and lateral dispersion coefficients i e kx and ky are formulated as seo and cheong 1998 aghababaei et al 2017 1 k x a n d k y g 1 μ ρ b h

deputizes for the consequences of sf sn channel roughness and slope therefore functional relationship 2 can be reformulated as 3 k x h u a n d k y h u g 3 b h u u or 4 k x a n d k y g 4 b h u u both dimensional and dimensionless functional relationships have been widely used to estimate kx and ky in rivers e g fischer 1975 jeon et al 2007 toprak 2016 noori et al 2016 aghababaei et al 2017 riahi madvar et al 2019 memarzadeh et al 2020 azar et al 2021 2 2 databases in this study we employed two databases associated with tracer studies performed for determination of kx and ky at both field and laboratory scales to drive the svm gep mtree epr and mars models the kx database which consists of 503 data points was compiled by riahi madvar et al 2019 also ky database which consists of 420 data points was compiled by ahmad 1997 jeon et al 2007 huai et al 2018 and aghababaei et al 2017 considering dimensional functional relationship 4 variables b h u and u were used to estimate kx and ky using the mlms table 1 indicates well known statistical properties of the databases for both k x and k y 2 3 machine learning models mlms we used five mlms to estimate kx and ky in channels including mtree epr gep mars and svm given sufficient supporting documents about these models in the literature friedman 1991 vapnik 1995 wang and witten 1996 ferreira 2001 giustolisi and savic 2006 we have provided a brief introduction separately for each model used in our study fig 1 illustrates a flowchart of different steps of the study the mtree utilizes classification operators of data points and divides the search space into several subspaces saghebian et al 2014 with the aid of gradient descent methodology multilinear regression relationship is fitted to the data points which are available in each subspace generally mtree is capable of formulating a complex system by using a set of if then rules in which multivariate linear regression can detect patterns of data points najafzadeh et al 2021 in this study mtree development was implemented in the weka software based on two rules i e two multivariable linear regression equations epr develops a mathematical formulation which includes various inner functions such as tangential exponential and natural logarithm moreover mathematical structure returned by epr has many optional setting parameters such as explored ranges of exponents number of algebraic terms and genetic algorithm operators giustolisi and savic 2006 in this way setting parameters of epr need to be optimized by using multi objective genetic algorithm the epr model is generally coded in the matlab software whose setting parameters are defined in the environment of excel in this study regression equation returned by the epr model contains five mathematical terms in order to estimate kx and ky and additionally 3600 generations were used for this purpose gep is developed based on characterization of chromosomes the structure of a gep model is developed based on the genetic algorithm along with using various genetic operators for optimization of gep driven formulation ferreira 2001 generally gep approach consists of several genes which are illustrated by tree like structures kaydani et al 2014 in this study gep is driven in the environment of genexprotools software three genes or subtrees were obtained for estimation of both kx and ky all the genes were combined together with an addition symbol known as the linking function furthermore in the model development a wide range of genetic operators such as mutation inversion and recombination were fixed as 0 00138 0 00546 and 0 00277 respectively mars technique utilizes a set of simple linear relationships which fits piecewise linear regression on each input variables for estimating both kx and ky in fact mars can divide the space of input variables i e b h u and u into different segments and then fit a spline function known as basis function on these segments generally previous applications of mars model in understanding of mixing process in rivers proved that the basis function with the second order polynomial provided the best results thus this typical basis function was used to develop the mars based equation in the matlab software and additionally particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to optimize weighting coefficients of the basis functions during the development of mars the number of basis functions was quantified in terms of overfitting process by using generalized cross validation svms are one of the most favorable learning techniques which have a wide range of applications in classification and regression problems vapnik 1995 sattari et al 2017 mirabbasi et al 2019 azar et al 2021 in svm input datasets are mapped into a higher dimensional feature space to separate the dataset patterns in this study svm model was developed by using kernel based radial basis function in the matlab software in svm setting parameters of kernel functions were tuned by means of grid search algorithm 2 4 uncertainty estimation the mlms were tuned to map input vector here b h u and u to target y here kx and ky based on a finite dataset e x z y z z 1 2 z f the number of data

and ky estimation respectively finally all the calibrated mlms were validated on a similar dataset set aside for model verification the number of data points for model verification was selected to be

related to the mlms with respect to dfactor the values less than 1 represent an acceptable level of uncertainty abbaspour et al 2007 furthermore de95eu varies between 0 and 100 respectively indicating the largest and lowest uncertainty levels by these benchmarks we can evaluate the uncertainty in estimation of kx and ky using the mlms 5 d f a c t o r 1 n i 1 n x u x l σ x 6 d e 95 e u 1 n c o u n t

be superior than those for ky estimation based on changing the calibration input vector an estimation interval was obtained for kx and ky with 95 significance level as shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the factors used to quantify model uncertainty i e dfactor and number of de95eu for each tuned kx and ky estimation model are also depicted in these two figures as shown in the diagrams dfactor varied from 0 79 svm model to 1 41 epr model for kx estimation and from 0 87 svm model to 1 71 mars model for ky estimation the lower the dfactor the lower the uncertainty in model estimation therefore the results based on dfactor values revealed less uncertainty for tuned kx models than for ky models the number of de95eu was similar for all tuned kx and ky models therefore based on the

in part due to the fact that exact information on lateral profiles of both cross sectional shape and velocity in rivers should be determined seo and cheong 1998 in this regard the river sinuosity i e sn was excluded from the analyses the sn which usually ranged between 1 and 3 in alluvial rivers schumm 1963 affects kx and ky through two different mechanisms rutherford 1994 1 it contributes to the cross sectional variability of flow velocity that increases decreases kx ky value in rivers and 2 it decreases increases kx ky by creating secondary currents that usually in rivers even in straight channels nezu et al 1993 boxall et al 2003 marion and zaramella 2006 nikora and roy 2012 river sinuosity plays a greater role in variation of ky than kx gu et al 2014 in addition the integral form suggested by fischer et al 1979 is based on the fact that the lateral velocity profile is 100 times or even up to 900 times papadimitrakis and orphanos 2004 more important than the vertical velocity profile in the production of longitudinal mixing in rivers possible dominance of vertical shear in some sections of rivers may add further complexity in kx and ky calculation papadimitrakis and orphanos 2004 kim 2012 bed shape factor sf dead zones froude number river discharge and even hydraulic radius are other important drivers on longitudinal and lateral mixing that have been excluded for simplification of the analyses liu 1977 deng et al 2002 boxall and guymer 2001 boxall and guymer 2007 shucksmith et al 2010 sahin 2014 disley et al 2015 lanzoni et al 2018 in fact the mlms were formulated based on b h u and u an ideal condition that is rarely fulfilled in natural rivers iii measurement uncertainty of the inputs i e b h u and u theoretically the functional relationships 3 and 4 are applicable to completely mixed rivers across the flow width however some data were obtained by tracer studies conducted on partially mixed streams e g mcquivey and keefer 1974 for which the width of completely mixed flow may be less than the river width kx and ky estimation methods use data from tracer experiments which usually fit observed data to the results obtained by solution of ade under proper initial and boundary conditions although kx and ky calculated by these experiments are usually used as the true value for appraisement of other approaches large uncertainties exist in the process of conducting such tracer studies in addition for example 1d ade solutions are only reliable after the initial advective dominant period a condition that is satisfied far downstream from the pollutant source deng et al 2001 albeit not fully quantified besides some data points might be measured in severely irregular rivers where the ade cannot fully capture the dispersion mechanism in such cases kx estimation will be largely uncertain due to skewness in actual concentration time curves compared to simulated concentration distribution using the ade seo and cheong 1998 finally soft hardware errors are also possible when measuring the hydraulic features of streams rutherford 1994 taken together these types of error induced by difficulties in tracer experiments palancar et al 2003 may contribute to poor estimation of kx and ky iv the techniques used for tuning the functional relationships 3 and 4 because some effective parameters are excluded from the functional relationships 3 and 4 these forms do not represent kx and ky variations well although the effects of some excluded parameters can be somewhat captured by the aspect ratio and friction term seo and cheong 1998 therefore more powerful techniques that are able to model highly complex input output relationships even when some important parameters are lacking would improve the accuracy in turn increasing the reliability of kx and ky estimations tayfur and singh 2005 toprak and savic 2007 toprak and cigizoglu 2008 sahay 2013 najafzadeh and tafarojnoruz 2016 noori et al 2017 azar et al 2021 v effect of outliers not present in the databases used the reported results pertain to the range of data within the used databases as concluded the change in the calibration datasets fed to the mlms has a marked influence on the models performance therefore the results presented here may change if the mlms are run on other databases especially those obtained from large rivers with significant irregularities in geometric hydraulic characteristics that result in very large kx and ky values this is important since the databases used in our study as well as other studies aimed to estimate dispersion coefficients do not contain very large kx and ky values for example while the maximum value of kx used in this study is less than 1800 m2 s tracer studies have recorded kx values even greater than 6000 m2 s calandro 1978 presence of rare outliers such as kx and ky values larger than maximum values in the current databases may further increase the estimation uncertainty 5 conclusions we aimed to determine the uncertainty associated with mtree epr gep mars and svm models for estimation of kx and ky in channels in general our study showed considerable uncertainty associated with these models which are commonly used for estimation of kx and ky the uncertainty associated with the mlms may further increase if we include the outliers in the databases used since these two coefficients are used in combination with 2d numerical models in water quality studies uncertainty in their estimation can result in unrealistic concentrations being simulated by the models downstream of pollutant release into rivers in this regard our results demonstrate the importance of uncertainty analysis of kx and ky estimation models as a vital issue that should not be overlooked in river water quality related studies therefore we suggest that the methodology we introduce here for uncertainty determination of these models becomes an essential component of empirical studies on estimation of kx and ky in rivers it should be noted that the presented methodology only accounts for model uncertainty induced by changes in calibration patterns whereas model uncertainty can also depend on other factors improved estimation of kx and ky in rivers can help water quality authorities and decision makers devise better plans for rehabilitating polluted rivers a way to improve estimation of kx and ky in rivers is to account for irregularities in geometric characteristics of rivers in the models in terms of bed shape factor and river sinuosity 6 data availability the data used in this study are

4124,due to the changing climate and environment the stationary assumption used to calculate the design precipitation or flood of dams is no longer suitable threatening dam reliability and safety to see whether nonstationary changes in extreme precipitation will impact existing dams in china we quantify the exceedance of extreme precipitation over the design intensity by the impact level r where the future extreme precipitation intensity is calculated from the nonstationary generalized pareto gp distribution we mainly focus on medium reservoir capacity greater than 0 1 billion m3 large reservoir capacity greater than 1 billion m3 and super sized dams reservoir capacity greater than 10 billion m3 which have design return periods longer than 100 years we find that about 15 20 of regions in china may have significant increases in extreme precipitation in the future mainly in the southeast and northwest 15 of medium and large sized dams of china may be significantly affected r greater than 50 and more dams are expected to be affected by 1 day 156 and 3 day 149 precipitation compared as opposed to 5 day 128 precipitation for super sized dams there is no possible significant impact in any of the basins all r 100 by 2100 under the current nonstationary assumption but results using cmip6 data show that dams over the zhujiang river basin and xinanjiang river basin are expected to be impacted r greater than 100 under the ssp585 scenario however under the ssp126 scenario the impacts of extreme precipitation are consistent with the nonstationary analysis results which suggest non significant impacts in all basins keywords extreme precipitation nonstationary change impact level generalized pareto distribution dams 1 introduction global warming has increased the risk of extreme precipitation worldwide o gorman and schneider 2009 neelin et al 2017 vu and mishra 2019 many studies have suggested that more frequent and intensified extreme precipitation events are expected under continuous climate change in the future donat et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 papalexiou and montanari 2019 huang et al 2021 such nonstationary change in extreme precipitation raises a new question will it cause more significant damage or even the failure of existing water conservation facilities many studies have suggested that nonstationary change may or will affect the service life of hydraulic construction projects valdez et al 2010 and other urban infrastructure mailhot and duchesne 2010 al ghadi et al 2020 or increase the risk of bridge and highway damage or even failure akhtar et al 2018 akhter 2018 it is essential for established facilities especially hydraulic construction projects with long service life to examine if climate change will put their reliability at risk according to the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china there are nearly 100 000 dams of various types with a total storage capacity of more than 800 billion m3 in practical engineering the design flood or precipitation is used to ensure the reliability of the hydraulic projects in the design period the design intensity which is often defined by the maximum possible flood or precipitation value that could pass through without damage or threatening the projects can be obtained from frequency analysis with sufficient available long time series data regulation for calculating design flood of water resources and hydropower projects of china states that the most commonly used method is pearson s three type curve gu et al 2016 recently some studies have attempted to apply the generalized extreme value gev and the generalized pareto gp distributions to improve the fitted results lima et al 2016 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 sarhadi and soulis 2017 however the above approaches operate under the stationary assumption that hydrometeorological characteristics remain constant over time sarhadi et al 2016 which has limited utility under a rapidly changing climate cheng et al 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 milly et al 2018 vu and mishra 2019 different distributions can be applied to nonstationary conditions including the generalized extreme value gev distribution gao et al 2016 vu and mishra 2019 song et al 2020 the generalized pareto gp distribution mondal and mujumdar 2015 thiombiano et al 2017 and the log pearson type iii lp3 distribution ragno et al 2019 nonstationary conditions are often considered by adding different meteorological factors as covariates such as the el nino southern oscillation enso index the southern oscillation index soi monthly sea surface temperature sst and global and local mean temperature which are used to analyze the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation in india mondal and mujumdar 2015 and in the united states vu and mishra 2019 song et al 2020 also have considered the impact of urbanization and the eastern asian summer monsoon index easmi in china gao et al 2016 have tested the nonstationary change of extreme precipitation at 631 stations across the country and analyzed it using the nonstationary gev distribution shi et al 2014 have found that precipitation event frequency and intensity in china have significantly increased in recent decades in addition many studies have concluded that extreme precipitation intensity has increased significantly in southeast china over the past few decades zhai et al 2005 piao et al 2010 zhang and cong 2014 xiao et al 2017 chen et al 2021 assuming that the extreme precipitation keeps intensifying and exceeding the design level of the dams in the future some dams may be significantly affected especially in southeast china where most dams are located it is critical to understand when and where the increase of extreme precipitation will exceed their design precipitation whether the changes in extreme precipitation will affect the reliability and safety of dams in china remains unclear from existing literature thus to fill the gap we aim to assess the potential impacts of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation on different dam classes due to future climate change to that end we first access dam information from different sources and assign each dam a return period and intensity while considering the complexity in construction standards and the natural environment of each dam the intensity is assumed to be extreme precipitation under the assigned return level where the dam is located using stationary gp distribution then the nonstationary gp distribution is applied to quantify the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation compared to intensity finally we use projected precipitation data from six cmip6 models under two shared socioeconomic pathways ssps to verify the impact on super sized dams notably analyzing the damage risk of the dams should take the rainfall runoff processes and specific underlying surface conditions into account while in this study we mainly focus on the possible impact of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation on the dams which may not fully represent the risk of damage to the dams 2 methods and data 2 1 methods we define the potential impact level r as the ratio of future extreme precipitation intensity and design intensity as 1 r t n t s s 100 where s is dam s design intensity calculated by the local stationary gp distribution and n t is precipitation intensity at time t calculated from the local nonstationary gp distribution then we can use the comparison of the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation and the design intensity of dams to evaluate the climate change impact on dams therefore compared with the design intensity higher intensity of future extreme precipitation will result in higher impact on the dams notably this method can intuitively represent the possible impact of extreme precipitation change on the dams but when quantifying dam safety risk the analysis of rainfall runoff processes is still essential a safety factor is assigned to ensure dam safety according to its importance geographic location and hydrological conditions which is the ratio of theoretical force to actual force for example the overall safety factor of the three gorges dam is 2 0 due to the large number and complex types of dams in china the safety factor of super sized dams is assumed to be 2 0 and other large and medium sized dams are assumed to be 1 5 in this study therefore if r is greater than 100 for super sized dams and greater than 50 for other large sized and medium sized dams they are considered to be significantly affected 2 1 1 stationary and nonstationary gp distribution in this study the pds partial duration series gp approach is selected to calculate the return level of extreme precipitation this approach has excellent performance for describing extreme precipitation and its probability density function pdf is written as 2 p y 1 σ 1 ξ y σ 1 ξ 1 where y x u 0 u 0 ξ and σ are the threshold shape parameter and scale parameter respectively wang 1991 then the nonstationary condition is applied to eq 2 with time varying covariate of scale parameters written as 3 σ σ 0 t σ 1 where t is the time covariate and σ 0 and σ 1 are the regression parameters as shown in eq 2 a threshold u 0 is needed to filter out extreme values due to the complicated climate conditions of china we set different u 0 for different regions in this study and calculate them based on the mean residual life method which uses the linear relationship between the mean of extreme values e and the threshold u 0 referring to langousis et al 2016 we linearly fit all points u e u and select a suitable u j as the minimum of the weighted mean square error wmse w j 4 w j n j j v a r x u j x u j where n j is the total number of points and j is the position of u j in ascending order of u we obtain n extreme values exceeding the threshold u j and set u j as the threshold u 0 in addition corresponding quantiles for y year return level are no longer p 1 1 y but p 1 y 0 ny where y 0 is the observation data length year 2 1 2 parameter estimation based on the bayesian approach the bayesian approach has been widely implemented for evaluating parameters cheng et al 2014 ragno et al 2019 song et al 2020 this study uses the bayesian based markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach referring to cheng et al 2014 which provides both parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification the vector containing the parameters θ σ ξ of the gp distribution can be estimated as 5 p σ ξ x i 1 n p σ p ξ p x i θ where the likelihood function is the gp distribution according to renard et al 2013 the default prior for the scale parameters σ is non informative normal distribution and for the shape parameter ξ the default prior is assumed to have a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 3 cheng et al 2014 for all grids in this study setting the chains with length 5000 and discarding the first 4000 iterations as burn in improve stable parameter estimation which is higher than cheng et al 2014 have suggested chains with length 3000 and discarding the first 2000 iterations as burn in and they have also indicated that longer chains can improve stable parameter estimation the criterion for evaluating convergence is 1 1 following cheng et al 2014 2 2 data 2 2 1 dam information in this study dam data fig 1 are collected from different data sources we extract all dam information for mainland china from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 including capacity and the geographic locations of about 850 dams and most have storage capacity greater than 0 01 billion m3 we use the chinese national committee of large dams to complete and correct information such as capacity for some super sized dams storage capacity greater than 10 billion m3 we also conduct data mining based on the 2020 list of persons responsible for the safety of large sized dams storage capacity greater than 0 1 billion m3 and dams announced by the ministry of water resources of china google maps and other search engines are used to supplement missing information on dams and add more than 100 dams table 1 summarizes the minimum dam return periods for different classes of dams dams with a capacity greater than 10 billion m3 are classified as super sized dams with design return periods longer than 1000 5000 years dams with a capacity between 1 and 10 billion m3 are classified into class i with design return periods longer than 1000 5000 years dams with a capacity between 0 1 and 1 billion m3 are classified into class ii with design return periods longer than 300 2000 years and dams with a capacity between 0 01 and 0 1 billion m3 are classified into class iii with design return periods longer than 100 1000 years due to the considerable variation in return periods we select 100 and 1000 years as indicators to evaluate the nonstationary change in return levels which represent the return periods of more than 90 of the dams selected in this study furthermore many super sized dams in china have a capacity greater than 10 billion m3 and longer return periods to further analyze the nonstationary impacts on these super sized dams we select nine closely related basins based on their locations fig 1 and table 2 the super sized dams are mainly distributed in east and central china there are also some super sized dams located in the upper reaches of the yangtze and yellow rivers whereas few dams are located in the northwest some super sized dams are located in the basins with low precipitation such as longyangxia dam in the upper yellow river basin considering the higher construction standards of these dams we use 10000 year return level intensity because it is difficult to describe the impact of nonstationary precipitation change on these dams using only one grid or station hosking and wallis 2005 we take the spatially averaged daily precipitation of all grids in the basin using the mean value will lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation but considering that the future and present extreme precipitation intensity within the same return period will be underestimated at the same time the impact level r will not be greatly affected notably the catchment size and precipitation time should be considered when analyzing the dam risk and we mainly focus on the impact of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation and simplify this process to facilitate the calculation in this study 2 2 2 precipitation data historical and future simulations observed daily precipitation from 1950 to 2016 is obtained from the rainfall estimates on a gridded network regen contractor et al 2020 a global land based dataset of daily precipitation with a resolution of 1 1 which is the longest dataset of daily precipitation based on gauge only records with global land coverage to show the nonstationary impact of different durations 1 day 3 day and 5 day precipitation are considered since most areas of china have a monsoon climate with precipitation mainly in summer our study did not analyze the precipitations in summer and winter months separately global climate models gcms offer plausible future climate scenarios that can be implemented for assessing possible changes in the intensity of extreme precipitation chen et al 2014 here we select six gcms from cmip6 to analyze the future change of extreme precipitation in nine selected basins under the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios namely bcc csm2 mr cesm2 cesm2 waccm inm cm5 0 noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm table 3 these have better performance in simulating precipitation in east asia park et al 2020 for each ssp scenario we calculate the return period level for each model and select the median as the prediction daily precipitation generated by the 6 gcms is bilinearly interpolated which means four neighbors of the target grid are used for linear interpolation in two directions to a horizontal resolution of 1 1 to match the historical data climate models are imperfect realistic representations and must be bias corrected before they are applied ho et al 2012 in this study we use the bias correction method by ho et al 2012 written as 6 x o μ 0 σ 0 σ m x m μ m where x o is predicted data μ 0 and μ m are mean values for observed and simulated historical data respectively σ 0 and σ m are respective standard deviations of observed and simulated historical data and x m is simulated future data 3 results 3 1 regional extreme precipitation change and r extreme precipitation with 100 year and 1000 year return periods under the stationary condition is assumed to be the design intensity of different dam classes considering the nationwide locations of dams precipitation intensity for the 100 year return period for all grids in china is calculated using the stationary gp distribution fig 2 a b c it shows significant spatial variability that generally increases from northwest to southeast specifically for 1 day precipitation southeast china has a high value of about 110 230 mm for 1 day precipitation the 100 year precipitation is about 1 7 and 2 times greater than 3 day and 5 day for most regions while the xinanjiang river basin xab and upper yangtze river basin uyzb have much higher intensity about 2 1 and 2 8 times greater than 3 day and 5 day precipitation respectively as seen in fig 2 d l we find that about 15 20 of areas in china are affected by the nonstationary change which shows significant increases in extreme precipitation r greater than 50 and the impact increases over time for 1 day precipitation duration fig 2 d g and j r values for almost all regions in china are 20 in 2020 in 2060 however about 5 of areas primarily in southeastern china where most dams are located have r greater than 50 the situation will become more severe in 2100 when more than 15 of grids have r values greater than 50 and the grids with the highest values are mainly distributed in the yangtze river basin 80 220 zhujiang river basin 90 390 and some northwestern regions 200 250 compared with 1 day 3 day fig 2 e h and k and 5 day fig 2 f i and l precipitation show higher r values in northwest china but lower values in southeast china r values for 3 day and 5 day are slightly lower in the upper yangtze river 70 180 and zhujiang river basin 80 270 but much higher in parts of northwest china 250 350 which appears to indicate that dams in the areas with less rainfall are more possibly to be affected by the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation with longer durations for the 1000 year return level fig 3 the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation and r values is consistent with the 100 year results however the 1000 year return level is of greater significance to large sized dams and large sized dams have r values of 50 100 in the yangtze river basin 100 160 in the zhujiang river basin and 150 270 in the southeastern river basin for all durations the 1 day and 3 day precipitation impacts are also significantly higher than the 5 day impacts for example in the yangtze river basin 75 and 70 of grids have r values greater than 50 in 2100 for 1 day and 3 day precipitation respectively while only 60 exceed this threshold for 5 day precipitation furthermore we find that the increase in nonstationary impact is nonlinear over time and accelerates in some regions ignoring grids with decreasing r or increasing r values with non significant impacts r 50 in 2100 the change in r from 2060 to 2100 is 1 2 times greater than that from 2020 to 2060 for example for the 100 year return level and 1 day precipitation more than 95 of all grids with r higher than 50 by 2100 have an accelerated increase 3 2 impacts on medium and large sized dams to further analyze the impacts of nonstationary change on different dam classes we plot the scatter of dam capacity versus r values for grids where the dams are located fig 4 and fig 5 for classes ii and iii with return periods from 300 to 2000 years the r values for both 100 and 1000 year return levels are considered whereas for class i only the 1000 year return level impact is needed in general most dams more than 80 are located in regions with r values 50 at all times for all durations and the impacts gradually increase over time for all classes almost no dams are affected in 2020 when r values are concentrated near 0 values increase in 2060 and 2100 and by 2100 15 of dams are expected to be affected significantly r greater than 50 comparing the nonstationary impacts of different precipitation durations we find that the impacts of shorter duration are more significant for all dam classes the numbers of affected class i dams by 1 day 15 dams and 3 day 17 dams precipitation are significantly higher than those impacted by 5 day 9 dams precipitation for classes ii iii the numbers of dams affected r of either 100 or 1000 years is greater than 50 are 141 for 1 day and 132 for 3 day precipitation both of which are higher than 117 for 5 day precipitation we also observe that ten dams in classes ii iii are severely influenced r higher than 200 by 1 day precipitation but almost no dam has r greater than 200 due to 3 day and 5 day precipitation 3 3 impact on super sized dams for basins with super sized dams no basins have r values greater than 100 in any situation which suggests that the future safety of super sized dams locations are shown in fig 1 in china is expected to be reliable fig 6 if we consider regions with r 20 by 2100 as no impact for basins like the middle yangtze river basin middle and lower yellow river basin and liaohe yalu river basin r values for all precipitation durations are always 20 even negative for 3 day or 5 day which suggests that super sized dams in these basins may not be affected at all again r values vary greatly at different durations in the same basin the langcangjiang river basin and xinfengjiang river basin have high r values for 1 day 85 and 82 precipitation but low values under 3 day 23 and 25 precipitation and no impacts r 20 at 5 day precipitation similarly the upper yangtze river basin only has a high r value under 1 day 51 precipitation but no impacts for 3 day and 5 day precipitation the upper yellow river basin has a high r value for 3 day 56 precipitation low r for 5 day 22 precipitation and no impact for 1 day precipitation the zhujiang river basin and basin xinanjiang river basin has low r for 3 day 22 precipitation or 5 day 24 precipitation but no impacts under the other two durations these differences in durations may provide a reference for future disaster prevention strategies that different durations of extreme precipitation should be taken into account for different regions for example the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation for basin lancangjiang river basin is mainly reflected in 1 day precipitation duration which increases from 53 3 mm to 98 6 mm by 2100 it suggests that in this basin short term but severe extreme precipitation needs to be considered however in basin upper yellow river basin the impact of 3 day precipitation is more significant and thus a change in 3 day extreme precipitation should be an area of focus the potential impacts on super sized dams using cmip6 data are plotted in fig 7 which shows that nonstationary change in extreme precipitation is expected to have more significant impacts under the ssp585 scenario than ssp126 we find non significant impacts r 20 in most basins under the ssp126 scenario for all precipitation durations whereas under the ssp585 scenario most basins have r values greater than 20 for all durations except for upper yangtze river basin and upper yellow river basin the significant impacts r greater than 100 of extreme precipitation change on dam security appear only in some basins under the ssp585 scenario in 2100 specifically the zhujiang river basin has r greater than 100 under 3 day 112 and 5 day 134 precipitation and xinanjiang river basin has r greater than 100 under 1 day 110 and 5 day 156 precipitation these results suggest that the potential impacts of climate change on super sized dams are more likely to appear in high emission scenarios we also notice that the impacts of precipitation duration vary greatly under the ssp585 scenario the variability of r between different durations is the highest in xinanjiang river basin and about 60 under ssp585 under ssp126 the highest variability is about 40 in xinanjiang river basin compared to impact ratios calculated using the nonstationary gp distribution the results for the ssp126 scenario from cmip 6 are comparable in most basins most basins have r values 50 for most precipitation durations using both approaches in particular the middle yangtze river basin middle and lower yellow river basin and liaohe yalu river basin have r values 20 for all durations using both approaches however in some basins r calculated using the nonstationary gp distribution under a certain duration is significantly higher than results from the ssp126 scenario for example the largest possible r values calculated from the nonstationary gp distribution are 85 1 day 82 1 day 51 1 day and 57 3 day for lancangjiang river basin xinfengjiang river basin upper yangtze river basin and upper yellow river basin respectively while the corresponding values under ssp126 are 16 1 day 11 1 day 2 1 day and 3 3 day respectively 4 discussion in this study there are significant differences in the impacts of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation at different durations which may be due to both the local precipitation characteristics and the method for describing extreme precipitation in fig 8 a we select the lancangjiang river basin as an example to show extreme values at different durations with trends tested by the nonparametric mann kendall test we find that only 5 day precipitation increases over time p value 0 05 while 1 day and 3 day show no significant trend indicating that nonstationary change may not exist for all durations at the same time in addition calculating extreme precipitation with an extended return period from a probability distribution may not be accurate in the case of the lancangjiang river basin fig 8b and c higher 3 day precipitation is noticeable compared to 5 day precipitation with a 10000 year return period comparing the 10000 year return levels for different precipitation durations at all grid points in china we find that this phenomenon exists in many regions most of which are in arid areas in the north and northwest fig 8d f this suggests that extreme precipitation with a long return period from the gp distribution may have overestimated short term duration or underestimated long term duration which may be the reason why more dams are affected by short term extreme precipitation change in the previous section there are also uncertainties in calculating extreme precipitation intensity under the nonstationary condition agilan and umamahesh 2018 and su and chen 2019 have pointed out that the introduction of covariates leads to more uncertainties and covariate selection also greatly affects the results china s climate is greatly influenced by the eastern asian monsoon ding and chan 2005 as well as large scale atmospheric circulation such as the enso agilan and umamahesh 2017 song et al 2020 due to higher spatial heterogeneity the best performing covariates vary significantly across different regions gao et al 2016 agilan and umamahesh 2017 song et al 2020 which may have a crucial impact on nonstationary change prediction under extreme precipitation therefore we compare four other covariates the eastern asian summer monsoon index easmi the southern oscillation index soi the multivariate enso index mei and local temperature data with 32 combinations of covariates table 4 to see whether temporal covariates are suitable for our study the best combination is not consistent from the spatial perspective different regions or temporal perspective different durations fig 9 we find that the time covariate is suitable in most conditions the time covariate fits best for the 1 day precipitation duration and it is also suitable for 5 day precipitation in most basins but less suitable for the 3 day duration it suggests that adopting a time covariate in this study is a safe option and our previous results are reliable 5 conclusions in this study we predict the exceedance of extreme precipitation over the design intensity in the future to examine the impacts of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation over different durations on dams in china the following conclusions can be drawn overall there are significant nonstationary increases in extreme precipitation over 100 year and 1000 year return periods for about 15 20 of areas in china by 2100 with strong regional differences significant increases are found in southeast and south china including the yangtze river basin zhujiang river basin and southeastern river basin where most dams are located the increase of the nonstationary impact is nonlinear over time and accelerates in some regions as the change in r from 2060 to 2100 is 1 2 times more than from 2020 to 2060 in most regions according to the impact ratios all dam classes are expected to be partially affected by the extreme precipitation changes about 15 of the medium sized and large sized dams are expected to be affected by extreme precipitation increase r greater than 50 by 2100 whereas all super sized dams may remain safe and reliable r 100 nonstationary changes in different durations of extreme precipitation vary greatly and have inconsistent impacts on different dam classes the impacts of short term duration extreme precipitation change on dams are more significant on all medium sized and large sized dams for super sized dams however the differences in r across the three durations are highly spatially variable the lancangjiang river basin r 85 and xinfengjiang river basin r 82 are expected to be affected by 1 day extreme precipitation change whereas the upper yangtze river basin r 51 is affected by 3 day precipitation r values in the other cases are low r 50 or show no impact r 20 by analyzing the projected precipitation data from cmip 6 models we find that the zhujiang river basin and xinanjiang river basin may be affected greatly r greater than 100 by the end of this century under the ssp585 scenario specifically the zhujiang river basin is expected to be impacted by 3 day r 112 and 5 day r 134 extreme precipitation change and xinanjiang river basin is expected to be mainly affected by 1 day r 110 and 5 day r 156 however under the ssp126 scenario most basins have low r 50 or no impact r 20 for all durations in addition the impact levels calculated from the ssp126 scenario in most basins are consistent with the nonstationary gp distribution however in the lancangjiang river basin xinfengjiang river basin upper yangtze river basin and upper yellow river basin the impacts of extreme precipitation change under the ssp126 scenario r 20 are significantly lower than those calculated using the nonstationary gp distribution r greater than 50 assessing dam safety is a highly complex task as many studies have suggested heavy precipitation does not necessarily lead to high discharge and catchment size is another important contributing factor in this study we consider the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation compared to the design intensity under stationary assumption but do not take into account the specific underlying surface conditions which may have overestimated the risk level for instance some areas of northwest china may be significantly affected by the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation but the 1000 year intensity of extreme precipitation in these areas is generally predicted to be 50 mm day which is less likely to affect the safety of the dams considering the local arid climate therefore these conclusions are of significant reference and still need further improvement credit authorship contribution statement hefei huang methodology software visualization

4124,due to the changing climate and environment the stationary assumption used to calculate the design precipitation or flood of dams is no longer suitable threatening dam reliability and safety to see whether nonstationary changes in extreme precipitation will impact existing dams in china we quantify the exceedance of extreme precipitation over the design intensity by the impact level r where the future extreme precipitation intensity is calculated from the nonstationary generalized pareto gp distribution we mainly focus on medium reservoir capacity greater than 0 1 billion m3 large reservoir capacity greater than 1 billion m3 and super sized dams reservoir capacity greater than 10 billion m3 which have design return periods longer than 100 years we find that about 15 20 of regions in china may have significant increases in extreme precipitation in the future mainly in the southeast and northwest 15 of medium and large sized dams of china may be significantly affected r greater than 50 and more dams are expected to be affected by 1 day 156 and 3 day 149 precipitation compared as opposed to 5 day 128 precipitation for super sized dams there is no possible significant impact in any of the basins all r 100 by 2100 under the current nonstationary assumption but results using cmip6 data show that dams over the zhujiang river basin and xinanjiang river basin are expected to be impacted r greater than 100 under the ssp585 scenario however under the ssp126 scenario the impacts of extreme precipitation are consistent with the nonstationary analysis results which suggest non significant impacts in all basins keywords extreme precipitation nonstationary change impact level generalized pareto distribution dams 1 introduction global warming has increased the risk of extreme precipitation worldwide o gorman and schneider 2009 neelin et al 2017 vu and mishra 2019 many studies have suggested that more frequent and intensified extreme precipitation events are expected under continuous climate change in the future donat et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 papalexiou and montanari 2019 huang et al 2021 such nonstationary change in extreme precipitation raises a new question will it cause more significant damage or even the failure of existing water conservation facilities many studies have suggested that nonstationary change may or will affect the service life of hydraulic construction projects valdez et al 2010 and other urban infrastructure mailhot and duchesne 2010 al ghadi et al 2020 or increase the risk of bridge and highway damage or even failure akhtar et al 2018 akhter 2018 it is essential for established facilities especially hydraulic construction projects with long service life to examine if climate change will put their reliability at risk according to the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china there are nearly 100 000 dams of various types with a total storage capacity of more than 800 billion m3 in practical engineering the design flood or precipitation is used to ensure the reliability of the hydraulic projects in the design period the design intensity which is often defined by the maximum possible flood or precipitation value that could pass through without damage or threatening the projects can be obtained from frequency analysis with sufficient available long time series data regulation for calculating design flood of water resources and hydropower projects of china states that the most commonly used method is pearson s three type curve gu et al 2016 recently some studies have attempted to apply the generalized extreme value gev and the generalized pareto gp distributions to improve the fitted results lima et al 2016 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 sarhadi and soulis 2017 however the above approaches operate under the stationary assumption that hydrometeorological characteristics remain constant over time sarhadi et al 2016 which has limited utility under a rapidly changing climate cheng et al 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 milly et al 2018 vu and mishra 2019 different distributions can be applied to nonstationary conditions including the generalized extreme value gev distribution gao et al 2016 vu and mishra 2019 song et al 2020 the generalized pareto gp distribution mondal and mujumdar 2015 thiombiano et al 2017 and the log pearson type iii lp3 distribution ragno et al 2019 nonstationary conditions are often considered by adding different meteorological factors as covariates such as the el nino southern oscillation enso index the southern oscillation index soi monthly sea surface temperature sst and global and local mean temperature which are used to analyze the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation in india mondal and mujumdar 2015 and in the united states vu and mishra 2019 song et al 2020 also have considered the impact of urbanization and the eastern asian summer monsoon index easmi in china gao et al 2016 have tested the nonstationary change of extreme precipitation at 631 stations across the country and analyzed it using the nonstationary gev distribution shi et al 2014 have found that precipitation event frequency and intensity in china have significantly increased in recent decades in addition many studies have concluded that extreme precipitation intensity has increased significantly in southeast china over the past few decades zhai et al 2005 piao et al 2010 zhang and cong 2014 xiao et al 2017 chen et al 2021 assuming that the extreme precipitation keeps intensifying and exceeding the design level of the dams in the future some dams may be significantly affected especially in southeast china where most dams are located it is critical to understand when and where the increase of extreme precipitation will exceed their design precipitation whether the changes in extreme precipitation will affect the reliability and safety of dams in china remains unclear from existing literature thus to fill the gap we aim to assess the potential impacts of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation on different dam classes due to future climate change to that end we first access dam information from different sources and assign each dam a return period and intensity while considering the complexity in construction standards and the natural environment of each dam the intensity is assumed to be extreme precipitation under the assigned return level where the dam is located using stationary gp distribution then the nonstationary gp distribution is applied to quantify the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation compared to intensity finally we use projected precipitation data from six cmip6 models under two shared socioeconomic pathways ssps to verify the impact on super sized dams notably analyzing the damage risk of the dams should take the rainfall runoff processes and specific underlying surface conditions into account while in this study we mainly focus on the possible impact of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation on the dams which may not fully represent the risk of damage to the dams 2 methods and data 2 1 methods we define the potential impact level r as the ratio of future extreme precipitation intensity and design intensity as 1 r t n t s s 100 where s is dam s design intensity calculated by the local stationary gp distribution and n t is precipitation intensity at time t calculated from the local nonstationary gp distribution then we can use the comparison of the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation and the design intensity of dams to evaluate the climate change impact on dams therefore compared with the design intensity higher intensity of future extreme precipitation will result in higher impact on the dams notably this method can intuitively represent the possible impact of extreme precipitation change on the dams but when quantifying dam safety risk the analysis of rainfall runoff processes is still essential a safety factor is assigned to ensure dam safety according to its importance geographic location and hydrological conditions which is the ratio of theoretical force to actual force for example the overall safety factor of the three gorges dam is 2 0 due to the large number and complex types of dams in china the safety factor of super sized dams is assumed to be 2 0 and other large and medium sized dams are assumed to be 1 5 in this study therefore if r is greater than 100 for super sized dams and greater than 50 for other large sized and medium sized dams they are considered to be significantly affected 2 1 1 stationary and nonstationary gp distribution in this study the pds partial duration series gp approach is selected to calculate the return level of extreme precipitation this approach has excellent performance for describing extreme precipitation and its probability density function pdf is written as 2 p y 1 σ 1 ξ y σ 1 ξ 1 where y x u 0 u 0 ξ and σ are the threshold shape parameter and scale parameter respectively wang 1991 then the nonstationary condition is applied to eq 2 with time varying covariate of scale parameters written as 3 σ σ 0 t σ 1 where t is the time covariate and σ 0 and σ 1 are the regression parameters as shown in eq 2 a threshold u 0 is needed to filter out extreme values due to the complicated climate conditions of china we set different u 0 for different regions in this study and calculate them based on the mean residual life method which uses the linear relationship between the mean of extreme values e and the threshold u 0 referring to langousis et al 2016 we linearly fit all points u e u and select a suitable u j as the minimum of the weighted mean square error wmse w j 4 w j n j j v a r x u j x u j where n j is the total number of points and j is the position of u j in ascending order of u we obtain n extreme values exceeding the threshold u j and set u j as the threshold u 0 in addition corresponding quantiles for y year return level are no longer p 1 1 y but p 1 y 0 ny where y 0 is the observation data length year 2 1 2 parameter estimation based on the bayesian approach the bayesian approach has been widely implemented for evaluating parameters cheng et al 2014 ragno et al 2019 song et al 2020 this study uses the bayesian based markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach referring to cheng et al 2014 which provides both parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification the vector containing the parameters θ σ ξ of the gp distribution can be estimated as 5 p σ ξ x i 1 n p σ p ξ p x i θ where the likelihood function is the gp distribution according to renard et al 2013 the default prior for the scale parameters σ is non informative normal distribution and for the shape parameter ξ the default prior is assumed to have a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 3 cheng et al 2014 for all grids in this study setting the chains with length 5000 and discarding the first 4000 iterations as burn in improve stable parameter estimation which is higher than cheng et al 2014 have suggested chains with length 3000 and discarding the first 2000 iterations as burn in and they have also indicated that longer chains can improve stable parameter estimation the criterion for evaluating convergence is 1 1 following cheng et al 2014 2 2 data 2 2 1 dam information in this study dam data fig 1 are collected from different data sources we extract all dam information for mainland china from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 including capacity and the geographic locations of about 850 dams and most have storage capacity greater than 0 01 billion m3 we use the chinese national committee of large dams to complete and correct information such as capacity for some super sized dams storage capacity greater than 10 billion m3 we also conduct data mining based on the 2020 list of persons responsible for the safety of large sized dams storage capacity greater than 0 1 billion m3 and dams announced by the ministry of water resources of china google maps and other search engines are used to supplement missing information on dams and add more than 100 dams table 1 summarizes the minimum dam return periods for different classes of dams dams with a capacity greater than 10 billion m3 are classified as super sized dams with design return periods longer than 1000 5000 years dams with a capacity between 1 and 10 billion m3 are classified into class i with design return periods longer than 1000 5000 years dams with a capacity between 0 1 and 1 billion m3 are classified into class ii with design return periods longer than 300 2000 years and dams with a capacity between 0 01 and 0 1 billion m3 are classified into class iii with design return periods longer than 100 1000 years due to the considerable variation in return periods we select 100 and 1000 years as indicators to evaluate the nonstationary change in return levels which represent the return periods of more than 90 of the dams selected in this study furthermore many super sized dams in china have a capacity greater than 10 billion m3 and longer return periods to further analyze the nonstationary impacts on these super sized dams we select nine closely related basins based on their locations fig 1 and table 2 the super sized dams are mainly distributed in east and central china there are also some super sized dams located in the upper reaches of the yangtze and yellow rivers whereas few dams are located in the northwest some super sized dams are located in the basins with low precipitation such as longyangxia dam in the upper yellow river basin considering the higher construction standards of these dams we use 10000 year return level intensity because it is difficult to describe the impact of nonstationary precipitation change on these dams using only one grid or station hosking and wallis 2005 we take the spatially averaged daily precipitation of all grids in the basin using the mean value will lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation but considering that the future and present extreme precipitation intensity within the same return period will be underestimated at the same time the impact level r will not be greatly affected notably the catchment size and precipitation time should be considered when analyzing the dam risk and we mainly focus on the impact of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation and simplify this process to facilitate the calculation in this study 2 2 2 precipitation data historical and future simulations observed daily precipitation from 1950 to 2016 is obtained from the rainfall estimates on a gridded network regen contractor et al 2020 a global land based dataset of daily precipitation with a resolution of 1 1 which is the longest dataset of daily precipitation based on gauge only records with global land coverage to show the nonstationary impact of different durations 1 day 3 day and 5 day precipitation are considered since most areas of china have a monsoon climate with precipitation mainly in summer our study did not analyze the precipitations in summer and winter months separately global climate models gcms offer plausible future climate scenarios that can be implemented for assessing possible changes in the intensity of extreme precipitation chen et al 2014 here we select six gcms from cmip6 to analyze the future change of extreme precipitation in nine selected basins under the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios namely bcc csm2 mr cesm2 cesm2 waccm inm cm5 0 noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm table 3 these have better performance in simulating precipitation in east asia park et al 2020 for each ssp scenario we calculate the return period level for each model and select the median as the prediction daily precipitation generated by the 6 gcms is bilinearly interpolated which means four neighbors of the target grid are used for linear interpolation in two directions to a horizontal resolution of 1 1 to match the historical data climate models are imperfect realistic representations and must be bias corrected before they are applied ho et al 2012 in this study we use the bias correction method by ho et al 2012 written as 6 x o μ 0 σ 0 σ m x m μ m where x o is predicted data μ 0 and μ m are mean values for observed and simulated historical data respectively σ 0 and σ m are respective standard deviations of observed and simulated historical data and x m is simulated future data 3 results 3 1 regional extreme precipitation change and r extreme precipitation with 100 year and 1000 year return periods under the stationary condition is assumed to be the design intensity of different dam classes considering the nationwide locations of dams precipitation intensity for the 100 year return period for all grids in china is calculated using the stationary gp distribution fig 2 a b c it shows significant spatial variability that generally increases from northwest to southeast specifically for 1 day precipitation southeast china has a high value of about 110 230 mm for 1 day precipitation the 100 year precipitation is about 1 7 and 2 times greater than 3 day and 5 day for most regions while the xinanjiang river basin xab and upper yangtze river basin uyzb have much higher intensity about 2 1 and 2 8 times greater than 3 day and 5 day precipitation respectively as seen in fig 2 d l we find that about 15 20 of areas in china are affected by the nonstationary change which shows significant increases in extreme precipitation r greater than 50 and the impact increases over time for 1 day precipitation duration fig 2 d g and j r values for almost all regions in china are 20 in 2020 in 2060 however about 5 of areas primarily in southeastern china where most dams are located have r greater than 50 the situation will become more severe in 2100 when more than 15 of grids have r values greater than 50 and the grids with the highest values are mainly distributed in the yangtze river basin 80 220 zhujiang river basin 90 390 and some northwestern regions 200 250 compared with 1 day 3 day fig 2 e h and k and 5 day fig 2 f i and l precipitation show higher r values in northwest china but lower values in southeast china r values for 3 day and 5 day are slightly lower in the upper yangtze river 70 180 and zhujiang river basin 80 270 but much higher in parts of northwest china 250 350 which appears to indicate that dams in the areas with less rainfall are more possibly to be affected by the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation with longer durations for the 1000 year return level fig 3 the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation and r values is consistent with the 100 year results however the 1000 year return level is of greater significance to large sized dams and large sized dams have r values of 50 100 in the yangtze river basin 100 160 in the zhujiang river basin and 150 270 in the southeastern river basin for all durations the 1 day and 3 day precipitation impacts are also significantly higher than the 5 day impacts for example in the yangtze river basin 75 and 70 of grids have r values greater than 50 in 2100 for 1 day and 3 day precipitation respectively while only 60 exceed this threshold for 5 day precipitation furthermore we find that the increase in nonstationary impact is nonlinear over time and accelerates in some regions ignoring grids with decreasing r or increasing r values with non significant impacts r 50 in 2100 the change in r from 2060 to 2100 is 1 2 times greater than that from 2020 to 2060 for example for the 100 year return level and 1 day precipitation more than 95 of all grids with r higher than 50 by 2100 have an accelerated increase 3 2 impacts on medium and large sized dams to further analyze the impacts of nonstationary change on different dam classes we plot the scatter of dam capacity versus r values for grids where the dams are located fig 4 and fig 5 for classes ii and iii with return periods from 300 to 2000 years the r values for both 100 and 1000 year return levels are considered whereas for class i only the 1000 year return level impact is needed in general most dams more than 80 are located in regions with r values 50 at all times for all durations and the impacts gradually increase over time for all classes almost no dams are affected in 2020 when r values are concentrated near 0 values increase in 2060 and 2100 and by 2100 15 of dams are expected to be affected significantly r greater than 50 comparing the nonstationary impacts of different precipitation durations we find that the impacts of shorter duration are more significant for all dam classes the numbers of affected class i dams by 1 day 15 dams and 3 day 17 dams precipitation are significantly higher than those impacted by 5 day 9 dams precipitation for classes ii iii the numbers of dams affected r of either 100 or 1000 years is greater than 50 are 141 for 1 day and 132 for 3 day precipitation both of which are higher than 117 for 5 day precipitation we also observe that ten dams in classes ii iii are severely influenced r higher than 200 by 1 day precipitation but almost no dam has r greater than 200 due to 3 day and 5 day precipitation 3 3 impact on super sized dams for basins with super sized dams no basins have r values greater than 100 in any situation which suggests that the future safety of super sized dams locations are shown in fig 1 in china is expected to be reliable fig 6 if we consider regions with r 20 by 2100 as no impact for basins like the middle yangtze river basin middle and lower yellow river basin and liaohe yalu river basin r values for all precipitation durations are always 20 even negative for 3 day or 5 day which suggests that super sized dams in these basins may not be affected at all again r values vary greatly at different durations in the same basin the langcangjiang river basin and xinfengjiang river basin have high r values for 1 day 85 and 82 precipitation but low values under 3 day 23 and 25 precipitation and no impacts r 20 at 5 day precipitation similarly the upper yangtze river basin only has a high r value under 1 day 51 precipitation but no impacts for 3 day and 5 day precipitation the upper yellow river basin has a high r value for 3 day 56 precipitation low r for 5 day 22 precipitation and no impact for 1 day precipitation the zhujiang river basin and basin xinanjiang river basin has low r for 3 day 22 precipitation or 5 day 24 precipitation but no impacts under the other two durations these differences in durations may provide a reference for future disaster prevention strategies that different durations of extreme precipitation should be taken into account for different regions for example the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation for basin lancangjiang river basin is mainly reflected in 1 day precipitation duration which increases from 53 3 mm to 98 6 mm by 2100 it suggests that in this basin short term but severe extreme precipitation needs to be considered however in basin upper yellow river basin the impact of 3 day precipitation is more significant and thus a change in 3 day extreme precipitation should be an area of focus the potential impacts on super sized dams using cmip6 data are plotted in fig 7 which shows that nonstationary change in extreme precipitation is expected to have more significant impacts under the ssp585 scenario than ssp126 we find non significant impacts r 20 in most basins under the ssp126 scenario for all precipitation durations whereas under the ssp585 scenario most basins have r values greater than 20 for all durations except for upper yangtze river basin and upper yellow river basin the significant impacts r greater than 100 of extreme precipitation change on dam security appear only in some basins under the ssp585 scenario in 2100 specifically the zhujiang river basin has r greater than 100 under 3 day 112 and 5 day 134 precipitation and xinanjiang river basin has r greater than 100 under 1 day 110 and 5 day 156 precipitation these results suggest that the potential impacts of climate change on super sized dams are more likely to appear in high emission scenarios we also notice that the impacts of precipitation duration vary greatly under the ssp585 scenario the variability of r between different durations is the highest in xinanjiang river basin and about 60 under ssp585 under ssp126 the highest variability is about 40 in xinanjiang river basin compared to impact ratios calculated using the nonstationary gp distribution the results for the ssp126 scenario from cmip 6 are comparable in most basins most basins have r values 50 for most precipitation durations using both approaches in particular the middle yangtze river basin middle and lower yellow river basin and liaohe yalu river basin have r values 20 for all durations using both approaches however in some basins r calculated using the nonstationary gp distribution under a certain duration is significantly higher than results from the ssp126 scenario for example the largest possible r values calculated from the nonstationary gp distribution are 85 1 day 82 1 day 51 1 day and 57 3 day for lancangjiang river basin xinfengjiang river basin upper yangtze river basin and upper yellow river basin respectively while the corresponding values under ssp126 are 16 1 day 11 1 day 2 1 day and 3 3 day respectively 4 discussion in this study there are significant differences in the impacts of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation at different durations which may be due to both the local precipitation characteristics and the method for describing extreme precipitation in fig 8 a we select the lancangjiang river basin as an example to show extreme values at different durations with trends tested by the nonparametric mann kendall test we find that only 5 day precipitation increases over time p value 0 05 while 1 day and 3 day show no significant trend indicating that nonstationary change may not exist for all durations at the same time in addition calculating extreme precipitation with an extended return period from a probability distribution may not be accurate in the case of the lancangjiang river basin fig 8b and c higher 3 day precipitation is noticeable compared to 5 day precipitation with a 10000 year return period comparing the 10000 year return levels for different precipitation durations at all grid points in china we find that this phenomenon exists in many regions most of which are in arid areas in the north and northwest fig 8d f this suggests that extreme precipitation with a long return period from the gp distribution may have overestimated short term duration or underestimated long term duration which may be the reason why more dams are affected by short term extreme precipitation change in the previous section there are also uncertainties in calculating extreme precipitation intensity under the nonstationary condition agilan and umamahesh 2018 and su and chen 2019 have pointed out that the introduction of covariates leads to more uncertainties and covariate selection also greatly affects the results china s climate is greatly influenced by the eastern asian monsoon ding and chan 2005 as well as large scale atmospheric circulation such as the enso agilan and umamahesh 2017 song et al 2020 due to higher spatial heterogeneity the best performing covariates vary significantly across different regions gao et al 2016 agilan and umamahesh 2017 song et al 2020 which may have a crucial impact on nonstationary change prediction under extreme precipitation therefore we compare four other covariates the eastern asian summer monsoon index easmi the southern oscillation index soi the multivariate enso index mei and local temperature data with 32 combinations of covariates table 4 to see whether temporal covariates are suitable for our study the best combination is not consistent from the spatial perspective different regions or temporal perspective different durations fig 9 we find that the time covariate is suitable in most conditions the time covariate fits best for the 1 day precipitation duration and it is also suitable for 5 day precipitation in most basins but less suitable for the 3 day duration it suggests that adopting a time covariate in this study is a safe option and our previous results are reliable 5 conclusions in this study we predict the exceedance of extreme precipitation over the design intensity in the future to examine the impacts of nonstationary change in extreme precipitation over different durations on dams in china the following conclusions can be drawn overall there are significant nonstationary increases in extreme precipitation over 100 year and 1000 year return periods for about 15 20 of areas in china by 2100 with strong regional differences significant increases are found in southeast and south china including the yangtze river basin zhujiang river basin and southeastern river basin where most dams are located the increase of the nonstationary impact is nonlinear over time and accelerates in some regions as the change in r from 2060 to 2100 is 1 2 times more than from 2020 to 2060 in most regions according to the impact ratios all dam classes are expected to be partially affected by the extreme precipitation changes about 15 of the medium sized and large sized dams are expected to be affected by extreme precipitation increase r greater than 50 by 2100 whereas all super sized dams may remain safe and reliable r 100 nonstationary changes in different durations of extreme precipitation vary greatly and have inconsistent impacts on different dam classes the impacts of short term duration extreme precipitation change on dams are more significant on all medium sized and large sized dams for super sized dams however the differences in r across the three durations are highly spatially variable the lancangjiang river basin r 85 and xinfengjiang river basin r 82 are expected to be affected by 1 day extreme precipitation change whereas the upper yangtze river basin r 51 is affected by 3 day precipitation r values in the other cases are low r 50 or show no impact r 20 by analyzing the projected precipitation data from cmip 6 models we find that the zhujiang river basin and xinanjiang river basin may be affected greatly r greater than 100 by the end of this century under the ssp585 scenario specifically the zhujiang river basin is expected to be impacted by 3 day r 112 and 5 day r 134 extreme precipitation change and xinanjiang river basin is expected to be mainly affected by 1 day r 110 and 5 day r 156 however under the ssp126 scenario most basins have low r 50 or no impact r 20 for all durations in addition the impact levels calculated from the ssp126 scenario in most basins are consistent with the nonstationary gp distribution however in the lancangjiang river basin xinfengjiang river basin upper yangtze river basin and upper yellow river basin the impacts of extreme precipitation change under the ssp126 scenario r 20 are significantly lower than those calculated using the nonstationary gp distribution r greater than 50 assessing dam safety is a highly complex task as many studies have suggested heavy precipitation does not necessarily lead to high discharge and catchment size is another important contributing factor in this study we consider the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation compared to the design intensity under stationary assumption but do not take into account the specific underlying surface conditions which may have overestimated the risk level for instance some areas of northwest china may be significantly affected by the nonstationary change in extreme precipitation but the 1000 year intensity of extreme precipitation in these areas is generally predicted to be 50 mm day which is less likely to affect the safety of the dams considering the local arid climate therefore these conclusions are of significant reference and still need further improvement credit authorship contribution statement hefei huang methodology software visualization
