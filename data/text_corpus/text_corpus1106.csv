5530,fine sediment dynamics downstream dams is a key issue when dealing with environmental impact of hydraulic flushing this paper presents an analysis of six field campaigns carried out during dam flushing events in june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 in the arc isère river system in the northern french alps suspended sediment concentrations ssc and discharges were evaluated using direct measurements or and 1d hydraulic modelling at up to 14 locations along the 120 kilometres long river channel the total suspended sediment flux ssf is analysed along the arc and isère rivers for each arc dam flushing event uncertainties were quantified based on a propagation method of both measurement and modelling errors the resulting confidence interval provides elements of discussion on the significance of the sediment mass balance between two consecutive measurement sites whereas the discharge time series of each flushing event is roughly the same the quantity of fine sediments removed from the reservoirs varied from 10 000 tons in 2007 to 40 000 tons in 2006 also a significant erosion is observed in the river system for some events 20 000 tons in 2007 while the ssf barely varied for other events in 2009 and 2011 this detailed data set allows to identify specific locations in the river network where deposition or erosion occurred this dynamics is closely related to both the hydrology in the upper isère river and the morphology of the arc and isère rivers which have been affected by the 2008 and 2010 floods keywords dam flushing impounded alpine river suspended sediment concentration ssc suspended sediment flux local mass balance 1 introduction about 1 of the total storage capacity in the world s reservoirs is lost each year due to sedimentation mahmood 1987 yoon 1992 vörösmarty et al 2003 this sedimentation rate depends mainly on the size of the reservoir relative to the amount of sediment flowing into it since the construction of new dams is rather difficult in developed countries due to stricter environmental regulations and the lack of suitable sites procedures have been established to sustain the storage capacity of existing reservoirs in numerous cases hydraulic flushing has been used successfully to restore lost reservoir storage capacity kondolf et al 2014 the flushing process consists in opening dam outlet gates to produce flows with velocities high enough to flush away the sediments accumulated in the reservoir theoretical and numerical studies chang et al 1996 olsen 1999 liu et al 2004 khosronejad et al 2008 ji et al 2011 laboratory experiments lai and shen 1996 campisano et al 2004 campisano et al 2008 and field observations jansson and erlingsson 2000 rayan and iguacel 2006 have shown that under appropriate conditions hydraulic flushing can remove both fine with cohesive material and coarse sands and gravels sediments flushing operations can have a significant impact on the morphology and ecology of the downstream part of a river system collier 2002 chung et al 2008 crosa et al 2010 bilotta et al 2012 alcayaga et al 2018 as an example crosa et al 2010 observed a drop in trout density as high as 73 a flushing operation performed in 2006 in an alpine reservoir in this case high suspended sediment concentrations ssc were measured in the downstream part of the river peak values up to 80 g l and event averaged value equal to 4 g l on the other hand when limits for ssc are adopted peteuil et al 2013 espa et al 2015 2019 demonstrated that environmental degradations can be significantly reduced also several studies have focused on the morphological effect of flushing waves on the river bed which mainly concerns coarse sediments kondolf and wilcock 1996 wohl and cenderelli 2000 brandt 2000 petts and gurnell 2005 petticrew et al 2007 these studies identified the direct link existing between the intensity of the flushing operations and the downstream erosion of the river bed gravel bars or main channel however fine sediments transported by flushing flows can also have a morphological impact on the downstream river system smart 1999 van maren et al 2010 following a flushing event brandt 1999 measured an increase of mean bed elevation of 10 centimetres due to the deposition of fine sediments over a 30 kilometre long reach downstream of the cachi dam in costa rica as an exacerbating factor vegetation grows more easily on fine deposits and provides optimal conditions for new deposition of fine sediments due to the local decrease of flow velocities newcombe and macdonald 1991 murle et al 2003 asaeda and rashid 2012 jourdain et al 2017 finally fine sediments can be the vectors of propagation for particulate pollutants and the residence time of the contaminated particles in the river channel is an important parameter to evaluate the vulnerability of a system frémion et al 2016 fine sediment deposition fluxes often represent a small part of the total suspended sediment flux ssf in embanked alpine river for high flow conditions they have been observed as non negligible for small braided systems only navratil et al 2010 misset et al 2019 where exchanges with the bed can be of the same order of magnitude than upstream input therefore the quantification of the mass of fine deposited sediments its spatial distribution and its temporal dynamics during one event is rather difficult to assess for large embanked systems bathymetric surveys performed before and after a flushing event are expensive time consuming and highly exposed to uncertainty measurement regarding the possibly small thickness of fine sediment deposits some aerial photograph analysis provided an estimate of the deposits but limited to surface measurements and difficult to apply to long reaches camenen et al 2013 camenen et al 2016 furthermore the measured bed evolution provides an estimation of the volume of sediments deposited or eroded to be compared to sediment fluxes an additional hypothesis on the sediment mixture and porosity of the bed is needed to convert the differential volume into a sediment mass the method based on ssf consists in estimating the difference between event integrated ssf for two consecutive positions of the river reach such method only provides a reach averaged behaviour that could be difficult to interpret if the distance between two positions is long moreover the uncertainty is sensitive to the temporal frequency of measurements and can sometimes become too high to give relevant conclusions garcia 2008 this explains that few studies have focused on fine sediment budgets based on ssf measurements especially for long embanked systems lópez tarazón et al 2012 none of these studies quantified precisely or examined critically their results with respect to uncertainty values as an example the work of tena et al 2014 on the ebro river improves the understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended sediment transport during flushing flow but it did not address the issue of fine sediment deposition in the river in this paper we raise the following questions what is the downstream dynamics of ssf during dam flushing events in an impounded river system regarding the uncertainty on ssf estimated from a detailed data set what is the significance of local mass balance between two consecutive measurement sites how to explain these mass balances with erosion and deposition processes on the river bed to answer these questions we analysed the propagation of ssf along the arc and isère river system following six hydraulic flushing events of the upper arc dams in june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 for these six flushing events measurements of discharges and ssc were performed at fourteen sites along 120 kilometres of the river downstream of the flushed reservoirs antoine 2013 in the first part of this paper we describe the field campaigns performed to measure water discharges and ssc at different sites of the river system as well as the method developed to explore this detailed data set the obtained instantaneous values of ssf are integrated over the flushing time period in order to compute the local mass balances between two consecutive measurement sites then a model of uncertainty propagation is proposed to estimate the significance of these local mass balances in the second part of the paper a global analysis of discharge ssc and ssf values is provided at the river scale also a discussion is provided on the links between local mass balances and site morphologies and history 2 material and method 2 1 study site the arc isère river system is a typical example of impounded alpine river system largely influenced by river management and dam management 2 1 1 the arc isère river system the isère river and its tributary the arc river are located in the northern french alps the respective surface areas of the catchments are 1950 km 2 and 5570 km 2 for the arc river and the isère river upstream of the city of grenoble fig 1 both catchments are characterized by a nival hydrological regime with an annual mean water discharge of 30 m 3 s for the arc river at pontamafrey and 177 m 3 s for the isère river at grenoble in the second part of the 20 th century three dams with a storage capacity of 0 8 mm 3 were built on the middle section of the arc river the freney dam the pont des chèvres dam and the saint martin la porte dam smlp dam compensation water flows along more than 50 of the total length of the arc river due to the water intakes used for hydropower generation nevertheless tributaries of the arc and isère rivers can be very dynamic and strong seasonal discharge variations occur in both rivers during the year in the middle of summer the mean monthly discharges on the lower arc river can reach 50 m 3 s and 250 m 3 s on the isère river in winter mean monthly discharges are 10 m 3 s on the arc river and 150 m 3 s on the isère river natural floods usually occur at the beginning of summer and in autumn dams are opened during large floods and have no impact on the flood dynamics in the downstream part of the valley because of their low storage capacities marnezy 1999 the discharge for the 10 years flood on arc river pontamafrey is estimated at 180 m 3 s and 900 m 3 s on the isère river grenoble because of continuous embankments the arc river is strongly constrained laterally and the mean slope of the river bed varies from 1 at saint jean de maurienne to 0 2 just upstream of its confluence with the isère river the slope can be locally steeper and supercritical flows are frequently observed on some parts of the river s course the slope of the isère river is smaller with values from 0 2 close to the confluence to 0 09 at the end of the study site both arc and isère river beds are mainly made of gravels with a poorly sorted grain size distribution both rivers are characterized by systems of alternate bars that are often vegetated in the isère river serlet et al 2018 they are also exposed to snow melt floods debris flows and are greatly affected by deposits of fine sediment on vegetated banks this paper focuses on the arc isère river system from the smlp dam to the city of grenoble the locations of the measurement sites are defined in this paper as the distance of the site from the confluence sites on the arc river have negative positions and sites on the isère river have positive positions 2 1 2 flushing of the arc dams to maintain storage capacity and electric power production the three dams of the middle arc river fig 1 are flushed yearly at the beginning of june except if a larger flood occurs before the planned hydraulic flushing for example no flush was performed in 2008 because a 15 years flood occurred in may during the flushing operation the successive openings of the dam outlet gates see fig 2 a are defined precisely to optimize the hydraulic effect of the flush as dam operators follow a project hydrograph similar discharge time series were observed for every flushing event see fig 2b although some differences can be observed because of the natural flow in the arc and isère rivers at the smlp dam the different dam opening phases correspond to the following parts of the hydrograph in the arc river 1 first a warning wave for fauna and hydraulic safety precautions of about 20 m 3 s is generated by an overflow of the clear water 2 then a discharge step is performed providing a discharge amplitude of approximately 90 m 3 s for 3 h 3 water is provided by larger reservoirs on the upper arc watershed bissorte and mont cenis dam reservoirs mainly see fig 1 to maintain the water discharge value and increase it to its maximum value from 130 to 150 m 3 s for about 4 h the maximum discharge value corresponds to a one year flood on the arc river 4 the discharge returns to the compensation water level in 2012 an additional peak up to 175 m 3 s arose during the first discharge step it resulted from some unexpected problems in the gate management 2 2 ssc and discharge measurements to evaluate the suspended load propagation along the reach resulting from dam flushing events high frequency measurements were performed during june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 events these measurements were anticipated and organization was facilitated by planning the dam flushing several weeks in advance measurements consisted in gauging discharges and performing ssc monitoring at several locations along the river reach fig 1 sscs were estimated from samples taken from surface water bucket samples from a bridge or at the riverside isco 4230 automatic sampler at 14 measurement sites fig 1 the samples were filtered and weighed following the iso 11923 protocol ssc estimation was also performed thanks to turbidimeters hach lange solitax sc line ts 50 g l installed at four monitoring stations thollet et al 2018 in these cases water samples were used to establish a relation between the measured turbidity and the effective ssc as a consequence it is important to note that the present study excludes coarse particles such as sand since it is poorly measured from surface and or riverside samples and turbidity in addition samples were taken in main tributaries arvan glandon isère restitution isère river to verify that their concentrations were negligible throughout the flushing events therefore the only effect of these tributaries was to decrease the ssc through dilution discharges were estimated at five sites along the arc isère system a7 a5 a2 i3 and i1 where a hydrometric station is present at these sites water level was measured and the discharge was obtained using well documented rating curves and additional discharge measurements using a classical current meter lspiv image analysis technique and or adcp measurements cf jodeau et al 2008 dramais et al 2011 in addition pressure gauges autonomous diver type and bubbler system pressure gauges were used to measure water level variations at several locations giving information on the transfer time of the flushing waves one dimensional hydraulic model was built for the whole river system to complete the discharge data set the 1d hydraulic numerical code mascaret goutal and maurel 2002 part of the open source telemac mascaret system was used for this study the model geometry was built using topographical data from several river cross section surveys conducted between 2004 and 2007 on the arc and isère rivers 56 river cross sections were available to build the arc river bed giving an average profile density of about 1 cross section per kilometre on the isère river this density was higher about one profile every 200 meters because local slopes can be very steep the calculation mesh was fixed at spatial resolution of 20 m calibration of the strickler coefficients was performed by comparing measured and computed water level and discharge values strickler friction coefficients used to calibrate the model vary from 20 m 1 3 s in the upstream part to 45 m 1 3 s in the downstream part the upstream boundary condition was built from the most upstream discharge time series measured on the river a7 fig 1 using a time shift based on pressure gauge measurements the downstream boundary condition is a free water flux boundary condition three main water inputs were set at randens 10 km upstream the arc isère confluence turbinated water from the aigueblanche reservoir at the confluence upstream part of the isère river and at cheylas 30 km downstream the arc isère confluence turbinated water from the flumet reservoir table 1 summaries the measurement methods used at each measurement site for each flushing event the position of each measurement site is given by its distance from the confluence see also fig 1 both sscs and water discharge time series are thus available at 14 measurement sites for the five flushing events 2 3 suspended sediment fluxes 2 3 1 instantaneous suspended sediment fluxes at each measurement site located at the position x i instantaneous flux values ϕ are computed using a linear interpolation of both discharges and ssc values 1 ϕ x i t q x i t ssc x i t due to a lack of data three data sets were excluded site i4 in 2006 and 2007 and site a1 in 2007 ssc data were measured at site a2 with an automatic sampler however since this site is located 500 m downstream the outlet channel of the randens hydro power plant an incomplete lateral mixing was suspected ssc measurements were performed at several points throughout the river in 2010 the results presented a standard deviation up to 40 due to incomplete lateral mixing even under low ssc conditions consequently no ssc measurement is made at this site since 2011 and the data from this site will be excluded from the flux estimations 2 3 2 suspended sediment fluxes integrated over the flushing event the instantaneous flux computed using eq 1 can be integrated over the time period of the event t event which varies from 12 h in the arc river to 16 h in the isère river due to dispersion processes 2 φ x i t event ϕ x i t dt this temporal integration provides the global mass of suspended sediment φ transported through a measurement site located at position x i a formalism was also introduced to study the temporal dynamic a cumulative transported mass was calculated as a function of the percentage t of t event 3 φ x i t t t event ϕ x i t dt 2 3 3 local mass balance the detailed spatial profiles of the total mass transported at the fourteen measurement sites are used to estimate a local mass balance this local mass balance δ φ between two consecutive measurement sites located at positions x i and x i 1 respectively is expressed such as 4 δ φ i i 1 φ x i 1 φ x i this integrated approach could mask successive deposition or erosion phases during one event then it is possible to obtain a dynamic local mass balance value using eq 3 i e a mass balance between two consecutive measurement sites after t of t event 5 δ φ i i 1 t φ x i 1 t φ x i t note that φ x i φ x i 100 and δ φ i i 1 δ φ i i 1 100 2 4 uncertainty in the integrated flux estimations 2 4 1 uncertainty propagation model as the instantaneous ssc and discharge values are obtained separately the relative variance of the instantaneous ssf can be expressed as the sum of the relative variances σ q 2 and σ ssc 2 of these variables 6 σ ϕ σ q 2 σ ssc 2 according to the methodology developed in the gum joint committee for guides in metrology 2008 the same decomposition of each relative variance σ q and σ ssc is performed to take into account all significant sources of uncertainty in the proposed error propagation model σ q and σ ssc are assumed time averaged 2 4 2 uncertainty of the discharge values uncertainties in the discharge values of the data set come mainly from three sources the measurement method σ q meas the numerical model σ q mod and eventually the temporal linear interpolation σ q int 7 σ q σ q meas 2 σ q mod 2 σ q int 2 measurement method σ q meas the same measurement method is used at the four measurement sites where discharge values are available these measurements are performed using the velocity area method which consists in sampling flow velocity and depth across the cross section for the discrete integration of the discharge using these isolated measurements a rating curve is extrapolated to transform the continuously measured water levels into discharge values the uncertainties resulting from this method are entirely site dependant le coz et al 2012 proposed a method to estimate the uncertainty of this measurement method at site a2 during dam flushing in 2011 using these results the value σ q meas 7 was chosen it is of the same order of magnitude of the uncertainty estimated by olivier et al 2008 from well documented rating curves of several mountainous discharge stations numerical modelling σ q mod for each flushing event the simulated instantaneous discharges were compared to those observed on the four measurement sites the time transfer of the water wave is well reproduced by the model for each flushing as are the maximum discharge values the standard deviation between the measured and modelled discharge was estimated systematically using the following equation 8 σ mi 1 n j 1 n q mod j q meas j q meas j the σ mi values vary from 2 to 7 with an averaged value around 5 larger values correspond generally to low flow discharges which are not as accurately modelled however these low flow discharges are not significant in term of overall fluxes effect of temporal sampling frequency σ q int water levels are measured continuously or calculated numerically with a small time step so the temporal effect of the linear interpolation used to compute the instantaneous suspended sediment flux at every time step is neglected for the discharge values as this assumption is not correct for the ssc measurements this source of uncertainty is taken into account in the following part 2 4 3 uncertainty of the ssc values four main sources of uncertainty are identified concerning the ssc values the vertical σ ssc vh and transversal heterogeneity σ ssc hh of the ssc in a river cross section the different measurement methods used sampled filtered wetted σ ssc spl or from turbidity measurement σ ssc tu and the effect of linear interpolation σ ssc int 9 σ ssc σ ssc hh 2 σ ssc vh 2 σ ssc spl 2 σ ssc tu 2 σ ssc int 2 spatial heterogeneity σ ssc hh and σ ssc vh ssc values are measured assuming a homogeneity throughout river cross section vertical homogeneity depends on the degree of turbulence of the river flow the grain size distribution of the suspended sediments and the geometry of the river bed some studies ryan and boufadel 2006 horowitz et al 1990 have shown that the homogeneity of suspended sediment is highly site dependant vertical ssc distribution has never been estimated on the arc and isère rivers because of the high flow velocities during flushing events however the rouse schmidt number z w s κ u with w s settling velocity of the suspended sediments κ 0 41 von karman constant and u friction velocity gives information on the potential vertical heterogeneity of the suspension garcia 2008 very low values of the rouse schmidt number z 1 indicate that the suspended sediments are well distributed over the vertical dimension of the river cross section such vertical homogeneity was also verified on a secondary channel of the arc river camenen et al 2018 antoine et al 2012 measured the settling velocity of suspended sediments during the flushing event of 2011 and observed a maximum value w s 2 mm s using the numerical hydraulic model to estimate u the maximum value of the rouse schmidt number calculated is thus z 3 10 2 which yields theoretically a relative standard deviation of 3 from the mean value on the ssc profile as a consequence we assume hereafter that σ ssc vh 3 it should be noted that this value would be higher while including the sand fraction lateral homogeneity is mainly function on the lateral variability in turbulence and so on the lateral variability in bed roughness it was studied during the flushing of 2006 némery et al 2013 on the isère river at site i1 where the river slope is the mildest 0 1 and the river cross section is the widest 100 m the measurements were performed at three sampling positions at the surface left middle and right side of the section the average value of the standard deviation was σ ssc hh 5 between the middle of the section and the left and right sides and the error occurred mainly during the lowering phase of the flushing event these two values σ ssc vh 3 and σ ssc hh 5 are used at every measurement site for every flushing event these uncertainty values may be locally higher near confluences indeed in case of a confluence the lateral homogeneity also depends on the longitudinal mixing and the distance to the confluence however since all measurement sites are far enough from confluences except a2 which has been skipped this local effect is neglected measurement method σ ssc spl and σ ssc tu the ssc measurement method plays a key role in error production for this study two different methods were used to measure the ssc a direct method using automatic or manual samples and an indirect method using a turbidimeter the error produced by the first method was studied in laboratory mano 2008 the repeatability of the measurement was tested 40 times on several samples over a range of sscs from 0 02 to 1 g l this experimental study showed that the relative standard deviation decreased rapidly with sscs from 20 1 to 5 5 another experiment was performed with higher concentrations about 10 g l and confirmed the decrease of the mean standard deviation to 2 5 since most of the measured concentrations during a flushing event vary from 1 to 30 g l the relative standard deviation from the direct sampling method was assumed equal to σ ssc spl 2 5 navratil et al 2011 gave a global uncertainty value resulting from the turbidimeter sampling method the authors estimated a relative standard deviation of 5 at high concentrations more than 10 g l and 10 at lower concentrations between 1 and 10 g l in the data set presented in table 1 most of the ssc values obtained from a turbidimeter were lower than 10 g l thus the relative standard deviation is fixed at σ ssc tu 10 however for the specific cases of flushing event turbidity measurements were generally combined with regular isco sampling as a consequence we reduced the error to 5 effect of temporal sampling frequency σ ssc int the term σ ssc int has to be estimated due to the heterogeneity of the sampling frequencies for the ssc measurements a simple formula is proposed to estimate this term between two measured ssc values ssc i and ssc i 1 separated by the time interval δ t the local relative error could be estimated as the product ssc i ssc i 1 δ t normalized by the averaged ssc value ssc i ssc i 1 2 and the time period t event of the flushing event finally the relative standard deviation resulting from the interpolation can be expressed for a whole instantaneous ssc signal of n values as 10 σ ssc int 1 n i 1 n ssc i ssc i 1 δ t t event ssc i ssc i 1 2 as observed in fig 3 σ ssc int decreases with the number of sampled sscs during the event this result allows defining a sampling strategy during the flushing event this indicator varies from about 0 004 for a very high frequency signal turbidimeter to 24 for a low frequency signal manual sampling with a frequency lower than one sample per hour whatever the case uncertainties due to sampling frequency become negligible as soon as there is at least one sample every 30 mn σ ssc int 3 the high frequency obtained thanks to turbidimeters is therefore not so beneficial in terms of overall uncertainty since σ ssc tu 10 2 5 significance of the local mass balance knowing the uncertainty in the integrated flux estimations the significance of the local mass balance δ φ i i 1 can be evaluated regarding the confidence interval of the integrated fluxes calculated at two consecutive measurement sites the condition for a significant erosion or deposition rate between two consecutive measurement sites is thus the following 11 φ x i 1 φ x i σ φ x i 1 σ φ x i 3 results 3 1 total fluxes and global uncertainty the calculated values of φ x i and their associated relative uncertainties σ φ are presented in the table 2 measurements were not achieved every year at the 14 sites generally due to experimental difficulties the uncertainty values of the integrated fluxes vary between 9 2 and 25 9 with a mean and median values of 11 5 and 10 7 respectively fig 4 shows an example of the global uncertainty profile for the 2010 dam flush with the ssc discharge and global uncertainty profiles fig 4a and the resulting confidence interval φ x i σ φ x i fig 4b the global uncertainty stems in almost equal proportions from the uncertainties on discharge and ssc the results are similar for the other flushing events except for the case of very scattered ssc samples in these cases the contribution of the ssc uncertainties is predominant e g in 2006 3 2 spatial evolution of total fluxes as the first measurement site a10 is located only one kilometre downstream to the smlp dam it gives the mass output from the three arc river dams in fig 5 we can see that this total input of sediment from dams varied from 12 000 tons in 2007 to 40 000 tons in 2006 at a9 and 52 000 tons in 2012 these variations in the storage and removal of fine sediment from the reservoirs depend on the upstream watershed incomes and dam management operations during the year separating two consecutive flushing events it should be noted that in fig 5 a decrease respectively increase in φ x i indicates deposition respectively erosion for the 2012 flushing event a larger erosion was observed due to the much larger discharge during the first step of the flushing event that led to a much significant erosion of the dam reservoirs over the whole river system the values of φ x i vary widely depending on the flushing event with some clear difference on the arc and isère rivers respectively on the arc river between a10 50 km and a1 0 km φ x i was conserved in 2006 2009 and 2010 whereas it increased between these two measurement sites by almost 12 000 tons in 2011 60 and 20 000 tons in 2007 and 2012 50 and 40 respectively indicating a large and significant erosion regarding the confidence interval especially in the downstream part of the arc river on the isère river between a1 0 km and i1 63 km φ x i did not vary significantly in 2007 2009 it increased by more than 10 000 tons in 2006 and 2010 40 in 2011 and 2012 some variations were observed but on the upstream isère reach only eventually apart from the 2009 and 2011 events corresponding to the lowest total fluxes one can observe a net erosion over the whole river system from approximately 10 000 tons in 2006 and 2012 to 20 000 tons in 2007 30 40 and 50 respectively this indicates that the river bed responds differently to very similar flushing hydrographs depending on the year a more detailed analysis of the φ spatial evolution shows that even if the value φ x i remained the same conserved or increased along the entire studied area specific local variations may occur especially around st jean de maurienne x 40 km and in the isère river straight after the confluence with the arc river 0 x 15 km strong positive or negative gradients of φ x i can be observed which indicate potentially strong local deposition or erosion processes 3 3 local mass balance regarding the confidence interval some local variations of φ x i appear to be not significant as an example the magnitude of the local variations observed between a4 x 24 km a5 x 33 km and a6 x 38 km is not high enough to be significant regarding the confidence interval for most flushing events fig 4b shows on the opposite a strong positive variation between i3 x 14 km and i2 x 27 km in 2010 which is significant regarding the confidence interval table 3 presents the values of the local mass balance δ φ i i 1 expressed in 10 3 tons along the study area if δ φ i i 1 0 this means that resuspension occurs between two consecutive measurement sites located at positions x i and x i 1 if δ φ i i 1 0 this means that deposition occurs between the two consecutive measurement sites the local mass balance values which are confirmed by the confidence intervals are given in bold font in table 3 following eq 11 it should be noted that depending on the year some intervals have been aggregated due to the absence of data in some sites it does not affect the results since the condition proposed eq 11 does not depend on the distance between the two consecutive measurement sites table 3 indicates that only 14 of the 52 local mass balances are significant for the proposed uncertainty model propagation 5 of the 19 negative mass balances and 9 of the 33 positive mass balances however significant local mass balances highlight different behaviours of the river bed evolution in 2010 a significant deposition is observed just upstream a strong re suspension even if the two successive river reaches separating a8 a7 and a6 have almost the same mean slopes about 1 and reach lengths are smaller than 5 kilometres more generally we can see that flushing events produce significant dynamics in terms of exchange with the river bed with values of re suspension or deposition of fine sediments up to 20 000 tons despite this relatively low significance of the local mass balance values meaningful tendencies may explain why local variations can be significant for one flushing event but not significant for the next one more generally the responses of the river bed can be divided into two groups the river bed gave similar responses for 2009 2010 and 2011 group 1 and similar responses for 2006 and 2007 group 2 the difference observed between the mass balance distributions of groups 1 and 2 is particularly evident for upstream sites in the arc river where the slope of the river bed is high for example high erosion of the bed was observed between measurement sites a8 and a7 before the year 2008 whereas systematic deposition was observed after this year the same behaviour was observed between sites a5 and a4 whereas the opposite was observed between sites a6 and a5 the two groups of flushing events were separated by a major event in may 2008 a natural flood flowed from the upper arc catchment 15 year return period regarding previous results the bed changes due to this flood significantly modified the local mass balance distribution jaballah et al 2015 showed evidences on these large effect of the 2008 flood on the river morphology on a 5 km long reach located between a6 and a5 which confirms its impact on ssf dynamics the flood that occurred in may 2010 the second highest in intensity during the study period and which affected in similar proportions all the sub catchments of the isère watershed did not change this local mass balance distribution the difference of behaviour between flushes could also be partly explained by the settling properties of sediments that can change depending on the storage duration in dam reservoirs legout et al 2018 indeed most deposits in dam reservoirs form during the spring period depending on the exact date of the dam flushing their storage duration can vary from a few days to a few months depending on the hydrology 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal dynamics of discharge and ssc the analysis of ssc and discharge signals gives information on their variability along both rivers and could provide some clues about the differences in flux dynamics from one flushing event to another in fig 6 the discharge and concentration measurement are presented for the dam flushes of 2007 and 2009 at pontamafrey a7 and grenoble i1 respectively on site a7 the ssc patterns resulting from the 2007 and 2009 flushing events differ in shape and magnitude in 2007 the peak ssc value 16 7 g l was measured during the first discharge step of the flushing hydrograph whereas the peak value of the 2009 ssc signal 10 9 g l appeared during the second discharge step these differences may be explained by the availability of the fine sediments and the erosion processes in the three dam reservoirs of the arc river in 2007 the ssc peak value corresponds to sediments that are easily removed from the reservoirs while the second part of the ssc signal is related to sediments removed due to higher bed shear stresses higher discharge values super critical flows in the dam reservoirs in 2009 the sediments of the dam reservoirs were more difficult to remove and the ssc signal increased only from the increasing part of the second discharge step as a consequence the sediment input is highly function of the hydrology during the months preceding the flushing event and so the accumulation of fresh fine sediments in dam reservoirs during the spring period on site i1 the ssc signals are smoothed because of the long distance travelled along the river and the dispersion processes the differences between the ssc peak values are attenuated one should note that the ssc peak is measured systematically after the discharge peak of the hydrograph since the flood wave travels faster than flow velocity 4 2 hydrology influence on ssc dynamics in order to understand the possible influence of the hydrology on the fine sediment dynamics we define an average discharge for the spring season before the flushing event q m spring i e from the 1st april to the day before the flushing event at both a7 and i1 location as well as a base discharge q m base during the flushing event on the isère river at i1 location averaged discharge on the day before the flushing event indeed the q max values are almost the same whatever the event on the arc river they increase only with the input from tributaries i e at the isère restitution x 8 km the isère confluence x 0 km and at the cheylas restitution x 20 km results are presented in table 4 together with the concentration peak values measured at a7 location for both discharge step in general the second peak of concentration during the 2nd plateau is higher than the first one since bed shear stresses are higher in the dam reservoirs however in 2007 a lower value is observed indicating a smaller stock of fine sediments in the reservoirs it could be explained by the flood event in september 2006 q max 150 m 3 s only two other significant floods for which dam gates were opened were observed during the period between 2005 and 2012 the may 2008 flood q max 450 m 3 s and the june 2010 flood q max 160 m 3 s similarly the following flushing event in 2009 and 2011 yielded a low total flux φ just after dam reservoirs i e φ 20 000 tons the initial total flux from dam reservoir is thus function of the duration without dam operation on the other hand the hydrology during the spring period does not appear to influence significantly the amount of fine sediment to be eroded no correlation could be found between the average flow q m spring on the two month prior to the flushing event and the initial total flux also we note that erosion generally occurred in the isère river when the base discharge q m base in the isère river is the highest 2006 2010 and 2012 this could be explained as the gravel bar were then flooded and fine sediment stocks over gravel bars could be resuspended however for the 2012 event which reached the largest discharges close to 500 m3 s highest vegetated part of gravels bars have been flooded and have enhanced deposition we expect to relate erosion on the downstream part of the arc river observed in 2007 2011 and 2012 with the additional flow discharge coming from the restitution q m rest however no clear correlation could be made 4 3 initial quantity of erodible sediments in the river bed continuous ssf measurements at site i1 which integrate the whole study area are available over the whole period of the study with a sampling step of 30 min more specifically the cumulative ssf measured at site i1 during the 2 3 months preceding each flushing from 1st april event showed large variations as a function of the event table 4 from 125 000 tons in 2011 to 1 000 000 tons in 2010 the large amounts of sediment mass in 2006 and 2010 were mostly due to a very active spring period but also due to some engineering works on the isère dikes in 2010 also a large compensation reservoir directly connected to the arc river just upstream a7 x 40 km was cleaned out over a three month period in 2010 and 2011 in 2006 and 2010 the 2 month integrated ssf at i1 reached very large values that have potentially led to large deposition over gravel bars significant re suspension have been observed on the isère river during the flushing events performed these two years and on the arc river during the 2006 event which appears consistent with the hydrology during the spring period the cleaning of the compensation reservoir in 2011 could also explain the large re suspension observed in the arc river during the following flushing event just upstream the confluence with the isère river in any case the sediment mass transported during a flushing event does not represent more than 5 of the annual suspended sediment mass transiting at site i1 these results corroborate previous estimations of the contribution of hydraulic flushes to annual ssf of the isère river némery et al 2013 our results confirm the importance of the suspended sediment dynamics before the event during the spring period indeed the spatial distribution of sediment deposits strongly affects the possible resuspension of sediment during the flushing event some studies droppo et al 2001 have shown the effect of sequential bed depositions under several flow conditions in the bed erosion process especially if the proportion of cohesive sediments in the total suspended load is non negligible 4 4 dynamic mass balance table 3 gives spatial information on the local mass balances per river reach for example the river bed between the two consecutive measurement sites a4 and a3 was systematically eroded as was the river bed between a3 and a1 furthermore the lengths of these two reaches are almost equal 12 km however the values of the dynamic and time normalized mass balance δ φ i i 1 t eq 5 on these parts of the river bed show very different mass transport dynamics during the flushing events in fig 7 c and d the values of δ φ a 3 a 1 t and δ φ a 4 a 3 t respectively are plotted as a function of the time made dimensionless with the duration of the event t event although the two reaches of the river were globally eroded at the end of the flushing event the a3 a1 reach endured first some large erosion and then some deposition this succession of erosion and deposition could be explained by an easily erodible mass of sediment on the river bed that was removed by the first discharge step of the flush hydrograph during the second discharge step the water level became high enough to flow on gravel bars implying significant deposition on the other hand the a4 a3 reach endured successively considerable deposition and then even larger erosion during the same event fig 7d on this reach two large easily submersible banks and a small dam reservoir were the only remarkable sites they could indeed explain the following mass balance dynamics from 2009 to 2011 events before the first discharge step the reservoir was emptied removing a small proportion of the fine deposited sediments this first release generated nevertheless a ssc peak at a relative low discharge value and did not influence the global mass balance value the first discharge step led to considerable deposition on the easily submersible banks which were eventually easily re suspended by the second discharge step furthermore the second discharge step involved sufficiently high water levels to remove the upper layer of sediment deposited in the small reservoir the global mass balances calculated for all the events were in this case not representative of the temporal dynamics of this reach where the exchange processes with the river bed were significant this cumulative method is also applied to confirm the effect of the flood in may 2008 as it appears in table 3 i e different river bed responses before and after the flood on the two previous examples from fig 7 c and d we can see that deposition and erosion dynamics suddenly changed between 2007 and 2009 even if the mass balance at the end of the events remain positive the dynamics changed from significant exchanges with the river bed to simple transfer of sediment mass and vice versa after 2009 the dynamics tend back to the one observed before the 2008 flood the dynamic cumulative mass balance for the more upstream reaches a8 a7 and a5 a4 are presented in fig 7 a and b respectively if the overall impact of the dam flushes on these reaches was generally deposition they presented a first step of erosion followed by a large deposition on the second part of the event these two additional examples also confirm the 2008 flood impact on ssf dynamics in these two other reaches linked to the large modifications of the river morphology jaballah et al 2015 indeed the opposite behaviour was observed in 2007 compared to the events after 2008 the global mass balances changing global erosion into global deposition b or inverse a the four examples presented in fig 7 show that the river reaches have not the same ability to recover the prior flood equilibrium reaches like the ones between a5 and a4 or a3 and a1 show in 2011 very similar dynamics than the one observed in 2007 for the two other reaches the prior dynamics were still not recovered in 2011 it also shows the dominating influence of river morphology on ssf dynamics 4 5 physical characteristics of the transported sediments sediments parameters like grain size and or settling velocity but also suspended concentration are fundamental for predicting deposition processes legout et al 2018 their variability could also explain observed differences between flushing events or river reaches garcia 2008 in 2011 grain size distribution gsd have been measured for every sediment samples at a5 a1 and i1 sites grain size characteristics averaged over the flushing period are presented in table 5 these grain size measurements show that few differences are observed between the three measurement sites for this event even if a small fining is observed only the percentile d 90 changed significantly between a1 and i1 in 2011 one observed a significant local erosion between a5 and a1 and a significant local deposition between a1 and i3 this year the local deposition between a1 and i3 could be related to the decrease of d 90 values with a position of the coarsest particles downstream the confluence with the isère river during the flushing event of june 2011 the additional discharge coming from the upper isère river was low and the flow velocity could have decrease significantly downstream the confluence where the river width is larger despite the significant local erosion observed between a5 and a1 no change were measured in terms of grain size distributions fig 7 b c and d shows the local dynamics of erosion and deposition between a5 and a1 in 2011 the flux was globally transferred between a5 and a4 with a first period of deposition followed by a period of erosion in this case one can conclude that the freshly deposed sediments during the first part of the event have been re suspended during the second part of the event explaining the constant gsd however between a3 and a1 the opposite behaviour is observed previous sediments deposits on the river bed were replaced by the suspended sediments coming from upstream however a similar gsd is observed indicating a certain consistency of the long term dynamics of the fine deposits in these reaches 5 conclusion six field campaigns were analysed to evaluate the impact of dam flushing events on suspended sediment dynamics downstream of the dams ssc and discharge measurements were performed on the arc and isère rivers france at 14 sites in june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 these intensive measurement campaigns allowed an estimation of suspended sediment fluxes along the reaches of both rivers as well as the local mass balance to estimate the significance of the observed local variations a propagation model for the uncertainty on the global flux was built taking into account the main sources of error for both ssc and discharges the mean calculated uncertainty value was σ φ 11 5 these uncertainty values confirm the global tendency of suspended sediment flux propagation whereas only 14 out of 52 local mass balances between two consecutive measurement sites were significant also a dynamic time normalized method was developed to evaluate and discuss temporal variations of the mass balance during one flushing event even if the dam flushing operating protocol was identical over the years except for 2012 the suspended sediment mass removed from the reservoirs varied from 10 000 tons in 2007 to 40 000 tons in 2006 the hydrology on the upper arc river during the previous spring period significantly affected the efficiency of these flushing events on the other hand the global fine sediment mass balance along the studied river segment varied from zero in 2011 and 2009 to 30 000 tons in 2007 indicating also a strong effect of the initial state stock of fine sediments in the river but also river geometry we showed that the bed morphology significantly modified the fine sediments dynamics indeed the may 2008 flood a 15 year return period flood on the arc river that largely modified both arc and isère river morphologies yielded major changes in fine sediment dynamics during flushing events indeed opposite behaviour were observed for many reaches in terms of global mass balance after the flushing event but also in terms of temporal dynamics during the event erosion followed by deposition or the opposite another point to be addressed is the quantity and quality of the fine sediment stocks in the river bed i e surface deposits and stocks infiltrated in the bed matrix indeed our knowledge of the stocks remains very limited it would be important to evaluate the quantity of available sediments as deposits but also stocked in the river bed that could be re suspended as soon as coarse particles are mobilized navratil et al 2010 misset et al 2019 more continuous monitoring of ssf but also direct measurements on the river bed and in dam reservoirs are necessary to estimate the initial state of the river bed and the availability of the fine sediments in reservoirs to better predict the effect of dam flushing investigations must now focus on combining the analysis of local morphodynamics and global hydrological aspects more in detail it could be eventually made in the future thanks to repeated lidar surveys assuming that topographic changes are only due to fine sediment dynamics and only occur on gravel bars an important issue is the sand fraction it corresponds indeed to approximately 50 of the deposit volume camenen et al 2016 whereas sand flux are not captured by the turbidimeters nor by the surface sampling network also the use of a numerical model to calculate downstream sediment propagation would help dam operators to optimize dam flushing scenarios credit authorship contribution statement g antoine validation formal analysis

5530,fine sediment dynamics downstream dams is a key issue when dealing with environmental impact of hydraulic flushing this paper presents an analysis of six field campaigns carried out during dam flushing events in june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 in the arc isère river system in the northern french alps suspended sediment concentrations ssc and discharges were evaluated using direct measurements or and 1d hydraulic modelling at up to 14 locations along the 120 kilometres long river channel the total suspended sediment flux ssf is analysed along the arc and isère rivers for each arc dam flushing event uncertainties were quantified based on a propagation method of both measurement and modelling errors the resulting confidence interval provides elements of discussion on the significance of the sediment mass balance between two consecutive measurement sites whereas the discharge time series of each flushing event is roughly the same the quantity of fine sediments removed from the reservoirs varied from 10 000 tons in 2007 to 40 000 tons in 2006 also a significant erosion is observed in the river system for some events 20 000 tons in 2007 while the ssf barely varied for other events in 2009 and 2011 this detailed data set allows to identify specific locations in the river network where deposition or erosion occurred this dynamics is closely related to both the hydrology in the upper isère river and the morphology of the arc and isère rivers which have been affected by the 2008 and 2010 floods keywords dam flushing impounded alpine river suspended sediment concentration ssc suspended sediment flux local mass balance 1 introduction about 1 of the total storage capacity in the world s reservoirs is lost each year due to sedimentation mahmood 1987 yoon 1992 vörösmarty et al 2003 this sedimentation rate depends mainly on the size of the reservoir relative to the amount of sediment flowing into it since the construction of new dams is rather difficult in developed countries due to stricter environmental regulations and the lack of suitable sites procedures have been established to sustain the storage capacity of existing reservoirs in numerous cases hydraulic flushing has been used successfully to restore lost reservoir storage capacity kondolf et al 2014 the flushing process consists in opening dam outlet gates to produce flows with velocities high enough to flush away the sediments accumulated in the reservoir theoretical and numerical studies chang et al 1996 olsen 1999 liu et al 2004 khosronejad et al 2008 ji et al 2011 laboratory experiments lai and shen 1996 campisano et al 2004 campisano et al 2008 and field observations jansson and erlingsson 2000 rayan and iguacel 2006 have shown that under appropriate conditions hydraulic flushing can remove both fine with cohesive material and coarse sands and gravels sediments flushing operations can have a significant impact on the morphology and ecology of the downstream part of a river system collier 2002 chung et al 2008 crosa et al 2010 bilotta et al 2012 alcayaga et al 2018 as an example crosa et al 2010 observed a drop in trout density as high as 73 a flushing operation performed in 2006 in an alpine reservoir in this case high suspended sediment concentrations ssc were measured in the downstream part of the river peak values up to 80 g l and event averaged value equal to 4 g l on the other hand when limits for ssc are adopted peteuil et al 2013 espa et al 2015 2019 demonstrated that environmental degradations can be significantly reduced also several studies have focused on the morphological effect of flushing waves on the river bed which mainly concerns coarse sediments kondolf and wilcock 1996 wohl and cenderelli 2000 brandt 2000 petts and gurnell 2005 petticrew et al 2007 these studies identified the direct link existing between the intensity of the flushing operations and the downstream erosion of the river bed gravel bars or main channel however fine sediments transported by flushing flows can also have a morphological impact on the downstream river system smart 1999 van maren et al 2010 following a flushing event brandt 1999 measured an increase of mean bed elevation of 10 centimetres due to the deposition of fine sediments over a 30 kilometre long reach downstream of the cachi dam in costa rica as an exacerbating factor vegetation grows more easily on fine deposits and provides optimal conditions for new deposition of fine sediments due to the local decrease of flow velocities newcombe and macdonald 1991 murle et al 2003 asaeda and rashid 2012 jourdain et al 2017 finally fine sediments can be the vectors of propagation for particulate pollutants and the residence time of the contaminated particles in the river channel is an important parameter to evaluate the vulnerability of a system frémion et al 2016 fine sediment deposition fluxes often represent a small part of the total suspended sediment flux ssf in embanked alpine river for high flow conditions they have been observed as non negligible for small braided systems only navratil et al 2010 misset et al 2019 where exchanges with the bed can be of the same order of magnitude than upstream input therefore the quantification of the mass of fine deposited sediments its spatial distribution and its temporal dynamics during one event is rather difficult to assess for large embanked systems bathymetric surveys performed before and after a flushing event are expensive time consuming and highly exposed to uncertainty measurement regarding the possibly small thickness of fine sediment deposits some aerial photograph analysis provided an estimate of the deposits but limited to surface measurements and difficult to apply to long reaches camenen et al 2013 camenen et al 2016 furthermore the measured bed evolution provides an estimation of the volume of sediments deposited or eroded to be compared to sediment fluxes an additional hypothesis on the sediment mixture and porosity of the bed is needed to convert the differential volume into a sediment mass the method based on ssf consists in estimating the difference between event integrated ssf for two consecutive positions of the river reach such method only provides a reach averaged behaviour that could be difficult to interpret if the distance between two positions is long moreover the uncertainty is sensitive to the temporal frequency of measurements and can sometimes become too high to give relevant conclusions garcia 2008 this explains that few studies have focused on fine sediment budgets based on ssf measurements especially for long embanked systems lópez tarazón et al 2012 none of these studies quantified precisely or examined critically their results with respect to uncertainty values as an example the work of tena et al 2014 on the ebro river improves the understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended sediment transport during flushing flow but it did not address the issue of fine sediment deposition in the river in this paper we raise the following questions what is the downstream dynamics of ssf during dam flushing events in an impounded river system regarding the uncertainty on ssf estimated from a detailed data set what is the significance of local mass balance between two consecutive measurement sites how to explain these mass balances with erosion and deposition processes on the river bed to answer these questions we analysed the propagation of ssf along the arc and isère river system following six hydraulic flushing events of the upper arc dams in june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 for these six flushing events measurements of discharges and ssc were performed at fourteen sites along 120 kilometres of the river downstream of the flushed reservoirs antoine 2013 in the first part of this paper we describe the field campaigns performed to measure water discharges and ssc at different sites of the river system as well as the method developed to explore this detailed data set the obtained instantaneous values of ssf are integrated over the flushing time period in order to compute the local mass balances between two consecutive measurement sites then a model of uncertainty propagation is proposed to estimate the significance of these local mass balances in the second part of the paper a global analysis of discharge ssc and ssf values is provided at the river scale also a discussion is provided on the links between local mass balances and site morphologies and history 2 material and method 2 1 study site the arc isère river system is a typical example of impounded alpine river system largely influenced by river management and dam management 2 1 1 the arc isère river system the isère river and its tributary the arc river are located in the northern french alps the respective surface areas of the catchments are 1950 km 2 and 5570 km 2 for the arc river and the isère river upstream of the city of grenoble fig 1 both catchments are characterized by a nival hydrological regime with an annual mean water discharge of 30 m 3 s for the arc river at pontamafrey and 177 m 3 s for the isère river at grenoble in the second part of the 20 th century three dams with a storage capacity of 0 8 mm 3 were built on the middle section of the arc river the freney dam the pont des chèvres dam and the saint martin la porte dam smlp dam compensation water flows along more than 50 of the total length of the arc river due to the water intakes used for hydropower generation nevertheless tributaries of the arc and isère rivers can be very dynamic and strong seasonal discharge variations occur in both rivers during the year in the middle of summer the mean monthly discharges on the lower arc river can reach 50 m 3 s and 250 m 3 s on the isère river in winter mean monthly discharges are 10 m 3 s on the arc river and 150 m 3 s on the isère river natural floods usually occur at the beginning of summer and in autumn dams are opened during large floods and have no impact on the flood dynamics in the downstream part of the valley because of their low storage capacities marnezy 1999 the discharge for the 10 years flood on arc river pontamafrey is estimated at 180 m 3 s and 900 m 3 s on the isère river grenoble because of continuous embankments the arc river is strongly constrained laterally and the mean slope of the river bed varies from 1 at saint jean de maurienne to 0 2 just upstream of its confluence with the isère river the slope can be locally steeper and supercritical flows are frequently observed on some parts of the river s course the slope of the isère river is smaller with values from 0 2 close to the confluence to 0 09 at the end of the study site both arc and isère river beds are mainly made of gravels with a poorly sorted grain size distribution both rivers are characterized by systems of alternate bars that are often vegetated in the isère river serlet et al 2018 they are also exposed to snow melt floods debris flows and are greatly affected by deposits of fine sediment on vegetated banks this paper focuses on the arc isère river system from the smlp dam to the city of grenoble the locations of the measurement sites are defined in this paper as the distance of the site from the confluence sites on the arc river have negative positions and sites on the isère river have positive positions 2 1 2 flushing of the arc dams to maintain storage capacity and electric power production the three dams of the middle arc river fig 1 are flushed yearly at the beginning of june except if a larger flood occurs before the planned hydraulic flushing for example no flush was performed in 2008 because a 15 years flood occurred in may during the flushing operation the successive openings of the dam outlet gates see fig 2 a are defined precisely to optimize the hydraulic effect of the flush as dam operators follow a project hydrograph similar discharge time series were observed for every flushing event see fig 2b although some differences can be observed because of the natural flow in the arc and isère rivers at the smlp dam the different dam opening phases correspond to the following parts of the hydrograph in the arc river 1 first a warning wave for fauna and hydraulic safety precautions of about 20 m 3 s is generated by an overflow of the clear water 2 then a discharge step is performed providing a discharge amplitude of approximately 90 m 3 s for 3 h 3 water is provided by larger reservoirs on the upper arc watershed bissorte and mont cenis dam reservoirs mainly see fig 1 to maintain the water discharge value and increase it to its maximum value from 130 to 150 m 3 s for about 4 h the maximum discharge value corresponds to a one year flood on the arc river 4 the discharge returns to the compensation water level in 2012 an additional peak up to 175 m 3 s arose during the first discharge step it resulted from some unexpected problems in the gate management 2 2 ssc and discharge measurements to evaluate the suspended load propagation along the reach resulting from dam flushing events high frequency measurements were performed during june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 events these measurements were anticipated and organization was facilitated by planning the dam flushing several weeks in advance measurements consisted in gauging discharges and performing ssc monitoring at several locations along the river reach fig 1 sscs were estimated from samples taken from surface water bucket samples from a bridge or at the riverside isco 4230 automatic sampler at 14 measurement sites fig 1 the samples were filtered and weighed following the iso 11923 protocol ssc estimation was also performed thanks to turbidimeters hach lange solitax sc line ts 50 g l installed at four monitoring stations thollet et al 2018 in these cases water samples were used to establish a relation between the measured turbidity and the effective ssc as a consequence it is important to note that the present study excludes coarse particles such as sand since it is poorly measured from surface and or riverside samples and turbidity in addition samples were taken in main tributaries arvan glandon isère restitution isère river to verify that their concentrations were negligible throughout the flushing events therefore the only effect of these tributaries was to decrease the ssc through dilution discharges were estimated at five sites along the arc isère system a7 a5 a2 i3 and i1 where a hydrometric station is present at these sites water level was measured and the discharge was obtained using well documented rating curves and additional discharge measurements using a classical current meter lspiv image analysis technique and or adcp measurements cf jodeau et al 2008 dramais et al 2011 in addition pressure gauges autonomous diver type and bubbler system pressure gauges were used to measure water level variations at several locations giving information on the transfer time of the flushing waves one dimensional hydraulic model was built for the whole river system to complete the discharge data set the 1d hydraulic numerical code mascaret goutal and maurel 2002 part of the open source telemac mascaret system was used for this study the model geometry was built using topographical data from several river cross section surveys conducted between 2004 and 2007 on the arc and isère rivers 56 river cross sections were available to build the arc river bed giving an average profile density of about 1 cross section per kilometre on the isère river this density was higher about one profile every 200 meters because local slopes can be very steep the calculation mesh was fixed at spatial resolution of 20 m calibration of the strickler coefficients was performed by comparing measured and computed water level and discharge values strickler friction coefficients used to calibrate the model vary from 20 m 1 3 s in the upstream part to 45 m 1 3 s in the downstream part the upstream boundary condition was built from the most upstream discharge time series measured on the river a7 fig 1 using a time shift based on pressure gauge measurements the downstream boundary condition is a free water flux boundary condition three main water inputs were set at randens 10 km upstream the arc isère confluence turbinated water from the aigueblanche reservoir at the confluence upstream part of the isère river and at cheylas 30 km downstream the arc isère confluence turbinated water from the flumet reservoir table 1 summaries the measurement methods used at each measurement site for each flushing event the position of each measurement site is given by its distance from the confluence see also fig 1 both sscs and water discharge time series are thus available at 14 measurement sites for the five flushing events 2 3 suspended sediment fluxes 2 3 1 instantaneous suspended sediment fluxes at each measurement site located at the position x i instantaneous flux values ϕ are computed using a linear interpolation of both discharges and ssc values 1 ϕ x i t q x i t ssc x i t due to a lack of data three data sets were excluded site i4 in 2006 and 2007 and site a1 in 2007 ssc data were measured at site a2 with an automatic sampler however since this site is located 500 m downstream the outlet channel of the randens hydro power plant an incomplete lateral mixing was suspected ssc measurements were performed at several points throughout the river in 2010 the results presented a standard deviation up to 40 due to incomplete lateral mixing even under low ssc conditions consequently no ssc measurement is made at this site since 2011 and the data from this site will be excluded from the flux estimations 2 3 2 suspended sediment fluxes integrated over the flushing event the instantaneous flux computed using eq 1 can be integrated over the time period of the event t event which varies from 12 h in the arc river to 16 h in the isère river due to dispersion processes 2 φ x i t event ϕ x i t dt this temporal integration provides the global mass of suspended sediment φ transported through a measurement site located at position x i a formalism was also introduced to study the temporal dynamic a cumulative transported mass was calculated as a function of the percentage t of t event 3 φ x i t t t event ϕ x i t dt 2 3 3 local mass balance the detailed spatial profiles of the total mass transported at the fourteen measurement sites are used to estimate a local mass balance this local mass balance δ φ between two consecutive measurement sites located at positions x i and x i 1 respectively is expressed such as 4 δ φ i i 1 φ x i 1 φ x i this integrated approach could mask successive deposition or erosion phases during one event then it is possible to obtain a dynamic local mass balance value using eq 3 i e a mass balance between two consecutive measurement sites after t of t event 5 δ φ i i 1 t φ x i 1 t φ x i t note that φ x i φ x i 100 and δ φ i i 1 δ φ i i 1 100 2 4 uncertainty in the integrated flux estimations 2 4 1 uncertainty propagation model as the instantaneous ssc and discharge values are obtained separately the relative variance of the instantaneous ssf can be expressed as the sum of the relative variances σ q 2 and σ ssc 2 of these variables 6 σ ϕ σ q 2 σ ssc 2 according to the methodology developed in the gum joint committee for guides in metrology 2008 the same decomposition of each relative variance σ q and σ ssc is performed to take into account all significant sources of uncertainty in the proposed error propagation model σ q and σ ssc are assumed time averaged 2 4 2 uncertainty of the discharge values uncertainties in the discharge values of the data set come mainly from three sources the measurement method σ q meas the numerical model σ q mod and eventually the temporal linear interpolation σ q int 7 σ q σ q meas 2 σ q mod 2 σ q int 2 measurement method σ q meas the same measurement method is used at the four measurement sites where discharge values are available these measurements are performed using the velocity area method which consists in sampling flow velocity and depth across the cross section for the discrete integration of the discharge using these isolated measurements a rating curve is extrapolated to transform the continuously measured water levels into discharge values the uncertainties resulting from this method are entirely site dependant le coz et al 2012 proposed a method to estimate the uncertainty of this measurement method at site a2 during dam flushing in 2011 using these results the value σ q meas 7 was chosen it is of the same order of magnitude of the uncertainty estimated by olivier et al 2008 from well documented rating curves of several mountainous discharge stations numerical modelling σ q mod for each flushing event the simulated instantaneous discharges were compared to those observed on the four measurement sites the time transfer of the water wave is well reproduced by the model for each flushing as are the maximum discharge values the standard deviation between the measured and modelled discharge was estimated systematically using the following equation 8 σ mi 1 n j 1 n q mod j q meas j q meas j the σ mi values vary from 2 to 7 with an averaged value around 5 larger values correspond generally to low flow discharges which are not as accurately modelled however these low flow discharges are not significant in term of overall fluxes effect of temporal sampling frequency σ q int water levels are measured continuously or calculated numerically with a small time step so the temporal effect of the linear interpolation used to compute the instantaneous suspended sediment flux at every time step is neglected for the discharge values as this assumption is not correct for the ssc measurements this source of uncertainty is taken into account in the following part 2 4 3 uncertainty of the ssc values four main sources of uncertainty are identified concerning the ssc values the vertical σ ssc vh and transversal heterogeneity σ ssc hh of the ssc in a river cross section the different measurement methods used sampled filtered wetted σ ssc spl or from turbidity measurement σ ssc tu and the effect of linear interpolation σ ssc int 9 σ ssc σ ssc hh 2 σ ssc vh 2 σ ssc spl 2 σ ssc tu 2 σ ssc int 2 spatial heterogeneity σ ssc hh and σ ssc vh ssc values are measured assuming a homogeneity throughout river cross section vertical homogeneity depends on the degree of turbulence of the river flow the grain size distribution of the suspended sediments and the geometry of the river bed some studies ryan and boufadel 2006 horowitz et al 1990 have shown that the homogeneity of suspended sediment is highly site dependant vertical ssc distribution has never been estimated on the arc and isère rivers because of the high flow velocities during flushing events however the rouse schmidt number z w s κ u with w s settling velocity of the suspended sediments κ 0 41 von karman constant and u friction velocity gives information on the potential vertical heterogeneity of the suspension garcia 2008 very low values of the rouse schmidt number z 1 indicate that the suspended sediments are well distributed over the vertical dimension of the river cross section such vertical homogeneity was also verified on a secondary channel of the arc river camenen et al 2018 antoine et al 2012 measured the settling velocity of suspended sediments during the flushing event of 2011 and observed a maximum value w s 2 mm s using the numerical hydraulic model to estimate u the maximum value of the rouse schmidt number calculated is thus z 3 10 2 which yields theoretically a relative standard deviation of 3 from the mean value on the ssc profile as a consequence we assume hereafter that σ ssc vh 3 it should be noted that this value would be higher while including the sand fraction lateral homogeneity is mainly function on the lateral variability in turbulence and so on the lateral variability in bed roughness it was studied during the flushing of 2006 némery et al 2013 on the isère river at site i1 where the river slope is the mildest 0 1 and the river cross section is the widest 100 m the measurements were performed at three sampling positions at the surface left middle and right side of the section the average value of the standard deviation was σ ssc hh 5 between the middle of the section and the left and right sides and the error occurred mainly during the lowering phase of the flushing event these two values σ ssc vh 3 and σ ssc hh 5 are used at every measurement site for every flushing event these uncertainty values may be locally higher near confluences indeed in case of a confluence the lateral homogeneity also depends on the longitudinal mixing and the distance to the confluence however since all measurement sites are far enough from confluences except a2 which has been skipped this local effect is neglected measurement method σ ssc spl and σ ssc tu the ssc measurement method plays a key role in error production for this study two different methods were used to measure the ssc a direct method using automatic or manual samples and an indirect method using a turbidimeter the error produced by the first method was studied in laboratory mano 2008 the repeatability of the measurement was tested 40 times on several samples over a range of sscs from 0 02 to 1 g l this experimental study showed that the relative standard deviation decreased rapidly with sscs from 20 1 to 5 5 another experiment was performed with higher concentrations about 10 g l and confirmed the decrease of the mean standard deviation to 2 5 since most of the measured concentrations during a flushing event vary from 1 to 30 g l the relative standard deviation from the direct sampling method was assumed equal to σ ssc spl 2 5 navratil et al 2011 gave a global uncertainty value resulting from the turbidimeter sampling method the authors estimated a relative standard deviation of 5 at high concentrations more than 10 g l and 10 at lower concentrations between 1 and 10 g l in the data set presented in table 1 most of the ssc values obtained from a turbidimeter were lower than 10 g l thus the relative standard deviation is fixed at σ ssc tu 10 however for the specific cases of flushing event turbidity measurements were generally combined with regular isco sampling as a consequence we reduced the error to 5 effect of temporal sampling frequency σ ssc int the term σ ssc int has to be estimated due to the heterogeneity of the sampling frequencies for the ssc measurements a simple formula is proposed to estimate this term between two measured ssc values ssc i and ssc i 1 separated by the time interval δ t the local relative error could be estimated as the product ssc i ssc i 1 δ t normalized by the averaged ssc value ssc i ssc i 1 2 and the time period t event of the flushing event finally the relative standard deviation resulting from the interpolation can be expressed for a whole instantaneous ssc signal of n values as 10 σ ssc int 1 n i 1 n ssc i ssc i 1 δ t t event ssc i ssc i 1 2 as observed in fig 3 σ ssc int decreases with the number of sampled sscs during the event this result allows defining a sampling strategy during the flushing event this indicator varies from about 0 004 for a very high frequency signal turbidimeter to 24 for a low frequency signal manual sampling with a frequency lower than one sample per hour whatever the case uncertainties due to sampling frequency become negligible as soon as there is at least one sample every 30 mn σ ssc int 3 the high frequency obtained thanks to turbidimeters is therefore not so beneficial in terms of overall uncertainty since σ ssc tu 10 2 5 significance of the local mass balance knowing the uncertainty in the integrated flux estimations the significance of the local mass balance δ φ i i 1 can be evaluated regarding the confidence interval of the integrated fluxes calculated at two consecutive measurement sites the condition for a significant erosion or deposition rate between two consecutive measurement sites is thus the following 11 φ x i 1 φ x i σ φ x i 1 σ φ x i 3 results 3 1 total fluxes and global uncertainty the calculated values of φ x i and their associated relative uncertainties σ φ are presented in the table 2 measurements were not achieved every year at the 14 sites generally due to experimental difficulties the uncertainty values of the integrated fluxes vary between 9 2 and 25 9 with a mean and median values of 11 5 and 10 7 respectively fig 4 shows an example of the global uncertainty profile for the 2010 dam flush with the ssc discharge and global uncertainty profiles fig 4a and the resulting confidence interval φ x i σ φ x i fig 4b the global uncertainty stems in almost equal proportions from the uncertainties on discharge and ssc the results are similar for the other flushing events except for the case of very scattered ssc samples in these cases the contribution of the ssc uncertainties is predominant e g in 2006 3 2 spatial evolution of total fluxes as the first measurement site a10 is located only one kilometre downstream to the smlp dam it gives the mass output from the three arc river dams in fig 5 we can see that this total input of sediment from dams varied from 12 000 tons in 2007 to 40 000 tons in 2006 at a9 and 52 000 tons in 2012 these variations in the storage and removal of fine sediment from the reservoirs depend on the upstream watershed incomes and dam management operations during the year separating two consecutive flushing events it should be noted that in fig 5 a decrease respectively increase in φ x i indicates deposition respectively erosion for the 2012 flushing event a larger erosion was observed due to the much larger discharge during the first step of the flushing event that led to a much significant erosion of the dam reservoirs over the whole river system the values of φ x i vary widely depending on the flushing event with some clear difference on the arc and isère rivers respectively on the arc river between a10 50 km and a1 0 km φ x i was conserved in 2006 2009 and 2010 whereas it increased between these two measurement sites by almost 12 000 tons in 2011 60 and 20 000 tons in 2007 and 2012 50 and 40 respectively indicating a large and significant erosion regarding the confidence interval especially in the downstream part of the arc river on the isère river between a1 0 km and i1 63 km φ x i did not vary significantly in 2007 2009 it increased by more than 10 000 tons in 2006 and 2010 40 in 2011 and 2012 some variations were observed but on the upstream isère reach only eventually apart from the 2009 and 2011 events corresponding to the lowest total fluxes one can observe a net erosion over the whole river system from approximately 10 000 tons in 2006 and 2012 to 20 000 tons in 2007 30 40 and 50 respectively this indicates that the river bed responds differently to very similar flushing hydrographs depending on the year a more detailed analysis of the φ spatial evolution shows that even if the value φ x i remained the same conserved or increased along the entire studied area specific local variations may occur especially around st jean de maurienne x 40 km and in the isère river straight after the confluence with the arc river 0 x 15 km strong positive or negative gradients of φ x i can be observed which indicate potentially strong local deposition or erosion processes 3 3 local mass balance regarding the confidence interval some local variations of φ x i appear to be not significant as an example the magnitude of the local variations observed between a4 x 24 km a5 x 33 km and a6 x 38 km is not high enough to be significant regarding the confidence interval for most flushing events fig 4b shows on the opposite a strong positive variation between i3 x 14 km and i2 x 27 km in 2010 which is significant regarding the confidence interval table 3 presents the values of the local mass balance δ φ i i 1 expressed in 10 3 tons along the study area if δ φ i i 1 0 this means that resuspension occurs between two consecutive measurement sites located at positions x i and x i 1 if δ φ i i 1 0 this means that deposition occurs between the two consecutive measurement sites the local mass balance values which are confirmed by the confidence intervals are given in bold font in table 3 following eq 11 it should be noted that depending on the year some intervals have been aggregated due to the absence of data in some sites it does not affect the results since the condition proposed eq 11 does not depend on the distance between the two consecutive measurement sites table 3 indicates that only 14 of the 52 local mass balances are significant for the proposed uncertainty model propagation 5 of the 19 negative mass balances and 9 of the 33 positive mass balances however significant local mass balances highlight different behaviours of the river bed evolution in 2010 a significant deposition is observed just upstream a strong re suspension even if the two successive river reaches separating a8 a7 and a6 have almost the same mean slopes about 1 and reach lengths are smaller than 5 kilometres more generally we can see that flushing events produce significant dynamics in terms of exchange with the river bed with values of re suspension or deposition of fine sediments up to 20 000 tons despite this relatively low significance of the local mass balance values meaningful tendencies may explain why local variations can be significant for one flushing event but not significant for the next one more generally the responses of the river bed can be divided into two groups the river bed gave similar responses for 2009 2010 and 2011 group 1 and similar responses for 2006 and 2007 group 2 the difference observed between the mass balance distributions of groups 1 and 2 is particularly evident for upstream sites in the arc river where the slope of the river bed is high for example high erosion of the bed was observed between measurement sites a8 and a7 before the year 2008 whereas systematic deposition was observed after this year the same behaviour was observed between sites a5 and a4 whereas the opposite was observed between sites a6 and a5 the two groups of flushing events were separated by a major event in may 2008 a natural flood flowed from the upper arc catchment 15 year return period regarding previous results the bed changes due to this flood significantly modified the local mass balance distribution jaballah et al 2015 showed evidences on these large effect of the 2008 flood on the river morphology on a 5 km long reach located between a6 and a5 which confirms its impact on ssf dynamics the flood that occurred in may 2010 the second highest in intensity during the study period and which affected in similar proportions all the sub catchments of the isère watershed did not change this local mass balance distribution the difference of behaviour between flushes could also be partly explained by the settling properties of sediments that can change depending on the storage duration in dam reservoirs legout et al 2018 indeed most deposits in dam reservoirs form during the spring period depending on the exact date of the dam flushing their storage duration can vary from a few days to a few months depending on the hydrology 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal dynamics of discharge and ssc the analysis of ssc and discharge signals gives information on their variability along both rivers and could provide some clues about the differences in flux dynamics from one flushing event to another in fig 6 the discharge and concentration measurement are presented for the dam flushes of 2007 and 2009 at pontamafrey a7 and grenoble i1 respectively on site a7 the ssc patterns resulting from the 2007 and 2009 flushing events differ in shape and magnitude in 2007 the peak ssc value 16 7 g l was measured during the first discharge step of the flushing hydrograph whereas the peak value of the 2009 ssc signal 10 9 g l appeared during the second discharge step these differences may be explained by the availability of the fine sediments and the erosion processes in the three dam reservoirs of the arc river in 2007 the ssc peak value corresponds to sediments that are easily removed from the reservoirs while the second part of the ssc signal is related to sediments removed due to higher bed shear stresses higher discharge values super critical flows in the dam reservoirs in 2009 the sediments of the dam reservoirs were more difficult to remove and the ssc signal increased only from the increasing part of the second discharge step as a consequence the sediment input is highly function of the hydrology during the months preceding the flushing event and so the accumulation of fresh fine sediments in dam reservoirs during the spring period on site i1 the ssc signals are smoothed because of the long distance travelled along the river and the dispersion processes the differences between the ssc peak values are attenuated one should note that the ssc peak is measured systematically after the discharge peak of the hydrograph since the flood wave travels faster than flow velocity 4 2 hydrology influence on ssc dynamics in order to understand the possible influence of the hydrology on the fine sediment dynamics we define an average discharge for the spring season before the flushing event q m spring i e from the 1st april to the day before the flushing event at both a7 and i1 location as well as a base discharge q m base during the flushing event on the isère river at i1 location averaged discharge on the day before the flushing event indeed the q max values are almost the same whatever the event on the arc river they increase only with the input from tributaries i e at the isère restitution x 8 km the isère confluence x 0 km and at the cheylas restitution x 20 km results are presented in table 4 together with the concentration peak values measured at a7 location for both discharge step in general the second peak of concentration during the 2nd plateau is higher than the first one since bed shear stresses are higher in the dam reservoirs however in 2007 a lower value is observed indicating a smaller stock of fine sediments in the reservoirs it could be explained by the flood event in september 2006 q max 150 m 3 s only two other significant floods for which dam gates were opened were observed during the period between 2005 and 2012 the may 2008 flood q max 450 m 3 s and the june 2010 flood q max 160 m 3 s similarly the following flushing event in 2009 and 2011 yielded a low total flux φ just after dam reservoirs i e φ 20 000 tons the initial total flux from dam reservoir is thus function of the duration without dam operation on the other hand the hydrology during the spring period does not appear to influence significantly the amount of fine sediment to be eroded no correlation could be found between the average flow q m spring on the two month prior to the flushing event and the initial total flux also we note that erosion generally occurred in the isère river when the base discharge q m base in the isère river is the highest 2006 2010 and 2012 this could be explained as the gravel bar were then flooded and fine sediment stocks over gravel bars could be resuspended however for the 2012 event which reached the largest discharges close to 500 m3 s highest vegetated part of gravels bars have been flooded and have enhanced deposition we expect to relate erosion on the downstream part of the arc river observed in 2007 2011 and 2012 with the additional flow discharge coming from the restitution q m rest however no clear correlation could be made 4 3 initial quantity of erodible sediments in the river bed continuous ssf measurements at site i1 which integrate the whole study area are available over the whole period of the study with a sampling step of 30 min more specifically the cumulative ssf measured at site i1 during the 2 3 months preceding each flushing from 1st april event showed large variations as a function of the event table 4 from 125 000 tons in 2011 to 1 000 000 tons in 2010 the large amounts of sediment mass in 2006 and 2010 were mostly due to a very active spring period but also due to some engineering works on the isère dikes in 2010 also a large compensation reservoir directly connected to the arc river just upstream a7 x 40 km was cleaned out over a three month period in 2010 and 2011 in 2006 and 2010 the 2 month integrated ssf at i1 reached very large values that have potentially led to large deposition over gravel bars significant re suspension have been observed on the isère river during the flushing events performed these two years and on the arc river during the 2006 event which appears consistent with the hydrology during the spring period the cleaning of the compensation reservoir in 2011 could also explain the large re suspension observed in the arc river during the following flushing event just upstream the confluence with the isère river in any case the sediment mass transported during a flushing event does not represent more than 5 of the annual suspended sediment mass transiting at site i1 these results corroborate previous estimations of the contribution of hydraulic flushes to annual ssf of the isère river némery et al 2013 our results confirm the importance of the suspended sediment dynamics before the event during the spring period indeed the spatial distribution of sediment deposits strongly affects the possible resuspension of sediment during the flushing event some studies droppo et al 2001 have shown the effect of sequential bed depositions under several flow conditions in the bed erosion process especially if the proportion of cohesive sediments in the total suspended load is non negligible 4 4 dynamic mass balance table 3 gives spatial information on the local mass balances per river reach for example the river bed between the two consecutive measurement sites a4 and a3 was systematically eroded as was the river bed between a3 and a1 furthermore the lengths of these two reaches are almost equal 12 km however the values of the dynamic and time normalized mass balance δ φ i i 1 t eq 5 on these parts of the river bed show very different mass transport dynamics during the flushing events in fig 7 c and d the values of δ φ a 3 a 1 t and δ φ a 4 a 3 t respectively are plotted as a function of the time made dimensionless with the duration of the event t event although the two reaches of the river were globally eroded at the end of the flushing event the a3 a1 reach endured first some large erosion and then some deposition this succession of erosion and deposition could be explained by an easily erodible mass of sediment on the river bed that was removed by the first discharge step of the flush hydrograph during the second discharge step the water level became high enough to flow on gravel bars implying significant deposition on the other hand the a4 a3 reach endured successively considerable deposition and then even larger erosion during the same event fig 7d on this reach two large easily submersible banks and a small dam reservoir were the only remarkable sites they could indeed explain the following mass balance dynamics from 2009 to 2011 events before the first discharge step the reservoir was emptied removing a small proportion of the fine deposited sediments this first release generated nevertheless a ssc peak at a relative low discharge value and did not influence the global mass balance value the first discharge step led to considerable deposition on the easily submersible banks which were eventually easily re suspended by the second discharge step furthermore the second discharge step involved sufficiently high water levels to remove the upper layer of sediment deposited in the small reservoir the global mass balances calculated for all the events were in this case not representative of the temporal dynamics of this reach where the exchange processes with the river bed were significant this cumulative method is also applied to confirm the effect of the flood in may 2008 as it appears in table 3 i e different river bed responses before and after the flood on the two previous examples from fig 7 c and d we can see that deposition and erosion dynamics suddenly changed between 2007 and 2009 even if the mass balance at the end of the events remain positive the dynamics changed from significant exchanges with the river bed to simple transfer of sediment mass and vice versa after 2009 the dynamics tend back to the one observed before the 2008 flood the dynamic cumulative mass balance for the more upstream reaches a8 a7 and a5 a4 are presented in fig 7 a and b respectively if the overall impact of the dam flushes on these reaches was generally deposition they presented a first step of erosion followed by a large deposition on the second part of the event these two additional examples also confirm the 2008 flood impact on ssf dynamics in these two other reaches linked to the large modifications of the river morphology jaballah et al 2015 indeed the opposite behaviour was observed in 2007 compared to the events after 2008 the global mass balances changing global erosion into global deposition b or inverse a the four examples presented in fig 7 show that the river reaches have not the same ability to recover the prior flood equilibrium reaches like the ones between a5 and a4 or a3 and a1 show in 2011 very similar dynamics than the one observed in 2007 for the two other reaches the prior dynamics were still not recovered in 2011 it also shows the dominating influence of river morphology on ssf dynamics 4 5 physical characteristics of the transported sediments sediments parameters like grain size and or settling velocity but also suspended concentration are fundamental for predicting deposition processes legout et al 2018 their variability could also explain observed differences between flushing events or river reaches garcia 2008 in 2011 grain size distribution gsd have been measured for every sediment samples at a5 a1 and i1 sites grain size characteristics averaged over the flushing period are presented in table 5 these grain size measurements show that few differences are observed between the three measurement sites for this event even if a small fining is observed only the percentile d 90 changed significantly between a1 and i1 in 2011 one observed a significant local erosion between a5 and a1 and a significant local deposition between a1 and i3 this year the local deposition between a1 and i3 could be related to the decrease of d 90 values with a position of the coarsest particles downstream the confluence with the isère river during the flushing event of june 2011 the additional discharge coming from the upper isère river was low and the flow velocity could have decrease significantly downstream the confluence where the river width is larger despite the significant local erosion observed between a5 and a1 no change were measured in terms of grain size distributions fig 7 b c and d shows the local dynamics of erosion and deposition between a5 and a1 in 2011 the flux was globally transferred between a5 and a4 with a first period of deposition followed by a period of erosion in this case one can conclude that the freshly deposed sediments during the first part of the event have been re suspended during the second part of the event explaining the constant gsd however between a3 and a1 the opposite behaviour is observed previous sediments deposits on the river bed were replaced by the suspended sediments coming from upstream however a similar gsd is observed indicating a certain consistency of the long term dynamics of the fine deposits in these reaches 5 conclusion six field campaigns were analysed to evaluate the impact of dam flushing events on suspended sediment dynamics downstream of the dams ssc and discharge measurements were performed on the arc and isère rivers france at 14 sites in june 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 these intensive measurement campaigns allowed an estimation of suspended sediment fluxes along the reaches of both rivers as well as the local mass balance to estimate the significance of the observed local variations a propagation model for the uncertainty on the global flux was built taking into account the main sources of error for both ssc and discharges the mean calculated uncertainty value was σ φ 11 5 these uncertainty values confirm the global tendency of suspended sediment flux propagation whereas only 14 out of 52 local mass balances between two consecutive measurement sites were significant also a dynamic time normalized method was developed to evaluate and discuss temporal variations of the mass balance during one flushing event even if the dam flushing operating protocol was identical over the years except for 2012 the suspended sediment mass removed from the reservoirs varied from 10 000 tons in 2007 to 40 000 tons in 2006 the hydrology on the upper arc river during the previous spring period significantly affected the efficiency of these flushing events on the other hand the global fine sediment mass balance along the studied river segment varied from zero in 2011 and 2009 to 30 000 tons in 2007 indicating also a strong effect of the initial state stock of fine sediments in the river but also river geometry we showed that the bed morphology significantly modified the fine sediments dynamics indeed the may 2008 flood a 15 year return period flood on the arc river that largely modified both arc and isère river morphologies yielded major changes in fine sediment dynamics during flushing events indeed opposite behaviour were observed for many reaches in terms of global mass balance after the flushing event but also in terms of temporal dynamics during the event erosion followed by deposition or the opposite another point to be addressed is the quantity and quality of the fine sediment stocks in the river bed i e surface deposits and stocks infiltrated in the bed matrix indeed our knowledge of the stocks remains very limited it would be important to evaluate the quantity of available sediments as deposits but also stocked in the river bed that could be re suspended as soon as coarse particles are mobilized navratil et al 2010 misset et al 2019 more continuous monitoring of ssf but also direct measurements on the river bed and in dam reservoirs are necessary to estimate the initial state of the river bed and the availability of the fine sediments in reservoirs to better predict the effect of dam flushing investigations must now focus on combining the analysis of local morphodynamics and global hydrological aspects more in detail it could be eventually made in the future thanks to repeated lidar surveys assuming that topographic changes are only due to fine sediment dynamics and only occur on gravel bars an important issue is the sand fraction it corresponds indeed to approximately 50 of the deposit volume camenen et al 2016 whereas sand flux are not captured by the turbidimeters nor by the surface sampling network also the use of a numerical model to calculate downstream sediment propagation would help dam operators to optimize dam flushing scenarios credit authorship contribution statement g antoine validation formal analysis

5531,evaluation of water resources systems and implementation of appropriate management strategies requires accurate and well classified information describing supply demand and consumption the wa water accounting framework is a relevant tool in this regard earlier applications of the wa framework draw heavily from remote sensing rs data however applying rs data limits the application of the framework to past and current situations such analyses are needed for future assessments due to new management and climate scenarios therefore the objective of this research is to link wa with the soil water assessment tool swat model to enhance it and to evaluate water management strategies through an integrated framework the resulting system swat fars customized version of swat model for fars region is capable of supporting macro and micro water planning through a systematic presentation of the past trends current and future status in water supply and demand to explore this methodology the system was applied to the tashk bakhtegan basin iran the trends in supply and consumption within the basin and some of the water saving policies that are mandated by the country s 6th development plan were evaluated application of swat fars to the task bakhtegan basin showeddecreasein manageable water of about 23 and a simultaneous increase of incremental irrigation of about 53 this lack of accessible water and imbalance of manageable water and water usage has almost omitted the basin s outflows to alleviate pressures on the basin s water resources a suggested elimination of rice cultivation and improving pressurized irrigation showed the first policy could reduce water consumption by 0 08 bcm yr and the second one can even increase water consumption by 0 25 bcm yr over current conditions the methodology used to develop swat fars is strongly recommended for other regions suffering water scarcity keywords water resources systems swat model water accounting plus wa water saving evapotranspiration management 1 introduction analyzing water resources systems and developing appropriate management strategies requires access to accurate information describing supply demand and consumption with this data a comprehensive picture can be built to help evaluate best management strategies identify opportunities for reducing water requirements increasing water productivity and so on to achieve the aforementioned mission the international water management institute iwmi developed the water accounting concept molden 1997 water accounting provides a means with which to summarize water use across varying spatial scales distinguish between withdrawal and consumption and to describe water soil productivity more precisely fao 2012 also describes water accounting as the systematic acquisition analysis and communication of information relating to stocks flows and fluxes of water from sources to sinks in natural disturbed or heavily engineered environments so far different frameworks have been introduced in this regard like iwmi wa molden 1997 seeaw 1 1 system of environmental economic accounts for water perry 2012 and gpwa 2 2 general purpose water accounting chalmers et al 2012 the iwmi wa framework molden 1997 was later improved through joint work by iwmi fao and ihe karimi et al 2013a and called water accounting plus wa wa shares the same fundamentals of iwmi wa especially on differentiating consumption and withdrawal while considering a stronger link with land use and provides more details in its main processes and mechanisms to summarize the water resources situation of a desired basin wa presents four sheets including i a resource base sheet ii an evapotranspiration sheet iii a productivity sheet and iv a withdrawal sheet the required data for each sheet can be obtained through remote sensing rs based data a feature that makes it very relevant and practical for data scarce areas and for large scale applications as it was applied for the indus basin 1 160 000 km2 and the helmand basin 262 342 km2 karimi et al 2013b however applying rs data limits the application of the wa framework only to past and current situations and may not be relevant for small subbasins due to existing uncertainties that would be amplified as the spatial scale of application grows finer these limitations could pose a legitimate obstacle for the application of wa beyond regional studies karimi and bastiaanssen 2014 a possible solution to the aforementioned problem is to build on the fact that input data for wa can also be obtained from hydrological simulation and water allocation models karimi et al 2013a in this manner it would be possible to capitalize on various hydrological simulation models such as hspf vic mike basin weap and the soil water assessment tool swat as evident from different literature e g tibebe and bewket 2011 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2015 krysanova and srinivasan 2015 jha et al 2015 swat arnold et al 1998 is widely used to simulate hydrological condition in a changing environment as well as to simulate and assess best management practices this function of swat is an important added value when the model is used as an integral part of wa and makes it possible to look into water accounts under different climate and management scenarios the climate scenarios can be future climate change projections rezaei zaman et al 2016 harrison et al 2019 or even past scenarios showing possible trends in rainfall and temperature rodgers et al 2019 these options are possible because of swat s capabilities of rainfall runoff simulation and calculation of water balance components at the farm through hydrological response units hrus and basin scales for more description swat is semi distributed dividing each subbasin into smaller hrus neitsch et al 2002 based on soil type crop patterns and management practices to do this the model includes many modules including crop growth groundwater and river routing to accommodate the required simulations another advantage of including these scales relates to possibility of the rebound effect evaluation in reality measures at farm scale do not necessarily lead to reduce water consumption at basin scale it can be due to decrease in return flows and deficit irrigation or even increase of evapotranspiration because of better water application gonzalez 2019 raeisi et al 2019 also evaluated the rebound effect of improving drip irrigation using swat model furthermore using many different types of observed ground data e g long term hydro climate records land use soil data etc by the model makes it to be associated with less uncertainties comparing with rs based water accounting framework of course uncertainty analyses of the framework can be done using the relevant tools e g swat cup abbaspour 2015 in order to link swat and wa there are some compatibility issues that had to be addressed first the main one is matching the official geographical units of the water resources departments with how swat delineates basins for instance the hierarchy of hydrologic units of the usa include 4 levels regions subregions accounting units and cataloging units seaber et al 1987 in case of the study area for this research iran hydrologic units also fall into 4 levels including rank 1 to rank 3 basins and a lower unit study regions sr so the sr or cataloging unit is the minimum geographical unit with total area varying from 2420 to 572290 ha that is needed to evaluate water resources to meet the data requirements for wa at the sr resolution swat faces a few limitations especially from the groundwater simulation point of view giving more clarifications it is possible that the natural hydrologic boundaries of a stream and of the groundwater flow parts of a system do not coincide johnson et al 2010 in such a situation the original form of groundwater simulation in swat would not be applicable since swat simulates spatial variations of groundwater volume and depth for each subbasin s hrus without considering their interactions with adjacent subbasins kim et al 2008 moreover agricultural water saving practices e g improving irrigation efficiency are the most popular practices to reduce pressure on water resources however there are some reports about weakness of simulation of this option in swat dechmi et al 2012 mainly due to its limitations in simulation of water losses during irrigation events so the application of the swat model for analyzing such management practices requires some modifications in addition there are limitations in the original version of the swat model in regard to simulating specific conditions of basins e g groundwater interaction and reporting some of the required wa variables e g transpiration the aim of this paper is to enhance capabilities of the wa framework through linkage to the swat conceptual model the most important considered features to design this framework includes 1 assessment of climate and non climate scenarios i e management strategies through a water accounting framework 2 to be suitable for any geographic scale e g entire basin subbasins and cataloging units per the specific need of our case study 3 including both micro and macro planning to achieve these objectives it would be investigated how limitations of the swat can be rectified and how the required data for the wa sheets can be retrieve from different modules of the model to explore the methodology and suggested system task bakhtegan basin is selected as the case study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data the tashk bakhtegan basin is located at longitude 51 42 to 54 33 e and latitude 29 2 to 31 15 n fig 1 with a total area of approximately 27 520 km2 the basin includes 4 subbasins and 22 srs outlined by the fars regional water authority the tashk and bakhtegan lakes are the destination of all rivers in the basin and serve as important natural habitats especially for migrating birds the climate of the region is a semiarid karst basin with annual average rainfall of 320 mm and annual average pan evaporation varying from 1763 1 to 2849 4 mm moe 2017 the basin is composed of large agricultural areas with intensive irrigation more than 60 of the irrigated area is dependent on groundwater resources this basin has historically provided resources for significant social economic and ecologic activities for centuries the remains of persepolis are located here the ceremonial capital of the achaemenid empire one of world s most ancient civilizations and registered in unesco as part of a national list of iranian monuments however this region has suffered from water shortage for over 50 years to alleviate this water scarcity several reservoirs have been built in recent decades the provided data and respective sources for the case study are shown in table 1 and includes spatial remote sensing e g dem soil and land use hydro climate agriculture management and the hydro structure data 2 2 water accounting plus wa framework and input data as it was stated before the wa framework provides four main standard reporting sheets including resources evapotranspiration withdrawal and productivity table 2 this study only focuses on the first three sheets resources evapotranspiration and withdrawal the resources sheet contains information on water volumes including inflows and outflows and how the water is consumed and its processes the evapotranspiration sheet provides information on the evapotranspiration conditions in the basin and indicates which parts of evapotranspiration processes are manageable i e evapotranspiration from modified land use rainfed and residential irrigated crops reservoirs and or unmanageable i e evapotranspiration from protected land use including shrub land forests glaciers wetlands natural grasslands also it contains information on the consumed fraction of water it means that how the part of the water applied is evaporated and transpired or consumed the consumed water is distinguished into both beneficial and non beneficial components beneficial water consumption is the amount of consumed water for transpiration of natural plants and agricultural crops but non beneficial water consumption indicates the water consumed that is lost from the system through interception soil evaporation groundwater evaporation and evaporation from water surfaces like rivers and reservoirs and conveyance systems as well as weed transpiration willardson et al 1994 the withdrawal sheet provides information on how the water flows in managed water lands including the water withdrawal i e the amount of water applied from surface water and groundwater resources for irrigation the amount of consumed water water losses and return flows karimi et al 2013a return flows are the non consumed water i e the difference between applied and consumed water for example surface runoff and deep percolation lankford 2012 the non consumed water includes both recoverable and non recoverable components all return flows are not recoverable due to degradation through nutrient leaching and salinity for example flows enters the ocean or brackish water bodies including percolation into saline aquifers drains without downstream diversion non recoverable sinks physically or economically recoverable return flows are water flows that are reused for example return flows to a water source drains and rivers and percolation from irrigated lands into freshwater aquifers water losses are also related to non recoverable return flows of the non consumed water fraction as well as non beneficial evaporation including evaporation from surface irrigation networks or conveyance systems perry 2007 the consumed beneficial and non beneficial and non consumed recoverable and non recoverable water terms have been adopted by willardson et al 1994 allen et al 1997 lankford 2006 perry 2007 perry et al 2009 and jägermeyr et al 2015 as well as the water accounting developed by molden 1997 appendix a summarizes the definitions of wa terms for more details refer to these studies and appendix a wa also provides the possibility to present its results based on sets of indicators and indices these sets help users better understand the current state of water resources issues future challenges and analyze various management strategies 2 3 swat model and data swat is a conceptual and semi distributed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 it is capable of simulating and predicting the effects and side effects of various management conditions e g watershed management planting and harvesting management irrigation pesticide and fertilizer management and crop pattern and rotation on quantity and quality of water the model discriminates a basin into subbasins and each subbasin is later separated into hydrological response units hrus these units have the same soil type land use and slope arnold et al 1998 in the model the hydrological cycle is simulated based on the water balance equation for each hru 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where swt is the amount of soil water content at t sw0 is the initial amount of soil water content and rday qsurf ea wseep and qgw are the amount of precipitation surface runoff actual evapotranspiration percolation and return flow originating from groundwater all in mm at the time i day respectively hydrological simulation of river basin in swat is performed in two stages phase 1 or land phase includes simulation of the values of the main inputs such as water and sediment from each subbasin into drainage channels phase 2 or water routing phase looks to the movement of phase 1 s components in drainage networks to the outlet of the basin more specifically consumption and withdrawal as the key components of wa are simulated in the model in a land phase simulation module the only water consumption from agricultural regions with no flow to sinks includes et i e canopy interception crop transpiration and soil evaporation agricultural water withdrawal is also estimated by both auto irrigation and manual irrigation subroutines manual management scheduling inputs in swat allows the users to define the actual field scale schedule agricultural practices by specific date or heat unit accumulations neitsch et al 2009 2 4 modifications for linkage of swat and wa in order to link the swat and wa frameworks and extract the required information it is very important to deeply understand the integration of hydrological and agricultural processes in basin simulation and how swat handles this task table 3 shows the wa sheets and required information as well as the related variables in the swat outputs the table also reveals how variables that are not originally provided can be filled in through modifications of the swat model these modifications as show in table 3 adjust the model to a simulate daily groundwater level b simulate interactions and exchanges of groundwater volume among different subbasins c simulate the water losses during irrigation events d simulate effects of dynamic changes of land use and e extract and analyse outputs of the model for estimation of wa variables the modified version with the water accounting capability is called swat fars more details about the modifications are as follows simulating groundwater level in the original swat groundwater module the simulation is done in two series of reservoirs located below the soil layers the given approach can be useful in groundwater simulation if the groundwater level changes are not significant otherwise the swat model only provides an estimation of the net water volume stored in the aquifer and doesn t report the aquifer water level changes for use in model calibration vazquez amábile and engel 2005 therefore the model code was changed to simulate daily groundwater level for each study region using eq 2 2 h wtbl i h wtbl i 1 exp α gw δ t w rchrg 1 exp α gw δ t 800 μ α gw where hwtbl is the groundwater level mm αgw is the time delay days and wrchrg is the total amount of aquifer recharge mm µ is the aquifer storage factor and δ t is the analysis time interval the modifications for reporting the groundwater level were done in hruyr f hrymon f and gwmod f sub modules simulating the interactions of aquifers the original swat model simulates the spatial variations of groundwater volume and depth in each subbasin s hrus without considering the subbasin s interactions however it is essential to consider interactions and exchanges between aquifers in different subbasins where the aquifer boundaries do not match the boundary of subbasins kim et al 2008 this feature is provided in the swat fars model by redefining the aquifer hrus by overlaying the subbasin hrus layer and aquifer boundaries fig 2 to consider aquifer boundary and its ground water storage interaction redefinition of hrus for simulation of aquifer interactions was done in irrsub f irrigate f gwmod f swat sub modules modifying the swat irrigation management modules application of swat to intensive irrigation agricultural basins where irrigation processes are the major component of the hydrologic balance could not be used for water accounting due to its limitations in simulation of water losses when the irrigation source is a river or outside the watershed during irrigation events in this case swat applies irrigation depth that fills the soil layers up to field capacity if the irrigation depth exceeds field capacity the excess water between soil saturation and field capacity limits returns to the irrigation source and isn t considered in the daily soil water balance calculation it is the same in the case of irrigation losses as well irrigation losses are defined as water that leaves the system without a benefit for agricultural crop growth that includes the conveyance and application losses the conveyance losses relate to water transport losses from the source to the field the application losses also relate to the portion of irrigation water that lost through the water application on field including soil evaporation and other non beneficial components e g weed transpiration and evaporation from conveyance systems the conveyance and application losses affect irrigation efficiency which is defined as the ratio between water consumption plant evapotranspiration and water withdrawal from water resources including rivers reservoirs lakes or groundwater jägermeyr et al 2015 for the application of swat in intensive irrigation application of water to maintain standing water on the field agricultural basins the irrigation subroutine source code needs to be modified to consider the irrigation losses in this study to include the excess water in the soil water balance calculations the swat irrigation modules were modified based on a modification proposed by dechmi et al 2012 according to previous research works about 35 to 50 of water withdrawal volume from water resources for irrigation returns to groundwater resources nasri et al 2015 dor et al 2011 arumí et al 2009 and the real water losses have been reported in general at about 5 to 20 karimi et al 2013b foster et al 2009 keller and keller 1995 due to the water conveyance systems in surface irrigation water conveyance and application losses are higher than water losses in groundwater irrigation and the surface irrigation efficiency is less than the groundwater irrigation efficiency to consider accurate water losses information and values reported by other researchers e g kienzle and schmidt 2008 foster et al 2009 were considered in this study the application water losses of irrigation events from surface water and groundwater resources are considered to be 20 and 10 of conveyance losses respectively which is added to the actual evapotranspiration of the corresponding hrus in this section modifications were done in sub modules including irrsub f irr res f subbasin f and gwmod f applying the dynamic changes of land use one of the important points in the simulation of agricultural basins relates to update the land use status of basins during the simulations swat fars model automatically integrates multiple land use maps and prepares the input files necessary for activating the land use update luu module in swat fars for this hru fractions are updated at the given times based on the changing of area and location of land use generation of wa sheets based on the swat model outputs various outputs of the model are required to be extracted and get processed to produce the required information of wa framework so swat fars interface was developed in c programming language for this task the interface is capable to run modified swat model and extract and calculate the wa variables by processing the output files of the swat model in each land use type and study region for annual and monthly time scales fig 3 shows the swat fars package main window real water saving concept one the main applications of this system is to explain impacts of different measures on water saving swat fars emphasizes the concept of real water saving seckler 1996 it means when a policy is effective it reduces incremental evapotranspiration and such water savings may be allocated to other uses or increase system outflows 3 results and discussion this section explores swat fars setup and its capabilities for analyzing water resources status and management scenarios based on the wa water accounting framework through the tashk bakhtegan basin 3 1 paramertization of swat fars model for this part tashk bakhtegan basin was divided into 56 subbasins and 2245 hrus hrus were extracted using the digital elevation model dem soil land use layers that have homogeneous slope land use and soil characteristics the dem layer was obtained from aster with 30 m resolution and the soil map from the fao 2011 also three land use maps for 1987 2007 and 2015 wri 2015 and locations of rivers hydrometric stations dams and study regions i e cus were prepared as well furthermore the management information relating to irrigation sources and irrigation planning the operation of three existing dams crops planting harvesting dates application of fertilization and pesticide are prepared from the local organizations the next step is the sensitivity analysis of model parameters that was used to determine which parameters have the largest impact on each outputs of the model sensitivity analysis calibration and uncertainty analysis of the swat fars model are performed with swat cup model abbaspour 2015 using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 for example table 4 indicates the parameters as well as p value and t stat initial and final range of them in the stream flow calibration process each parameter which has more t stat value and if its p value is close to zero has had the largest impact on streamflows therefore the results showed that cn2 parameter curve number parameter was the most sensitive parameter and after that gw qmn these parameters were effective ones on surface runoff and groundwater participation in streamflow 3 2 calibration and validation of the swat fars model swat fars needed further calibration and validation what we called it as multi variable multi site calibration since the conventional reliance on hydrometric data is insufficient and it is crucial to include other processes and especially actual evapotranspiration in the course of calibration for this aim the model calibration and validation were carried out using maximum available observation data such as 1 river discharges 2 groundwater level 3 base flow 4 potential and actual evapotranspiration and 5 crop yields to do this after the initial setup of the model calibration and validation were carried out in a multi stage process in the first step hydrological calibration was performed using stream flow base flow and groundwater level to ensure the model simulates surface water groundwater and their interacting in the next step potential and actual evapotranspiration and crop yields were calibrated for more clarification the calibration and validation process of swat fars is shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows performance of the calibrated model for simulation of stream flows a base flows b and groundwater level c using the statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns the calibration during 1985 2006 and validation during 2006 2014 of surface runoff and its base flow were performed using the more important parameters as shown in table 4 fig 5 a shows the values of the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns are more than 0 5 which indicate an acceptable model performance for stream flow simulation in the calibration and validation periods in order to evaluate the results of base flow simulation two correlation features for observed and simulated base flow and base flow index were considered in this study two sub programs called bfi in hydro office software gregor 2012 and recursive digital filter method were applied to separate base flow from the daily streamflows the separation was done for the stations that were not affected by the upstream controlled flows for 1985 to 2014 i e dehkade sefid jamalbeig shirin tange balaghi and droudzan stations as shown in fig 5 b the results of monthly base flow evaluation at these stations indicate an acceptable performance of the model r2 between 0 88 and 0 95 and nash coefficient between 0 56 and 0 73 finally fig 5 c shows the model performance for simulating the groundwater level changes in each aquifer the values of r2 and ns indices for the calibration and validation of groundwater level changes are more than 50 in 83 and 87 of these aquifers respectively also the maximum deviation between simulated and observed values is about 26 the results indicate the acceptable performance of the model in simulating aquifers volume changes in most study regions due to the importance of proper simulations of actual evapotranspiration eta and crop yields as an indicator for eta to evaluate the basin water consumption through different management scenarios efforts were made to calibrate this crucial variable however since there is no direct measurements for eta in the basin a common problem the average simulated eta under full irrigation i e maximum crop water requirement is compared to values reported by the iran national water document 2007 this document includes different crop water requirements of all the basin within iran the calibration of the model for crop yields was also simultaneously carried out with calibration of actual evapotranspiration fig 6 shows the box plot of the observed values of evapotranspiration and crop yields in comparison with the average simulated values the results indicate that there is an acceptable agreement between the model results and the observed values according to maximum and minimum values in the range changes and first and third quartiles as seen in fig 6 except for tomato and bean the average simulated evapotranspiration of the crops are varied from the first to third quartile of the observed values also it is shown that the average simulated crop yields are within the first to third quartile of the observed values 3 3 water accounting plus wa based on the swat fars model based on the calibrated model and further linkage to wa framework the water accounting sheets are presented for the two periods of time including 1985 to 2006 1st and 2007 to 2014 2nd dividing of the entire period in two sections is based on farokhnia 2016 that reported prolong droughts and significant changes on the hydrological characteristics after 2006 using these sheets status of the basin s water resources issues are assessed and presented in the following sections additionally the results for the entire record i e 1985 2014 are also illustrated in the sheets to show more the flexibility of the developed system 3 3 1 wa resources base sheet the first sheet is the resource base sheet table 2 and is shown in fig 7 the sheet shows how the components are varied during the first and second periods as well as the entire time period the major difference related to net inflow originated from decreases in the basin s precipitation the sheet shows about 5 decrease in the precipitation and 10 decrease in net inflows during the two time periods it is also affected by the changes in surface water and groundwater reservoirs snowpack and soil moisture during the investigated periods the natural evapotranspiration as one of the most important outflows has decreased by about 4 3 which is mainly due to precipitation decrease however changes in manageable water is more critical a decrease of 23 is reported in the sheet from the first period to the second period for manageable water along with an increase of incremental evapotranspiration of about 53 this substantially relates to an increase of cropped lands and increase of the basin s temperature farokhnia 2016 these changes have led to a significant shortage of environmental flows such that the inflows of tashk bakhtegan lakes are decreased from 1 47 to 0 01 billion m3 yr 3 3 2 evapotranspiration sheet fig 8 shows the evapotranspiration sheet table 2 for the time periods the amounts of water consumption for different land uses are presented on the left the figure shows 38 increase of eta of managed land use as the most significant component to show the role of human activities on water consumption the right side of the report shows beneficial and non beneficial water consumptions in this part beneficial evapotranspiration is considered as transpiration of crops and natural plants while non beneficial evapotranspiration occurs through evaporation from soil reservoirs etc the sheet also reveals that despite of the significant reduction in manageable water fig 7 12 increase in beneficial evapotranspiration is simultaneously occurred it can be attributed to the increase in cultivated areas and substitution of high water consuming plants in the cropping pattern that has increased transpiration of plants up to 30 also transpiration of natural plants e g pastures and forests are decreased about 13 due to a partial reduction in the area and less available moisture as reduced precipitation in case of the non beneficial evapotranspiration soil evaporation as one of the biggest source of consumption is about 4 5 bcm almost 84 of the total consumptions that is reduced by 6 5 this shows although increasing in agricultural area and irrigation practices increased soil evaporation but the negative effect of precipitation decline on it has been great the evaporation from water bodies dams and lakes is another component of the non beneficial evapotranspiration that indicates 50 increase between the periods of time this increasing is also due to mullah sadra dam impoundment in the second period groundwater evaporation also indicates a slight increase in the second period 3 3 3 withdrawal sheet fig 9 shows the withdrawal reporting sheet table 2 due to increasing production in the irrigated area the total agricultural water withdrawals and agricultural groundwater withdrawals in the second period increased by 17 5 and 24 6 respectively the lack of surface water resources in the second period especially in downstream regions can be one reason for 17 decrease in surface water withdrawals therefore incremental evapotranspiration and losses increased by 34 for the second period conveyance and application losses of irrigation water have been increased from 450 million m3 to 556 million m3 almost 11 increase due to increase in water withdrawals particularly increasing in surface water withdrawals are associated with larger losses due to transmission and issues related to surface irrigation networks the last part of this report deals with the amount of withdrawn water returned to the surface and groundwater sources which is not sufficiently considered in many studies the returns to the surface and groundwater sources is considered as loss in the analysis of classical irrigation efficiency where it has not been removed from water basin cycle and it can be recoverable and reusable keller and keller 1995 the results show that approximately 38 of the water withdrawals for irrigated agricultural lands in the tashk bakhtegan basin returns to surface water and groundwater resources the total return flows have been increased almost 36 in the second period due to increasing in water withdrawals over time the return flows to groundwater resources is up to 98 of total return flows 3 3 4 wa performance indicators table 5 shows the indicators of each reporting sheet along with their descriptions and the amount of them in the two analyzing periods for calculations of some the indicators in the resource base sheet it was necessary to consider the environmental water right of the tashk bakhtegan lake as committed flow which is 342 million m3 yr in normal conditions fars province department of environment 2011 the indicators of water resources and consumptions report respective definitions and amounts for the two periods are presented in table 5 for instance it is illustrated that the ratio of manageable water was 28 in the first period and decreased to 23 in the second period which is mainly due to decrease in precipitations similarly the ratio of groundwater resources change increased from 7 3 to 16 in the second period that indicates more over exploitation of groundwater the ratio of utilizable water for the first period indicates 88 of water allocable in the basin is used for consumption and simultaneously supplying downstream commitments about 342 million m3 as the water rights of the lakes in normal conditions but in the second period it decreases to 85 of basin available water and almost no inflows to the lakes the ratio of commitments downstream supply equals 4 47 and 0 for the periods respectively another notable ratio is the consumption ratio which is 49 for the first period it indicates only 50 of allocable water was being consumed during the first period however it increased to 99 in the second period in which the exploitation of water resources is more than the manageable water 3 3 5 spatial and temporal evaluation of wa components one of the main expectations from water accounting analysis is the ability to evaluate and identify trends in water supply demand accessibility and use in time and space within specified domains fao 2012 definitely providing such information and respected records are very limited or not available at all this option is embedded in swat fars and the components of wa are possible to be extracted at different scales and time for instance fig 10 shows spatial variation of total consumed water water resources and consumptions sheet within the basin fig 11 also illustrates temporal variation of precipitation total consumed water and outflow water resources and consumptions sheet during 1985 to 2014 the behavior of the basin before 2004 and after it noticeable moreover based on batchelor et al 2016 through water accounting it would be possible to underlying causes of imbalances in supply and demand and levels of environmental sustainability fig 11 shows also status of the basin from these point of views as well although more detailed information can be obtained from the sheets to address these issues 3 3 6 application of swat fars for analyzing the management policies water saving and alleviating pressure on water resources are the common goals in the environmental section of the iran 6th five year development plan for this aim changing cropping pattern and changing irrigation from surface to pressurized systems has attracted the most attentions as possible solutions these policies are evaluated for the study area as follows changing cropping pattern rice is a high consuming water crop and based on the 6th plan it is suggested to eliminate this practice from the tashkh bakhtegan basin s cropping pattern the current rice area in the basin is about 30 000 ha out of 450 000 ha of the irrigated area to assess effects and side effects of such a policy all the rice hru s substituted by wheat in swat fars and the model was run for the period of 1985 to 2014 to shorten the text the results of the wa withdrawal sheet is only presented in fig 12 as it is shown in the figure this management scenario reduces agricultural withdrawal by 0 27 bcm yr 3 56 minus 3 29 bcm yr but the incremental evapotranspiration and transpiration are only reduced by 0 11and 0 08 bcm yr respectively one the unique features of swat fars is the possibility to track rebound effects in real world when a water saving measure is implemented the expected saved water does not necessary would be availed for another users e g environment since it can be unintentionally applied for conventional deficit irrigation or intentionally used for development of cropped lands as well as cultivation of more water consuming crops raeisi et al 2019 what has shown in fig 12 is based on not controlling rebound effect because it needs huge infrastructure to control rebound effect and it is not available in the study area application of pressurized irrigation changing the current surface irrigation to drip system is another common policy to reduce water consumption it is also mandated in the 6th plan which also needs huge investment applying this system for the entire basin shows this measure can reduce agricultural withdrawal by 1 25 mcm 3 56 minus 2 31bcm yr notably this measure not only decreases incremental evapotranspiration and transpiration but also increases them by 0 15 and 0 25 bcm yr respectively due to reduction of deficit irrigation when more water is available fig 12 this issue is warned in perry et al 2017 that as far as water allocation is not controllable increasing irrigation efficiency can have negative effect on water consumption 4 conclusion the aim of this research work was to enhance capabilities of wa water accounting with linkage to swat as a conceptual model for better policy and decisions making in water resources management for the linkage it was necessary to make some changes in the model s code and also define new boundaries for category units or study regions in the package so called swat fars the most important philosophy behind swat fars is to develop a tool with the following concerns a tool to support integrated water resources management iwrm systematic presentation of the current status and past trends in water supply and demand as well as future situation under different policies and management scenarios through water accounting framework evaluation of effect and side effects of water policies in an integrated framework incorporation of climate scenarios e g climate changes aogcm data and historical climate trends in management scenarios evaluation of the above assessments in different geographical domains possibility to estimate water saving using real water saving concept evaluation of policies under conditions of control or not control of rebound effect estimation of water and soil productivity indices based on water withdrawal and consumption as well as beneficial and non beneficial consumption separation of climate and human effects through wa framework explanation of ratio of actual evapotranspiration to maximum crop water requirements i e deficit irrigation reporting the wa sheets at the different spatial scales from hru level to basin level application of swat fars for task bakhtegan basin showed despite of a significantdecreasein manageable water almost 23 due to the negative trends in precipitations not only incremental irrigation in the basin is not reduced but also it has been considerably increased almost 53 this has led to almost 99 decrease in outflows that eventually creates inflows to the tashk and bakhtegan lakes also 77 decrease in the volume of groundwater resources in the basin due to over exploitation is another consequent two alleviate pressures on the basin s water resources two main policies are considered based on the 6th developing plan they are elimination of rice cultivation with its own social oppositions and improving pressurized irrigation with huge investment requirements the results showed changing cropping pattern can reduce water consumption by 0 08 bcm yr but changing irrigation system can even increase water consumption by 0 25 bcm yr finally the methodology that applied to develop swat fars package i e linkage of a conceptual model having high simulation abilities with a relevant water accounting framework acts a useful integrated tool to support more realistic policy and decision making better understand of the current state of water resources and predict future challenges and opportunities that is strongly

that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a definitions of wa terms water withdrawal is the amount of water applied from surface water and groundwater resources water applied is the amount of consumed water return flows and losses consumed water fraction the part of the water applied that is evaporated and transpired it also indicates which parts of consumed water are beneficial and non beneficial within the basin beneficial water consumption is the amount of consumed water for transpiration of natural plants and agricultural crops non beneficial water consumption indicates the water consumed that is lost from the system through interception soil evaporation groundwater evaporation and evaporation from water surfaces like rivers and reservoirs as well as weed transpiration and evaporative conveyance systems return flows the difference between applied and consumed water that describes the amount of it that is recoverable and non recoverable recoverable flow return flows that are reused for example return flows to a water source drains and rivers and percolation from irrigated lands into freshwater aquifers non recoverable flow it is lost to further use due to degradation through nutrient leaching and salinity for example flows enters the ocean or brackish water bodies including percolation into saline aquifers drains without downstream diversion non recoverable sinks physically or economically irrigation water losses non recoverable return flows of the non consumed water fraction as well as non beneficial evaporation irrigation water losses are defined as water that leaves the system without a benefit for agricultural crop growth that includes the nominal and real losses the nominal losses relate to water transport losses from the source to the field conveyance losses the real losses relate to the portion of water irrigation that lost through the water application on field including soil evaporation and other non beneficial components e g weed transpiration and evaporative conveyance systems gross inflow indicates the amount of water flows into the basin including precipitation water inflows from surface or ground water resources net inflow is the amount of gross inflow after changes in volume of fresh water storage and indicates the degree of water available for evapotranspiration exploitable water indicates water being present in different sources including groundwater rivers lakes and reservoirs available water indicates the amount of water that is available for use at the basin in fact it is obtained from the exploitable water minus reserved and non utilizable outflows protected land use is the natural ecosystem and environmentally sensitive land use including shrub land forests glaciers wetlands natural grasslands as well as protection from sea utilized land use indicates a low to moderate resource utilization such as savannah woodland and mixed pastures modified land use is the principal vegetation that is replaced for increased utilization of land resources incremental evapotranspiration the water consumption that is just related to water withdrawals outflows the amount of water that leaves the basin through surface and subsurface systems including surface and subsurface outflows 
5531,evaluation of water resources systems and implementation of appropriate management strategies requires accurate and well classified information describing supply demand and consumption the wa water accounting framework is a relevant tool in this regard earlier applications of the wa framework draw heavily from remote sensing rs data however applying rs data limits the application of the framework to past and current situations such analyses are needed for future assessments due to new management and climate scenarios therefore the objective of this research is to link wa with the soil water assessment tool swat model to enhance it and to evaluate water management strategies through an integrated framework the resulting system swat fars customized version of swat model for fars region is capable of supporting macro and micro water planning through a systematic presentation of the past trends current and future status in water supply and demand to explore this methodology the system was applied to the tashk bakhtegan basin iran the trends in supply and consumption within the basin and some of the water saving policies that are mandated by the country s 6th development plan were evaluated application of swat fars to the task bakhtegan basin showeddecreasein manageable water of about 23 and a simultaneous increase of incremental irrigation of about 53 this lack of accessible water and imbalance of manageable water and water usage has almost omitted the basin s outflows to alleviate pressures on the basin s water resources a suggested elimination of rice cultivation and improving pressurized irrigation showed the first policy could reduce water consumption by 0 08 bcm yr and the second one can even increase water consumption by 0 25 bcm yr over current conditions the methodology used to develop swat fars is strongly recommended for other regions suffering water scarcity keywords water resources systems swat model water accounting plus wa water saving evapotranspiration management 1 introduction analyzing water resources systems and developing appropriate management strategies requires access to accurate information describing supply demand and consumption with this data a comprehensive picture can be built to help evaluate best management strategies identify opportunities for reducing water requirements increasing water productivity and so on to achieve the aforementioned mission the international water management institute iwmi developed the water accounting concept molden 1997 water accounting provides a means with which to summarize water use across varying spatial scales distinguish between withdrawal and consumption and to describe water soil productivity more precisely fao 2012 also describes water accounting as the systematic acquisition analysis and communication of information relating to stocks flows and fluxes of water from sources to sinks in natural disturbed or heavily engineered environments so far different frameworks have been introduced in this regard like iwmi wa molden 1997 seeaw 1 1 system of environmental economic accounts for water perry 2012 and gpwa 2 2 general purpose water accounting chalmers et al 2012 the iwmi wa framework molden 1997 was later improved through joint work by iwmi fao and ihe karimi et al 2013a and called water accounting plus wa wa shares the same fundamentals of iwmi wa especially on differentiating consumption and withdrawal while considering a stronger link with land use and provides more details in its main processes and mechanisms to summarize the water resources situation of a desired basin wa presents four sheets including i a resource base sheet ii an evapotranspiration sheet iii a productivity sheet and iv a withdrawal sheet the required data for each sheet can be obtained through remote sensing rs based data a feature that makes it very relevant and practical for data scarce areas and for large scale applications as it was applied for the indus basin 1 160 000 km2 and the helmand basin 262 342 km2 karimi et al 2013b however applying rs data limits the application of the wa framework only to past and current situations and may not be relevant for small subbasins due to existing uncertainties that would be amplified as the spatial scale of application grows finer these limitations could pose a legitimate obstacle for the application of wa beyond regional studies karimi and bastiaanssen 2014 a possible solution to the aforementioned problem is to build on the fact that input data for wa can also be obtained from hydrological simulation and water allocation models karimi et al 2013a in this manner it would be possible to capitalize on various hydrological simulation models such as hspf vic mike basin weap and the soil water assessment tool swat as evident from different literature e g tibebe and bewket 2011 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2015 krysanova and srinivasan 2015 jha et al 2015 swat arnold et al 1998 is widely used to simulate hydrological condition in a changing environment as well as to simulate and assess best management practices this function of swat is an important added value when the model is used as an integral part of wa and makes it possible to look into water accounts under different climate and management scenarios the climate scenarios can be future climate change projections rezaei zaman et al 2016 harrison et al 2019 or even past scenarios showing possible trends in rainfall and temperature rodgers et al 2019 these options are possible because of swat s capabilities of rainfall runoff simulation and calculation of water balance components at the farm through hydrological response units hrus and basin scales for more description swat is semi distributed dividing each subbasin into smaller hrus neitsch et al 2002 based on soil type crop patterns and management practices to do this the model includes many modules including crop growth groundwater and river routing to accommodate the required simulations another advantage of including these scales relates to possibility of the rebound effect evaluation in reality measures at farm scale do not necessarily lead to reduce water consumption at basin scale it can be due to decrease in return flows and deficit irrigation or even increase of evapotranspiration because of better water application gonzalez 2019 raeisi et al 2019 also evaluated the rebound effect of improving drip irrigation using swat model furthermore using many different types of observed ground data e g long term hydro climate records land use soil data etc by the model makes it to be associated with less uncertainties comparing with rs based water accounting framework of course uncertainty analyses of the framework can be done using the relevant tools e g swat cup abbaspour 2015 in order to link swat and wa there are some compatibility issues that had to be addressed first the main one is matching the official geographical units of the water resources departments with how swat delineates basins for instance the hierarchy of hydrologic units of the usa include 4 levels regions subregions accounting units and cataloging units seaber et al 1987 in case of the study area for this research iran hydrologic units also fall into 4 levels including rank 1 to rank 3 basins and a lower unit study regions sr so the sr or cataloging unit is the minimum geographical unit with total area varying from 2420 to 572290 ha that is needed to evaluate water resources to meet the data requirements for wa at the sr resolution swat faces a few limitations especially from the groundwater simulation point of view giving more clarifications it is possible that the natural hydrologic boundaries of a stream and of the groundwater flow parts of a system do not coincide johnson et al 2010 in such a situation the original form of groundwater simulation in swat would not be applicable since swat simulates spatial variations of groundwater volume and depth for each subbasin s hrus without considering their interactions with adjacent subbasins kim et al 2008 moreover agricultural water saving practices e g improving irrigation efficiency are the most popular practices to reduce pressure on water resources however there are some reports about weakness of simulation of this option in swat dechmi et al 2012 mainly due to its limitations in simulation of water losses during irrigation events so the application of the swat model for analyzing such management practices requires some modifications in addition there are limitations in the original version of the swat model in regard to simulating specific conditions of basins e g groundwater interaction and reporting some of the required wa variables e g transpiration the aim of this paper is to enhance capabilities of the wa framework through linkage to the swat conceptual model the most important considered features to design this framework includes 1 assessment of climate and non climate scenarios i e management strategies through a water accounting framework 2 to be suitable for any geographic scale e g entire basin subbasins and cataloging units per the specific need of our case study 3 including both micro and macro planning to achieve these objectives it would be investigated how limitations of the swat can be rectified and how the required data for the wa sheets can be retrieve from different modules of the model to explore the methodology and suggested system task bakhtegan basin is selected as the case study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data the tashk bakhtegan basin is located at longitude 51 42 to 54 33 e and latitude 29 2 to 31 15 n fig 1 with a total area of approximately 27 520 km2 the basin includes 4 subbasins and 22 srs outlined by the fars regional water authority the tashk and bakhtegan lakes are the destination of all rivers in the basin and serve as important natural habitats especially for migrating birds the climate of the region is a semiarid karst basin with annual average rainfall of 320 mm and annual average pan evaporation varying from 1763 1 to 2849 4 mm moe 2017 the basin is composed of large agricultural areas with intensive irrigation more than 60 of the irrigated area is dependent on groundwater resources this basin has historically provided resources for significant social economic and ecologic activities for centuries the remains of persepolis are located here the ceremonial capital of the achaemenid empire one of world s most ancient civilizations and registered in unesco as part of a national list of iranian monuments however this region has suffered from water shortage for over 50 years to alleviate this water scarcity several reservoirs have been built in recent decades the provided data and respective sources for the case study are shown in table 1 and includes spatial remote sensing e g dem soil and land use hydro climate agriculture management and the hydro structure data 2 2 water accounting plus wa framework and input data as it was stated before the wa framework provides four main standard reporting sheets including resources evapotranspiration withdrawal and productivity table 2 this study only focuses on the first three sheets resources evapotranspiration and withdrawal the resources sheet contains information on water volumes including inflows and outflows and how the water is consumed and its processes the evapotranspiration sheet provides information on the evapotranspiration conditions in the basin and indicates which parts of evapotranspiration processes are manageable i e evapotranspiration from modified land use rainfed and residential irrigated crops reservoirs and or unmanageable i e evapotranspiration from protected land use including shrub land forests glaciers wetlands natural grasslands also it contains information on the consumed fraction of water it means that how the part of the water applied is evaporated and transpired or consumed the consumed water is distinguished into both beneficial and non beneficial components beneficial water consumption is the amount of consumed water for transpiration of natural plants and agricultural crops but non beneficial water consumption indicates the water consumed that is lost from the system through interception soil evaporation groundwater evaporation and evaporation from water surfaces like rivers and reservoirs and conveyance systems as well as weed transpiration willardson et al 1994 the withdrawal sheet provides information on how the water flows in managed water lands including the water withdrawal i e the amount of water applied from surface water and groundwater resources for irrigation the amount of consumed water water losses and return flows karimi et al 2013a return flows are the non consumed water i e the difference between applied and consumed water for example surface runoff and deep percolation lankford 2012 the non consumed water includes both recoverable and non recoverable components all return flows are not recoverable due to degradation through nutrient leaching and salinity for example flows enters the ocean or brackish water bodies including percolation into saline aquifers drains without downstream diversion non recoverable sinks physically or economically recoverable return flows are water flows that are reused for example return flows to a water source drains and rivers and percolation from irrigated lands into freshwater aquifers water losses are also related to non recoverable return flows of the non consumed water fraction as well as non beneficial evaporation including evaporation from surface irrigation networks or conveyance systems perry 2007 the consumed beneficial and non beneficial and non consumed recoverable and non recoverable water terms have been adopted by willardson et al 1994 allen et al 1997 lankford 2006 perry 2007 perry et al 2009 and jägermeyr et al 2015 as well as the water accounting developed by molden 1997 appendix a summarizes the definitions of wa terms for more details refer to these studies and appendix a wa also provides the possibility to present its results based on sets of indicators and indices these sets help users better understand the current state of water resources issues future challenges and analyze various management strategies 2 3 swat model and data swat is a conceptual and semi distributed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 it is capable of simulating and predicting the effects and side effects of various management conditions e g watershed management planting and harvesting management irrigation pesticide and fertilizer management and crop pattern and rotation on quantity and quality of water the model discriminates a basin into subbasins and each subbasin is later separated into hydrological response units hrus these units have the same soil type land use and slope arnold et al 1998 in the model the hydrological cycle is simulated based on the water balance equation for each hru 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where swt is the amount of soil water content at t sw0 is the initial amount of soil water content and rday qsurf ea wseep and qgw are the amount of precipitation surface runoff actual evapotranspiration percolation and return flow originating from groundwater all in mm at the time i day respectively hydrological simulation of river basin in swat is performed in two stages phase 1 or land phase includes simulation of the values of the main inputs such as water and sediment from each subbasin into drainage channels phase 2 or water routing phase looks to the movement of phase 1 s components in drainage networks to the outlet of the basin more specifically consumption and withdrawal as the key components of wa are simulated in the model in a land phase simulation module the only water consumption from agricultural regions with no flow to sinks includes et i e canopy interception crop transpiration and soil evaporation agricultural water withdrawal is also estimated by both auto irrigation and manual irrigation subroutines manual management scheduling inputs in swat allows the users to define the actual field scale schedule agricultural practices by specific date or heat unit accumulations neitsch et al 2009 2 4 modifications for linkage of swat and wa in order to link the swat and wa frameworks and extract the required information it is very important to deeply understand the integration of hydrological and agricultural processes in basin simulation and how swat handles this task table 3 shows the wa sheets and required information as well as the related variables in the swat outputs the table also reveals how variables that are not originally provided can be filled in through modifications of the swat model these modifications as show in table 3 adjust the model to a simulate daily groundwater level b simulate interactions and exchanges of groundwater volume among different subbasins c simulate the water losses during irrigation events d simulate effects of dynamic changes of land use and e extract and analyse outputs of the model for estimation of wa variables the modified version with the water accounting capability is called swat fars more details about the modifications are as follows simulating groundwater level in the original swat groundwater module the simulation is done in two series of reservoirs located below the soil layers the given approach can be useful in groundwater simulation if the groundwater level changes are not significant otherwise the swat model only provides an estimation of the net water volume stored in the aquifer and doesn t report the aquifer water level changes for use in model calibration vazquez amábile and engel 2005 therefore the model code was changed to simulate daily groundwater level for each study region using eq 2 2 h wtbl i h wtbl i 1 exp α gw δ t w rchrg 1 exp α gw δ t 800 μ α gw where hwtbl is the groundwater level mm αgw is the time delay days and wrchrg is the total amount of aquifer recharge mm µ is the aquifer storage factor and δ t is the analysis time interval the modifications for reporting the groundwater level were done in hruyr f hrymon f and gwmod f sub modules simulating the interactions of aquifers the original swat model simulates the spatial variations of groundwater volume and depth in each subbasin s hrus without considering the subbasin s interactions however it is essential to consider interactions and exchanges between aquifers in different subbasins where the aquifer boundaries do not match the boundary of subbasins kim et al 2008 this feature is provided in the swat fars model by redefining the aquifer hrus by overlaying the subbasin hrus layer and aquifer boundaries fig 2 to consider aquifer boundary and its ground water storage interaction redefinition of hrus for simulation of aquifer interactions was done in irrsub f irrigate f gwmod f swat sub modules modifying the swat irrigation management modules application of swat to intensive irrigation agricultural basins where irrigation processes are the major component of the hydrologic balance could not be used for water accounting due to its limitations in simulation of water losses when the irrigation source is a river or outside the watershed during irrigation events in this case swat applies irrigation depth that fills the soil layers up to field capacity if the irrigation depth exceeds field capacity the excess water between soil saturation and field capacity limits returns to the irrigation source and isn t considered in the daily soil water balance calculation it is the same in the case of irrigation losses as well irrigation losses are defined as water that leaves the system without a benefit for agricultural crop growth that includes the conveyance and application losses the conveyance losses relate to water transport losses from the source to the field the application losses also relate to the portion of irrigation water that lost through the water application on field including soil evaporation and other non beneficial components e g weed transpiration and evaporation from conveyance systems the conveyance and application losses affect irrigation efficiency which is defined as the ratio between water consumption plant evapotranspiration and water withdrawal from water resources including rivers reservoirs lakes or groundwater jägermeyr et al 2015 for the application of swat in intensive irrigation application of water to maintain standing water on the field agricultural basins the irrigation subroutine source code needs to be modified to consider the irrigation losses in this study to include the excess water in the soil water balance calculations the swat irrigation modules were modified based on a modification proposed by dechmi et al 2012 according to previous research works about 35 to 50 of water withdrawal volume from water resources for irrigation returns to groundwater resources nasri et al 2015 dor et al 2011 arumí et al 2009 and the real water losses have been reported in general at about 5 to 20 karimi et al 2013b foster et al 2009 keller and keller 1995 due to the water conveyance systems in surface irrigation water conveyance and application losses are higher than water losses in groundwater irrigation and the surface irrigation efficiency is less than the groundwater irrigation efficiency to consider accurate water losses information and values reported by other researchers e g kienzle and schmidt 2008 foster et al 2009 were considered in this study the application water losses of irrigation events from surface water and groundwater resources are considered to be 20 and 10 of conveyance losses respectively which is added to the actual evapotranspiration of the corresponding hrus in this section modifications were done in sub modules including irrsub f irr res f subbasin f and gwmod f applying the dynamic changes of land use one of the important points in the simulation of agricultural basins relates to update the land use status of basins during the simulations swat fars model automatically integrates multiple land use maps and prepares the input files necessary for activating the land use update luu module in swat fars for this hru fractions are updated at the given times based on the changing of area and location of land use generation of wa sheets based on the swat model outputs various outputs of the model are required to be extracted and get processed to produce the required information of wa framework so swat fars interface was developed in c programming language for this task the interface is capable to run modified swat model and extract and calculate the wa variables by processing the output files of the swat model in each land use type and study region for annual and monthly time scales fig 3 shows the swat fars package main window real water saving concept one the main applications of this system is to explain impacts of different measures on water saving swat fars emphasizes the concept of real water saving seckler 1996 it means when a policy is effective it reduces incremental evapotranspiration and such water savings may be allocated to other uses or increase system outflows 3 results and discussion this section explores swat fars setup and its capabilities for analyzing water resources status and management scenarios based on the wa water accounting framework through the tashk bakhtegan basin 3 1 paramertization of swat fars model for this part tashk bakhtegan basin was divided into 56 subbasins and 2245 hrus hrus were extracted using the digital elevation model dem soil land use layers that have homogeneous slope land use and soil characteristics the dem layer was obtained from aster with 30 m resolution and the soil map from the fao 2011 also three land use maps for 1987 2007 and 2015 wri 2015 and locations of rivers hydrometric stations dams and study regions i e cus were prepared as well furthermore the management information relating to irrigation sources and irrigation planning the operation of three existing dams crops planting harvesting dates application of fertilization and pesticide are prepared from the local organizations the next step is the sensitivity analysis of model parameters that was used to determine which parameters have the largest impact on each outputs of the model sensitivity analysis calibration and uncertainty analysis of the swat fars model are performed with swat cup model abbaspour 2015 using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 for example table 4 indicates the parameters as well as p value and t stat initial and final range of them in the stream flow calibration process each parameter which has more t stat value and if its p value is close to zero has had the largest impact on streamflows therefore the results showed that cn2 parameter curve number parameter was the most sensitive parameter and after that gw qmn these parameters were effective ones on surface runoff and groundwater participation in streamflow 3 2 calibration and validation of the swat fars model swat fars needed further calibration and validation what we called it as multi variable multi site calibration since the conventional reliance on hydrometric data is insufficient and it is crucial to include other processes and especially actual evapotranspiration in the course of calibration for this aim the model calibration and validation were carried out using maximum available observation data such as 1 river discharges 2 groundwater level 3 base flow 4 potential and actual evapotranspiration and 5 crop yields to do this after the initial setup of the model calibration and validation were carried out in a multi stage process in the first step hydrological calibration was performed using stream flow base flow and groundwater level to ensure the model simulates surface water groundwater and their interacting in the next step potential and actual evapotranspiration and crop yields were calibrated for more clarification the calibration and validation process of swat fars is shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows performance of the calibrated model for simulation of stream flows a base flows b and groundwater level c using the statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns the calibration during 1985 2006 and validation during 2006 2014 of surface runoff and its base flow were performed using the more important parameters as shown in table 4 fig 5 a shows the values of the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns are more than 0 5 which indicate an acceptable model performance for stream flow simulation in the calibration and validation periods in order to evaluate the results of base flow simulation two correlation features for observed and simulated base flow and base flow index were considered in this study two sub programs called bfi in hydro office software gregor 2012 and recursive digital filter method were applied to separate base flow from the daily streamflows the separation was done for the stations that were not affected by the upstream controlled flows for 1985 to 2014 i e dehkade sefid jamalbeig shirin tange balaghi and droudzan stations as shown in fig 5 b the results of monthly base flow evaluation at these stations indicate an acceptable performance of the model r2 between 0 88 and 0 95 and nash coefficient between 0 56 and 0 73 finally fig 5 c shows the model performance for simulating the groundwater level changes in each aquifer the values of r2 and ns indices for the calibration and validation of groundwater level changes are more than 50 in 83 and 87 of these aquifers respectively also the maximum deviation between simulated and observed values is about 26 the results indicate the acceptable performance of the model in simulating aquifers volume changes in most study regions due to the importance of proper simulations of actual evapotranspiration eta and crop yields as an indicator for eta to evaluate the basin water consumption through different management scenarios efforts were made to calibrate this crucial variable however since there is no direct measurements for eta in the basin a common problem the average simulated eta under full irrigation i e maximum crop water requirement is compared to values reported by the iran national water document 2007 this document includes different crop water requirements of all the basin within iran the calibration of the model for crop yields was also simultaneously carried out with calibration of actual evapotranspiration fig 6 shows the box plot of the observed values of evapotranspiration and crop yields in comparison with the average simulated values the results indicate that there is an acceptable agreement between the model results and the observed values according to maximum and minimum values in the range changes and first and third quartiles as seen in fig 6 except for tomato and bean the average simulated evapotranspiration of the crops are varied from the first to third quartile of the observed values also it is shown that the average simulated crop yields are within the first to third quartile of the observed values 3 3 water accounting plus wa based on the swat fars model based on the calibrated model and further linkage to wa framework the water accounting sheets are presented for the two periods of time including 1985 to 2006 1st and 2007 to 2014 2nd dividing of the entire period in two sections is based on farokhnia 2016 that reported prolong droughts and significant changes on the hydrological characteristics after 2006 using these sheets status of the basin s water resources issues are assessed and presented in the following sections additionally the results for the entire record i e 1985 2014 are also illustrated in the sheets to show more the flexibility of the developed system 3 3 1 wa resources base sheet the first sheet is the resource base sheet table 2 and is shown in fig 7 the sheet shows how the components are varied during the first and second periods as well as the entire time period the major difference related to net inflow originated from decreases in the basin s precipitation the sheet shows about 5 decrease in the precipitation and 10 decrease in net inflows during the two time periods it is also affected by the changes in surface water and groundwater reservoirs snowpack and soil moisture during the investigated periods the natural evapotranspiration as one of the most important outflows has decreased by about 4 3 which is mainly due to precipitation decrease however changes in manageable water is more critical a decrease of 23 is reported in the sheet from the first period to the second period for manageable water along with an increase of incremental evapotranspiration of about 53 this substantially relates to an increase of cropped lands and increase of the basin s temperature farokhnia 2016 these changes have led to a significant shortage of environmental flows such that the inflows of tashk bakhtegan lakes are decreased from 1 47 to 0 01 billion m3 yr 3 3 2 evapotranspiration sheet fig 8 shows the evapotranspiration sheet table 2 for the time periods the amounts of water consumption for different land uses are presented on the left the figure shows 38 increase of eta of managed land use as the most significant component to show the role of human activities on water consumption the right side of the report shows beneficial and non beneficial water consumptions in this part beneficial evapotranspiration is considered as transpiration of crops and natural plants while non beneficial evapotranspiration occurs through evaporation from soil reservoirs etc the sheet also reveals that despite of the significant reduction in manageable water fig 7 12 increase in beneficial evapotranspiration is simultaneously occurred it can be attributed to the increase in cultivated areas and substitution of high water consuming plants in the cropping pattern that has increased transpiration of plants up to 30 also transpiration of natural plants e g pastures and forests are decreased about 13 due to a partial reduction in the area and less available moisture as reduced precipitation in case of the non beneficial evapotranspiration soil evaporation as one of the biggest source of consumption is about 4 5 bcm almost 84 of the total consumptions that is reduced by 6 5 this shows although increasing in agricultural area and irrigation practices increased soil evaporation but the negative effect of precipitation decline on it has been great the evaporation from water bodies dams and lakes is another component of the non beneficial evapotranspiration that indicates 50 increase between the periods of time this increasing is also due to mullah sadra dam impoundment in the second period groundwater evaporation also indicates a slight increase in the second period 3 3 3 withdrawal sheet fig 9 shows the withdrawal reporting sheet table 2 due to increasing production in the irrigated area the total agricultural water withdrawals and agricultural groundwater withdrawals in the second period increased by 17 5 and 24 6 respectively the lack of surface water resources in the second period especially in downstream regions can be one reason for 17 decrease in surface water withdrawals therefore incremental evapotranspiration and losses increased by 34 for the second period conveyance and application losses of irrigation water have been increased from 450 million m3 to 556 million m3 almost 11 increase due to increase in water withdrawals particularly increasing in surface water withdrawals are associated with larger losses due to transmission and issues related to surface irrigation networks the last part of this report deals with the amount of withdrawn water returned to the surface and groundwater sources which is not sufficiently considered in many studies the returns to the surface and groundwater sources is considered as loss in the analysis of classical irrigation efficiency where it has not been removed from water basin cycle and it can be recoverable and reusable keller and keller 1995 the results show that approximately 38 of the water withdrawals for irrigated agricultural lands in the tashk bakhtegan basin returns to surface water and groundwater resources the total return flows have been increased almost 36 in the second period due to increasing in water withdrawals over time the return flows to groundwater resources is up to 98 of total return flows 3 3 4 wa performance indicators table 5 shows the indicators of each reporting sheet along with their descriptions and the amount of them in the two analyzing periods for calculations of some the indicators in the resource base sheet it was necessary to consider the environmental water right of the tashk bakhtegan lake as committed flow which is 342 million m3 yr in normal conditions fars province department of environment 2011 the indicators of water resources and consumptions report respective definitions and amounts for the two periods are presented in table 5 for instance it is illustrated that the ratio of manageable water was 28 in the first period and decreased to 23 in the second period which is mainly due to decrease in precipitations similarly the ratio of groundwater resources change increased from 7 3 to 16 in the second period that indicates more over exploitation of groundwater the ratio of utilizable water for the first period indicates 88 of water allocable in the basin is used for consumption and simultaneously supplying downstream commitments about 342 million m3 as the water rights of the lakes in normal conditions but in the second period it decreases to 85 of basin available water and almost no inflows to the lakes the ratio of commitments downstream supply equals 4 47 and 0 for the periods respectively another notable ratio is the consumption ratio which is 49 for the first period it indicates only 50 of allocable water was being consumed during the first period however it increased to 99 in the second period in which the exploitation of water resources is more than the manageable water 3 3 5 spatial and temporal evaluation of wa components one of the main expectations from water accounting analysis is the ability to evaluate and identify trends in water supply demand accessibility and use in time and space within specified domains fao 2012 definitely providing such information and respected records are very limited or not available at all this option is embedded in swat fars and the components of wa are possible to be extracted at different scales and time for instance fig 10 shows spatial variation of total consumed water water resources and consumptions sheet within the basin fig 11 also illustrates temporal variation of precipitation total consumed water and outflow water resources and consumptions sheet during 1985 to 2014 the behavior of the basin before 2004 and after it noticeable moreover based on batchelor et al 2016 through water accounting it would be possible to underlying causes of imbalances in supply and demand and levels of environmental sustainability fig 11 shows also status of the basin from these point of views as well although more detailed information can be obtained from the sheets to address these issues 3 3 6 application of swat fars for analyzing the management policies water saving and alleviating pressure on water resources are the common goals in the environmental section of the iran 6th five year development plan for this aim changing cropping pattern and changing irrigation from surface to pressurized systems has attracted the most attentions as possible solutions these policies are evaluated for the study area as follows changing cropping pattern rice is a high consuming water crop and based on the 6th plan it is suggested to eliminate this practice from the tashkh bakhtegan basin s cropping pattern the current rice area in the basin is about 30 000 ha out of 450 000 ha of the irrigated area to assess effects and side effects of such a policy all the rice hru s substituted by wheat in swat fars and the model was run for the period of 1985 to 2014 to shorten the text the results of the wa withdrawal sheet is only presented in fig 12 as it is shown in the figure this management scenario reduces agricultural withdrawal by 0 27 bcm yr 3 56 minus 3 29 bcm yr but the incremental evapotranspiration and transpiration are only reduced by 0 11and 0 08 bcm yr respectively one the unique features of swat fars is the possibility to track rebound effects in real world when a water saving measure is implemented the expected saved water does not necessary would be availed for another users e g environment since it can be unintentionally applied for conventional deficit irrigation or intentionally used for development of cropped lands as well as cultivation of more water consuming crops raeisi et al 2019 what has shown in fig 12 is based on not controlling rebound effect because it needs huge infrastructure to control rebound effect and it is not available in the study area application of pressurized irrigation changing the current surface irrigation to drip system is another common policy to reduce water consumption it is also mandated in the 6th plan which also needs huge investment applying this system for the entire basin shows this measure can reduce agricultural withdrawal by 1 25 mcm 3 56 minus 2 31bcm yr notably this measure not only decreases incremental evapotranspiration and transpiration but also increases them by 0 15 and 0 25 bcm yr respectively due to reduction of deficit irrigation when more water is available fig 12 this issue is warned in perry et al 2017 that as far as water allocation is not controllable increasing irrigation efficiency can have negative effect on water consumption 4 conclusion the aim of this research work was to enhance capabilities of wa water accounting with linkage to swat as a conceptual model for better policy and decisions making in water resources management for the linkage it was necessary to make some changes in the model s code and also define new boundaries for category units or study regions in the package so called swat fars the most important philosophy behind swat fars is to develop a tool with the following concerns a tool to support integrated water resources management iwrm systematic presentation of the current status and past trends in water supply and demand as well as future situation under different policies and management scenarios through water accounting framework evaluation of effect and side effects of water policies in an integrated framework incorporation of climate scenarios e g climate changes aogcm data and historical climate trends in management scenarios evaluation of the above assessments in different geographical domains possibility to estimate water saving using real water saving concept evaluation of policies under conditions of control or not control of rebound effect estimation of water and soil productivity indices based on water withdrawal and consumption as well as beneficial and non beneficial consumption separation of climate and human effects through wa framework explanation of ratio of actual evapotranspiration to maximum crop water requirements i e deficit irrigation reporting the wa sheets at the different spatial scales from hru level to basin level application of swat fars for task bakhtegan basin showed despite of a significantdecreasein manageable water almost 23 due to the negative trends in precipitations not only incremental irrigation in the basin is not reduced but also it has been considerably increased almost 53 this has led to almost 99 decrease in outflows that eventually creates inflows to the tashk and bakhtegan lakes also 77 decrease in the volume of groundwater resources in the basin due to over exploitation is another consequent two alleviate pressures on the basin s water resources two main policies are considered based on the 6th developing plan they are elimination of rice cultivation with its own social oppositions and improving pressurized irrigation with huge investment requirements the results showed changing cropping pattern can reduce water consumption by 0 08 bcm yr but changing irrigation system can even increase water consumption by 0 25

water applied is the amount of consumed water return flows and losses consumed water fraction the part of the water applied that is evaporated and transpired it also indicates which parts of consumed water are beneficial and non beneficial within the basin beneficial water consumption is the amount of consumed water for transpiration of natural plants and agricultural crops non beneficial water consumption indicates the water consumed that is lost from the system through interception soil evaporation groundwater evaporation and evaporation from water surfaces like rivers and reservoirs as well as weed transpiration and evaporative conveyance systems return flows the difference between applied and consumed water that describes the amount of it that is recoverable and non recoverable recoverable flow return flows that are reused for example return flows to a water source drains and rivers and percolation from irrigated lands into freshwater aquifers non recoverable flow it is lost to further use due to degradation through nutrient leaching and salinity for example flows enters the ocean or brackish water bodies including percolation into saline aquifers drains without downstream diversion non recoverable sinks physically or economically irrigation water losses non recoverable return flows of the non consumed water fraction as well as non beneficial evaporation irrigation water losses are defined as water that leaves the system without a benefit for agricultural crop growth that includes the nominal and real losses the nominal losses relate to water transport losses from the source to the field conveyance losses the real losses relate to the portion of water irrigation that lost through the water application on field including soil evaporation and other non beneficial components e g weed transpiration and evaporative conveyance systems gross inflow indicates the amount of water flows into the basin including precipitation water inflows from surface or ground water resources net inflow is the amount of gross inflow after changes in volume of fresh water storage and indicates the degree of water available for evapotranspiration exploitable water indicates water being present in different sources including groundwater rivers lakes and reservoirs available water indicates the amount of water that is available for use at the basin in fact it is obtained from the exploitable water minus reserved and non utilizable outflows protected land use is the natural ecosystem and environmentally sensitive land use including shrub land forests glaciers wetlands natural grasslands as well as protection from sea utilized land use indicates a low to moderate resource utilization such as savannah woodland and mixed pastures modified land use is the principal vegetation that is replaced for increased utilization of land resources incremental evapotranspiration the water consumption that is just related to water withdrawals outflows the amount of water that leaves the basin through surface and subsurface systems including surface and subsurface outflows 
5532,we examined long term changes in daily streamflow associated with forestry practices over a 60 year period 1959 2017 in the alsea watershed study oregon coast range pacific northwest usa we quantified the response of daily streamflow to 1 harvest of mature old forest in 1966 2 43 to 53 yr and 48 to 58 yr old industrial plantation forests in 2006 2009 and 3 logging of the plantations using contemporary forest practices including retention of a riparian buffer in 2010 and 2014 daily streamflow from a 40 to 53 yr old douglas fir plantation was 25 lower on average and 50 lower during the summer june 15 to sept 15 of 2006 to 2009 relative to the reference watershed containing mature old forest low flow deficits persisted over six or more months of each year surprisingly contemporary forest practices i e clearcutting of the plantation with riparian buffers in 2009 and 2014 had only a minor effect on streamflow deficits two years after logging in 2014 summer streamflow deficits were similar to those observed prior to harvest under 40 to 53 yr old plantations high evapotranspiration from rapidly regenerating vegetation including planted douglas fir and from the residual plantation forest in the riparian buffer appeared to explain the persistence of streamflow deficits after logging of nearly 100 of the forest plantation results of this study indicated that 40 to 50 yr rotations of douglas fir plantations can produce persistent large summer low flow deficits while the clearcutting of these plantations with retention of riparian buffers increased daily streamflow slightly flows did not return to pre first entry conditions further work is needed to examine how intensively managed plantation forests along with expected warmer drier conditions in the future may influence summer low streamflow and aquatic ecosystems keywords water deficits forest harvesting plantations alsea watershed study riparian buffer 1 introduction climate change natural disturbances and human activities have raised concerns about both the short and long term effects on water supplies originating from forests flörke et al 2018 hellema et al 2018 vörösmarty et al 2010 much of the concern is in part the result of dramatic increases in disturbances in forests a trend projected to continue in many regions globally hansen et al 2013 nolan et al 2018 widespread forest

recent global expansion of industrial plantation forestry e g hansen et al 2013 has raised concerns about the long term hydrologic effects of forest plantations ferraz et al 2013 scott 2005 experimental watershed studies have provided evidence that low flows may increase in the first decade following harvest of mature or old growth forest with and without riparian buffers but low flows may decline in subsequent decades as vegetation regenerates jones and post 2004 moore and wondzell 2005 rothacher 1970 surfleet and skaugset 2013 however few studies have sufficient data to reveal long term effects of forest harvest and plantations on summer low flows in a recent analysis of 60 years of daily streamflow data from eight paired watersheds in the cascade range oregon usa summer streamflow fell below pre treatment levels within 15 years after old growth forest harvest perry and jones 2017 additionally these low flow deficits persisted and intensified for 50 years as the douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii plantations became established perry and jones 2017 long term declines in low flows associated with forest harvesting and plantations raise concerns about aquatic ecosystem health and water supply especially in dry years leppi et al 2012 luce and holden 2009 despite these observations several important questions about the magnitude and longevity of the effects of forest harvesting and industrial plantation forestry remain unanswered thus research from long term watershed studies is needed to compare streamflow response to harvest of mature and old growth forest with the streamflow response to contemporary forestry practices which involve clearcutting of 30 to 50 year plantations with riparian buffers harvest of plantations may temporarily increase summer low flows surfleet and skaugset 2013 but it is unclear whether contemporary forest practices can restore low flows to levels produced by mature and old growth forest the alsea watershed study in the oregon coast range provided a unique opportunity to address these uncertainties the study included an initial phase of harvest of mature old forest 1959 1973 harr and krygier 1972 growth of douglas fir plantations a second harvest in 2009 of 43 to 53 yr old and in 2014 of 48 to 58 yr old plantations using contemporary forestry practices including a riparian buffer and a final post phase 2015 2017 with riparian trees 51 to 61 yr old we addressed the following questions 1 how did harvest of 43 to 58 yr old douglas fir plantations with riparian buffers influence streamflow compared to harvest of unmanaged mature old forest in the oregon coast range pacific northwest usa 2 what processes explain these responses in the alsea compared to other long term watershed experiments in the region 2 study site the alsea watershed study 44 5 n 123 9 w was established in september 1958 fig 1 the study area is located in the siuslaw national forest in the central oregon coast range draining

watershed and treatment descriptions 3 1 flynn creek the reference watershed flynn creek 210 ha is located on u s forest service land and is undisturbed by human activities fig 1 flynn creek was designated a u s forest service research natural area in 1975 mean elevation is 272 m and the mean watershed slope gradient is 25 the gravel bed stream has a gradient of 0 025 m m moring 1975 and summer mean wetted width of 1 3 m bladon et al 2016 canopy closure as assessed with a spherical densiometer along the stream channel was 91 92 between 2006 and 2012 vegetation consists of two tree height cohorts fig 1 table 1 one at 32 m corresponding to an estimated 60 70 cover of red alder and big leaf maple and another at 54 m corresponding to an estimated 30 40 cover of douglas fir

historically used to examine the impact of road building and extensive forest management on water quality harr et al 1975 the mean elevation is 304 m and the mean gradient is 27 the gravel bed stream has a gradient of 0 018 m m and summer mean wetted width of 1 8 m moring 1975 roads were constructed in 1965 harr et al 1975 and three 25 ha patch clearcuts were harvested between may and november 1966 using high lead cable yarding with a riparian buffer along all streams fig 2 table a cutover units were broadcast burned and hand planted with douglas fir followed by herbicide treatments to control competing vegetation between 1978 and 1988 the usda forest service usfs intermittently clear cut harvested and thinned three small units totaling 44 ha table 1 fig 2 the usfs also thinned 59 ha in three management units in deer creek around 2006 this thinning was not a part of the study and details on the exact area and basal area removal retention are not currently known these thinning operations may have affected streamflow to some extent but given the small spatial extent it is unlikely they affected the overall findings of our analysis for deer creek in 1959 vegetation consisted of 60 64 conifer forest dominated by post fire douglas fir 50 70 and 70 110 years old and 36 40 cover of 40 to 60 year old deciduous hardwoods hall and stednick 2008 harris 1977 harris and williams

canopy closure along the stream channel was 96 in 2006 2008 and 89 in 2010 2012 roads were constructed in 1965 harr et al 1975 and the watershed was 82 clearcut in 1966 with a combination of high lead cable and tractor yarding there was no riparian buffer trees were yarded across the stream and large wood and logging debris were cleared from the channel after clearcutting the site was broadcast burned hand planted with douglas fir and treated with herbicide table 1 in 1956 13 ha 17 of the drainage area in the headwaters of needle branch were clear cut hall and stednick 2008 therefore 100 of the watershed area was clear cut between 1956 and 1966 hence the pre treatment relationship between needle branch and flynn creek 1959 1966 reflects in part the conversion of 17 of needle branch from old forest to young plantation in 1956 at the time of the second harvest entry 2009 plantations in needle branch were aged 43 to 53 years pre commercial thinning occurred in 1981 stednick and kern 1992 during the second contemporary harvest entry the upper sub watershed 34 9 ha was clearcut harvested in 2009 and a lower section 36 8 ha was clearcut in 2014 for a total clearcut of 96 of the drainage area fig 2 both clearcuts were completed using cable and tractor equipment all trees in the cutover area were removed including along three small non fish bearing tributaries but a 15 m riparian management area was retained on each side of the fish bearing portion of the stream in accordance with the oregon forest practices act and rules odf 1994 the riparian management area

of the watershed with red alder occupying a significant portion of the riparian corridors mean tree height in the watershed in 2009 was 28 m fig 1 4 methods 4 1 discharge record streamflow data were collected continuously during two periods in the historical period 1959 to 1973 15 water years data were tabulated at 2 hour intervals including seven years each of pre and post harvest data in the contemporary period 2006 to 2017 12 water years data were collected at 10 minute intervals including three to eight years of pre harvest data table 1 fig 3 the watersheds were instrumented in 1958 with compound broad crested concrete weirs located at the watershed outlets of flynn creek needle branch and deer creek harris 1977b streamflow was monitored by the usgs from 1959 to 1973 by the watershed research cooperative from 2006 to 2017 hatten et al 2018 for the contemporary record 2006 to 2017 rating curves were developed based 40 to 55 stage discharge data points collected for each

streamflow effects of forest harvest were calculated following methods in jones and post 2004 and perry and jones 2017 the difference r in mean daily flow q normalized by drainage area between treated qt and reference qr watersheds was calculated for each day between 1959 and 1973 and between 2006 and 2017 1 r l n q t q r qr corresponded to the mean daily flow in flynn creek while qt was the mean daily flow from either needle branch or deer creek an r 0 represented no difference in q between a treatment and the reference while values 0 or 0 represented increases or decreases in discharge relative to the reference mean daily differences in daily flows between treated and reference watersheds r d were calculated for each day d and compared for various combinations of five pre and post

1959 1965 and 2 to compare the effects of the first and second harvest entries on water yields see supplemental material tables s2 s4 and figs s3 s6 changes in daily streamflow from the alsea watershed study were also compared to long term watershed experiments in the cascades of oregon that used the same methods of analysis jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 4 3 uncertainty to account for uncertainty in drainage area and rating curves estimated annual water yields for the historic and contemporary periods were compared assuming different combinations of estimated drainage area and rating curves supplementary material table s4 based on this analysis we opted to use the lidar derived drainage area estimates and the rating curves specific to the historic and contemporary periods method 1 in the supplementary material c we note that the alsea watershed study gauging infrastructure was not designed and constructed to provide high resolution low flow measurements but rather to capture the range of streamflow generated in these headwater watersheds however we believe that this infrastructure was sufficiently robust to detect long term changes in daily flows the supplementary material provides a comprehensive effort to confirm that these analyses are robust 5 results here we report analyses of effects on daily streamflow from 1 the historical first entry

with riparian buffer table 2 analysis of streamflow data from flynn creek reference indicated that streamflow at the long term reference site was stationary in other words there was no evidence that daily streamflow had changed over the period of record 1959 to 2017 in the reference watershed except for one day in early february when mean daily streamflow decreased by 2 p 0 038 supplementary material fig s7 while changes associated with ongoing forest succession in flynn creek such as senescence of riparian alder were observed anecdotally they did not produce detectable changes in streamflow over time at flynn creek and therefore did not appear to affect the changes quantified in this study the comparisons of daily flows are presented here in terms of percent difference in ratios of the treatment to reference flows eq 2 the changes are presented in absolute differences in unit area streamflow mm in the supplementary material b fig s2 5 1 effects of initial harvest of 110 yr old forest on daily streamflow clearcutting of 110 yr old forest in 1966 initially increased streamflow table 2 during the first seven years after clearcutting in 1966 daily streamflow increased on average by 19 in needle branch 82 clearcut and 6 in deer creek 25 patch clearcut fig 5 a table 2 on average mean daily streamflow increased significantly on 235 days of each water year 64 of the days in needle branch and 186 days of each water year 51 in deer creek during the first seven years after clearcutting the 82 clearcut harvest in needle branch primarily affected streamflow during the fall producing increases of 60 range 26 98 in daily streamflow from late september through november with smaller 14 increases in the spring may 15 to june 30 and small decreases 10 in summer july 1 to september 15 fig 5 a red line the 25 patch clearcutting of 110 yr old forest in deer creek in 1966 also primarily affected daily streamflow in the fall up to 30 increases in mid

streamflow increased relative to the pre harvest 40 to 53 yr old forest plantation conditions but summer streamflow deficits persisted table 2 fig 5 c orange and magenta lines when compared to the second pre harvest period 2006 2009 mean daily streamflow in needle branch increased by 53 in the first five years 2010 2014 after phase i of the second harvest fig 6 magenta line these increases occurred on average during 308 days of each water year the highest increases in daily flows after phase i of the second entry 2010 2014 occurred in the late summer table 2 fig 6 magenta line also when compared to the second pre harvest period 2006 2009 mean daily streamflow increased by 41 in the first three years after phase ii of the second harvest 2015 2017 and increases occurred on average during 320 days of each water year fig 6 orange line relative increases in streamflow were greater after the harvest of the young forest plantation than after the harvest of mature old forest table 2 over the water year as a whole the second harvest did not restore streamflow to the levels produced by mature old forest in the reference watershed when compared to the initial pre harvest period 1959 1965 mean daily streamflow in needle branch was unchanged 0 change in the first five years 2010 2014 after phase i of the second harvest and it was 6 lower in the three years 2015 2017 after phase ii of the second harvest entry 2014 fig 5 c orange and magenta lines table 2 summer streamflow increased after the harvest of 43 to 53 yr old plantation forests but then quickly declined and remained lower than summer streamflow in the mature old forest reference watershed that is relative to the second pre harvest period 2006 2009 40 53 yr old plantations june 1 to september 15 streamflow increased by 76 in the first five years after phase i of the second harvest 2010 2014 and by 49 in the first three years after phase ii of the second harvest 2015 2017 fig 6 orange and magenta lines in contrast relative to the first pre treatment period 1959 1965 110 yr old forest mean daily streamflow during june 1 to september 15 decreased by 21 in the first five years 2010 2014 after phase i of the second harvest and decreased by 36 in the first three years 2015 2017 after phase ii of the second harvest fig 5 c orange and magenta lines after the second harvest streamflow from the harvested watershed was significantly lower than in the reference watershed for an average of 138 days of each water year between 2010 and 2014 and 168 days of each water year between 2015 and 2017 fig 5 c orange and magenta lines in other words the combination of 1 to 3 yr old douglas fir plantation in the lower half of needle branch 5 to 8 yr old plantation in the upper half of the watershed and 49 to 61 yr old douglas fir and red alder in the riparian buffer zone produced similar summer streamflow levels to the 40 to 53 yr old plantation table 2 5 4 comparison with other long term paired watershed studies in the region the observed 50 declines in summer streamflow from 40 to 53 yr old douglas fir plantations at needle branch relative to the mature old forest reference watershed were comparable to those detected for similar aged douglas fir plantations in the h j andrews experimental forest watershed 01 and1 and the coyote creek coyote 03 coy3 watersheds in the oregon cascades fig 7 a summer streamflow deficits were more persistent in needle branch may to december and in coy3 may to november than in and1 june to september fig 7 a the magnitude of summer streamflow deficits also was related to the proportion of watershed area in young 30 to 50 yr old plantations in several of the paired watersheds at the h j andrews coyote creek and alsea fig 7 b jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 in particular 82 100 cover of douglas fir plantations ranging from 36 to 53 years of age in needle branch and1 and coy 3 produced summer daily streamflow deficits of 30 to 51 relative to their mature and old growth forest reference watersheds in contrast 25 cover of douglas fir plantations in deer creek and and3 produced summer daily streamflow deficits of 14 21 controlling for area of mature forest converted to plantations summer streamflow deficits were smaller in the andrews forest compared to alsea and coyote fig 7 b 6 discussion the long term streamflow responses observed in the alsea watershed study along with results from other studies in the region suggest that the effects of vegetation on evapotranspiration strongly influence summer low flows however these effects may be moderated by climate variability in conjunction with other published work from the alsea watershed study these results also indicate that summer low flow deficits associated with contemporary plantation forestry using 40 to 50 yr rotations and riparian buffers may limit fish habitat these findings are discussed in detail below 6 1 vegetation effects on evapotranspiration the age species composition density and successional stage of vegetation appeared to affect evapotranspiration explaining many of the observed streamflow responses the 40 to 53 yr old forest plantations produced summer low flow deficits in needle branch because of apparently higher transpiration of young trees growing in dense plantation forest stands compared to large mature old trees growing in less dense stands shaped by centuries of disturbance and succession the greater relative increase in streamflow after the harvest of the young forest plantation compared to increases after the initial harvest of mature old forest in needle branch table 2 indicates that the evapotranspiration rates in the 40 to 53 yr old forest plantation were substantially greater than in the primarily older forest that had been harvested in 1966 similar to other studies in the region that also included historic harvesting with no riparian buffers the magnitude of summer streamflow deficits in needle branch were proportional to the area of watershed in young forest plantations fig 7 b this provides evidence indicating that the effects of forest harvesting on evapotranspiration were additive in these headwater catchments 3 km2 these findings are consistent with literature suggesting that transpiration rates decrease with age in individual trees and as a result of changes in forest structure during succession immediately after clearcutting reductions in interception and evapotranspiration generally lead to increased soil moisture and increased streamflow bowling et al 2000 harr et al 1982 keppeler and ziemer 1990 rothacher 1965 however over time vegetation regeneration can increase evapotranspiration and decrease soil moisture and summer streamflow adams et al 1991 fowler et al 1987 ingwersen 1985 pike and scherer 2003 salemi et al 2012 young fast growing densely spaced trees typically have higher rates of sapflow compared to older forest stands moore et al 2004 moore et al 2011 perry and jones 2017 which could contribute to summer streamflow deficits for example streamflow deficits declined in south african watersheds as forest plantations exceeded their rotation ages 15 yrs for eucalyptus grandis and 30 yrs for pinus radiata scott and prinsloo 2008 similarly stem density stomatal conductance and photosynthesis decreased in 70 100 yr old compared to 20 40 yr old loblolly pine stands drake et al 2011 indicating that tree physiological changes during later stages of forest succession may decrease summer evapotranspiration and may increase summer streamflow in mature old forests summer streamflow deficits under 40 to 53 yr old plantations at needle branch alsea were comparable in magnitude to those reported from similar aged douglas fir plantations in other paired watersheds in oregon andrews forest coyote creek jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 indicating that douglas fir plantations of similar age have similar evapotranspiration rates relative to the mature old and old growth forest reference stands in each of these three locations contemporary forest practices clearcut harvest of 43 to 53 yr old plantations with a riparian buffer at alsea did not restore summer low flows to levels produced by mature old forest forest harvesting with riparian buffers in the upper half of needle branch in 2009 increased summer low flows relative to the pre harvest plantation but these flows were still lower than those in the reference mature old forest this response implies relatively high evapotranspiration by the remaining 44 to 58 yr old douglas fir plantations in the lower half of the watershed and the trees in the riparian buffer zone in the upper watershed compared to the mature old forest in the reference watershed surprisingly after the remainder of needle branch was clearcut with a riparian buffer in 2014 summer streamflow deficits intensified and approached those under the former 40 to 53 yr old plantations this response implies high evapotranspiration from the upper part of the watershed with 6 to 8 yr old douglas fir and from residual trees in the riparian buffer zone suggesting that this vegetation can exert a disproportionate effect on low streamflow bond et al 2002 while representing only a few percent of watershed area 6 2 effects of climate variability on low streamflow both spatial and temporal variation in climate appeared to affect the magnitude and duration of summer low flow deficits summer streamflow deficits at alsea were of similar duration to those from coyote creek in the southern oregon cascades but lasted for more of the year than those reported from similar aged douglas fir plantations in the h j andrews forest in the central oregon cascades jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 in addition controlling for plantation area harvested summer streamflow deficits were smaller at the h j andrews forest compared to the alsea and coyote creek fig 7 b the first seven years after the initial harvest of mature old forest in needle branch in the 1960s produced much smaller increases in average daily streamflow and summer streamflow than reported for other paired watershed studies in oregon new hampshire and north carolina jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 these differences may be explained in part by potentially high evapotranspiration demand from the re growing vegetation in the 13 ha that were clear cut in needle branch in 1956 cooler winter temperatures and the presence of snowpack at the andrews forest seasonal snowpack and deciduous forests at hubbard brook in new hampshire and deciduous forests at coweeta in north carolina jones and post 2004 all of these factors may limit the period of summer deficits in these sites compared to locations with less snow warmer winter temperature and evergreen forest such as the alsea or coyote study sites temporal variation in climate also may have influenced the magnitude and duration of summer streamflow deficits in needle branch after the second harvest 2010 2017 summer streamflow deficits intensified unexpectedly after phase ii of logging during the second harvest at needle branch 2015 2017 summer conditions were hotter and drier in phase ii 2015 2017 compared to phase i 2010 2013 see study site description controlling for plantation age summer low flow deficits were greater under plantations relative to reference old growth forest during hotter drier years when summer streamflow was relatively low perry and jones 2017 streamflow responses to clearcutting of old growth and establishment of douglas fir plantations andrews and1 and and2 varied significantly between dry and wet periods burt et al 2015 the hotter drier conditions in 2015 to 2017 may have intensified evapotranspiration in the remaining vegetation overwhelming any increases in moisture after logging of the lower watershed in needle branch 6 3 implications for water quality and fish habitat persistent deficits in summer low flows related to plantation forestry have the potential to impact water quality and aquatic ecosystem health for example maximum daily stream temperatures in needle branch rose by 7 15 c in the first two years after clearcutting of mature old forest removal of riparian vegetation and instream wood and burning of slash in the 1960s brown and krygier 1970 these stream temperature increases occurred despite an increase in streamflow and are similar to increases reported elsewhere e g johnson and jones 2000 in contrast the second harvest in 2009 of 43 to 53 yr old plantation had little effect on stream temperature bladon et al 2016 the lack of a stream temperature response to the second harvest is likely related to the riparian buffer i e mean canopy closure over the stream was 96 before the harvest and 89 after the harvest the relative post harvest increase in daily streamflow we reported in this study 50 180 and the groundwater and hyporheic sources of summer streamflow in the watershed hale and mcdonnell 2016 salmonid fish biomass in needle branch appeared to have recovered to the pre treatment 1959 1965 levels prior to the second entry and late summer total biomass of coastal cutthroat trout increased after harvest of the 43 to 53 yr old plantation bateman et al 2018 the reported 76 relative increases in summer streamflow between 2010 and 2014 and associated increases in stream perennial extent and available habitat following the second harvest may partially explain the increase in fish biomass after the second entry phase i however it remains uncertain why fish biomass recovered to original levels when streamflow was reduced under the 40 to 53 yr old forest stand some models suggest a 25 50 reduction in fish habitat availability as a result of decreased summer low flow associated with regenerating young stands gronsdahl et al 2019 research at the alsea watersheds and elsewhere should continue to monitor fish response to changing forest and stream conditions 7 conclusion streamflow from a 40 to 53 yr old douglas fir plantation in the alsea watershed in the coast range of oregon was 25 lower on average and 50 lower during the summer june 1 to september 15 relative to the reference watershed containing mature old forest these low flow deficits were similar in magnitude to those observed under similar aged douglas fir plantations in the cascade range of oregon high evapotranspiration rates from douglas fir plantations appeared to explain deficits from 40 to 50 yr old forest plantations surprisingly contemporary forest practices i e clearcut of 43 to 53 yr old and 48 to 58 yr old plantations with riparian buffers had only a minor effect on the streamflow deficits and by a few years after logging summer streamflow deficits were similar to those observed under 40 to 53 yr old plantations high evapotranspiration from rapidly regenerating vegetation including planted douglas fir and from the residual forest in the riparian buffer appeared to explain the persistence of streamflow deficits despite nearly 100 clearcutting of the watershed low streamflow deficits also were greater during warmer drier years results of this study indicate that contemporary forestry harvesting practices including 40 to 50 yr rotations of douglas fir plantations with riparian buffers may produce persistent low flow deficits short term amelioration of these deficits after logging may partially explain observed increases in fish biomass in needle branch however it remains uncertain why fish biomass appeared to have recovered in the 40 to 53 yr old forest stand to levels observed in 1958 1973 further work is needed to examine how intensively managed plantation forests and expected warmer drier future conditions may influence

5532,we examined long term changes in daily streamflow associated with forestry practices over a 60 year period 1959 2017 in the alsea watershed study oregon coast range pacific northwest usa we quantified the response of daily streamflow to 1 harvest of mature old forest in 1966 2 43 to 53 yr and 48 to 58 yr old industrial plantation forests in 2006 2009 and 3 logging of the plantations using contemporary forest practices including retention of a riparian buffer in 2010 and 2014 daily streamflow from a 40 to 53 yr old douglas fir plantation was 25 lower on average and 50 lower during the summer june 15 to sept 15 of 2006 to 2009 relative to the reference watershed containing mature old forest low flow deficits persisted over six or more months of each year surprisingly contemporary forest practices i e clearcutting of the plantation with riparian buffers in 2009 and 2014 had only a minor effect on streamflow deficits two years after logging in 2014 summer streamflow deficits were similar to those observed prior to harvest under 40 to 53 yr old plantations high evapotranspiration from rapidly regenerating vegetation including planted douglas fir and from the residual plantation forest in the riparian buffer appeared to explain the persistence of streamflow deficits after logging of nearly 100 of the forest plantation results of this study indicated that 40 to 50 yr rotations of douglas fir plantations can produce persistent large summer low flow deficits while the clearcutting of these plantations with retention of riparian buffers increased daily streamflow slightly flows did not return to pre first entry conditions further work is needed to examine how intensively managed plantation forests along with expected warmer drier conditions in the future may influence summer low streamflow and aquatic ecosystems keywords water deficits forest harvesting plantations alsea watershed study riparian buffer 1 introduction climate change natural disturbances and human activities have raised concerns about both the short and long term effects on water supplies originating from forests flörke et al 2018 hellema et al 2018 vörösmarty et al 2010 much of the concern is in part the result of dramatic increases in disturbances in forests a trend projected to continue in many regions globally hansen et al 2013 nolan et al 2018 widespread forest disturbance may alter forested headwater watersheds whose structure composition and health influence water supplies for aquatic ecosystems and for downstream uses brown et al 2008 creed et al 2014

recent global expansion of industrial plantation forestry e g hansen et al 2013 has raised concerns about the long term hydrologic effects of forest plantations ferraz et al 2013 scott 2005 experimental watershed studies have provided evidence that low flows may increase in the first decade following harvest of mature or old growth forest with and without riparian buffers but low flows may decline in subsequent decades as vegetation regenerates jones and post 2004 moore and wondzell 2005 rothacher 1970 surfleet and skaugset 2013 however few studies have sufficient data to reveal long term effects of forest harvest and plantations on summer low flows in a recent analysis of 60 years of daily streamflow data from eight paired watersheds in the cascade range oregon usa summer streamflow fell below pre treatment levels within 15 years after old growth forest harvest perry and jones 2017 additionally these low flow deficits persisted and intensified for 50 years as the douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii plantations became established perry and jones 2017 long term declines in low flows associated with forest harvesting and plantations raise concerns about aquatic ecosystem health and water supply especially in dry years leppi et al 2012 luce and holden 2009 despite these observations several important questions about the magnitude and longevity of the effects of forest harvesting and industrial plantation forestry remain unanswered thus research from long term watershed studies is needed to compare streamflow response to harvest of mature and old growth forest with the streamflow response to contemporary forestry practices which involve clearcutting of 30 to 50 year plantations with riparian buffers harvest of plantations may temporarily increase summer low flows surfleet and skaugset 2013 but it is unclear whether contemporary forest practices can restore low flows to levels produced by mature and old growth forest the alsea watershed study in the oregon coast range provided a unique opportunity to address these uncertainties the study included an initial phase of harvest of mature old forest 1959 1973 harr and krygier 1972 growth of douglas fir plantations a second harvest in 2009 of 43 to 53 yr old and in 2014 of 48 to 58 yr old plantations using contemporary forestry practices including a riparian buffer and a final post phase 2015 2017 with riparian trees 51 to 61 yr old we addressed the following questions 1 how did harvest of 43 to 58 yr old douglas fir plantations with riparian buffers influence streamflow compared to harvest of unmanaged mature old forest in the oregon coast range pacific northwest usa 2 what processes explain these responses in the alsea compared to other long term watershed experiments in the region 2 study site the alsea watershed study 44 5 n 123 9 w was established in september 1958 fig 1 the study area is located in the siuslaw national forest in the central oregon coast range draining highly dissected terrain with short steep soil mantled hillslopes underlain by the tyee formation a rhythmically eocene interbedded sandstone and mudstones deposit snavely et al 1964 in general the

watershed and treatment descriptions 3 1 flynn creek the reference watershed flynn creek 210 ha is located on u s forest service land and is undisturbed by human activities fig 1 flynn creek was designated a u s forest service research natural area in 1975 mean elevation is 272 m and the mean watershed slope gradient is 25 the gravel bed stream has a gradient of 0 025 m m moring 1975 and summer mean wetted width of 1 3 m bladon et al 2016 canopy closure as assessed with a spherical densiometer along the stream channel was 91 92 between 2006 and 2012 vegetation consists of two tree height cohorts fig 1 table 1 one at 32 m corresponding to an estimated 60 70 cover of red alder and big leaf maple and another at 54 m corresponding to an estimated 30 40 cover of douglas fir

historically used to examine the impact of road building and extensive forest management on water quality harr et al 1975 the mean elevation is 304 m and the mean gradient is 27 the gravel bed stream has a gradient of 0 018 m m and summer mean wetted width of 1 8 m moring 1975 roads were constructed in 1965 harr et al 1975 and three 25 ha patch clearcuts were harvested between may and november 1966 using high lead cable yarding with a riparian buffer along all streams fig 2 table a cutover units were broadcast burned and hand planted with douglas fir followed by herbicide treatments to control competing vegetation between 1978 and 1988 the usda forest service usfs intermittently clear cut harvested and thinned three small units totaling 44 ha table 1 fig 2 the usfs also thinned 59 ha in three management units in deer creek around 2006 this thinning was not a part of the study and details on the exact area and basal area removal retention are not currently known these thinning operations may have affected streamflow to some extent but given the small spatial extent it is unlikely they affected the overall findings of our analysis for deer creek in 1959 vegetation consisted of 60 64 conifer forest dominated by post fire douglas fir 50 70 and 70 110 years old and 36 40 cover of 40 to 60 year old deciduous hardwoods hall and stednick 2008 harris 1977 harris and williams

canopy closure along the stream channel was 96 in 2006 2008 and 89 in 2010 2012 roads were constructed in 1965 harr et al 1975 and the watershed was 82 clearcut in 1966 with a combination of high lead cable and tractor yarding there was no riparian buffer trees were yarded across the stream and large wood and logging debris were cleared from the channel after clearcutting the site was broadcast burned hand planted with douglas fir and treated with herbicide table 1 in 1956 13 ha 17 of the drainage area in the headwaters of needle branch were clear cut hall and stednick 2008 therefore 100 of the watershed area was clear cut between 1956 and 1966 hence the pre treatment relationship between needle branch and flynn creek 1959 1966 reflects in part the conversion of 17 of needle branch from old forest to young plantation in 1956 at the time of the second harvest entry 2009 plantations in needle branch were aged 43 to 53 years pre commercial thinning occurred in 1981 stednick and kern 1992 during the second contemporary harvest entry the upper sub watershed 34 9 ha was clearcut harvested in 2009 and a lower section 36 8 ha was clearcut in 2014 for a total clearcut of 96 of the drainage area fig 2 both clearcuts were completed using cable and tractor equipment all trees in the cutover area were removed including along three small non fish bearing tributaries but a 15 m riparian management area was retained on each side of the fish bearing portion of the stream in accordance with the oregon forest practices act and rules odf 1994 the riparian management area contained a minimum of 3 7 m2 conifer basal area per 300 m of stream length and four to five wildlife leave trees per hectare as recommended by the oregon forest practices act adams and storm 2011

collected continuously during two periods in the historical period 1959 to 1973 15 water years data were tabulated at 2 hour intervals including seven years each of pre and post harvest data in the contemporary period 2006 to 2017 12 water years data were collected at 10 minute intervals including three to eight years of pre harvest data table 1 fig 3 the watersheds were instrumented in 1958 with compound broad crested concrete weirs located at the watershed outlets of flynn creek needle branch and deer creek harris 1977b streamflow was monitored by the usgs from 1959 to 1973 by the watershed research cooperative from 2006 to 2017 hatten et al 2018 for the contemporary record 2006 to 2017 rating curves were developed based 40 to 55 stage discharge data points collected for each watershed hatten et al 2018 the historic record was practically complete with less than 1 missing data but there were 3 15 missing data in the contemporary record table 1 fig 3 4 2 daily average streamflow effects of forest harvest were calculated following methods in jones and post 2004 and perry and jones 2017 the difference r in mean daily flow q normalized by drainage area between treated qt and reference qr watersheds was calculated for each day between 1959 and 1973 and between 2006 and 2017 1 r l n q t q r qr corresponded to the mean daily flow in flynn creek while qt was the mean daily flow from either needle branch or deer creek an r 0 represented no difference in q between a treatment and the reference while values 0 or 0 represented increases or decreases in discharge relative to the reference mean daily differences in daily flows between treated and reference watersheds r d were calculated for each day d and compared for various combinations of five pre and post

1959 1965 and 2 to compare the effects of the first and second harvest entries on water yields see supplemental material tables s2 s4 and figs s3 s6 changes in daily streamflow from the alsea watershed study were also compared to long term watershed experiments in the cascades of oregon that used the same methods of analysis jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 4 3 uncertainty to account for uncertainty in drainage area and rating curves estimated annual water yields for the historic and contemporary periods were compared assuming different combinations of estimated drainage area and rating curves supplementary material table s4 based on this analysis we opted to use the lidar derived drainage area estimates and the rating curves specific to the historic and contemporary periods method 1 in the supplementary material c we note that the alsea watershed study gauging infrastructure was not designed and constructed to provide high resolution low flow measurements but rather to capture the range of streamflow generated in these headwater watersheds however we believe that this infrastructure was sufficiently robust to detect long term changes in daily flows the supplementary material provides a comprehensive effort to confirm that these analyses are robust 5 results here we report analyses of effects on daily streamflow from 1 the historical first entry harvest in deer creek 25 patch clearcut of 110 yr forest with riparian buffers and needle branch 82 clearcut of 110 yr forest with no riparian buffer 2 40 51 yr old forest plantation growth in deer creek and 40 61 yr old forest plantation in needle branch including areas clear cut in 1956 and 1966 and 3 the contemporary harvest second entry in needle branch 96 clearcut of 43 58 yr old plantation with riparian buffer table 2 analysis of streamflow data from flynn creek reference indicated that streamflow at the long term reference site was stationary in other words there was no evidence that daily streamflow had changed over the period of record 1959 to 2017 in the reference watershed except for one day in early february when mean daily streamflow decreased by 2 p 0 038 supplementary material fig s7 while changes associated with ongoing forest succession in flynn creek such as senescence of riparian alder were observed anecdotally they did not produce detectable changes in streamflow over time at flynn creek and therefore did not appear to affect the changes quantified in this study the comparisons of daily flows are presented here in terms of percent difference in ratios of the treatment to reference flows eq 2 the changes are presented in absolute differences in unit area streamflow mm in the supplementary material b fig s2 5 1 effects of initial harvest of 110 yr old forest on daily streamflow clearcutting of 110 yr old forest in 1966 initially increased streamflow table 2 during the first seven years after clearcutting in 1966 daily streamflow increased on average by 19 in needle branch 82 clearcut and 6 in deer creek 25 patch clearcut fig 5 a table 2 on average mean daily streamflow increased significantly on 235 days of each water year 64 of the days in needle branch and 186 days of each water year 51 in deer creek during the first seven years after clearcutting the 82 clearcut harvest in needle branch primarily affected streamflow during the fall producing increases of 60 range 26 98 in daily streamflow from late september through november with smaller 14 increases in the spring may 15 to june 30 and small decreases 10 in summer july 1 to september 15 fig 5 a red line the 25 patch clearcutting of 110 yr old forest in deer creek in 1966 also primarily affected daily streamflow in the fall up to 30 increases in mid september to mid november and late spring up to 25 increases in june fig 5 a blue line 5 2 long term effects of plantations forest on daily streamflow replacement of 110 yr old conifer forest with 40 53 year old plantations decreased daily streamflow in needle branch and deer creek table 2 during 2006 2009 the period 40 43 years after 82 harvest and 50 53 years after 17 harvest and planting of douglas fir in needle branch daily streamflow was on average 25 lower than the reference watershed fig 5 b red line in contrast 40 51 years after 25 harvest and planting of douglas fir in deer creek

streamflow increased relative to the pre harvest 40 to 53 yr old forest plantation conditions but summer streamflow deficits persisted table 2 fig 5 c orange and magenta lines when compared to the second pre harvest period 2006 2009 mean daily streamflow in needle branch increased by 53 in the first five years 2010 2014 after phase i of the second harvest fig 6 magenta line these increases occurred on average during 308 days of each water year the highest increases in daily flows after phase i of the second entry 2010 2014 occurred in the late summer table 2 fig 6 magenta line also when compared to the second pre harvest period 2006 2009 mean daily streamflow increased by 41 in the first three years after phase ii of the second harvest 2015 2017 and increases occurred on average during 320 days of each water year fig 6 orange line relative increases in streamflow were greater after the harvest of the young forest plantation than after the harvest of mature old forest table 2 over the water year as a whole the second harvest did not restore streamflow to the levels produced by mature old forest in the reference watershed when compared to the initial pre harvest period 1959 1965 mean daily streamflow in needle branch was unchanged 0 change in the first five years 2010 2014 after phase i of the second harvest and it was 6 lower in the three years 2015 2017 after phase ii of the second harvest entry 2014 fig 5 c orange and magenta lines table 2 summer streamflow increased after the harvest of 43 to 53 yr old plantation forests but then quickly declined and remained lower than summer streamflow in the mature old forest reference watershed that is relative to the second pre harvest period 2006 2009 40 53 yr old plantations june 1 to september 15 streamflow increased by 76 in the first five years after phase i of the second harvest 2010 2014 and by 49 in the first three years after phase ii of the second harvest 2015 2017 fig 6 orange and magenta lines in contrast relative to the first pre treatment period 1959 1965 110 yr old forest mean daily streamflow during june 1 to september 15 decreased by 21 in the first five years 2010 2014 after phase i of the second harvest and decreased by 36 in the first three years 2015 2017 after phase ii of the second harvest fig 5 c orange and magenta lines after the second harvest streamflow from the harvested watershed was significantly lower than in the reference watershed for an average of 138 days of each water year between 2010 and 2014 and 168 days of each water year between 2015 and 2017 fig 5 c orange and magenta lines in other words the combination of 1 to 3 yr old douglas fir plantation in the lower half of needle branch 5 to 8 yr old plantation in the upper half of the watershed and 49 to 61 yr old douglas fir and red alder in the riparian buffer zone produced similar summer streamflow levels to the 40 to 53 yr old plantation table 2 5 4 comparison with other long term paired watershed studies in the region the observed 50 declines in summer streamflow from 40 to 53 yr old douglas fir plantations at needle branch relative to the mature old forest reference watershed were comparable to those detected for similar aged douglas fir plantations in the h j andrews experimental forest watershed 01 and1 and the coyote creek coyote 03 coy3 watersheds in the oregon cascades fig 7 a summer streamflow deficits were more persistent in needle branch may to december and in coy3 may to november than in and1 june to september fig 7 a the magnitude of summer streamflow deficits also was related to the proportion of watershed area in young 30 to 50 yr old plantations in several of the paired watersheds at the h j andrews coyote creek and alsea fig 7 b jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 in particular 82 100 cover of douglas fir plantations ranging from 36 to 53 years of age in needle branch and1 and coy 3 produced summer daily streamflow deficits of 30 to 51 relative to their mature and old growth forest reference watersheds in contrast 25 cover of douglas fir plantations in deer creek and and3 produced summer daily streamflow deficits of 14 21 controlling for area of mature forest converted to plantations summer streamflow deficits were smaller in the andrews forest compared to alsea and coyote fig 7 b 6 discussion the long term streamflow responses observed in the alsea watershed study along with results from other studies in the region suggest that the effects of vegetation on evapotranspiration strongly influence summer low flows however these effects may be moderated by climate variability in conjunction with other published work from the alsea watershed study these results also indicate that summer low flow deficits associated with contemporary plantation forestry using 40 to 50 yr rotations and riparian buffers may limit fish habitat these findings are discussed in detail below 6 1 vegetation effects on evapotranspiration the age species composition density and successional stage of vegetation appeared to affect evapotranspiration explaining many of the observed streamflow responses the 40 to 53 yr old forest plantations produced summer low flow deficits in needle branch because of apparently higher transpiration of young trees growing in dense plantation forest stands compared to large mature old trees growing in less dense stands shaped by centuries of disturbance and succession the greater relative increase in streamflow after the harvest of the young forest plantation compared to increases after the initial harvest of mature old forest in needle branch table 2 indicates that the evapotranspiration rates in the 40 to 53 yr old forest plantation were substantially greater than in the primarily older forest that had been harvested in 1966 similar to other studies in the region that also included historic harvesting with no riparian buffers the magnitude of summer streamflow deficits in needle branch were proportional to the area of watershed in young forest plantations fig 7 b this provides evidence indicating that the effects of forest harvesting on evapotranspiration were additive in these headwater catchments 3 km2 these findings are consistent with literature suggesting that transpiration rates decrease with age in individual trees and as a result of changes in forest structure during succession immediately after clearcutting reductions in interception and evapotranspiration generally lead to increased soil moisture and increased streamflow bowling et al 2000 harr et al 1982 keppeler and ziemer 1990 rothacher 1965 however over time vegetation regeneration can increase evapotranspiration and decrease soil moisture and summer streamflow adams et al 1991 fowler et al 1987 ingwersen 1985 pike and scherer 2003 salemi et al 2012 young fast growing densely spaced trees typically have higher rates of sapflow compared to older forest stands moore et al 2004 moore et al 2011 perry and jones 2017 which could contribute to summer streamflow deficits for example streamflow deficits declined in south african watersheds as forest plantations exceeded their rotation ages 15 yrs for eucalyptus grandis and 30 yrs for pinus radiata scott and prinsloo 2008 similarly stem density stomatal conductance and photosynthesis decreased in 70 100 yr old compared to 20 40 yr old loblolly pine stands drake et al 2011 indicating that tree physiological changes during later stages of forest succession may decrease summer evapotranspiration and may increase summer streamflow in mature old forests summer streamflow deficits under 40 to 53 yr old plantations at needle branch alsea were comparable in magnitude to those reported from similar aged douglas fir plantations in other paired watersheds in oregon andrews forest coyote creek jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 indicating that douglas fir plantations of similar age have similar evapotranspiration rates relative to the mature old and old growth forest reference stands in each of these three locations contemporary forest practices clearcut harvest of 43 to 53 yr old plantations with a riparian buffer at alsea did not restore summer low flows to levels produced by mature old forest forest harvesting with riparian buffers in the upper half of needle branch in 2009 increased summer low flows relative to the pre harvest plantation but these flows were still lower than those in the reference mature old forest this response implies relatively high evapotranspiration by the remaining 44 to 58 yr old douglas fir plantations in the lower half of the watershed and the trees in the riparian buffer zone in the upper watershed compared to the mature old forest in the reference watershed surprisingly after the remainder of needle branch was clearcut with a riparian buffer in 2014 summer streamflow deficits intensified and approached those under the former 40 to 53 yr old plantations this response implies high evapotranspiration from the upper part of the watershed with 6 to 8 yr old douglas fir and from residual trees in the riparian buffer zone suggesting that this vegetation can exert a disproportionate effect on low streamflow bond et al 2002 while representing only a few percent of watershed area 6 2 effects of climate variability on low streamflow both spatial and temporal variation in climate appeared to affect the magnitude and duration of summer low flow deficits summer streamflow deficits at alsea were of similar duration to those from coyote creek in the southern oregon cascades but lasted for more of the year than those reported from similar aged douglas fir plantations in the h j andrews forest in the central oregon cascades jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 in addition controlling for plantation area harvested summer streamflow deficits were smaller at the h j andrews forest compared to the alsea and coyote creek fig 7 b the first seven years after the initial harvest of mature old forest in needle branch in the 1960s produced much smaller increases in average daily streamflow and summer streamflow than reported for other paired watershed studies in oregon new hampshire and north carolina jones and post 2004 perry and jones 2017 these differences may be explained in part by potentially high evapotranspiration demand from the re growing vegetation in the 13 ha that were clear cut in needle branch in 1956 cooler winter temperatures and the presence of snowpack at the andrews forest seasonal snowpack and deciduous forests at hubbard brook in new hampshire and deciduous forests at coweeta in north carolina jones and post 2004 all of these factors may limit the period of summer deficits in these sites compared to locations with less snow warmer winter temperature and evergreen forest such as the alsea or coyote study sites temporal variation in climate also may have influenced the magnitude and duration of summer streamflow deficits in needle branch after the second harvest 2010 2017 summer streamflow deficits intensified unexpectedly after phase ii of logging during the second harvest at needle branch 2015 2017 summer conditions were hotter and drier in phase ii 2015 2017 compared to phase i 2010 2013 see study site description controlling for plantation age summer low flow deficits were greater under plantations relative to reference old growth forest during hotter drier years when summer streamflow was relatively low perry and jones 2017 streamflow responses to clearcutting of old growth and establishment of douglas fir plantations andrews and1 and and2 varied significantly between dry and wet periods burt et al 2015 the hotter drier conditions in 2015 to 2017 may have intensified evapotranspiration in the remaining vegetation overwhelming any increases in moisture after logging of the lower watershed in needle branch 6 3 implications for water quality and fish habitat persistent deficits in summer low flows related to plantation forestry have the potential to impact water quality and aquatic ecosystem health for example maximum daily stream temperatures in needle branch rose by 7 15 c in the first two years after clearcutting of mature old forest removal of riparian vegetation and instream wood and burning of slash in the 1960s brown and krygier 1970 these stream temperature increases occurred despite an increase in streamflow and are similar to increases reported elsewhere e g johnson and jones 2000 in contrast the second harvest in 2009 of 43 to 53 yr old plantation had little effect on stream temperature bladon et al 2016 the lack of a stream temperature response to the second harvest is likely related to the riparian buffer i e mean canopy closure over the stream was 96 before the harvest and 89 after the harvest the relative post harvest increase in daily streamflow we reported in this study 50 180 and the groundwater and hyporheic sources of summer streamflow in the watershed hale and mcdonnell 2016 salmonid fish biomass in needle branch appeared to have recovered to the pre treatment 1959 1965 levels prior to the second entry and late summer total biomass of coastal cutthroat trout increased after harvest of the 43 to 53 yr old plantation bateman et al 2018 the reported 76 relative increases in summer streamflow between 2010 and 2014 and associated increases in stream perennial extent and available habitat following the second harvest may partially explain the increase in fish biomass after the second entry phase i however it remains uncertain why fish biomass recovered to original levels when streamflow was reduced under the 40 to 53 yr old forest stand some models suggest a 25 50 reduction in fish habitat availability as a result of decreased summer low flow associated with regenerating young stands gronsdahl et al 2019 research at the alsea watersheds and elsewhere should continue to monitor fish response to changing forest and stream conditions 7 conclusion streamflow from a 40 to 53 yr old douglas fir plantation in the alsea watershed in the coast range of oregon was 25 lower on average and 50 lower during the summer june 1 to september 15 relative to the reference watershed containing mature old forest these low flow deficits were similar in magnitude to those observed under similar aged douglas fir plantations in the cascade range of oregon high evapotranspiration rates from douglas fir plantations appeared to explain deficits from 40 to 50 yr old forest plantations surprisingly contemporary forest practices i e clearcut of 43 to 53 yr old and 48 to 58 yr old plantations with riparian buffers had only a minor effect on the streamflow deficits and by a few years after logging summer streamflow deficits were similar to those observed under 40 to 53 yr old plantations high evapotranspiration from rapidly regenerating vegetation including planted douglas fir and from the residual forest in the riparian buffer appeared to explain the persistence of streamflow deficits despite nearly 100 clearcutting of the watershed low streamflow deficits also were greater during warmer drier years results of this study indicate that contemporary forestry harvesting practices including 40 to 50 yr rotations of douglas fir plantations with riparian buffers may produce persistent low flow deficits short term amelioration of these deficits after logging may partially explain observed increases in fish biomass in needle branch however it remains uncertain why fish biomass appeared to have recovered in the 40 to 53 yr old forest stand to levels observed in 1958 1973 further work is needed to examine how intensively managed plantation forests and expected warmer drier future conditions may influence

5533,dealing with institutional settings involving multiple stakeholders is essential for improving the applicability of reservoir operation optimization models however a centralized decision maker cdm is conventionally assumed to represent multiple players with perfect cooperation and information exchange for modeling the decision making process with hierarchical structure and non cooperative interactions in real problems in this paper we define the deviation of operation performance between the assumed centralized and the practical hierarchical decision making procedures as an institutional gap ig to further derive the causes of the ig and evaluate the influence of the cdm s preference on the ig a comparative analysis between bilevel programming and multi objective programming mop is conducted for the reservoir pre impoundment problem rpp compared to optimizing two conflicting objectives in mop our proposed bilevel optimization framework models the flood control rule maker and reservoir refill rule maker as minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the hydropower production benefit respectively with a hierarchical institutional structure our case study of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china indicates that the centralized optimization model without considering the hierarchical interaction between flood control and reservoir refill decision makers would lead to an ig in terms of underestimation of flood risk we further find that the magnitude of the ig is highly related to the selection of the cdm s preference and the largest ig is obtained when the flood control or hydropower generation objective is solely considered particularly we specify the range of preference setting which results in the domination of centralized model solutions as compared to the bilevel solution although the solutions within this range are not realistic for practical operation our findings provide an insight into the cause of the ig as well as the effects of preference on the ig facilitating future improvement of institutional structure design and preference setting for practical reservoir operation optimizations keywords reservoir operation optimization reservoir pre impoundment problem rpp bilevel programming multi objective programming mop institutional gap ig 1 introduction despite intensive research efforts in optimization modeling of reservoir operation problems and the utilization of powerful modern computers it is well recognized that a continuing gap exists between literature and practices cai et al 2018 choong and el shafie 2014 horne et al 2016 labadie 2004 simonović 1992 wurbs 1993 yeh 1985 including in the field of flood water conservation such as reservoir impounding during the post flood season and refill periods in china for instance 97 988 reservoirs have been built by 2015 nbsc n d but only 56 have been recorded as applying multistage flood limited water levels flwls creei and dut 2014 although numerous studies have been conducted on dynamic control of flwl dc flwl hence a thorough understanding of the mechanism behind this gap would improve the applicability of optimization model as well as the efficiency of reservoir system operations reducing or eliminating the gap is not trivial because of the complex dynamic nonlinear uncertain multidisciplinary and multi agent characteristics of reservoir operation problems giuliani et al 2016 mendes et al 2015 noël and cai 2017 zeng et al 2019 previous studies have pointed out three main factors that would result in the gap 1 human subjective factor or the reluctance of practitioners to adopt more advanced and complicated models in current reservoir operating systems cai et al 2015 labadie and sullivan 1986 yeh and becker 1982 2 technical factor basically associated with three challenges including understanding of flood seasonality chen et al 2015 hall and bloeschl 2018 ye et al 2017 hydrologic non stationarity yan et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 and imperfect information for real time meteorological and hydrology forecast toth et al 2000 wanders et al 2014 and 3 institutional factor which is the inconsistency of conventional optimization models with institutional settings in practical reservoir operations adigüzel and coşkunoğlu 1984 booker et al 2005 doyle and patterson 2019 marston and cai 2016 suggestions to overcome these hindrances have included construction of more capable water infrastructure and facilities improvement of computer hardware and software technologies and encouragement of reservoir operators to participate in model development cai et al 2015 fotovatikhah et al 2018 horne et al 2016 in addition there is a need for an effective framework capable of addressing institutional features booker et al 2005 ingram et al 1984 especially for large reservoir systems with complex organizational structures in reservoir pre impoundment problem rpp studies significant improvement has been made in addressing the human subjective factor and technical factor over the past three decades the barrier of human subjective factor has been tackled by the development of decision support systems cai et al 2015 labadie 2006 for the technical obstacles numerous techniques have been developed to deal with the above mentioned three challenges research on flood sub seasons identification and joint distribution of seasonal floods liu et al 2011 has led to studies on the multistage flwl chen et al 2013 liu et al 2010 multiple duration limited water level yun and singh 2008 and dc flwl diao and wang 2011 li et al 2010 moreover progresses have been made in studies on reservoir inflow forecasting zhou and guo 2014 nonstationary reservoir inflow prediction xu et al 2015 and the probability distribution of the maximum refill water availability at the end of refill season wan et al 2016 nevertheless compared to the other two factors little attention has been paid to bridge the gap resulted from the institutional factor or the institutional gap ig as defined in our study according to the number of stakeholders involved in the decision making process reservoir operating systems can be divided into two categories single decision maker systems and multi decision maker systems centralized decision making only applies to reservoirs with one managing administrator such as single purpose reservoirs for power production or irrigation generally multi purpose reservoir systems are managed and operated by multiple stakeholders correspondingly the institutional setting of such multiple stakeholders is characterized by horizontal and hierarchical structure for multi reservoir systems reservoir operators may be horizontally organized with equal operation rights or hierarchically organized with different priority given to different stakeholders coordination of horizontally organized reservoirs could be described as co operative or non cooperative games li et al 2019 madani 2010 yu et al 2019 hierarchically for an individual reservoir with both a flood control objective and other competitive conservation demands hydropower generation water supply environment etc such as the three gorges reservoir tgr it is generally characterized by at least two managerial levels decision makers at each level have control over different decision variables to achieve different objectives particularly for rpp the flood control rule and the reservoir refill rule during the post flood season and refill period which together decide whether a reservoir can be refilled back to the normal storage water level nswl are determined with a hierarchical decision making structure the flood control rule maker at the upper level has priority over the reservoir refill rule maker but on the other side when the refill rule maker at the lower level makes decisions according to the flood control rule this will in turn have impact on the upper level objective hence the flood control rule maker needs to take into account the reactions of the reservoir refill rule maker however most previous optimization models assume just one decision maker with centralized decision right for example multi objective programming mop also known as multi criteria optimization has been widely used and developed in rpp research chen et al 2013 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 because of the assumption of cdm studies based on mop only derive the optimal reservoir refill rule with the given flood control rule on a single level in which the hierarchical interactions between flood control rule and refill rule makers are neglected such cdm based modeling could not apply to provide practical solutions for rpp since the model structure is different from the hierarchical decision making structure of the real reservoir operating system in this respect the application of bilevel programming has received increasing attention in various aspects of water resources research including water resources allocation chen et al 2017 fang et al 2013 hu et al 2016 safari et al 2014 tu et al 2015 xu et al 2013 energy water conflict resolution cheng et al 2016 shafiee jood et al 2018 xu et al 2015 zhang and vesselinov 2016 multi reservoir operation in inter basin water transfer supply projects guo et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 optimal groundwater remediation management he et al 2018 and water distribution systems planning bostian et al 2015 in some studies comparisons between the single level and bilevel model were made to evaluate the capability and efficiency of the bilevel models both from the perspectives of objective functions and solutions shafiee jood et al 2018 xu et al 2016 2013 these studies suggest that bilevel programming improves the model s capability of dealing with the hierarchical decision making process and coordinating conflicting objectives at different levels whereas single level mop optimizations might lead to deviation of the solutions from reality shafiee jood et al 2018 such as an unbalanced development for the whole society xu et al 2013 however the interactions between the decision makers at different levels i e the stackelberg nash gaming process have not been investigated in terms of ig including why there is an ig between current optimization models and practical operations in rpp how large is the ig and which factors influence the magnitude of the ig therefore the aim of this paper is to answer the above questions through comparisons of bilevel programming and mop optimization in numerical examples and the tgr case we 1 explore the causes of the ig with the consideration of hierarchical interactions between the rule makers for flood control and reservoir refill and 2 quantify the influence of preference setting on the magnitude of the ig which would substantially help improve the practicability of rpp optimization modeling and provide implications for institutional reforms the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a general definition of bilevel programming and formulates a bilevel model for rpp section 3 compares the solution deviations between the bilevel programming model and the mop optimization via illustrative numerical examples section 4 introduces a real case of the tgr in section 5 we extend the comparative analysis between the bilevel and centralized optimization model to the tgr case and obtain further practical implications concerning the causes and influential factors of the ig finally section 6 provides the conclusion 2 methodology 2 1 overview of bilevel programming as a special class of optimization model the bilevel programming model was originally developed for dealing with hierarchical decision making structure with two non cooperative decision makers bard 2010 candler and norton 1977 von stackelberg 1952 it has been widely applied in various areas such as transportation brotcorne et al 2000 migdalas 1995 network facility distribution sun et al 2008 environmental economics sinha et al 2014 sinha et al 2013 and supply chain management jalil et al 2019 witt 2019 generally two decision makers are involved in the bilevel model i e the leader at the upper level and the follower at the lower level each could control a different set of variables to optimize their own objective functions by following a sequential decision process which is the main difference from the conventional model with only a cdm optimizing all objectives within the framework of this hierarchical structure the leaders would make decisions to optimize their own objectives taking into account perfect information about the reactions of the followers and then the followers would react to set the optimal values of their controlled variables under the given values of the upper level variables bard 2010 calvete et al 2011 therefore the lower level model could be considered as nested constraints of the upper level model which implicitly determines the feasible region of the bilevel optimization mathematically a bilevel programming model is expressed as 1 min x f x y s t g x y 0 y arg min y f x y s t g x y 0 where f is the objective function of the upper level model x is the set of decision variables of the leader g is the set of constraints of the upper level model f is the objective function of the lower level model y is the set of decision variables of the follower g is the set of constraints of the lower level model based on the above description some basic definitions are given as follows which will be further used to uncover the causes of the ig in the following sections 1 constraint domain i e the values of x and y that satisfy all constraints 2 s x y g x y 0 g x y 0 2 constraint set of the lower level for given x x x g x y 0 3 y x y g x y 0 3 rational reaction set of the lower level to given x x x g x y 0 4 ψ x arg min y f x y y y x 4 inducive region or feasible region of the bilevel problem consisting of the intersection of the constraints domain and rational reaction set 5 ir x y x y s y ψ x generally the solutions for the bilevel programming model should be feasible in the first place that is the optimal solution is restricted to the inducive region as defined in eq 5 the feasible solution x y would be optimal when it achieves the minimum value of the upper level objective i e f x y f x y holds for all feasible solutions x y in ir 2 2 bilevel programming model for rpp according to the chinese institutional setting flood control and water conservation are controlled by separate departments csc 2018 mwr 2012 since most reservoirs serve both flood control and water conservation purposes the flood control department and water conservation department are formulated with a hierarchical structure and make decisions in sequence for reservoir operation rule settings during the flood season when flood control is the primary concern csc 2018 as shown in fig 1 due to the high importance of the dam and downstream security the department taking responsibility for flood control is typically set as the leader while the department seeking water conservation benefits such as the corporation for hydropower generation is set as the follower correspondingly the flood control department would determine the flood control rules including the controlled water levels and the corresponding controlled levels of reservoir discharge to reduce the flood risk with the consideration of the reaction of the water conservation department the water conservation department then determines the refill rule curve i e the targeted storage level of reservoir impoundment to maximize the benefits of water conservation such as power generation both the leader and follower are constrained by the following physical constraints water balance reservoir storage volumes basic flood control security reservoir release minimal and maximal power output maximum variation of the daily water level etc as far as rpp is concerned considering the interaction between the flood control and water conservation departments is essential to balance the trade off between flood risk and water conservation benefit during the process of reservoir impoundment especially for the post flood season ding et al 2017 concerning the possible incidence of large floods at post flood periods flood risk and water conservation benefits would be both increased if the controlled water levels are set too high or the reservoir impounds too fast conversely if the controlled water levels are set too low or the impoundment starts late and progresses slowly flood risk would be decreased but water or hydropower energy shortage might occur because subsequent inflows might be insufficient to satisfy water and energy demands in the following non flood season a bilevel programming model is developed to simulate the hierarchical interaction between the flood control department and water conservation department optimizing their conflicting interests fig 2 a depicts the modeling structure on the basis of hierarchical decision making mechanism the upper and lower level objectives decision variables and constraints of this model are further described in the following 2 2 1 upper level model for flood control operation the flood control department generally focuses on minimizing the flood risk the lowest flood risk would be achieved by emptying the storage for flood control during the whole flood season and starting the reservoir refill thereafter but this might not adapt to the increasing water demand in this regard we minimize the potential flood risk as the upper level objective in the bilevel programming model the potential flood risk is defined as the difference of the flood peak water level a typically used indicator in flood risk assessment lewis et al 2011 robson et al 1998 xu et al 2020 between the proposed optimal reservoir operations and the operation which preserves all reservoir storage for flood control in the whole flood season this difference is calculated with three scenarios of small medium and large floods in the post flood season which are represented by the seasonal design inflows with 20 year 100 year and 1000 year return period respectively thus the potential flood risk is calculated with the weighting method as follows 6 min f p r f w 1 δ p e a k s w 2 δ p e a k m w 3 δ p e a k l 7 δ p e a k z opt peak z 0 peak z 0 peak 100 where δ p e a k s δ p e a k m and δ p e a k l are the differences of flood peak water level under the small medium and large seasonal design flows respectively z opt peak is the flood peak water level under the proposed rule optimized by the bilevel model and z 0 peak is the flood peak water level under the operation rule which preserves all reservoir storage for flood control throughout the flood season w 1 w 2 and w 3 are weighting factors for the three flood scenarios as the decision variables of the upper level this study optimizes the flood control rules which consist of the controlled water levels and the corresponding controlled levels of reservoir discharge the controlled water levels include flwls and cfwls i e the compensating flood control water levels lying between the flwl and the nswl cfwls are used to divide part of the reservoir storage to support flood control in the downstream site which is relatively far from the reservoir and has local inflows when the reservoir storage lies below the cfwl the discharge should be controlled at a safe level in order to reduce the flood risk at the downstream site different from the traditional method of preserving fixed reservoir storage for flood control our bilevel model is optimizing a set of multistage controlled water levels and the corresponding controlled discharges the upper level decision variable is given as x x 1 x 2 x i where x i z i q i represents the flwls cfwls and the corresponding controlled discharges applied in the i th ten days during the post flood period as the constraints of the upper level model the flwls and cfwls should lie between the dead water level dwl and nswl of the reservoir 8 dwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 z i x i nswl furthermore the reservoir operation under the given flood control rules should conform to the following constraints 1 water balance equation 9 v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t where δ t is the operational time step v i j and v i j 1 are the reservoir storage volume at the beginning and end of a day q in i j and q out i j are the reservoir in and outflow on j th day of the i th year among which q out i j would be determined based on current storage v i j of the reservoir and the inflow q in i j according to both the flood control rule x z q and the refill rule curve y our case study in section 4 provides further details on how determination of the reservoir release is regulated by the operation rules 2 reservoir storage volumes limits 10 v min v i j v max where v min is the minimum reservoir storage volume and v max is the maximum storage volume 3 basic flood control security 11 r f 0 where r f represents the probability of the reservoir water level exceeding the highest

z and δ z are daily decrease and increase of the storage level respectively δ z max and δ z max represent the maximum allowable daily decrease and increase of the storage level respectively 2 2 2 lower level model for water conservation operation the lower level decision maker i e the water conservation department could operate the reservoir with multiple purposes in this study we mainly focus on hydropower generation during the refill period and the non flood season for evaluation we apply the optimized rules with long series of historical daily inflow data to simulate reservoir operation processes and calculate the annual average plant output e avg the lower level objective function is defined as 16 min f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j where k is the hydropower output coefficient q i j is the outflow and h i j is the water head of the reservoir on the j th day of the i th year n is the number of years and m is the number of time steps days during the operational horizon corresponding to the minimizing objectives at the upper level model we minimize the negative e avg which is equivalent to maximizing power production in addition we propose pre impoundment of the reservoir and advance the start date to the later period of the flood season to simplify the computation burden the refill rule curve is controlled by several variables between the flwl and nswl with a five day time step y y 1 y 2 y i where y i represents the targeted storage level for impoundment at the end of the i th five days during the refill period in practice the refill rule curve is suggested to rise with time ranging from the flwl to nswl of the reservoir 17 flwl y 1 y 2 y i nswl note that the constraints presented in eqs 9 15 are also applicable for the lower level model 2 2 3

q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max to solve this model a simulation based optimization framework on the basis of particle swarm optimization algorithm pso is proposed in this study intelligent algorithms such as genetic algorithms ga yin 2000 neural networks bp hu et al 2010 lv et al 2008 and pso guo et al 2012 jiang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 2012 provide applicable tools for np hard and non convex bilevel programming problems among these methods pso has been shown to provide optimal or suboptimal solutions jiang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 2012 the procedure of the proposed solution framework is given in fig 3 the basic principle of the framework is to apply pso iteratively to approximate the optimal solution for both the upper and lower levels while the simulation model of reservoir operation is embedded to evaluate the performance of proposed schemes 2 3 evaluation of ig we define a new index ig to quantify the deviation of the optimal performances of flood risk and hydropower generation between the bilevel model and the related mop model see fig 2b particularly the pareto optimal solutions of the mop model is derived by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 ig is defined as 19 ig δ f i δ f i f f i par f f i par where f and f are the upper and lower level objective value of the bilevel solution respectively f i par and f i par are the upper and lower level objective value of i th solution point on the pareto front of the mop model while using the mop method to optimize reservoir operation problems a pre defined preference of the cdm is needed to make the final choice among all non dominated solutions hence the choice of i th solution point is dependent on the preference setting for the potential flood risk and power generation ig is expected to better reflect the interactive relationship between two levels under different preference settings the one dimensional index proposed by shafiee jood et al 2018 is a special case of equation 19 which only compares the value of the lower level objective when given specified upper level decisions further although the bilevel model in this study only involves one objective at each level the index of ig can be extended to deal with multi objective hierarchical optimization problems more specifically we measure the preference setting in this study by defining the weight ratio between two objectives which is based on the relative weighting factor of solution points on the pareto front the weight ratio w r i of i th point is calculated as 20 w r i 1 f i norm 1 f i norm where f i norm and f i norm are the normalized values of potential flood risk and power production of i th solution point on the pareto front 3 illustrative example for the causes of ig in this section we employ a simplified optimization problem with two nonlinear and non cooperative objectives amouzegar 1999 to illustrate the effects of hierarchical and centralized decision making structure on the causes of the ig since the bilevel programming model is formulated with the same hierarchical decision making structure the analysis for this problem can then be further extended to uncover the causes of the ig for more complex optimization problems as well as the proposed bilevel model for rpp the testing bilevel programming problem is given as example 1 to represent the hierarchical decision making process in operation practice for comparison the related mop model or bicriteria model example 2 represents the centralized optimization model in research literature example 1 bilevel programming problem 22 min x f x y x 5 2 2 y 1 2 s t y arg min y f x y y 1 2 1 5 x y 3 x y 3 x 0 5 y 4 x y 7 x 0 y 0 example 2 bicriteria

fig 4 a which verifies the existence of the ig further it can be seen that there are two patterns of ig point a which denotes the optimal objective values of the bilevel programming model is dominated by any point on the pareto front within the yellow shaded area while point a is non dominated by any point on the pareto front out of this area for example point b dominates point a with both smaller f value and f value i e the ig between point b and a is i g b δ f b δ f b 7 75 7 75 meanwhile point c with smaller f value and larger f value does not dominate point a i e the ig between point c and a is i g c δ f c δ f c 8 15 note that point b and c represent different preferences toward two objectives choosing the solution of b means giving more preference to f while the choice of c means giving more preference to f the influence of preference setting on the igs will be further discussed in section 5 to explore the causes of the ig we depict the solution space of example 1 and 2 in fig 4b the green shaded area s is the constraint domain of the problems the inducive region of the upper level model is drawn as the dashed black line denoted by ir in the figure and the pareto front is plotted as the dark blue line denoted by e according to the definition ir is the set of candidate points x y x within s by which y x is the optimized lower level variable according to x this implies that the leaders could only optimize their objectives through the inducive region determined by the decisions of the followers in contrast the solutions of the bicriteria problem are found by selecting the ones with non dominated f f values among all couples of x y over s therefore the solution space is different between two models part of e overlaps with ir which divides the pareto front into two segments some points in e such as point b dominate point a but do not lie the inducive region are thus not feasible solutions for hierarchical optimization model some other points such as point c lie in the overlapping area of e and ir but would not be considered as an optimal solution of the bilevel programming because of an inferior upper level objective value compared to point a it is worth noting that the decision makers of two levels might cooperate or have consistent interests and the optimal solution to the bilevel model would lie on the pareto front amouzegar 1999 sinha et al 2014 however evidence suggests that a bilevel programming model with such an optimality condition is not applicable for most reservoir operations to maintain the generality of model formulation we mainly pay attention to the cases of hierarchical decision making with players who have conflicting goals and behave uncooperatively corresponding to real reservoir operations in practice bard 1983 4 case study 4 1 overview of the tgr impoundment problem the three gorges reservoir tgr the world s largest multi purpose hydro junction is a key project in the water resources management of the yangtze river fig 5 with a flood storage capacity of 22 15 billion m3 the tgr can effectively control floods coming from the upstream of the yangtze river which significantly reduces the flood risk downstream in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where the most populous and economically developed plain area of china is located in particular it has been practically proved to strengthen watershed protection for the jingjiang river reach and the dongting lake areas which suffered from frequent and disastrous flood damages in the past nakayama and shankman 2013 xia et al 2016 as the second most important objective the tgr has a firm output of 4990 mw with a total 18200 mw of installed hydropower capacity up to 2018 the annual generated power of the tgr has exceeded 100 billion kilowatt hours generally a hydrological year is divided into two operation periods for the tgr cwrc 2012 flood season from mid june to late september non flood season which includes the refill period october and the water drawdown period from november to 9th june in the next year according to its original design the tgr operation focuses on flood control throughout the flood season and maintains the water level at its flwl of 145 m till the end of september only when october begins the reservoir would be gradually refilled up to the nswl of 175 m this operation principle implies that for a full storage more than 8000 m3 s discharge should be retained daily in october however with significant decrease of the inflow of the tgr in the last two decades the original scheme of such intensive impoundment risks intensifying the water use conflict in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and makes it difficult to achieve the full storage in most years zheng 2016 in 2008 for example after the tgr started refilling on 28th september the impounding progress was hindered in october because drought occurred in the xiangjiang river area and the tgr had to increase its release to alleviate the water shortage in the lower reaches as a result the water level of tgr only arrived at 172 6 m till the end of refilling on 6th november which was about 2 5 m below the nswl it is thus necessary to improve the original tgr operation rules for an effective reservoir impoundment in this context numerous studies have been conducted on optimization of the tgr operation scheme with pre impoundment during post flood periods li et al 2010 2014 liu et al 2010 2011 zhou et al 2015 in practice the tgr has gone into the era of experimental pre impoundment since 2010 nevertheless studies so far rarely consider the hierarchical structure of decision making and most of the models are based on the mop framework therefore there is still a gap between the research results and practical operation schemes for the tgr pre impoundment for instance researchers proposed that reservoir refilling should start from 1st september and the storage level should reach 160 m by 30th september but for the past five years the tgr started refilling on 10th september and the storage level normally ranged from 162 m to 165 m on 30th september 4 2 hierarchical structure of reservoir operation early refilling of the tgr involves two decision makers formulated as the leader follower relationship as the leader the general commands of flood control and drought relief of china and of the yangtze river regarded as a single entity in our study the gcfd set flood control standards and determine flood control rules so as to reduce the potential flood risk of the tgr dam and the downstream areas as the follower the china three gorges corporation ctgc directly makes plans for power generation and reservoir impoundment the ctgc also needs to coordinate the interests of other departments such as the changjiang waterway bureau and china s state grid for simplification our bilevel modeling of the tgr operation mainly focuses on the interaction between the gcfd and ctgc 4 3 flood control and refill rules for optimization the originally designed operation rule of the tgr would preserve all reservoir storage above the fixed flwl for flood control at the jingjiang river reach jingjiang compensating flood control which is described as follows cwrc 1997 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at the flwl of 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level is above 145 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station should not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is between 100 year and 1000 year in 2009 the ministry of water resources of china revised the tgr operation rule so as to divide part of the reservoir storage for flood control compensation at the chenglingji hydrological station to help reduce the flood threat confronting the dongting lake area chenglingji compensating flood control mwr 2009 the division curve of this part of storage i e the cfwl is currently set at 155 m leaving 5 65 billion m3 storage for flood capacity compensation accordingly the operation rule of the tgr has been revised as follows 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level ranges between 145 m and 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the chenglingji hydrological station does not exceed 34 4 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is less than or equal to 100 year 3 when the water level is above 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station does not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is between 100 year and 1000 year for the tgr operations there is increasing need for regulating smaller inflows and reducing the flood risk of the lower reach during the post flood period so in this study we mainly seek to improve the current fixed cfwl by optimizing a set of multistage cfwls as the decision variable of the gcfd which is represented by a set of three lines in the first middle and last ten days of september i e x x 1 x 2 x 3 the optimization of the corresponding controlled discharges is not included according to operation experiences and findings of related studies li et al 2014 mwr 2009 zheng 2016 the tgr s controlled discharge for the jingjiang compensating flood control and chenglingji compensating flood control are proposed as 55000 m3 s and 42000 m3 s respectively originally the tgr refilling is organized as follows after the flood season ends the reservoir storage is gradually refilled from the flwl of 145 m up to the nswl of 175 m in october a refill rule curve will guide the progress of impoundment as stated in the tgr operation rules enacted by the changjiang water resources commission in 2012 the refilling starts on 10th september and the storage level can rise to 165 m by the end of september cwrc 2012 during the early refilling in the post flood season the operation of the tgr should switch from impoundment to flood control when there are incoming floods in near future in this study we further advance the start date of impoundment to 1st september so as to verify the effectiveness of an earlier pre impoundment strategy meanwhile we seek to improve the conventional linear impounding progress by optimizing the decision variable of the water conservation department as the refill rule curve which is discretized into 11 control points between 145 m and 175 m with a five day time step i e y y 1 y 2 y 11 to evaluate the performance of the optimized operation scheme we employ the following two schemes for comparison 1 the tgr original operation rule with jingjiang compensating flood control and without early refilling denoted as ord and 2 the tgr operation rule adopted in 2012 which applies the cfwl of 155 m for chenglingji compensating flood control and pre impoundment starting on 10th september denoted as eic 4 4 data input 4 4 1 long series of historical runoff the simulation and calculation of our case study is based on the 131 year from 1882 to 2012 historical daily inflow series of the tgr 4 4 2 design flows of the tgr post flood season as part of calculation of the potential flood risk we select 1952 and 1964 as typical years to derive seasonal design flow hydrographs using peak and volume amplitude method extreme flood situation occurred during the post flood season in both typical years while the seasonal flood in 1952 is characterized as multi peak type and the flood in 1964 is of single peak type and the peak is closer to the end of the flood season li et al 2010 4 4 3 setting of boundary values the minimum water discharge limit q min is 10 000 m3 s and 8000 m3 s for the tgr in september and october respectively the maximum allowable daily increase of the storage level δ z max for impoundment of the tgr is 3 m the daily decrease of the reservoir storage δ z max should not exceed 2 m during floods and 0 6 m in the non flood season these settings are mainly serving the demands for navigation and ecological water use downstream and bank stability 5 results and discussion 5 1 operation scheme according to the bilevel framework the operation scheme optimized by the proposed bilevel framework has achieved better performances in terms of utilization of flood water in comparison with the performances under the operation rules of ord and eic the mean annual usage rate of the tgr flood control capacity during september and october is lifted up to 68 6 which is 137 times that of ord 0 5 and 11 more than that of eic 61 8 as the results of the reservoir discharge intervals in different scenarios shows table 1 the optimized operation scheme enhances the control of the discharge for reducing the flood risk at the chenglingji hydrologic station for the lower level model the full storage rate at the end of refill period is significantly increased from 79 4 of ord and 92 4 or eic to 96 2 and the annual average ending water level at october is raised up to 174 9 m hence the tgr generates more hydropower the annual average power generation of the tgr from 1st september to 9th june before the beginning of the flood season in the next hydrological year is 63 1 billion kwh which is 3 0 and 1 2 billion kwh more than that of the ord and eic respectively table 2 compares the power generation in september and the later non flood season as expected the ord leads to the highest portion of power production in september but performs poorly in the non flood season in contrast the proposed optimal operation scheme and the eic with pre impoundment both illustrate the advantage of power generation during the non flood season meanwhile the tgr potential flood risk increases to 0 13 including 0 08 for 20 year 0 042 for 100 year and 0 008 for 1000 year flood scenarios comparing to the value of 0 and 0 002 in the case of ord and eic as the results of the flood peak water level intervals show table 3 the optimized operation scheme would maintain the reservoir at a relatively high storage level during post flood periods nevertheless the basic flood control security see eq 11 is still guaranteed with a possibility of exceeding the highest safe water level in front of dam as zero just as in the other two schemes with the design flow used fig 6 shows the tgr flood control rule and refill rule curve optimized by the proposed bilevel model the operation rules of ord and eic are also plotted for comparison the three cfwl lines i e the upper decision variable x are 156 2 m 158 2 m and 163 8 m this result indicates that 6 4 billion m3 7 8 billion m3 and 12 0 billion m3 reservoir storage can be used for flood control for chenglingji hydrological station in the first middle and last ten days of september respectively compared to the current cfwl of 155 m the storage for chenglingji compensating flood control is increased by 0 7 billion m3 2 1 billion m3 and 6 3 billion m3respectively accordingly the flood storage capacity preserved for the jingjiang river reach is reduced the optimized refill rule curve y suggests a more active pre impoundment strategy for the tgr than that of eic for it advances the trigger of impoundment to 1st september and allows the water level to arrive at 166 3 m on 30th september as compared to the 165 m in eic it is worth mentioning that during most of september the refill rule curve lies below the cfwl lines which implies a trade off between flood control and impoundment during the post flood season after the flood season the water level is lifted up within a shorter time and almost reaches full storage of the reservoir before mid october in general the impounding under our optimized scheme is more active than that of eic in terms of higher water head and more power generation in both september and the non flood season because the optimized operation scheme tends to retain more runoff under the medium and small flood scenarios the potential flood risk is increased with the reduced flood control capacity 5 2 why is there an ig fig 7 shows the bilevel feasible solutions in pink points which are derived from the blue points on the pareto front that is the water conservation department optimizes the refill rule curve given the flood control rule i e cfwls specified in the cdm model among seven sample operation scheme points m j d b e k and n the points m and n represent the two special cases for which the cdm only focuses on minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the power generation respectively it is clearly shown that all the operation schemes on the pareto front are not feasible in bilevel programming and the bilevel feasible solutions in pink points produce more power generation but higher potential flood risk than the corresponding pareto optimal solutions there are two main reasons that pareto optimal schemes cannot apply to the tgr impoundment which are given as below first of all the operation schemes on the pareto front of mop optimization are not feasible in bilevel decision making even if they are more efficient for both objectives for example as shown in fig 7 point b has the objective values f 0 12 and f 63 2 and its corresponding decision variables for flood control rule and refill control curve are x 156 8 157 9 164 2 and y 153 4 156 5 161 2 162 7 163 2 164 7 170 0 173 5 174 9 174 9 174 9 respectively the upper level decision maker i e the gcfd sets the cfwl lines of the tgr as x x at first then the ctgc on the lower level would optimize the refill rule curve according to the pre specified flood control rules x x with the only concern of maximizing the power generation the ctgc would seek to fill up the storage as fast as possible and the refill rule curve is optimized as y 149 6 155 3 161 0 164 2 166 2 171 2 172 4 173 9 174 4 175 0 175 0 given the specified flood control rules x y is optimal from the perspective of the ctgc and thus y is not a bilevel feasible solution the refill rule curve y and its corresponding y are shown in fig 8 b and the objective values become f 0 19 and f 63 4 point c in fig 7 given the flood control rule optimized by the centralized model it can be observed in fig 8b that the refill rule curve lies below the one derived from the bilevel model especially during the post flood season furthermore it can be seen in fig 7 that the pink points are densely scattered over the right lower region above the blue points of the pareto front which indicates that a higher potential flood risk would be resulted from the transition from the optimal operation schemes of the cdm model to that of the bilevel model point c for example is not as efficient as point b and would not be considered as an optimal solution of the bilevel model with the potential flood risk higher than f the actual potential flood risk of 0 19 for the operation scheme at point c is underestimated to the level of 0 12 at point b in this respect about 0 3 percent increase in power generation at point c may hardly be acceptable due to increase of 0 07 in potential flood risk this underestimation of potential flood risk of the mop model or the infeasible optimality of solutions is the consequence of neglecting the autonomy of the ctgc on the refill rule decision making process since the ctgc makes its decision after the gcfd its decision on the refill rule curve could have impact on the optimal realization of the gcfd s objective in flood control the gcfd thus has to take into account the reactions of the ctgc for setting the flood control rule however the mop optimization does not consider such a non cooperative interaction in decision making similarly we test other points on the pareto front and as fig 7 shows the feasible solutions in bilevel optimization either have poor performance for the flood control objective such as point c green shaded area i or poor performance for both the upper and lower level objectives red shaded area ii no point could produce better performance for both objectives compared to point a that is a hierarchical decision making problem would not achieve the efficiency of a bi criteria model where the non cooperative interactions between the two levels is taken into account actually if we draw an envelope curve of these newly accessed points we can obtain another front above the original pareto front implying that the feasible region of bilevel programming is more restrained than the solution space of mop optimization 5 3 how large is the ig and what is the influence of cdm s preference on this gap the preference of the cdm has impact on the magnitude of the gap in terms of the potential flood risk and power generation as fig 9 shows in segment m d the underestimation of the mop model in both objectives increases as the cdm pays more attention to flood control for example the potential flood risk and the amount of power generation at point j are underestimated with 0 07 and 0 4 billion kwh respectively i e i g j δ f j δ f j 0 07 0 4 meanwhile the largest underestimation of the potential flood risk is 0 13 at point m where the cdm controls all operation rules setting and ignores the interaction between the ctgc and gcfd for determining the refill rule comparatively in segment n e the overestimation in the objectives of potential flood risk and power generation increases as the cdm pays more attention to power generation taking point k for example the magnitude of overestimation amounts to 0 08 and 0 5 billion kwh respectively i e i g k δ f k δ f k 0 08 0 5 the largest overestimation of power generation is 0 7 billion kwh at point n where the cdm controls all impounding decisions and does not consider the prevailing role and interests of the gcfd in flood control rule setting it is interesting to see that there are two threshold points e and d at which one dimension of the ig namely the gap of potential flood risk or power generation respectively does not exist i e δ f e 0 δ f d 0 in fig 9 the points on the right side of point e have a larger weight for the flood control objective and the points on the left side of point e have a larger weight for the power generation objective the curve in fig 9a is separated by point e into the pink m e segment and the blue n e segment corresponding to underestimated and overestimated potential flood risk respectively similarly point d divides the curve in fig 9b into two segments where underestimation and overestimation of power production occurs respectively fig 9c shows that there are two kinds of gap patterns the pareto optimal operation schemes as related to segment d e are more efficient than the scheme derived from the bilevel model for they result in underestimated potential flood risk and overestimated power generation i e positive values of the ig in two dimensions at the same time the ig is relatively small in both dimensions when the preference is set within this range the second category of the pareto optimal operation schemes the ig of which falls out of the segment d e is non dominated as compared to the bilevel optimal scheme these schemes either result in underestimated potential flood risk and power generation segment m d or overestimated potential flood risk and power generation segment n e these results suggest that it is only when the cdm s preference for flood control or water conservation is within a certain range the operation scheme optimized by the bilevel framework is dominated by the operation scheme of the centralized model in addition we analyze the relationship between the ig for potential flood risk and power generation and the preference toward two objectives which is quantified by the weight ratio wr as defined in equation 20 as illustrated in fig 10 δ f and δ f first decrease as wr increases when the wr is close to 1 at the threshold points e and d which implies equal preference setting the smallest δ f i and δ f i are derived respectively then δ f and δ f rise up again with the increase of wr this suggests that for our case problem when there is preference inequality between flood control and power generation the gap between mop solutions and the practical solution obtained by bilevel programming can be even larger it is shown in fig 8 that neglecting the interactions between the ctgc and gcfd would influence the discrepancy in the optimized control variables in general a more conservative and slower impounding progress for smaller potential flood risk can be expected as indicated by the blue lines below the pink dashed line where blue and pink lines are the refill rule curves of the mop model and of the bilevel model respectively particularly the difference of refill rule curves between the two models increases with a larger cdm preference for flood control as indicated by the sample points k fig 8c b fig 8b and j fig 8a 6 conclusion a new index of institutional gap ig is defined in this study to quantify the deviation in optimal performance between the conventional model and the bilevel programming model to identify the causes of the ig and evaluate the influence of preference on the magnitude of the ig a comparative analysis between two models is conducted for rpp through an illustrative numerical example and the real case of the tgr firstly an ig is mainly attributed to the negligence of hierarchical interactions between the flood control department and the water conservation department in reservoir operation rules setting to be more specific the centralized optimization model assumes that a cdm could perfectly determine the flood control and refill rule simultaneously with the full cooperation of the two departments to achieve the common objectives while in practice the water conservation department has rights to control the refill rule for hydropower generation which would restrict the decision space of the flood control department secondly our proposed framework provides important implication about the impact of the cdm s preference toward conflicting objectives on the magnitude of the ig in particular the ig is the largest when the preference is given to the flood control or hydropower generation objective only moreover within a specified range of preference setting the pareto optimal solutions perform better than the bilevel solution in terms of both objectives but such advantage is not achievable due to the lack of cooperation in this centralized institutional setting in all the proposed analytical framework provides guidance on improving the applicability of reservoir operation optimization models in terms of institutional structure design and preference setting three important concerns need to be addressed in future study firstly this study mainly focuses on the hierarchical feature of reservoir operating systems yet for a better extension of the developed framework to large reservoir systems with complex organizational structures more research work needs to be done to combine the modeling of both hierarchical and horizontal interactions secondly the optimal solutions of the lower level may not be unique when optimizing the bilevel model for rpp leaving space for further study on ill posed bilevel programming problems zemkoho 2016 which deal with negotiation mechanisms between the flood control department and water conservation department finally while this analysis focuses on lack of cooperation but perfect information about lower level decisions imperfect information may also cause efficiency loss and lead to local optimum in optimizations including bilevel programming giuliani

5533,dealing with institutional settings involving multiple stakeholders is essential for improving the applicability of reservoir operation optimization models however a centralized decision maker cdm is conventionally assumed to represent multiple players with perfect cooperation and information exchange for modeling the decision making process with hierarchical structure and non cooperative interactions in real problems in this paper we define the deviation of operation performance between the assumed centralized and the practical hierarchical decision making procedures as an institutional gap ig to further derive the causes of the ig and evaluate the influence of the cdm s preference on the ig a comparative analysis between bilevel programming and multi objective programming mop is conducted for the reservoir pre impoundment problem rpp compared to optimizing two conflicting objectives in mop our proposed bilevel optimization framework models the flood control rule maker and reservoir refill rule maker as minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the hydropower production benefit respectively with a hierarchical institutional structure our case study of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china indicates that the centralized optimization model without considering the hierarchical interaction between flood control and reservoir refill decision makers would lead to an ig in terms of underestimation of flood risk we further find that the magnitude of the ig is highly related to the selection of the cdm s preference and the largest ig is obtained when the flood control or hydropower generation objective is solely considered particularly we specify the range of preference setting which results in the domination of centralized model solutions as compared to the bilevel solution although the solutions within this range are not realistic for practical operation our findings provide an insight into the cause of the ig as well as the effects of preference on the ig facilitating future improvement of institutional structure design and preference setting for practical reservoir operation optimizations keywords reservoir operation optimization reservoir pre impoundment problem rpp bilevel programming multi objective programming mop institutional gap ig 1 introduction despite intensive research efforts in optimization modeling of reservoir operation problems and the utilization of powerful modern computers it is well recognized that a continuing gap exists between literature and practices cai et al 2018 choong and el shafie 2014 horne et al 2016 labadie 2004 simonović 1992 wurbs 1993 yeh 1985 including in the field of flood water conservation such as reservoir impounding during the post flood season and refill periods in china for instance 97 988 reservoirs have been built by 2015 nbsc n d but only 56 have been recorded as applying multistage flood limited water levels flwls creei and dut 2014 although numerous studies have been conducted on dynamic control of flwl dc flwl hence a thorough understanding of the mechanism behind this gap would improve the applicability of optimization model as well as the efficiency of reservoir system operations reducing or eliminating the gap is not trivial because of the complex dynamic nonlinear uncertain multidisciplinary and multi agent characteristics of reservoir operation problems giuliani et al 2016 mendes et al 2015 noël and cai 2017 zeng et al 2019 previous studies have pointed out three main factors that would result in the gap 1 human subjective factor or the reluctance of practitioners to adopt more advanced and complicated models in current reservoir operating systems cai et al 2015 labadie and sullivan 1986 yeh and becker 1982 2 technical factor basically associated with three challenges including understanding of flood seasonality chen et al 2015 hall and bloeschl 2018 ye et al 2017 hydrologic non stationarity yan et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 and imperfect information for real time meteorological and hydrology forecast toth et al 2000 wanders et al 2014 and 3 institutional factor which is the inconsistency of conventional optimization models with institutional settings in practical reservoir operations adigüzel and coşkunoğlu 1984 booker et al 2005 doyle and patterson 2019 marston and cai 2016 suggestions to overcome these hindrances have included construction of more capable water infrastructure and facilities improvement of computer hardware and software technologies and encouragement of reservoir operators to participate in model development cai et al 2015 fotovatikhah et al 2018 horne et al 2016 in addition there is a need for an effective framework capable of addressing institutional features booker et al 2005 ingram et al 1984 especially for large reservoir systems with complex organizational structures in reservoir pre impoundment problem rpp studies significant improvement has been made in addressing the human subjective factor and technical factor over the past three decades the barrier of human subjective factor has been tackled by the development of decision support systems cai et al 2015 labadie 2006 for the technical obstacles numerous techniques have been developed to deal with the above mentioned three challenges research on flood sub seasons identification and joint distribution of seasonal floods liu et al 2011 has led to studies on the multistage flwl chen et al 2013 liu et al 2010 multiple duration limited water level yun and singh 2008 and dc flwl diao and wang 2011 li et al 2010 moreover progresses have been made in studies on reservoir inflow forecasting zhou and guo 2014 nonstationary reservoir inflow prediction xu et al 2015 and the probability distribution of the maximum refill water availability at the end of refill season wan et al 2016 nevertheless compared to the other two factors little attention has been paid to bridge the gap resulted from the institutional factor or the institutional gap ig as defined in our study according to the number of stakeholders involved in the decision making process reservoir operating systems can be divided into two categories single decision maker systems and multi decision maker systems centralized decision making only applies to reservoirs with one managing administrator such as single purpose reservoirs for power production or irrigation generally multi purpose reservoir systems are managed and operated by multiple stakeholders correspondingly the institutional setting of such multiple stakeholders is characterized by horizontal and hierarchical structure for multi reservoir systems reservoir operators may be horizontally organized with equal operation rights or hierarchically organized with different priority given to different stakeholders coordination of horizontally organized reservoirs could be described as co operative or non cooperative games li et al 2019 madani 2010 yu et al 2019 hierarchically for an individual reservoir with both a flood control objective and other competitive conservation demands hydropower generation water supply environment etc such as the three gorges reservoir tgr it is generally characterized by at least two managerial levels decision makers at each level have control over different decision variables to achieve different objectives particularly for rpp the flood control rule and the reservoir refill rule during the post flood season and refill period which together decide whether a reservoir can be refilled back to the normal storage water level nswl are determined with a hierarchical decision making structure the flood control rule maker at the upper level has priority over the reservoir refill rule maker but on the other side when the refill rule maker at the lower level makes decisions according to the flood control rule this will in turn have impact on the upper level objective hence the flood control rule maker needs to take into account the reactions of the reservoir refill rule maker however most previous optimization models assume just one decision maker with centralized decision right for example multi objective programming mop also known as multi criteria optimization has been widely used and developed in rpp research chen et al 2013 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 because of the assumption of cdm studies based on mop only derive the optimal reservoir refill rule with the given flood control rule on a single level in which the hierarchical interactions between flood control rule and refill rule makers are neglected such cdm based modeling could not apply to provide practical solutions for rpp since the model structure is different from the hierarchical decision making structure of the real reservoir operating system in this respect the application of bilevel programming has received increasing attention in various aspects of water resources research including water resources allocation chen et al 2017 fang et al 2013 hu et al 2016 safari et al 2014 tu et al 2015 xu et al 2013 energy water conflict resolution cheng et al 2016 shafiee jood et al 2018 xu et al 2015 zhang and vesselinov 2016 multi reservoir operation in inter basin water transfer supply projects guo et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 optimal groundwater remediation management he et al 2018 and water distribution systems planning bostian et al 2015 in some studies comparisons between the single level and bilevel model were made to evaluate the capability and efficiency of the bilevel models both from the perspectives of objective functions and solutions shafiee jood et al 2018 xu et al 2016 2013 these studies suggest that bilevel programming improves the model s capability of dealing with the hierarchical decision making process and coordinating conflicting objectives at different levels whereas single level mop optimizations might lead to deviation of the solutions from reality shafiee jood et al 2018 such as an unbalanced development for the whole society xu et al 2013 however the interactions between the decision makers at different levels i e the stackelberg nash gaming process have not been investigated in terms of ig including why there is an ig between current optimization models and practical operations in rpp how large is the ig and which factors influence the magnitude of the ig therefore the aim of this paper is to answer the above questions through comparisons of bilevel programming and mop optimization in numerical examples and the tgr case we 1 explore the causes of the ig with the consideration of hierarchical interactions between the rule makers for flood control and reservoir refill and 2 quantify the influence of preference setting on the magnitude of the ig which would substantially help improve the practicability of rpp optimization modeling and provide implications for institutional reforms the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a general definition of bilevel programming and formulates a bilevel model for rpp section 3 compares the solution deviations between the bilevel programming model and the mop optimization via illustrative numerical examples section 4 introduces a real case of the tgr in section 5 we extend the comparative analysis between the bilevel and centralized optimization model to the tgr case and obtain further practical implications concerning the causes and influential factors of the ig finally section 6 provides the conclusion 2 methodology 2 1 overview of bilevel programming as a special class of optimization model the bilevel programming model was originally developed for dealing with hierarchical decision making structure with two non cooperative decision makers bard 2010 candler and norton 1977 von stackelberg 1952 it has been widely applied in various areas such as transportation brotcorne et al 2000 migdalas 1995 network facility distribution sun et al 2008 environmental economics sinha et al 2014 sinha et al 2013 and supply chain management jalil et al 2019 witt 2019 generally two decision makers are involved in the bilevel model i e the leader at the upper level and the follower at the lower level each could control a different set of variables to optimize their own objective functions by following a sequential decision process which is the main difference from the conventional model with only a cdm optimizing all objectives within the framework of this hierarchical structure the leaders would make decisions to optimize their own objectives taking into account perfect information about the reactions of the followers and then the followers would react to set the optimal values of their controlled variables under the given values of the upper level variables bard 2010 calvete et al 2011 therefore the lower level model could be considered as nested constraints of the upper level model which implicitly determines the feasible region of the bilevel optimization mathematically a bilevel programming model is expressed as 1 min x f x y s t g x y 0 y arg min y f x y s t g x y 0 where f is the objective function of the upper level model x is the set of decision variables of the leader g is the set of constraints of the upper level model f is the objective function of the lower level model y is the set of decision variables of the follower g is the set of constraints of the lower level model based on the above description some basic definitions are given as follows which will be further used to uncover the causes of the ig in the following sections 1 constraint domain i e the values of x and y that satisfy all constraints 2 s x y g x y 0 g x y 0 2 constraint set of the lower level for given x x x g x y 0 3 y x y g x y 0 3 rational reaction set of the lower level to given x x x g x y 0 4 ψ x arg min y f x y y y x 4 inducive region or feasible region of the bilevel problem consisting of the intersection of the constraints domain and rational reaction set 5 ir x y x y s y ψ x generally the solutions for the bilevel programming model should be feasible in the first place that is the optimal solution is restricted to the inducive region as defined in eq 5 the feasible solution x y would be optimal when it achieves the minimum value of the upper level objective i e f x y f x y holds for all feasible solutions x y in ir 2 2 bilevel programming model for rpp according to the chinese institutional setting flood control and water conservation are controlled by separate departments csc 2018 mwr 2012 since most reservoirs serve both flood control and water conservation purposes the flood control department and water conservation department are formulated with a hierarchical structure and make decisions in sequence for reservoir operation rule settings during the flood season when flood control is the primary concern csc 2018 as shown in fig 1 due to the high importance of the dam and downstream security the department taking responsibility for flood control is typically set as the leader while the department seeking water conservation benefits such as the corporation for hydropower generation is set as the follower correspondingly the flood control department would determine the flood control rules including the controlled water levels and the corresponding controlled levels of reservoir discharge to reduce the flood risk with the consideration of the reaction of the water conservation department the water conservation department then determines the refill rule curve i e the targeted storage level of reservoir impoundment to maximize the benefits of water conservation such as power generation both the leader and follower are constrained by the following physical constraints water balance reservoir storage volumes basic flood control security reservoir release minimal and maximal power output maximum variation of the daily water level etc as far as rpp is concerned considering the interaction between the flood control and water conservation departments is essential to balance the trade off between flood risk and water conservation benefit during the process of reservoir impoundment especially for the post flood season ding et al 2017 concerning the possible incidence of large floods at post flood periods flood risk and water conservation benefits would be both increased if the controlled water levels are set too high or the reservoir impounds too fast conversely if the controlled water levels are set too low or the impoundment starts late and progresses slowly flood risk would be decreased but water or hydropower energy shortage might occur because subsequent inflows might be insufficient to satisfy water and energy demands in the following non flood season a bilevel programming model is developed to simulate the hierarchical interaction between the flood control department and water conservation department optimizing their conflicting interests fig 2 a depicts the modeling structure on the basis of hierarchical decision making mechanism the upper and lower level objectives decision variables and constraints of this model are further described in the following 2 2 1 upper level model for flood control operation the flood control department generally focuses on minimizing the flood risk the lowest flood risk would be achieved by emptying the storage for flood control during the whole flood season and starting the reservoir refill thereafter but this might not adapt to the increasing water demand in this regard we minimize the potential flood risk as the upper level objective in the bilevel programming model the potential flood risk is defined as the difference of the flood peak water level a typically used indicator in flood risk assessment lewis et al 2011 robson et al 1998 xu et al 2020 between the proposed optimal reservoir operations and the operation which preserves all reservoir storage for flood control in the whole flood season this difference is calculated with three scenarios of small medium and large floods in the post flood season which are represented by the seasonal design inflows with 20 year 100 year and 1000 year return period respectively thus the potential flood risk is calculated with the weighting method as follows 6 min f p r f w 1 δ p e a k s w 2 δ p e a k m w 3 δ p e a k l 7 δ p e a k z opt peak z 0 peak z 0 peak 100 where δ p e a k s δ p e a k m and δ p e a k l are the differences of flood peak water level under the small medium and large seasonal design flows respectively z opt peak is the flood peak water level under the proposed rule optimized by the bilevel model and z 0 peak is the flood peak water level under the operation rule which preserves all reservoir storage for flood control throughout the flood season w 1 w 2 and w 3 are weighting factors for the three flood scenarios as the decision variables of the upper level this study optimizes the flood control rules which consist of the controlled water levels and the corresponding controlled levels of reservoir discharge the controlled water levels include flwls and cfwls i e the compensating flood control water levels lying between the flwl and the nswl cfwls are used to divide part of the reservoir storage to support flood control in the downstream site which is relatively far from the reservoir and has local inflows when the reservoir storage lies below the cfwl the discharge should be controlled at a safe level in order to reduce the flood risk at the downstream site different from the traditional method of preserving fixed reservoir storage for flood control our bilevel model is optimizing a set of multistage controlled water levels and the corresponding controlled discharges the upper level decision variable is given as x x 1 x 2 x i where x i z i q i represents the flwls cfwls and the corresponding controlled discharges applied in the i th ten days during the post flood period as the constraints of the upper level model the flwls and cfwls should lie between the dead water level dwl and nswl of the reservoir 8 dwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 z i x i nswl furthermore the reservoir operation under the given flood control rules should conform to the following constraints 1 water balance equation 9 v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t where δ t is the operational time step v i j and v i j 1 are the reservoir storage volume at the beginning and end of a day q in i j and q out i j are the reservoir in and outflow on j th day of the i th year among which q out i j would be determined based on current storage v i j of the reservoir and the inflow q in i j according to both the flood control rule x z q and the refill rule curve y our case study in section 4 provides further details on how determination of the reservoir release is regulated by the operation rules 2 reservoir storage volumes limits 10 v min v i j v max where v min is the minimum reservoir storage volume and v max is the maximum storage volume 3 basic flood control security 11 r f 0 where r f represents the probability of the reservoir water level exceeding the highest safe water level in front of the dam during floods li et al 2014 4 reservoir release limits 12 q min q out i j min q safe q cap where q min is the minimal required reservoir discharge q safe is the controlled level of reservoir discharge corresponding to the current controlled water level q cap stands for the maximum allowable reservoir discharge capability 5 limits of power output p i j 13 p min p i j p max where p min and p max represent firm and maximum output of the power station respectively 6 restriction on daily change rate of the water level z 14 δ z δ z max 15 δ z δ z max where δ z and δ z are daily decrease and increase of the storage level respectively δ z max and δ z max represent the maximum allowable daily decrease and increase of the storage level respectively 2 2 2 lower level model for water conservation operation the lower level decision maker i e the water conservation department could operate the reservoir with multiple purposes in this study we mainly focus on hydropower generation during the refill period and the non flood season for evaluation we apply the optimized rules with long series of historical daily inflow data to simulate reservoir operation processes and calculate the annual average plant output e avg the lower level objective function is defined as 16 min f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j where k is the hydropower output coefficient q i j is the outflow and h i j is the water head of the reservoir on the j th day of the i th year n is the number of years and m is the number of time steps days during the operational horizon corresponding to the minimizing objectives at the upper level model we minimize the negative e avg which is equivalent to maximizing power production in addition we propose pre impoundment of the reservoir and advance the start date to the later period of the flood season to simplify the computation burden the refill rule curve is controlled by several variables between the flwl and nswl with a five day time step y y 1 y 2 y i where y i represents the targeted storage level for impoundment at the end of the i th five days during the refill period in practice the refill rule curve is suggested to rise with time ranging from the flwl to nswl of the reservoir 17 flwl y 1 y 2 y i nswl note that the constraints presented in eqs 9 15 are also applicable for the lower level model 2 2 3 optimization model and solution framework combining the upper and lower level models together the bilevel programming model is formulated as 18 min x f p r f w 1 δ p e a k s w 2 δ p e a k m w 3 δ p e

q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max to solve this model a simulation based optimization framework on the basis of particle swarm optimization algorithm pso is proposed in this study intelligent algorithms such as genetic algorithms ga yin 2000 neural networks bp hu et al 2010 lv et al 2008 and pso guo et al 2012 jiang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 2012 provide applicable tools for np hard and non convex bilevel programming problems among these methods pso has been shown to provide optimal or suboptimal solutions jiang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 2012 the procedure of the proposed solution framework is given in fig 3 the basic principle of the framework is to apply pso iteratively to approximate the optimal solution for both the upper and lower levels while the simulation model of reservoir operation is embedded to evaluate the performance of proposed schemes 2 3 evaluation of ig we define a new index ig to quantify the deviation of the optimal performances of flood risk and hydropower generation between the bilevel model and the related mop model see fig 2b particularly the pareto optimal solutions of the mop model is derived by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 ig is defined as 19 ig δ f i δ f i f f i par f f i par where f and f are the upper and lower level objective value of the bilevel solution respectively f i par and f i par are the upper and lower level objective value of i th solution point on the pareto front of the mop model while using the mop method to optimize reservoir operation problems a pre defined preference of the cdm is needed to make the final choice among all non dominated solutions hence the choice of i th solution point is dependent on the preference setting for the potential flood risk and power generation ig is expected to better reflect the interactive relationship between two levels under different preference settings the one dimensional index proposed by shafiee jood et al 2018 is a special case of equation 19 which only compares the value of the lower level objective when given specified upper level decisions further although the bilevel model in this study only involves one objective at each level the index of ig can be extended to deal with multi objective hierarchical optimization problems more specifically we measure the preference setting in this study by defining the weight ratio between two objectives which is based on the relative weighting factor of solution points on the pareto front the weight ratio w r i of i th point is calculated as 20 w r i 1 f i norm 1 f i norm where f i norm and f i norm are the normalized values of potential flood risk and power production of i th solution point on the pareto front 3 illustrative example for the causes of ig in this section we employ a simplified optimization problem with two nonlinear and non cooperative objectives amouzegar 1999 to illustrate the effects of hierarchical and centralized decision making structure on the causes of the ig since the bilevel programming model is formulated with the same hierarchical decision making structure the analysis for this problem can then be further extended to uncover the causes of the ig for more complex optimization problems as well as the proposed bilevel model for rpp the testing bilevel programming problem is given as example 1 to represent the hierarchical decision making process in operation practice for comparison the related mop model or bicriteria model example 2 represents the centralized optimization model in research literature example 1 bilevel programming problem 22 min x f x y x 5 2 2 y 1 2 s t y arg min y f x y y 1 2 1 5 x y 3 x y 3 x 0 5 y 4 x y 7 x 0 y 0 example 2 bicriteria optimization problem 23 min x y f x y x 5 2 2 y 1 2 min x y f x y y 1 2 1 5 x y s t 3 x y 3 x 0 5 y 4 x y 7 x 0 y 0 the deviation of the optimal performances between two examples is clearly shown in fig 4 a which verifies the existence of the ig further it can be seen that there are two patterns of ig point a which denotes the optimal objective values of the bilevel programming model is dominated by any point on the pareto front within the yellow shaded area while point a is non dominated by any point on the pareto front out of this area for example point b dominates point a with both smaller f value and f value i e the ig between point b and a is i g b δ f b δ f b 7 75 7 75 meanwhile point c with smaller f value and larger f value does not dominate point a i e the ig between point c and a is i g c δ f c δ f c 8 15 note that point b and c represent different preferences toward two objectives choosing the solution of b means giving more preference to f while the choice of c means giving more preference to f the influence of preference setting on the igs will be further discussed in section 5 to explore the causes of the ig we depict the solution space of example 1 and 2 in fig 4b the green shaded area s is the constraint domain of the problems the inducive region of the upper level model is drawn as the dashed black line denoted by ir in the figure and the pareto front is plotted as the dark blue line denoted by e according to the definition ir is the set of candidate points x y x within s by which y x is the optimized lower level variable according to x this implies that the leaders could only optimize their objectives through the inducive region determined by the decisions of the followers in contrast the solutions of the bicriteria problem are found by selecting the ones with non dominated f f values among all couples of x y over s therefore the solution space is different between two models part of e overlaps with ir which divides the pareto front into two segments some points in e such as point b dominate point a but do not lie the inducive region are thus not feasible solutions for hierarchical optimization model some other points such as point c lie in the overlapping area of e and ir but would not be considered as an optimal solution of the bilevel programming because of an inferior upper level objective value compared to point a it is worth noting that the decision makers of two levels might cooperate or have consistent interests and the optimal solution to the bilevel model would lie on the pareto front amouzegar 1999 sinha et al 2014 however evidence suggests that a bilevel programming model with such an optimality condition is not applicable for most reservoir operations to maintain the generality of model formulation we mainly pay attention to the cases of hierarchical decision making with players who have conflicting goals and behave uncooperatively corresponding to real reservoir operations in practice bard 1983 4 case study 4 1 overview of the tgr impoundment problem the three gorges reservoir tgr the world s largest multi purpose hydro junction is a key project in the water resources management of the yangtze river fig 5 with a flood storage capacity of 22 15 billion m3 the tgr can effectively control floods coming from the upstream of the yangtze river which significantly reduces the flood risk downstream in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where the most populous and economically developed plain area of china is located in particular it has been practically proved to strengthen watershed protection for the jingjiang river reach and the dongting lake areas which suffered from frequent and disastrous flood damages in the past nakayama and shankman 2013 xia et al 2016 as the second most important objective the tgr has a firm output of 4990 mw with a total 18200 mw of installed hydropower capacity up to 2018 the annual generated power of the tgr has exceeded 100 billion kilowatt hours generally a hydrological year is divided into two operation periods for the tgr cwrc 2012 flood season from mid june to late september non flood season which includes the refill period october and the water drawdown period from november to 9th june in the next year according to its original design the tgr operation focuses on flood control throughout the flood season and maintains the water level at its flwl of 145 m till the end of september only when october begins the reservoir would be gradually refilled up to the nswl of 175 m this operation principle implies that for a full storage more than 8000 m3 s discharge should be retained daily in october however with significant decrease of the inflow of the tgr in the last two decades the original scheme of such intensive impoundment risks intensifying the water use conflict in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and makes it difficult to achieve the full storage in most years zheng 2016 in 2008 for example after the tgr started refilling on 28th september the impounding progress was hindered in october because drought occurred in the xiangjiang river area and the tgr had to increase its release to alleviate the water shortage in the lower reaches as a result the water level of tgr only arrived at 172 6 m till the end of refilling on 6th november which was about 2 5 m below the nswl it is thus necessary to improve the original tgr operation rules for an effective reservoir impoundment in this context numerous studies have been conducted on optimization of the tgr operation scheme with pre impoundment during post flood periods li et al 2010 2014 liu et al 2010 2011 zhou et al 2015 in practice the tgr has gone into the era of experimental pre impoundment since 2010 nevertheless studies so far rarely consider the hierarchical structure of decision making and most of the models are based on the mop framework therefore there is still a gap between the research results and practical operation schemes for the tgr pre impoundment for instance researchers proposed that reservoir refilling should start from 1st september and the storage level should reach 160 m by 30th september but for the past five years the tgr started refilling on 10th september and the storage level normally ranged from 162 m to 165 m on 30th september 4 2 hierarchical structure of reservoir operation early refilling of the tgr involves two decision makers formulated as the leader follower relationship as the leader the general commands of flood control and drought relief of china and of the yangtze river regarded as a single entity in our study the gcfd set flood control standards and determine flood control rules so as to reduce the potential flood risk of the tgr dam and the downstream areas as the follower the china three gorges corporation ctgc directly makes plans for power generation and reservoir impoundment the ctgc also needs to coordinate the interests of other departments such as the changjiang waterway bureau and china s state grid for simplification our bilevel modeling of the tgr operation mainly focuses on the interaction between the gcfd and ctgc 4 3 flood control and refill rules for optimization the originally designed operation rule of the tgr would preserve all reservoir storage above the fixed flwl for flood control at the jingjiang river reach jingjiang compensating flood control which is described as follows cwrc 1997 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at the flwl of 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level is above 145 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station should not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is between 100 year and 1000 year in 2009 the ministry of water resources of china revised the tgr operation rule so as to divide part of the reservoir storage for flood control compensation at the chenglingji hydrological station to help reduce the flood threat confronting the dongting lake area chenglingji compensating flood control mwr 2009 the division curve of this part of storage i e the cfwl is currently set at 155 m leaving 5 65 billion m3 storage for flood capacity compensation accordingly the operation rule of the tgr has been revised as follows 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level ranges between 145 m and 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the chenglingji hydrological station does not exceed 34 4 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is less than or equal to 100 year 3 when the water level is above 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station does not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is between 100 year and 1000 year for the tgr operations there is increasing need for regulating smaller inflows and reducing the flood risk of the lower reach during the post flood period so in this study we mainly seek to improve the current fixed cfwl by optimizing a set of multistage cfwls as the decision variable of the gcfd which is represented by a set of three lines in the first middle and last ten days of september i e x x 1 x 2 x 3 the optimization of the corresponding controlled discharges is not included according to operation experiences and findings of related studies li et al 2014 mwr 2009 zheng 2016 the tgr s controlled discharge for the jingjiang compensating flood control and chenglingji compensating flood control are proposed as 55000 m3 s and 42000 m3 s respectively originally the tgr refilling is organized as follows after the flood season ends the reservoir storage is gradually refilled from the flwl of 145 m up to the nswl of 175 m in october a refill rule curve will guide the progress of impoundment as stated in the tgr operation rules enacted by the changjiang water resources commission in 2012 the refilling starts on 10th september and the storage level can rise to 165 m by the end of september cwrc 2012 during the early refilling in the post flood season the operation of the tgr should switch from impoundment to flood control when there are incoming floods in near future in this study we further advance the start date of impoundment to 1st september so as to verify the effectiveness of an earlier pre impoundment strategy meanwhile we seek to improve the conventional linear impounding progress by optimizing the decision variable of the water conservation department as the refill rule curve which is discretized into 11 control points between 145 m and 175 m with a five day time step i e y y 1 y 2 y 11 to evaluate the performance of the optimized operation scheme we employ the following two schemes for comparison 1 the tgr original operation rule with jingjiang compensating flood control and without early refilling denoted as ord and 2 the tgr operation rule adopted in 2012 which applies the cfwl of 155 m for chenglingji compensating flood control and pre impoundment starting on 10th september denoted as eic 4 4 data input 4 4 1 long series of historical runoff the simulation and calculation of our case study is based on the 131 year from 1882 to 2012 historical daily inflow series of the tgr 4 4 2 design flows of the tgr post flood season as part of calculation of the potential flood risk we select 1952 and 1964 as typical years to derive seasonal design flow hydrographs using peak and volume amplitude method extreme flood situation occurred during the post flood season in both typical years while the seasonal flood in 1952 is characterized as multi peak type and the flood in 1964 is of single peak type and the peak is closer to the end of the flood season li et al 2010 4 4 3 setting of boundary values the minimum water discharge limit q min is 10 000 m3 s and 8000 m3 s for the tgr in september and october respectively the maximum allowable daily increase of the storage level δ z max for impoundment of the tgr is 3 m the daily decrease of the reservoir storage δ z max should not exceed 2 m during floods and 0 6 m in the non flood season these settings are mainly serving the demands for navigation and ecological water use downstream and bank stability 5 results and discussion 5 1 operation scheme according to the bilevel framework the operation scheme optimized by the proposed bilevel framework has achieved better performances in terms of utilization of flood water in comparison with the performances under the operation rules of ord and eic the mean annual usage rate of the tgr flood control capacity during september and october is lifted up to 68 6 which is 137 times that of ord 0 5 and 11 more than that of eic 61 8 as the results of the reservoir discharge intervals in different scenarios shows table 1 the optimized operation scheme enhances the control of the discharge for reducing the flood risk at the chenglingji hydrologic station for the lower level model the full storage rate at the end of refill period is significantly increased from 79 4 of ord and 92 4 or eic to 96 2 and the annual average ending water level at october is raised up to 174 9 m hence the tgr generates more hydropower the annual average power generation of the tgr from 1st september to 9th june before the beginning of the flood season in the next hydrological year is 63 1 billion kwh which is 3 0 and 1 2 billion kwh more than that of the ord and eic respectively table 2 compares the power generation in september and the later non flood season as expected the ord leads to the highest portion of power production in september but performs poorly in the non flood season in contrast the proposed optimal operation scheme and the eic with pre impoundment both illustrate the advantage of power generation during the non flood season meanwhile the tgr potential flood risk increases to 0 13 including 0 08 for 20 year 0 042 for 100 year and 0 008 for 1000 year flood scenarios comparing to the value of 0 and 0 002 in the case of ord and eic as the results of the flood peak water level intervals show table 3 the optimized operation scheme would maintain the reservoir at a relatively high storage level during post flood periods nevertheless the basic flood control security see eq 11 is still guaranteed with a possibility of exceeding the highest safe water level in front of dam as zero just as in the other two schemes with the design flow used fig 6 shows the tgr flood control rule and refill rule curve optimized by the proposed bilevel model the operation rules of ord and eic are also plotted for comparison the three cfwl lines i e the upper decision variable x are 156 2 m 158 2 m and 163 8 m this result indicates that 6 4 billion m3 7 8 billion m3 and 12 0 billion m3 reservoir storage can be used for flood control for chenglingji hydrological station in the first middle and last ten days of september respectively compared to the current cfwl of 155 m the storage for chenglingji compensating flood control is increased by 0 7 billion m3 2 1 billion m3 and 6 3 billion m3respectively accordingly the flood storage capacity preserved for the jingjiang river reach is reduced the optimized refill rule curve y suggests a more active pre impoundment strategy for the tgr than that of eic for it advances the trigger of impoundment to 1st september and allows the water level to arrive at 166 3 m on 30th september as compared to the 165 m in eic it is worth mentioning that during most of september the refill rule curve lies below the cfwl lines which implies a trade off between flood control and impoundment during the post flood season after the flood season the water level is lifted up within a shorter time and almost reaches full storage of the reservoir before mid october in general the impounding under our optimized scheme is more active than that of eic in terms of higher water head and more power generation in both september and the non flood season because the optimized operation scheme tends to retain more runoff under the medium and small flood scenarios the potential flood risk is increased with the reduced flood control capacity 5 2 why is there an ig fig 7 shows the bilevel feasible solutions in pink points which are derived from the blue points on the pareto front that is the water conservation department optimizes the refill rule curve given the flood control rule i e cfwls specified in the cdm model among seven sample operation scheme points m j d b e k and n the points m and n represent the two special cases for which the cdm only focuses on minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the power generation respectively it is clearly shown that all the operation schemes on the pareto front are not feasible in bilevel programming and the bilevel feasible solutions in pink points produce more power generation but higher potential flood risk than the corresponding pareto optimal solutions there are two main reasons that pareto optimal schemes cannot apply to the tgr impoundment which are given as below first of all the operation schemes on the pareto front of mop optimization are not feasible in bilevel decision making even if they are more efficient for both objectives for example as shown in fig 7 point b has the objective values f 0 12 and f 63 2 and its corresponding decision variables for flood control rule and refill control curve are x 156 8 157 9 164 2 and y 153 4 156 5 161 2 162 7 163 2 164 7 170 0 173 5 174 9 174 9 174 9 respectively the upper level decision maker i e the gcfd sets the cfwl lines of the tgr as x x at first then the ctgc on the lower level would optimize the refill rule curve according to the pre specified flood control rules x x with the only concern of maximizing the power generation the ctgc would seek to fill up the storage as fast as possible and the refill rule curve is optimized as y 149 6 155 3 161 0 164 2 166 2 171 2 172 4 173 9 174 4 175 0 175 0 given the specified flood control rules x y is optimal from the perspective of the ctgc and thus y is not a bilevel feasible solution the refill rule curve y and its corresponding y are shown in fig 8 b and the objective values become f 0 19 and f 63 4 point c in fig 7 given the flood control rule optimized by the centralized model it can be observed in fig 8b that the refill rule curve lies below the one derived from the bilevel model especially during the post flood season furthermore it can be seen in fig 7 that the pink points are densely scattered over the right lower region above the blue points of the pareto front which indicates that a higher potential flood risk would be resulted from the transition from the optimal operation schemes of the cdm model to that of the bilevel model point c for example is not as efficient as point b and would not be considered as an optimal solution of the bilevel model with the potential flood risk higher than f the actual potential flood risk of 0 19 for the operation scheme at point c is underestimated to the level of 0 12 at point b in this respect about 0 3 percent increase in power generation at point c may hardly be acceptable due to increase of 0 07 in potential flood risk this underestimation of potential flood risk of the mop model or the infeasible optimality of solutions is the consequence of neglecting the autonomy of the ctgc on the refill rule decision making process since the ctgc makes its decision after the gcfd its decision on the refill rule curve could have impact on the optimal realization of the gcfd s objective in flood control the gcfd thus has to take into account the reactions of the ctgc for setting the flood control rule however the mop optimization does not consider such a non cooperative interaction in decision making similarly we test other points on the pareto front and as fig 7 shows the feasible solutions in bilevel optimization either have poor performance for the flood control objective such as point c green shaded area i or poor performance for both the upper and lower level objectives red shaded area ii no point could produce better performance for both objectives compared to point a that is a hierarchical decision making problem would not achieve the efficiency of a bi criteria model where the non cooperative interactions between the two levels is taken into account actually if we draw an envelope curve of these newly accessed points we can obtain another front above the original pareto front implying that the feasible region of bilevel programming is more restrained than the solution space of mop optimization 5 3 how large is the ig and what is the influence of cdm s preference on this gap the preference of the cdm has impact on the magnitude of the gap in terms of the potential flood risk and power generation as fig 9 shows in segment m d the underestimation of the mop model in both objectives increases as the cdm pays more attention to flood control for example the potential flood risk and the amount of power generation at point j are underestimated with 0 07 and 0 4 billion kwh respectively i e i g j δ f j δ f j 0 07 0 4 meanwhile the largest underestimation of the potential flood risk is 0 13 at point m where the cdm controls all operation rules setting and ignores the interaction between the ctgc and gcfd for determining the refill rule comparatively in segment n e the overestimation in the objectives of potential flood risk and power generation increases as the cdm pays more attention to power generation taking point k for example the magnitude of overestimation amounts to 0 08 and 0 5 billion kwh respectively i e i g k δ f k δ f k 0 08 0 5 the largest overestimation of power generation is 0 7 billion kwh at point n where the cdm controls all impounding decisions and does not consider the prevailing role and interests of the gcfd in flood control rule setting it is interesting to see that there are two threshold points e and d at which one dimension of the ig namely the gap of potential flood risk or power generation respectively does not exist i e δ f e 0 δ f d 0 in fig 9 the points on the right side of point e have a larger weight for the flood control objective and the points on the left side of point e have a larger weight for the power generation objective the curve in fig 9a is separated by point e into the pink m e segment and the blue n e segment corresponding to underestimated and overestimated potential flood risk respectively similarly point d divides the curve in fig 9b into two segments where underestimation and overestimation of power production occurs respectively fig 9c shows that there are two kinds of gap patterns the pareto optimal operation schemes as related to segment d e are more efficient than the scheme derived from the bilevel model for they result in underestimated potential flood risk and overestimated power generation i e positive values of the ig in two dimensions at the same time the ig is relatively small in both dimensions when the preference is set within this range the second category of the pareto optimal operation schemes the ig of which falls out of the segment d e is non dominated as compared to the bilevel optimal scheme these schemes either result in underestimated potential flood risk and power generation segment m d or overestimated potential flood risk and power generation segment n e these results suggest that it is only when the cdm s preference for flood control or water conservation is within a certain range the operation scheme optimized by the bilevel framework is dominated by the operation scheme of the centralized model in addition we analyze the relationship between the ig for potential flood risk and power generation and the preference toward two objectives which is quantified by the weight ratio wr as defined in equation 20 as illustrated in fig 10 δ f and δ f first decrease as wr increases when the wr is close to 1 at the threshold points e and d which implies equal preference setting the smallest δ f i and δ f i are derived respectively then δ f and δ f rise up again with the increase of wr this suggests that for our case problem when there is preference inequality between flood control and power generation the gap between mop solutions and the practical solution obtained by bilevel programming can be even larger it is shown in fig 8 that neglecting the interactions between the ctgc and gcfd would influence the discrepancy in the optimized control variables in general a more conservative and slower impounding progress for smaller potential flood risk can be expected as indicated by the blue lines below the pink dashed line where blue and pink lines are the refill rule curves of the mop model and of the bilevel model respectively particularly the difference of refill rule curves between the two models increases with a larger cdm preference for flood control as indicated by the sample points k fig 8c b fig 8b and j fig 8a 6 conclusion a new index of institutional gap ig is defined in this study to quantify the deviation in optimal performance between the conventional model and the bilevel programming model to identify the causes of the ig and evaluate the influence of preference on the magnitude of the ig a comparative analysis between two models is conducted for rpp through an illustrative numerical example and the real case of the tgr firstly an ig is mainly attributed to the negligence of hierarchical interactions between the flood control department and the water conservation department in reservoir operation rules setting to be more specific the centralized optimization model assumes that a cdm could perfectly determine the flood control and refill rule simultaneously with the full cooperation of the two departments to achieve the common objectives while in practice the water conservation department has rights to control the refill rule for hydropower generation which would restrict the decision space of the flood control department secondly our proposed framework provides important implication about the impact of the cdm s preference toward conflicting objectives on the magnitude of the ig in particular the ig is the largest when the preference is given to the flood control or hydropower generation objective only moreover within a specified range of preference setting the pareto optimal solutions perform better than the bilevel solution in terms of both objectives but such advantage is not achievable due to the lack of cooperation in this centralized institutional setting in all the proposed analytical framework provides guidance on improving the applicability of reservoir operation optimization models in terms of institutional structure design and preference setting three important concerns need to be addressed in future study firstly this study mainly focuses on the hierarchical feature of reservoir operating systems yet for a better extension of the developed framework to large reservoir systems with complex organizational structures more research work needs to be done to combine the modeling of both hierarchical and horizontal interactions secondly the optimal solutions of the lower level may not be unique when optimizing the bilevel model for rpp leaving space for further study on ill posed bilevel programming problems zemkoho 2016 which deal with negotiation mechanisms between the flood control department and water conservation department finally while this analysis focuses on lack of cooperation but perfect information about lower level decisions imperfect information may also cause efficiency loss and lead to local optimum in optimizations including bilevel programming giuliani and castelletti 2013 le cadre et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 so it would be meaningful to analyze the influence of information exchange between the stakeholders on the ig and further provide implications

5534,the lowest low waters usually occur during spring tides in tide dominated coastal environments however they could also occur during neaps rather than springs at more landward stations and this phenomenon isknownas the reversal of the lowest low waters rllw the rllw greatly depends on subtidal and daily oscillations in the water level the evolutions of which along a channel are of considerable importance in navigation safety and freshwater intake observations collected at an inland hydrological station shilong in the networks of the east river china show that the lowest low water level previously occurred during neaps but now occurs during springs to elucidate the causes of this evolution t tide was used to extract constituents from water level records collected over the past fifty years at five stations in this river network system including astronomical constituents overtides and fortnightly tides the results show that the astronomical constituents were significantly amplified in the upstream stations while the fortnightly tide msf decreased slightly in the long term physically channel deepening caused by excessive sand excavation has increased the water depth and reduced the effective drag in the friction term of the momentum balance the reduced frictional effect reflected by the residual water level slope is responsible for the significant increase in the astronomical tidal amplitudes however they were not strongly influenced by long term variations in river runoff and sea level rise the amplitude ratio between msf and s2 was used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of rllw this ratio at shilong continuously decreased over time and the location where the ratio was 1 moved upstream indicating that the rllw has traveled farther inland in recent decades the evolution of the rllw in the east river network implies that the tidal dominant zone has enlarged in recent decades keywords reversal of the lowest low waters east river sand excavation frictional effect msf s2 amplitude ratio river runoff 1 introduction several studies conducted on deltas and estuaries revealed that variations in the elevation of water and tidal properties are primarily governed by alterations in the landward seaward and geometric boundaries vellinga et al 2014 hoitink and jay 2016 the water level in estuaries is affected by coastal processes astronomical tides river flow and other external forces and their relative importance changes along the estuary jay et al 2015 2016 water level variations also play an important role in the estuarine environment for example the impacts of subtidal water level variations particularly fortnightly oscillations on wetland inundation and navigation are not negligible buschman et al 2009 hoitink and jay 2016 sassi and hoitink 2013 jay et al 2015 in this study subtidal variations refer to water level fluctuations over periods significantly longer than one day hoitink and jay 2016 jay et al 2015 suggested that subtidal oscillations should be considered when defining the seaward boundary of the tidal rivers upstream of the boundary the lowest low water levels occur during neap tides instead of spring tides which is regarded as the reversal of the lowest low waters rllw variations in the lowest low water levels affect tidal freshwater wetlands bunn and arthington 2002 wolanski 2007 and navigation channels jay et al 2011 therefore it is essential and practically important to better understand the rllw and its corresponding hydrological processes previous studies have shown that subtidal nonlinear oscillations larger than the daily tidal variations are responsible for the rllw hoitink and jay 2016 jay et al 2011 2016 subtidal surface variations could reach the point where the diurnal and semidiurnal tides are extinct godin and martinez 1994 thus they even greatly influence the inland water levels the fortnightly tide msf one of the key constituents of subtidal tides is forced in shallow water by river tide interactions in analytical one dimensional models leblond 1979 kukulka and jay 2003 buschman et al 2009 demonstrated that river tide interactions are the main factor inducing fortnightly subtidal water level variations by decomposing the subtidal friction term which is significant in the subtidal momentum balance into the contributions of river flow river tide interactions and tide motions based on the observed data and a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model gallo and vinzon 2005 analyzed the propagation of msf and its impact on water levels in the amazon river hoitink and jay 2016 summarized the features of fortnightly tides and their effect on water levels according to hoitink and jay 1 the msf oscillation is generated by interaction between the semidiurnal constituents m2 and s2 2 as it has a long wavelength the msf persists over long distances up to locations where the astronomical constituents have disappeared without decay 3 the msf lowers the daily mean water levels on neap tides and rises them on spring tides at locations where the amplitude of msf is equal or larger than of s2 the lowest low water levels occur during neap tides rather than spring tides this phenomenon has been observed in the yangtze guo et al 2015 saint lawrence matte et al 2014 and amazon rivers gallo and vinzon 2005 tidal river networks occupy the junctions between oceans and rivers which are among the most prosperous and densely populated regions of the world however the threats of deltaic sinking due to sea level rise and subsidence due to human activities are becoming increasingly severe and apparent syvitski et al 2009 the impact of sea level rise has received great interest due to climate change and the mean sea level msl will increase by 2 m worldwide in the 21st century nicholls and cazenave 2010 changes in the msl may affect changes and variations in tides ross et al 2017 feng et al 2015 jay 2009 xu and huang 2013 however the influence of the relative msl rise on channel morphology is more often overwhelmed by human activities vellinga et al 2014 the effects of construction on the water level and tides including sand excavation land reclamation dam construction and reservoirs can be regarded as abrupt alterations for work to be conducted in the future while the effects of sea level rise are gradual and minor at inland stations vellinga et al 2014 many deltas are currently enduring intense human activity syvitski et al 2009 syvitski and saito 2007 in the delaware river the depth was increased from 6 1 to 12 2 m which contributed to faster wave propagation and doubled tidal ranges during 1910 1983 dilorenzo et al 1993 by assessing the historic tidal datum levels changes in the columbia river jay et al 2011 suggested that variations in tides were due to a combination of changing ocean tides and local alterations in the pearl river delta the phenomenon of increasing water levels in the middle and lower reaches but decreasing levels in the landward reaches is ascribed to channel deepening caused by excessive sand excavation zhang et al 2009 a similar conclusion was drawn from the rhine meuse delta vellinga et al 2014 to date many studies have noted the contribution of human activities to the long term changes and trends of mean water levels but few have considered the evolution of the rllw the networks of the east river fig 1 in southern china are the third largest river networks in the pearl river delta which is a typical delta that has endured severe anthropogenic impacts in the recent decades due to economic boom and rapid urbanization moreover as it is a fresh water source for many metropolises such as shenzhen and hong kong the water quality jiang et al 2009 jin 2001 and low water level changes jia et al 2006 in this delta have received great attention however no studies have yet concentrated on the changes in the lowest lower water level and their causes the lowest low water levels usually occur during spring tides in the seaward reaches of rivers and in the landward reaches during neap tides during the 1970s and 1980s the low water level at the shilong hydrological station which is located in the upstream region of the east river network during neap tides was much lower than that during spring tides in a 15 day cycle fig 2 however the lowest low water level had mostly occurred during spring tides since the 1990s and the tidal range and daily mean water level at shilong are larger and lower than they were before 1990 respectively fig 2 furthermore the trends in the annual mean water level and tidal range in the upper and lower parts of this river network have changed in the long term fig 3 the water level has decreased sharply in the upstream stations xinjiapu shilong and dongguan but increased slightly in the downstream area sishengwei dasheng after 1990 the tidal ranges at shilong and xinjiapu became approximately three times larger than those before the 1980s however no obvious changes have been observed at the seaward stations these abrupt changes and distinct trends could be explained by the great and uneven sand excavation in the east river network according to previous studies jia et al 2007 luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 in this paper we take notice of the evolution of rllw in the east river networks and focus on the influences of morphologic changes on this phenomenon the remainder of this article is organized as follows materials and methods are presented in section 2 in order to analyze tidal properties harmonic analysis t tide model and continuous wavelet transform cwt are applied to long time series of observed data results and discussions are in section 3 according to previous investigation mentioned above the reason that the lowest low water level changes abruptly could be related to damping or amplification of subtidal and principle constituents therefore we analyze the temporal and spatial variability of tidal properties from section 3 1 to 3 3 moreover the natural and anthropogenic impacts on tides are discussed in section 3 4 and the implication of the evolution of rllw are explored in section 3 5 conclusions and summaries are drawn in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of 319 5 km2 jia et al 2007 the east river network is the third largest river network in the pearl river delta located in guangdong province china the east river debouches into the funnel shaped lingding bay through the humen outlet the tide in lingding bay mainly originates from the pacific oceanic tidal propagation through the luzon strait mao et al 2004 which is mixed and is mainly semidiurnal with a tidal form number f ak1 ao1 am2 as2 ak1 ao1 as2 and am2 indicates the amplitude of k1 o1 s2 and m2 ranging from 0 94 to 1 77 mao et al 2004 the tidal range near four outlets humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen varies from 1 0 to 1 5 m therefore the estuary has a micro tidal regime the astronomical tidal amplitudes m2 s2 k1 and o1 at the estuary mouth hong kong increase slowly despite m2 which has decreased by approximately 0 3 mm per year in recent decades feng et al 2015 amplitudes of major constituents at the humen outlet have exhibited a slightly increasing trend over the past 50 years zhang et al 2018 however slightly decreasing trends have been detected at stations dasheng and sishengwei near the mouth of the east river two main branches of the river network separate near shilong station 38 km from the river mouth i e the northern and southern branches xinjiapu 30 km from the river mouth and dasheng 2 km from the river mouth and dongguan 28 km from the river mouth and sishengwei 2 km from the river mouth were selected as study stations in the northern and southern branches respectively the mean river discharge at the boluo upstream station is approximately 719 m3 s the annual mean of which has changed slightly in recent decades zhang et al 2009 2010 2018 the river discharge partition rates are approximately 0 57 and 0 43 in the southern and northern branches according to field measurements collected by the guangdong hydrological bureau respectively owing to rapid economic growth that has occurred since the 1980s a large amount of sand has been extracted from the river channels to meet the demands of urbanization as a consequence of the excessive sand excavation the river bed of the east river network has been significantly and unevenly lowered with its average depth change ranging from 1 77 to 6 48 m luo et al 2007 the upward river bed slope from the outlet has been reduced to almost zero natural siltation in the network is approximately 0 33 m m3 yr and sediment transport from boluo was approximately 1 97 m m3 yr between 1980 and 2002 approximately 3 32 billion m3 of sand has been extracted from the lower reaches of the east river between 1980 and 2002 which is 7 5 times more than the amount of sediment transported from boluo jia et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 2 2 data overview long term water level data obtained for 5 stations along the northern and southern branches of the east river networks was extracted from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china hydrological stations in the delta denoted by black dots in fig 1 kept records of two high and two low water levels each 24 84 hr day and the corresponding record lengths are shown in table 1 error data including spurious and glitches was removed after visual check all water level records were converted to pearl river datum and 1 hour interval trigonometrical interpolation was applied to generate the water level data for harmonic analysis see appendix a daily mean river discharge between 1984 and 2012 at boluo are used for analysis 2 3 harmonic analysis following the method reported by pawlowicz et al 2002 the tidal heights were modeled using the t tide program as a sum of a sinusoidal wave with different frequencies nodal corrections were performed and detailed validation of the method are shown in appendix b in this study we extracted the m2 s2 k1 o1 m4 and msf properties for a time series of one year time using t tide the diurnal k1 and o1 and semidiurnal m2 and s2 tides are the major constituents of the pearl river system mao et al 2004 wong et al 2003 m4 and msf the overtide and the compound tide of m2 dominate the non linear signature of the estuaries friedrichs and aubrey 1988 the fortnightly constituent msf is the main factor resulting in the occurrence of the lowest low water level during neap tides 2 4 the continuous wavelet transform to understand the impacts of discharge on tides the continuous wavelet transform cwt is applied to the

significance of these trends the modified pre whitening procedure kulkarni and von storch 1995 von storch 1999 before the mk test is applied to limit the impact of serial correlation moreover the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is used here to evaluate change points in a time series 3 results and discussions 3 1 temporal tidal variations in order to figure out the reasons for the evolution of rllw temporal and spatial evolutions of tidal constituents are displayed in this and the following sections time series of the diurnal k1 and o1 semidiurnal m2 and s2 quarter diurnal m4 and fortnightly constituents msf are presented in figs 4 6 respectively 3 1 1 variations in astronomical constituents the gauge observations of the northern and southern branches exhibit great variations in the astronomical tides the variations of k1 o1 m2 and s2 were similar with a marked increase in the amplitudes and sharp decline in the phases occurring at landward stations shilong and xinjiapu but slight changes at seaward stations between 1960 and 2012 figs 4 and 5 as shown in table 2 according to the mk trend results the diurnal tidal amplitude has slowly decreased at dasheng and sishengwei and significantly increased at the upstream stations xinjiapu and shilong with magnitudes of approximately 0 003 m yr the maximal amplitude at the upstream stations was observed in 1992 the amplification occurring from 1980 to 1990 contributed to the increasing trend at the landward stations for example the increment in the amplitude of k1 between 1980 and 1990 was approximately 0 02 m per year at shilong while the increment was almost zero before the 1980s and after the 1990s fig 4 the amplitudes of k1 with an average value of 0 4 m at the most seaward station were consistently slightly higher than those of o1 one possible explanation for this is the different impacts of m2 on k1 and o1 under strong bottom friction godin and martinez 1994 matte et al 2014 furthermore the largest variations in amplitude between the most seaward and landward stations of k1 and o1 were 0 34 and 0 25 m respectively indicating that k1 was dampened more rapidly than o1 the higher frequency of k1 was possibly responsible for the higher amplitude damping rate godin 1999 the annual mean amplitudes and phases for the two main semidiurnal constituents m2 and s2 which are the main factors in generating fortnightly tides are shown in fig 5 hoitink and jay 2016 gallo and vinzon 2005 the largest constituent m2 had an amplitude of 0 61 0 74 m while the amplitude of s2 was approximately one third of that of m2 the trend of the annual amplitude of m2 was more significantly positive than that of s2 according to results of the mk test shown in table 2 the amplitudes of m2 and s2 at the seaward stations exhibited subtle and negative trends table 2 the patterns of the amplitudes of m2 and s2 at landward stations were more variable than those at the seaward stations the observations collected at xinjiapu and shilong exhibit distinct amplification from 1980 to 1990 during which the amplitudes of m2 and s2 more than tripled the marked increase in the diurnal and semidiurnal tides coincided with the excavation of sand from the channels according to theory excessive excavation will not only increase channel depth but it will also decrease the effective drag coefficient thereby decreasing the bottom friction and increasing the amplitude friedrichs 2010 friedrichs and aubrey 1994 jay 1991 moreover the results of the pettitt test in table 2 show that all significant change points of the tidal amplitudes occurred around 1985 which corresponds to the change point of the lowest low water level reported in section 3 2 phase represents the timing of the tide the phases increased in the landward direction for all astronomical constituents figs 4 and 5 indicating that the tide propagated slower upstream the phases decreased over time at specific stations for example those at shilong shifted from 90 to 30 for k1 and from 130 to 60 for m2 in recent decades variations in the phases of semidiurnal constituents were larger than those of diurnal constituents and the phase shifts were more variable at the landward stations dongguan xinjiapu and shilong whereas the seaward stations reported relatively stable phases this suggests that tidal propagation was accelerated within the river channels in recent decades 3 1 2 variations in overtides and compound tides as the amplitude was approximately 0 1 m the m2 s2 generated compound tide msf is important to this study the fortnightly tide msf exhibited an almost constant amplitude decrease slightly at all stations during the study period fig 6 according to previous studies hoitink and jay 2016 buschman et al 2009 msf is the dominant factor causing the rllw from springs to neaps as a greater surface level slope is required to compensate for the larger landward stokes drift during spring tides giese and jay 1989 buschman et al 2009 however the lowest low waters at shilong have not always occurred on neaps after the 1990s owing to the almost constant msf amplitude thus fortnightly and astronomical tides must be compared to better understand the evolution of rllw to further explore the rllw phenomenon the ratios between the amplitudes of msf and m2 and msf and s2 at the most landward and seaward stations are presented in fig 7 the msf m2 and msf s2 amplitude ratios greatly exceeded 1 before 1979 and 1990 at shilong respectively indicating that the msf amplitude increased beyond that of the semidiurnal tides the msf m2 and msf s2 amplitude ratios decreased sharply at shilong before the 1980s and 1990s respectively while the ratios at the most seaward station sishengwei were relatively constant although the msf amplitude was larger than that of m2 in the 1960s and 1970s the msf amplitude at shilong has only been approximately 20 of the amplitude of m2 since the 1990s this suggests that the dissipation of the energy of m2 slows in the sishengwei shilong reach the southern branch and it could propagate farther upstream than before as msf has slightly decreased the msf s2 amplitude ratios at shilong were larger and decreased more rapidly than the msf m2 ratios since 1990 the msf s2 amplitude ratios at shilong have declined to approximately 1 which has since remained the same indicating that s2 overwhelmed msf after this period this coincides with the abrupt change in the lowest low water level discussed in section 3 2 at the location where the increase in the msf amplitude was equal to that of the principle tides i e s2 the lowest low water level reversed from springs to neaps hoitink and jay 2016 guo et al 2015 as observed at shilong previously fig 2 therefore the evolution of rllw at shilong station can be attributed to the rapid attenuation of msf s2 the rapidly increasing s2 and m2 are responsible for the attenuation of the ratios because the amplitude of msf was almost constant during the study period fig s2 see the supporting information presents the annual mean amplitudes of m4 at five stations with its magnitude smaller than 0 05 m the amplitude of m4 was relatively minor compared to the astronomical and fortnightly tides m4 exhibited an almost constant amplitudes at all the stations except for a small increase at shilong hence m4 is of relatively subtle importance in analyzing the evolution of rllw 3 2 subtidal variations fig 8 presents the instantaneous and daily averaged water levels from 1970 to 1971 at five stations along the two branches the daily mean water level was systematically lower during neap tides than spring tides between xinjiapu and shilong in the northern branch and between dongguan and shilong in the southern branch while this was less evident at dasheng and sishengwei this phenomenon suggests that the fortnightly subtidal water level variations in the upstream region of the east river network are strong in a tide dominated coastal environment both the highest and lowest water levels occur during spring tides however this is not true for the lowest low water level within a delta thus there must be a transition point for the lowest low water level along the channels of the network which may have been located between the landward stations and seaward stations during 1970 and 1971 this scenario changed after the 1990s the river network appears to have become tide dominated as the lowest low water levels occurred more frequently during spring tides at shilong station fig 2 the annual probability of the lowest low water level occurring on a neap tide at shilong was calculated using data from the past 50 years fig 9 and the mann kendall mk and the pettitt tests were applied to evaluate the significance of the trend and abrupt changes in the probability the average probability was 48 before the 1980s while that after the 1990s was 25 the occurrence of the lowest low water levels during neap tides decreased by half during this period the mk test shows that the probability decreased 0 79 per year with a confidence level of over 99 7 demonstrating a clear tide dominated trend at shilong according to the results of the pettitt test the change point occurred in 1987 with a significance level of at over 99 which corresponds to the observations presented in fig 2 3 3 spatial variations of tides the profiles of the amplitudes of the main constituents i e m2 s2 k1 o1 m4 and msf along the northern and southern branches and the msf s2 amplitude ratio are displayed in fig 10 the astronomical tides in the two main branches were both damped with increasing distance inland the amplitudes of m2 decreased by 58 and 59 cm along the northern and southern channels respectively and it was dissipated more strongly and rapidly than any of the other constituents the diurnal tides k1 and o1 and the secondary semidiurnal constituent s2 exhibited similar amplitude damping rates the damping rates of the astronomical tides increased as the tidal wave propagated inland in contrast the amplitude of the overtide m4 varied slightly along the channel and the compound tide msf increased monotonically the msf was highest at shilong and its magnitude was the same as that of the principal tides the amplification of msf and attenuation of s2 resulted in the sharp increase in msf s2 along the channel the amplitude of msf was equal to that of the principal tide s2 approximately 30 km from the river mouth which is regarded as the location of rllw in this river network the msf became dominant and the lowest low water levels clearly occurred during neap tides upriver from this point the decadal mean msf s2 ratios along two branches are shown in fig 11 the msf s2 amplified monotonically upstream and a steeper increasing slope was observed in the upper part of the river network the point at which the amplitude of msf was equal to that of s2 msf s2 1 was located near around xinjiapu and dongguan in the northern and southern channels respectively during the 1960s and 1970s this point began to move upstream after the 1980s and extended beyond shilong after the 1990s indicating that occurrence of the the lowest low waters on neaps at shilong has decreased since the 1990s the movement of the transition point in the northern channel increased over time and the most movement was detected between the 1980s and 1990s this phenomenon was not observed in the southern channel due to the lack of data obtained by dongguan station 3 4 natural and anthropogenic impacts on tides section 3 3 have shown that the changing tides during the study period are responsible for transition of the lowest low water level this section examines the possible causes of these changes including natural influences both variations of discharge and sea level rise and anthropogenic impacts 3 4 1 impact of river discharge river discharge plays an important role in tidal dynamics by damping the amplitude modulating tidal interactions and dissipating energy zhang et al 2009 2010 reported that the variations in the annual mean river discharge from boluo were small and steady and no clear trend was detected according to the results of the mk test and linear regression the annual mean discharge has been smaller in recent decades than that of two other tributaries in the pearl river system zhang et al 2018 therefore annual variations in discharge had a very limited impact on the long term trends of the tidal variables however seasonal changes of river discharge at boluo are significant and not negligible to further explore the influence of seasonal variations in discharge on tidal amplitude cwt analysis was conducted to observed water level series at shilong in 2011 fig s4 see the supporting information the d1 and d2 tidal energy were almost constant in 2011 simultaneously seasonal variance of the fortnightly signal d1 14 was significant the d1 14 gained strength at high river discharges especially around the 200th day and 300th day thus the d1 14 is more sensitive to river discharge than the principle tides in the east river networks the monthly averaged d2 d1 14 amplitudes at shilong were calculated on the basis of eq 3 during 1992 2012 and the relationship between tidal amplitudes and corresponding river discharge from boluo are shown in fig 12 the amplitude of d2 decreased as discharge increase while the amplitude of d1 14 increased as the river discharge increased indicating that higher discharge dampened the principle tides d2 but enhanced the fortnightly signal d1 14 at shilong the linear regression indicates that the increasing slope of d1 14 is larger than the decreasing slope of d2 with river discharge indicating that changes in discharge influenced d1 14 to a greater extent than d2 this could be explained by the fact that the fresh water outflow plays a role of the frictional effect and damps principle tides like d2 along channel while the presence of the outflow generates and enhances the fortnightly tide as tides progressing upstream buschman et al 2009 hoitink and jay 2016 sassi and hoitink 2013 jay et al 2015 detailed explanations have been reported by godin 1999 who estimated u u in the friction term see eq 4 by au bu 3 a and b are coefficients determined by chebyshev polynomials the linear portion indicated by au influences the original harmonics for example k1 o1 m2 and s2 while the nonlinear portion bu 3 modifies these harmonics but produces new harmonics at higher or lower frequencies the low frequency band msf is a product of the nonlinear portion at the frequency difference of m2 and s2 amplitude of which is a function of velocities of outflow m2 and s2 therefore river flow plays a dominant part in generating msf fortnightly variations are almost negligible at the mouth of the amazon river and peak approximately 400 km from the river mouth gallo and vinzon 2005 a similar phenomenon has been observed in the yangtze river guo et al 2015 hence river discharge modulates tidal propagation in tidal rivers as it transfers energy from principle tides to subtidal tides 3 4 2 impacts of sea level rise and the nodal cycle as the gravitational forces driving the tides were almost constant over the observed timescale the msl rise is the most likely element causing tidal variations worldwide many studies have suggested that the increase in the global msl in recent centuries is a potential cause of the observed regional changes to tides jay 2009 müller 2011 müller et al 2011 müller et al 2011 reported that a 1 m increase in the msl may increase the tidal range by 1 2 based on a global model however mawdsley et al 2015 found no significant evidence to suggest that tidal variations were caused by changes in the msl based on the analysis of 220 tidal gauge stations worldwide mawdsley et al 2015 suggested that the msl is a significant mechanism at some sites but other mechanisms may be more important on regional or local scales this is the case for the east river network feng et al 2015 investigated the long term changes in the main original tides o1 k1 m2 n2 and s2 along the coast of china based on 17 tide gauge records from 1954 to 2012 and found no significant correlation between the m2 amplitude and sea level rise fig s3 see the supporting information the observed trend of the amplitude of m2 is opposite to the increasing trend of msl at the hong kong station which is a coastal gauging station near lingding bay this contrasting trend reflects that the rise in msl cannot explain the tidal variations near lingding bay or the significant tidal changes in the east river network with severe local variations the annual sea level rise of 2 9 mm in this region as reported by the state oceanic administration may only cause a 3 change in the tide according to müller therefore the influence of sea level rise on the tide in this region is minor the 18 6 year nodal cycle caused by the precession of the lunar ascending node may also impact on tides shaw and tsimplis 2010 haigh et al 2011 feng et al 2015 the nodal modulation of m2 had a value of 5 cm at the eastern atlantic coast and approximately 1 1 cm within the mediterranean sea shaw and tsimplis 2010 to assess the nodal impacts in the east river network the method of feng et al 2015 is applied the nodal impacts on the constituents are significant only when the following assumptions are both true first the amplitude of the estimated nodal modulation α n of each constituent should be greater than the corresponding root mean square rms second at least 50 of the variance is explained here α n rms and the explained variance are the results of a nodal modulation model this method took the amplitudes and phases of m2 as examples table s1 see the supporting information the rms values of all stations exceeded α n demonstrating that the nodal impacts on m2 within the east river network were not significant the nodal cycles of tidal constituents were significant at off shore stations feng et al 2015 but decreased sharply in the delta channel networks due to the influence of many confounding factors such as river discharge and bathymetry matte et al 2013 3 4 3 impact of topographic changes the rapid evolution of the bathymetry in the channel networks provides another explanation for the changing tides in the east river networks many studies have indicated that morphological changes under human intervention are wide spread and can significantly alter tidal levels chernetsky et al 2010 jay 1991 vriend 1991 zhang et al 2010 this is especially apparent in the the east river network prior to modification the east river network was shallow however disordered sand excavation increased its depth and resulted in the formation of multiple branches collectively the significant lowering of the riverbed has been explored between 1988 and 2002 luo et al 2007 and the average depth of the east river network has increased by approximately 1 5 4 6 m during this period table 3 the greatest variations in water depth occurred in the shilong xinjiapu reach the northern branch the channel width b changed slightly because it has been constrained by dikes constructed in the past fifty years the times of the changes in water depth were coincident with significant changes in four major constituents k1 o1 m2 and s2 at shilong and xinjiapu where there was a major increase in the tidal amplitude during the initial sand excavation period of the mid 1980s topographic variations influence tidal wave propagation in channels in serval ways first topographic funneling directly impacts the amplitude of tidal waves jay 1991 green 1837 and jay 1991 revealed that tidal transport depends on the channel width and depth an increase in channel depth increases tidal transport thereby increasing the tidal amplitude however topographic funneling is only a part of the image tidal amplitude also depends on the strength of friction at the river bed friedrichs and aubrey 1994 jay 1991 and tidal energy increases with a decrease in friction to further elucidate the impacts of increased water depths on tides the tidally averaged momentum equation which can be simplified to a balance between the pressure gradient and friction buschman et al 2009 hoitink and jay 2016 is analyzed in this section 4 g z x c d u u h where the overbars denote the tidal average z is the water surface elevation xis the landward longitudinal distance u is the cross sectional averaged velocity g is the acceleration due to gravity cd is a drag coefficient and h is the water depth the right section of this equation is the friction term with this balance the water surface slope would be decreased by an increase in the channel depth for a given river runoff in addition to changes in the water depth excessive sand excavation also reduces the effective cd of the channel by reducing the sinuosity and removing sand waves jay et al 2011 the hardening of river banks might also reduce the effective friction ralston et al 2019 increased tidal velocity due to changes in depth may enhance the friction term which would partially offset the effect of channel deepening and increase the effective drag however the reduction in friction caused by channel deepening has overwhelmed any increase in cd in many cases such as the hudson ralston et al 2019 columbia jay et al 2011 and ems river jensen et al 2003 therefore a reduction in friction due to sand excavation controlled the water level and increased tidal amplitude in recent decades variations in u may also have contributed to this change variation in bottom friction could also be reflected by the water level slope which can be derived from the observed water level sassi and hoitink 2013 cai et al 2018 fig 13 compares the water level slope before and after sand excavation in the northern branch of the river which increased as the river flow increased the considerable decrease in water level slope at a given discharge indicates that the frictional effect was sharply decreased after sand dredging thus sand excavation reduces friction astronomical constituents k1 o1 m2 and s2 were the major source of tidal wave energy entering this river network the significant decrease in friction along the channel slows the dissipation of tidal energy explaining the farther propagation and significant increase of major astronomical tides upstream at shilong and xinjiapu in recent decades therefore the reduction in bottom friction caused by excessive sand excavation concentrated tidal energy increased the amplitude of major tides and modified the evolution of the rllw 3 5 implication of the evolution of rllw for delta jay et al 2015 defined the tidal river boundary with rllw in the columbia river where the lowest low water level occurred during neap tides instead of spring tides this definition is of practical importance because upstream of this point subtidal variations are dominant while the principle tides are dominant downstream of this point thus the rllw provided an estimate of the division between tidal and fluvial dominance in a tidal system the evolution of the rllw between neap and spring tides reflects the variations in the tidal and fluvial dominant zones which exert important influences on regional ecosystems and navigation channels this division of the tidal and fluvial dominant parts by the rllw is universal and has also been applied to the yangtze river guo et al 2015 where the reversal location is over 100 km landward of the river mouth prior to sand excavation in the east river network the lowest low water level occurred during neap tides rather than spring tides upstream of xinjiapu 30 km from river mouth due to the attenuation of principal tidal species and amplification of the fortnightly tide however the transition of the lowest low water level has moved upstream of shilong in recent years the evolution of the rllw suggests that the tidal dominant part in the east river network is expanded due to excessive sand excavation consequently the timing when ships enter the port by the tide changes saline water intrudes farther landward mao et al 2004 jia et al 2007 and freshwater intake pumps do not function well cai et al 2018 furthermore the evolution of the rllw mainly caused by morphological changes may affect delta morphology by a feedback mechanism coastal and estuarine processes play an important role in sediment transport and delta morphology expansion of tidal dominant part and stronger incident waves may increase the import of sediment from the coast the turbidity of estuarine turbidity maximum etm would be reinforced and location of which may change as a result of stronger incident waves however the relationship between etm and delta development still remains largely unexplored to date hoitink et al 2017 and further researches will be required in the future in depth survey of sediment transport and delta morphology calls for analysis of tidal current asymmetry small changes in tidal current may alter sediment transport significantly because sediment transport is proportional to a third power of tidal current postma 1961 dronkers 1986 evolution of rllw in deltas could be only one of the react that deltas accommodated to human interference it costs deltas centuries rather than decades to adapt themselves to human induced changes hoitink et al 2017 4 conclusions the lowest low water levels shift from spring to neap tides as they propagate inland which is regarded as the reversal of the lowest low waters rllw observations obtained at upstream station in the east river network show that the lowest low waters have occurred more frequently during springs in recent years to understand the evolution of the rllw in the east river network the t tide model was applied to extract the amplitudes and phases of tidal constituents based on data observed at five stations throughout the river networks the reduction in the probability of the lowest low waters occurring during neaps was proved significant at shilong whether the lowest low water level occurs during neaps or springs depends on subtidal oscillations and variations in the principle tides harmonic analysis demonstrated that in recent decades the amplitudes of the principle tides k1 o1 m2 and s2 sharply increased at upstream stations particularly in the 1980s and 1990s additionally the dissipation of daily tides slowed as they traveled in channels allowing them to propagate further in contrast the fortnightly tide msf grows farther inland and its amplitudes at the stations have changed slightly in the long term therefore variations in the principle tides are responsible for the evolution of the rllw in this river network the amplitude ratios between msf and s2 were applied to estimate the change point of the lowest low waters at shilong in recent decades and the location of the rllw along the channels the amplitude ratio at shilong continuously declined until 1990 which is the lowest low water change point the location of the rllw along the channel where the msf s2 amplitude ratio was equal to 1 moved upstream in the study period and it even extended beyond shilong in the 2000s indicating that the tidal dominated zone has expanded in the past decades to further elucidate the possible causes of the changing daily tides the impacts of river discharge sea level rise 18 6 year nodal cycle and topographic changes were also discussed cwt analysis revealed that the influence of annual variations in river discharge on the long term evolution of the astronomical tidal amplitudes was very limited while the fortnightly tides were more sensitive to discharge the impacts of sea level rise and the 18 6 year nodal cycle were negligible when compared to the topographic changes in the east river network the water level slopes before and after sand excavation were analyzed to estimate the variations in the friction term caused by topographic changes the increase in water depth in recent decades reduced the friction term and slowed down the dissipation of tidal energy forcing the astronomical tidal amplitude to increase in summary the extensive sand excavation occurring in the east river network lead to the evolution of rllw credit authorship contribution statement xiaoya luo conceptualization writing original draft

interval trigonometrical function is applied to two high and two low water levels water levels z are model as z t z 1 z 2 2 sin π t t 1 t 2 t 1 0 5 π q π z 1 z 2 2 where t denotes time t1 and t2 are the start and end time respectively z1 and z2 are water levels at t t1 and t t2 respectively q is the coefficient defined as q 1 z 1 z 2 0 z 1 z 2 hourly observed water levels at shilong and sishengwei during 2010 2011 provided by guangdong hydrological bureau are applied for validation of this interpolation the agreement of hourly observed water levels and interpolations of trigonometrical function of high and low water levels is presented in fig a1 the pearson correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are calculated to validate the performance of trigonometrical interpolation results show that the interpolated water level is in well agreement with the measured water level in the upstream shilong and downstream sishengwei with r larger than 0 98 and rmse 0 09 m the fast fourier transform fft is applied to both interpolated and observed time series for comparison of power spectrum fig a2 shows that the frequency structure predicted by interpolation matches the observed one well at d1 d2 d4 and d1 14 although there is some discrepancy in the lower annual frequency band at sishengwei the frequency structure predicted by trigonometrical interpolation performs well for the objective of this paper besides tidal amplitudes and phases of interpolated and observed time series are also compared in fig a3 tidal properties of interpolated time series are overall slightly larger than the observed ones in both upstream and downstream except for the overtide m4 as for the amplitude of m4 the interpolated is smaller than the observed due to its high frequency moreover m4 is the smallest constituents at shilong the largest difference in amplitudes occur in m2 at shilong which is about 10 of its value and the largest difference in phases occurs in m4 at sishengwei the interpolated amplitude ratio between msf and s2 is smaller than the observed at the inland station shilong because of slightly larger s2 and smaller msf while msf s2 amplitude ratio at the seaward station sishengwei changes a little because the interpolated amplitudes of msf and s2 are both slightly larger despite of discrepancy in predicting higher frequency band 1 hour interval trigonometrical interpolation is capable to reconstruct hourly water levels this method is very useful for analysis of low sampling frequency water levels especially when two high and two low water levels are recorded only appendix b the performance of t tide model is assessed by the root mean square error r and the skill score s wu et al 2011 for observed and predicted water levels the model performance is excellent at s 0 65 good at 0 5 s 0 65 and poor at s 0 2 marechal 2004 the root mean square errors are acceptable with a mean value of 0 31 m the average skill score for water level is 0 69 showing that the model performance is excellent although the values are around 0 5 at some stations the performance is good to assess the suitability of t tide for river discharge we applied nonstationary mode of harmonic analysis nsha this method which has been applied to the yangtze river estuary guo et al 2015 is conducted on water level at specific river discharge ranges with t tide specifically the nsha was conducted on the water level at shilong when the river runoff at boluo was between 700 and 1400 m3 s for example the discontinuous observed data were analyzed however as there were fewer flow points higher than 2800 m3 s they were not analyzed owing to data length limits at each discharge range the fortnightly tide msf are not included in fig b1 the m2 amplitudes decreased at shilong from 0 44 m at a river discharge below 700 m3 s to 0 32 m at a discharge of 2100 2800 m3 s fig b1 similar trends were detected for the amplitudes of s2 and k1 however o1 and m4 behave differently with river discharge o1 amplitude increased slightly with discharge and m4 amplitude increased and then decreased increment in o1 amplitude may be due to energy transfer from m2 and k1 to o1 through the m2 k1 o1 triad interactions parker 1991 guo et al 2015 stronger nonlinear interaction under higher discharge is responsible for increment in m4 when river discharge is relatively small but higher discharge will dissipate m4 as a frictional effect godin 1999 godin and martinez 1994 the average amplitude error of m2 was 0 032 m which is 10 of its amplitude the errors of m2 amplitudes increased with discharge and were highest at a discharge of 1400 2100 m3 s and then decreased which may be due to shorter data length at discharge higher than 2100 m3 s the average amplitude error of k1 was 0 04 m which is approximately 15 of its amplitude the errors in the amplitude of k1 increased with discharge ranging from 0 034 m at a discharge below 700 m3 s to 0 044 m when the discharge was between 2100 and 2800 m3 s amplitude errors of other constituents are around the magnitude of 0 01 m mean msf amplitude errors increased along the channel ranging from 12 to 18 of its amplitude fig s1 see the supporting information the largest error of 0 02 m was observed at shilong from 1963 to 2012 which is approximately 16 of the amplitude of msf macmahan et al 2014 reported that an error of 0 02 m in the msf amplitude at new river inlet nc usa which was 13 of its amplitude indicated good model performance therefore the msf amplitude errors in this study were acceptable overall the application of the t tide model to the east river network is reasonable and reliable appendix c supplementary data supplementary data to this

5534,the lowest low waters usually occur during spring tides in tide dominated coastal environments however they could also occur during neaps rather than springs at more landward stations and this phenomenon isknownas the reversal of the lowest low waters rllw the rllw greatly depends on subtidal and daily oscillations in the water level the evolutions of which along a channel are of considerable importance in navigation safety and freshwater intake observations collected at an inland hydrological station shilong in the networks of the east river china show that the lowest low water level previously occurred during neaps but now occurs during springs to elucidate the causes of this evolution t tide was used to extract constituents from water level records collected over the past fifty years at five stations in this river network system including astronomical constituents overtides and fortnightly tides the results show that the astronomical constituents were significantly amplified in the upstream stations while the fortnightly tide msf decreased slightly in the long term physically channel deepening caused by excessive sand excavation has increased the water depth and reduced the effective drag in the friction term of the momentum balance the reduced frictional effect reflected by the residual water level slope is responsible for the significant increase in the astronomical tidal amplitudes however they were not strongly influenced by long term variations in river runoff and sea level rise the amplitude ratio between msf and s2 was used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of rllw this ratio at shilong continuously decreased over time and the location where the ratio was 1 moved upstream indicating that the rllw has traveled farther inland in recent decades the evolution of the rllw in the east river network implies that the tidal dominant zone has enlarged in recent decades keywords reversal of the lowest low waters east river sand excavation frictional effect msf s2 amplitude ratio river runoff 1 introduction several studies conducted on deltas and estuaries revealed that variations in the elevation of water and tidal properties are primarily governed by alterations in the landward seaward and geometric boundaries vellinga et al 2014 hoitink and jay 2016 the water level in estuaries is affected by coastal processes astronomical tides river flow and other external forces and their relative importance changes along the estuary jay et al 2015 2016 water level variations also play an important role in the estuarine environment for example the impacts of subtidal water level variations particularly fortnightly oscillations on wetland inundation and navigation are not negligible buschman et al 2009 hoitink and jay 2016 sassi and hoitink 2013 jay et al 2015 in this study subtidal variations refer to water level fluctuations over periods significantly longer than one day hoitink and jay 2016 jay et al 2015 suggested that subtidal oscillations should be considered when defining the seaward boundary of the tidal rivers upstream of the boundary the lowest low water levels occur during neap tides instead of spring tides which is regarded as the reversal of the lowest low waters rllw variations in the lowest low water levels affect tidal freshwater wetlands bunn and arthington 2002 wolanski 2007 and navigation channels jay et al 2011 therefore it is essential and practically important to better understand the rllw and its corresponding hydrological processes previous studies have shown that subtidal nonlinear oscillations larger than the daily tidal variations are responsible for the rllw hoitink and jay 2016 jay et al 2011 2016 subtidal surface variations could reach the point where the diurnal and semidiurnal tides are extinct godin and martinez 1994 thus they even greatly influence the inland water levels the fortnightly tide msf one of the key constituents of subtidal tides is forced in shallow water by river tide interactions in analytical one dimensional models leblond 1979 kukulka and jay 2003 buschman et al 2009 demonstrated that river tide interactions are the main factor inducing fortnightly subtidal water level variations by decomposing the subtidal friction term which is significant in the subtidal momentum balance into the contributions of river flow river tide interactions and tide motions based on the observed data and a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model gallo and vinzon 2005 analyzed the propagation of msf and its impact on water levels in the amazon river hoitink and jay 2016 summarized the features of fortnightly tides and their effect on water levels according to hoitink and jay 1 the msf oscillation is generated by interaction between the semidiurnal constituents m2 and s2 2 as it has a long wavelength the msf persists over long distances up to locations where the astronomical constituents have disappeared without decay 3 the msf lowers the daily mean water levels on neap tides and rises them on spring tides at locations where the amplitude of msf is equal or larger than of s2 the lowest low water levels occur during neap tides rather than spring tides this phenomenon has been observed in the yangtze guo et al 2015 saint lawrence matte et al 2014 and amazon rivers gallo and vinzon 2005 tidal river networks occupy the junctions between oceans and rivers which are among the most prosperous and densely populated regions of the world however the threats of deltaic sinking due to sea level rise and subsidence due to human activities are becoming increasingly severe and apparent syvitski et al 2009 the impact of sea level rise has received great interest due to climate change and the mean sea level msl will increase by 2 m worldwide in the 21st century nicholls and cazenave 2010 changes in the msl may affect changes and variations in tides ross et al 2017 feng et al 2015 jay 2009 xu and huang 2013 however the influence of the relative msl rise on channel morphology is more often overwhelmed by human activities vellinga et al 2014 the effects of construction on the water level and tides including sand excavation land reclamation dam construction and reservoirs can be regarded as abrupt alterations for work to be conducted in the future while the effects of sea level rise are gradual and minor at inland stations vellinga et al 2014 many deltas are currently enduring intense human activity syvitski et al 2009 syvitski and saito 2007 in the delaware river the depth was increased from 6 1 to 12 2 m which contributed to faster wave propagation and doubled tidal ranges during 1910 1983 dilorenzo et al 1993 by assessing the historic tidal datum levels changes in the columbia river jay et al 2011 suggested that variations in tides were due to a combination of changing ocean tides and local alterations in the pearl river delta the phenomenon of increasing water levels in the middle and lower reaches but decreasing levels in the landward reaches is ascribed to channel deepening caused by excessive sand excavation zhang et al 2009 a similar conclusion was drawn from the rhine meuse delta vellinga et al 2014 to date many studies have noted the contribution of human activities to the long term changes and trends of mean water levels but few have considered the evolution of the rllw the networks of the east river fig 1 in southern china are the third largest river networks in the pearl river delta which is a typical delta that has endured severe anthropogenic impacts in the recent decades due to economic boom and rapid urbanization moreover as it is a fresh water source for many metropolises such as shenzhen and hong kong the water quality jiang et al 2009 jin 2001 and low water level changes jia et al 2006 in this delta have received great attention however no studies have yet concentrated on the changes in the lowest lower water level and their causes the lowest low water levels usually occur during spring tides in the seaward reaches of rivers and in the landward reaches during neap tides during the 1970s and 1980s the low water level at the shilong hydrological station which is located in the upstream region of the east river network during neap tides was much lower than that during spring tides in a 15 day cycle fig 2 however the lowest low water level had mostly occurred during spring tides since the 1990s and the tidal range and daily mean water level at shilong are larger and lower than they were before 1990 respectively fig 2 furthermore the trends in the annual mean water level and tidal range in the upper and lower parts of this river network have changed in the long term fig 3 the water level has decreased sharply in the upstream stations xinjiapu shilong and dongguan but increased slightly in the downstream area sishengwei dasheng after 1990 the tidal ranges at shilong and xinjiapu became approximately three times larger than those before the 1980s however no obvious changes have been observed at the seaward stations these abrupt changes and distinct trends could be explained by the great and uneven sand excavation in the east river network according to previous studies jia et al 2007 luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 in this paper we take notice of the evolution of rllw in the east river networks and focus on the influences of morphologic changes on this phenomenon the remainder of this article is organized as follows materials and methods are presented in section 2 in order to analyze tidal properties harmonic analysis t tide model and continuous wavelet transform cwt are applied to long time series of observed data results and discussions are in section 3 according to previous investigation mentioned above the reason that the lowest low water level changes abruptly could be related to damping or amplification of subtidal and principle constituents therefore we analyze the temporal and spatial variability of tidal properties from section 3 1 to 3 3 moreover the natural and anthropogenic impacts on tides are discussed in section 3 4 and the implication of the evolution of rllw are explored in section 3 5 conclusions and summaries are drawn in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of 319 5 km2 jia et al 2007 the east river network is the third largest river network in the pearl river delta located in guangdong province china the east river debouches into the funnel shaped lingding bay through the humen outlet the tide in lingding bay mainly originates from the pacific oceanic tidal propagation through the luzon strait mao et al 2004 which is mixed and is mainly semidiurnal with a tidal form number f ak1 ao1 am2 as2 ak1 ao1 as2 and am2 indicates the amplitude of k1 o1 s2 and m2 ranging from 0 94 to 1 77 mao et al 2004 the tidal range near four outlets humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen varies from 1 0 to 1 5 m therefore the estuary has a micro tidal regime the astronomical tidal amplitudes m2 s2 k1 and o1 at the estuary mouth hong kong increase slowly despite m2 which has decreased by approximately 0 3 mm per year in recent decades feng et al 2015 amplitudes of major constituents at the humen outlet have exhibited a slightly increasing trend over the past 50 years zhang et al 2018 however slightly decreasing trends have been detected at stations dasheng and sishengwei near the mouth of the east river two main branches of the river network separate near shilong station 38 km from the river mouth i e the northern and southern branches xinjiapu 30 km from the river mouth and dasheng 2 km from the river mouth and dongguan 28 km from the river mouth and sishengwei 2 km from the river mouth were selected as study stations in the northern and southern branches respectively the mean river discharge at the boluo upstream station is approximately 719 m3 s the annual mean of which has changed slightly in recent decades zhang et al 2009 2010 2018 the river discharge partition rates are approximately 0 57 and 0 43 in the southern and northern branches according to field measurements collected by the guangdong hydrological bureau respectively owing to rapid economic growth that has occurred since the 1980s a large amount of sand has been extracted from the river channels to meet the demands of urbanization as a consequence of the excessive sand excavation the river bed of the east river network has been significantly and unevenly lowered with its average depth change ranging from 1 77 to 6 48 m luo et al 2007 the upward river bed slope from the outlet has been reduced to almost zero natural siltation in the network is approximately 0 33 m m3 yr and sediment transport from boluo was approximately 1 97 m m3 yr between 1980 and 2002 approximately 3 32 billion m3 of sand has been extracted from the lower reaches of the east river between 1980 and 2002 which is 7 5 times more than the amount of sediment transported from boluo jia et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 2 2 data overview long term water level data obtained for 5 stations along the northern and southern branches of the east river networks was extracted from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china hydrological stations in the delta denoted by black dots in fig 1 kept records of two high and two low water levels each 24 84 hr day and the corresponding record lengths are shown in table 1 error data including spurious and glitches was removed after visual check all water level records were converted to pearl river datum and 1 hour interval trigonometrical interpolation was applied to generate the water level data for harmonic analysis see appendix a daily mean river discharge between 1984 and 2012 at boluo are used for analysis 2 3 harmonic analysis following the method reported by pawlowicz et al 2002 the tidal heights were modeled using the t tide program as a sum of a sinusoidal wave with different frequencies nodal corrections were performed and detailed validation of the method are shown in appendix b in this study we extracted the m2 s2 k1 o1 m4 and msf properties for a time series of one year time using t tide the diurnal k1 and o1 and semidiurnal m2 and s2 tides are the major constituents of the pearl river system mao et al 2004 wong et al 2003 m4 and msf the overtide and the compound tide of m2 dominate the non linear signature of the estuaries friedrichs and aubrey 1988 the fortnightly constituent msf is the main factor resulting in the occurrence of the lowest low water level during neap tides 2 4 the continuous wavelet transform to understand the impacts of discharge on tides the continuous wavelet transform cwt is applied to the time series of water levels the cwt extracts the frequency content of a signal as a function of time it can resolve time series that containing nonstationary processes as for a discrete time series xj the corresponding wavelet transform is 1 w n s j 1 n x j ψ j n δ t s where s is the scale or frequency j and n are the time series δ t is the uniform time step 1 h in this research and n is the length of time series ψ is a mother wavelet function that has unit energy at each scale s and the asterisk indicates a complex conjugate the morlet wavelet function is applied in tidal fluvial process analysis the morlet function reads as 2 ψ t π 1 4 exp 6 i t t 2 2 where t is dimensionless time being different from harmonic analysis cwt calculate amplitudes of tidal species by eq 3 which is a group of tidal constituents with similar frequencies e g the diurnal semidiurnal and quarter diurnal bands namely d1 d2 d4 respectively 3 a di s 1 i s 2 i w s 2 2 π s d s s di where adi is the amplitude of tidal species di i 1 2 4 1 14 indicating diurnal semidiurnal quarter diurnal and fortnightly tidal species sdi refers to the predetermined scale of tidal species di s 1 i and s 2 i are the lower and upper bounds of scale range of the tidal species di 2 5 the mann kendall and pettitt tests to detect the trends and trend breaks of tidal harmonics different methods of analysis are combined in this paper a linear regression method is applied to quantify the long term linear trends in time series and the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is employed for statistical significance of these trends the modified pre whitening procedure kulkarni and von storch 1995 von storch 1999 before the mk test is applied to limit the impact of serial correlation moreover the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is used here to evaluate change points in a time series 3 results and discussions 3 1 temporal tidal variations in order to figure out the reasons for the evolution of rllw temporal and spatial evolutions of tidal constituents are displayed in this and the following sections time series of the diurnal k1 and o1 semidiurnal m2 and s2 quarter diurnal m4 and fortnightly constituents msf are presented in figs 4 6 respectively 3 1 1 variations in astronomical constituents the gauge observations of the northern and southern branches exhibit great variations in the astronomical tides the variations of k1 o1 m2 and s2 were similar with a marked increase in the amplitudes and sharp decline in the phases occurring at landward stations shilong and xinjiapu but slight changes at seaward stations between 1960 and 2012 figs 4 and 5 as shown in table 2 according to the mk trend results the diurnal tidal amplitude has slowly decreased at dasheng and sishengwei and significantly increased at the upstream stations xinjiapu and shilong with magnitudes of approximately 0 003 m yr the maximal amplitude at the upstream stations was observed in 1992 the amplification occurring from 1980 to 1990 contributed to the increasing trend at the landward stations for example the increment in the amplitude of k1 between 1980 and 1990 was approximately 0 02 m per year at shilong while the increment was almost zero before the 1980s and after the 1990s fig 4 the amplitudes of k1 with an average value of 0 4 m at the most seaward station were consistently slightly higher than those of o1 one possible explanation for this is the different impacts of m2 on k1 and o1 under strong bottom friction godin and martinez 1994 matte et al 2014 furthermore the largest variations in amplitude between the most seaward and landward stations of k1 and o1 were 0 34 and 0 25 m respectively indicating that k1 was dampened more rapidly than o1 the higher frequency of k1 was possibly responsible for the higher amplitude damping rate godin 1999 the annual mean amplitudes and phases for the two main semidiurnal constituents m2 and s2 which are the main factors in generating fortnightly tides are shown in fig 5 hoitink and jay 2016 gallo and vinzon 2005 the largest constituent m2 had an amplitude of 0 61 0 74 m while the amplitude of s2 was approximately one third of that of m2 the trend of the annual amplitude of m2 was more significantly positive than that of s2 according to results of the mk test shown in table 2 the amplitudes of m2 and s2 at the seaward stations exhibited subtle and negative trends table 2 the patterns of the amplitudes of m2 and s2 at landward stations were more variable than those at the seaward stations the observations collected at xinjiapu and shilong exhibit distinct amplification from 1980 to 1990 during which the amplitudes of m2 and s2 more than tripled the marked increase in the diurnal and semidiurnal tides coincided with the excavation of sand from the channels according to theory excessive excavation will not only increase channel depth but it will also decrease the effective drag coefficient thereby decreasing the bottom friction and increasing the amplitude friedrichs 2010 friedrichs and aubrey 1994 jay 1991 moreover the results of the pettitt test in table 2 show that all significant change points of the tidal amplitudes occurred around 1985 which corresponds to the change point of the lowest low water level reported in section 3 2 phase represents the timing of the tide the phases increased in the landward direction for all astronomical constituents figs 4 and 5 indicating that the tide propagated slower upstream the phases decreased over time at specific stations for example those at shilong shifted from 90 to 30 for k1 and from 130 to 60 for m2 in recent decades variations in the phases of semidiurnal constituents were larger than those of diurnal constituents and the phase shifts were more variable at the landward stations dongguan xinjiapu and shilong whereas the seaward stations reported relatively stable phases this suggests that tidal propagation was accelerated within the river channels in recent decades 3 1 2 variations in overtides and compound tides as the amplitude was approximately 0 1 m the m2 s2 generated compound tide msf is important to this study the fortnightly tide msf exhibited an almost constant amplitude decrease slightly at all stations during the study period fig 6 according to previous studies hoitink and jay 2016 buschman et al 2009 msf is the dominant factor causing the rllw from springs to neaps as a greater surface level slope is required to compensate for the larger landward stokes drift during spring tides giese and jay 1989 buschman et al 2009 however the lowest low waters at shilong have not always occurred on neaps after the 1990s owing to the almost constant msf amplitude thus fortnightly and astronomical tides must be compared to better understand the evolution of rllw to further explore the rllw phenomenon the ratios between the amplitudes of msf and m2 and msf and s2 at the most landward and seaward stations are presented in fig 7 the msf m2 and msf s2 amplitude ratios greatly exceeded 1 before 1979 and 1990 at shilong respectively indicating that the msf amplitude increased beyond that of the semidiurnal tides the msf m2 and msf s2 amplitude ratios decreased sharply at shilong before the 1980s and 1990s respectively while the ratios at the most seaward station sishengwei were relatively constant although the msf amplitude was larger than that of m2 in the 1960s and 1970s the msf amplitude at shilong has only been approximately 20 of the amplitude of m2 since the 1990s this suggests that the dissipation of the energy of m2 slows in the sishengwei shilong reach the southern branch and it could propagate farther upstream than before as msf has slightly decreased the msf s2 amplitude ratios at shilong were larger and decreased more rapidly than the msf m2 ratios since 1990 the msf s2 amplitude ratios at shilong have declined to approximately 1 which has since remained the same indicating that s2 overwhelmed msf after this period this coincides with the abrupt change in the lowest low water level discussed in section 3 2 at the location where the increase in the msf amplitude was equal to that of the principle tides i e s2 the lowest low water level reversed from springs to neaps hoitink and jay 2016 guo et al 2015 as observed at shilong previously fig 2 therefore the evolution of rllw at shilong station can be attributed to the rapid attenuation of msf s2 the rapidly increasing s2 and m2 are responsible for the attenuation of the ratios because the amplitude of msf was almost constant during the study period fig s2 see the supporting information presents the annual mean amplitudes of m4 at five stations with its magnitude smaller than 0 05 m the amplitude of m4 was relatively minor compared to the astronomical and fortnightly tides m4 exhibited an almost constant amplitudes at all the stations except for a small increase at shilong hence m4 is of relatively subtle importance in analyzing the evolution of rllw 3 2 subtidal variations fig 8 presents the instantaneous and daily averaged water levels from 1970 to 1971 at five stations along the two branches the daily mean water level was systematically lower during neap tides than spring tides between xinjiapu and shilong in the northern branch and between dongguan and shilong in the southern branch while this was less evident at dasheng and sishengwei this phenomenon suggests that the fortnightly subtidal water level variations in the upstream region of the east river network are strong in a tide dominated coastal environment both the highest and lowest water levels occur during spring tides however this is not true for the lowest low water level within a delta thus there must be a transition point for the lowest low water level along the channels of the network which may have been located between the landward stations and seaward stations during 1970 and 1971 this scenario changed after the 1990s the river network appears to have become tide dominated as the lowest low water levels occurred more frequently during spring tides at shilong station fig 2 the annual probability of the lowest low water level occurring on a neap tide at shilong was calculated using data from the past 50 years fig 9 and the mann kendall mk and the pettitt tests were applied to evaluate the significance of the trend and abrupt changes in the probability the average probability was 48 before the 1980s while that after the 1990s was 25 the occurrence of the lowest low water levels during neap tides decreased by half during this period the mk test shows that the probability decreased 0 79 per year with a confidence level of over 99 7 demonstrating a clear tide dominated trend at shilong according to the results of the pettitt test the change point occurred in 1987 with a significance level of at over 99 which corresponds to the observations presented in fig 2 3 3 spatial variations of tides the profiles of the amplitudes of the main constituents i e m2 s2 k1 o1 m4 and msf along the northern and southern branches and the msf s2 amplitude ratio are displayed in fig 10 the astronomical tides in the two main branches were both damped with increasing distance inland the amplitudes of m2 decreased by 58 and 59 cm along the northern and southern channels respectively and it was dissipated more strongly and rapidly than any of the other constituents the diurnal tides k1 and o1 and the secondary semidiurnal constituent s2 exhibited similar amplitude damping rates the damping rates of the astronomical tides increased as the tidal wave propagated inland in contrast the amplitude of the overtide m4 varied slightly along the channel and the compound tide msf increased monotonically the msf was highest at shilong and its magnitude was the same as that of the principal tides the amplification of msf and attenuation of s2 resulted in the sharp increase in msf s2 along the channel the amplitude of msf was equal to that of the principal tide s2 approximately 30 km from the river mouth which is regarded as the location of rllw in this river network the msf became dominant and the lowest low water levels clearly occurred during neap tides upriver from this point the decadal mean msf s2 ratios along two branches are shown in fig 11 the msf s2 amplified monotonically upstream and a steeper increasing slope was observed in the upper part of the river network the point at which the amplitude of msf was equal to that of s2 msf s2 1 was located near around xinjiapu and dongguan in the northern and southern channels respectively during the 1960s and 1970s this point began to move upstream after the 1980s and extended beyond shilong after the 1990s indicating that occurrence of the the lowest low waters on neaps at shilong has decreased since the 1990s the movement of the transition point in the northern channel increased over time and the most movement was detected between the 1980s and 1990s this phenomenon was not observed in the southern channel due to the lack of data obtained by dongguan station 3 4 natural and anthropogenic impacts on tides section 3 3 have shown that the changing tides during the study period are responsible for transition of the lowest low water level this section examines the possible causes of these changes including natural influences both variations of discharge and sea level rise and anthropogenic impacts 3 4 1 impact of river discharge river discharge plays an important role in tidal dynamics by damping the amplitude modulating tidal interactions and dissipating energy zhang et al 2009 2010 reported that the variations in the annual mean river discharge from boluo were small and steady and no clear trend was detected according to the results of the mk test and linear regression the annual mean discharge has been smaller in recent decades than that of two other tributaries in the pearl river system zhang et al 2018 therefore annual variations in discharge had a very limited impact on the long term trends of the tidal variables however seasonal changes of river discharge at boluo are significant and not negligible to further explore the influence of seasonal variations in discharge on tidal amplitude cwt analysis was conducted to observed water level series at shilong in 2011 fig s4 see the supporting information the d1 and d2 tidal energy were almost constant in 2011 simultaneously seasonal variance of the fortnightly signal d1 14 was significant the d1 14 gained strength at high river discharges especially around the 200th day and 300th day thus the d1 14 is more sensitive to river discharge than the principle tides in the east river networks the monthly averaged d2 d1 14 amplitudes at shilong were calculated on the basis of eq 3 during 1992 2012 and the relationship between tidal amplitudes and corresponding river discharge from boluo are shown in fig 12 the amplitude of d2 decreased as discharge increase while the amplitude of d1 14 increased as the river discharge increased indicating that higher discharge dampened the principle tides d2 but enhanced the fortnightly signal d1 14 at shilong the linear regression indicates that the increasing slope of d1 14 is larger than the decreasing slope of d2 with river discharge indicating that changes in discharge influenced d1 14 to a greater extent than d2 this could be explained by the fact that the fresh water outflow plays a role of the frictional effect and damps principle tides like d2 along channel while the presence of the outflow generates and enhances the fortnightly tide as tides progressing upstream buschman et al 2009 hoitink and jay 2016 sassi and hoitink 2013 jay et al 2015 detailed explanations have been reported by godin 1999 who estimated u u in the friction term see eq 4 by au bu 3 a and b are coefficients determined by chebyshev polynomials the linear portion indicated by au influences the original harmonics for example k1 o1 m2 and s2 while the nonlinear portion bu 3 modifies these harmonics but produces new harmonics at higher or lower frequencies the low frequency band msf is a product of the nonlinear portion at the frequency difference of m2 and s2 amplitude of which is a function of velocities of outflow m2 and s2 therefore river flow plays a dominant part in generating msf fortnightly variations are almost negligible at the mouth of the amazon river and peak approximately 400 km from the river mouth gallo and vinzon 2005 a similar phenomenon has been observed in the yangtze river guo et al 2015 hence river discharge modulates tidal propagation in tidal rivers as it transfers energy from principle tides to subtidal tides 3 4 2 impacts of sea level rise and the nodal cycle as the gravitational forces driving the tides were almost constant over the observed timescale the msl rise is the most likely element causing tidal variations worldwide many studies have suggested that the increase in the global msl in recent centuries is a potential cause of the observed regional changes to tides jay 2009 müller 2011 müller et al 2011 müller et al 2011 reported that a 1 m increase in the msl may increase the tidal range by 1 2 based on a global model however mawdsley et al 2015 found no significant evidence to suggest that tidal variations were caused by changes in the msl based on the analysis of 220 tidal gauge stations worldwide mawdsley et al 2015 suggested that the msl is a significant mechanism at some sites but other mechanisms may be more important on regional or local scales this is the case for the east river network feng et al 2015 investigated the long term changes in the main original tides o1 k1 m2 n2 and s2 along the coast of china based on 17 tide gauge records from 1954 to 2012 and found no significant correlation between the m2 amplitude and sea level rise fig s3 see the supporting information the observed trend of the amplitude of m2 is opposite to the increasing trend of msl at the hong kong station which is a coastal gauging station near lingding bay this contrasting trend reflects that the rise in msl cannot explain the tidal variations near lingding bay or the significant tidal changes in the east river network with severe local variations the annual sea level rise of 2 9 mm in this region as reported by the state oceanic administration may only cause a 3 change in the tide according to müller therefore the influence of sea level rise on the tide in this region is minor the 18 6 year nodal cycle caused by the precession of the lunar ascending node may also impact on tides shaw and tsimplis 2010 haigh et al 2011 feng et al 2015 the nodal modulation of m2 had a value of 5 cm at the eastern atlantic coast and approximately 1 1 cm within the mediterranean sea shaw and tsimplis 2010 to assess the nodal impacts in the east river network the method of feng et al 2015 is applied the nodal impacts on the constituents are significant only when the following assumptions are both true first the amplitude of the estimated nodal modulation α n of each constituent should be greater than the corresponding root mean square rms second at least 50 of the variance is explained here α n rms and the explained variance are the results of a nodal modulation model this method took the amplitudes and phases of m2 as examples table s1 see the supporting information the rms values of all stations exceeded α n demonstrating that the nodal impacts on m2 within the east river network were not significant the nodal cycles of tidal constituents were significant at off shore stations feng et al 2015 but decreased sharply in the delta channel networks due to the influence of many confounding factors such as river discharge and bathymetry matte et al 2013 3 4 3 impact of topographic changes the rapid evolution of the bathymetry in the channel networks provides another explanation for the changing tides in the east river networks many studies have indicated that morphological changes under human intervention are wide spread and can significantly alter tidal levels chernetsky et al 2010 jay 1991 vriend 1991 zhang et al 2010 this is especially apparent in the the east river network prior to modification the east river network was shallow however disordered sand excavation increased its depth and resulted in the formation of multiple branches collectively the significant lowering of the riverbed has been explored between 1988 and 2002 luo et al 2007 and the average depth of the east river network has increased by approximately 1 5 4 6 m during this period table 3 the greatest variations in water depth occurred in the shilong xinjiapu reach the northern branch the channel width b changed slightly because it has been constrained by dikes constructed in the past fifty years the times of the changes in water depth were coincident with significant changes in four major constituents k1 o1 m2 and s2 at shilong and xinjiapu where there was a major increase in the tidal amplitude during the initial sand excavation period of the mid 1980s topographic variations influence tidal wave propagation in channels in serval ways first topographic funneling directly impacts the amplitude of tidal waves jay 1991 green 1837 and jay 1991 revealed that tidal transport depends on the channel width and depth an increase in channel depth increases tidal transport thereby increasing the tidal amplitude however topographic funneling is only a part of the image tidal amplitude also depends on the strength of friction at the river bed friedrichs and aubrey 1994 jay 1991 and tidal energy increases with a decrease in friction to further elucidate the impacts of increased water depths on tides the tidally averaged momentum equation which can be simplified to a balance between the pressure gradient and friction buschman et al 2009 hoitink and jay 2016 is analyzed in this section 4 g z x c d u u h where the overbars denote the tidal average z is the water surface elevation xis the landward longitudinal distance u is the cross sectional averaged velocity g is the acceleration due to gravity cd is a drag coefficient and h is the water depth the right section of this equation is the friction term with this balance the water surface slope would be decreased by an increase in the channel depth for a given river runoff in addition to changes in the water depth excessive sand excavation also reduces the effective cd of the channel by reducing the sinuosity and removing sand waves jay et al 2011 the hardening of river banks might also reduce the effective friction ralston et al 2019 increased tidal velocity due to changes in depth may enhance the friction term which would partially offset the effect of channel deepening and increase the effective drag however the reduction in friction caused by channel deepening has overwhelmed any increase in cd in many cases such as the hudson ralston et al 2019 columbia jay et al 2011 and ems river jensen et al 2003 therefore a reduction in friction due to sand excavation controlled the water level and increased tidal amplitude in recent decades variations in u may also have contributed to this change variation in bottom friction could also be reflected by the water level slope which can be derived from the observed water level sassi and hoitink 2013 cai et al 2018 fig 13 compares the water level slope before and after sand excavation in the northern branch of the river which increased as the river flow increased the considerable decrease in water level slope at a given discharge indicates that the frictional effect was sharply decreased after sand dredging thus sand excavation reduces friction astronomical constituents k1 o1 m2 and s2 were the major source of tidal wave energy entering this river network the significant decrease in friction along the channel slows the dissipation of tidal energy explaining the farther propagation and significant increase of major astronomical tides upstream at shilong and xinjiapu in recent decades therefore the reduction in bottom friction caused by excessive sand excavation concentrated tidal energy increased the amplitude of major tides and modified the evolution of the rllw 3 5 implication of the evolution of rllw for delta jay et al 2015 defined the tidal river boundary with rllw in the columbia river where the lowest low water level occurred during neap tides instead of spring tides this definition is of practical importance because upstream of this point subtidal variations are dominant while the principle tides are dominant downstream of this point thus the rllw provided an estimate of the division between tidal and fluvial dominance in a tidal system the evolution of the rllw between neap and spring tides reflects the variations in the tidal and fluvial dominant zones which exert important influences on regional ecosystems and navigation channels this division of the tidal and fluvial dominant parts by the rllw is universal and has also been applied to the yangtze river guo et al 2015 where the reversal location is over 100 km landward of the river mouth prior to sand excavation in the east river network the lowest low water level occurred during neap tides rather than spring tides upstream of xinjiapu 30 km from river mouth due to the attenuation of principal tidal species and amplification of the fortnightly tide however the transition of the lowest low water level has moved upstream of shilong in recent years the evolution of the rllw suggests that the tidal dominant part in the east river network is expanded due to excessive sand excavation consequently the timing when ships enter the port by the tide changes saline water intrudes farther landward mao et al 2004 jia et al 2007 and freshwater intake pumps do not function well cai et al 2018 furthermore the evolution of the rllw mainly caused by morphological changes may affect delta morphology by a feedback mechanism coastal and estuarine processes play an important role in sediment transport and delta morphology expansion of tidal dominant part and stronger incident waves may increase the import of sediment from the coast the turbidity of estuarine turbidity maximum etm would be reinforced and location of which may change as a result of stronger incident waves however the relationship between etm and delta development still remains largely unexplored to date hoitink et al 2017 and further researches will be required in the future in depth survey of sediment transport and delta morphology calls for analysis of tidal current asymmetry small changes in tidal current may alter sediment transport significantly because sediment transport is proportional to a third power of tidal current postma 1961 dronkers 1986 evolution of rllw in deltas could be only one of the react that deltas accommodated to human interference it costs deltas centuries rather than decades to adapt themselves to human induced changes hoitink et al 2017 4 conclusions the lowest low water levels shift from spring to neap tides as they propagate inland which is regarded as the reversal of the lowest low waters rllw observations obtained at upstream station in the east river network show that the lowest low waters have occurred more frequently during springs in recent years to understand the evolution of the rllw in the east river network the t tide model was applied to extract the amplitudes and phases of tidal constituents based on data observed at five stations throughout the river networks the reduction in the probability of the lowest low waters occurring during neaps was proved significant at shilong whether the lowest low water level occurs during neaps or springs depends on subtidal oscillations and variations in the principle tides harmonic analysis demonstrated that in recent decades the amplitudes of the principle tides k1 o1 m2 and s2 sharply increased at upstream stations particularly in the 1980s and 1990s additionally the dissipation of daily tides slowed as they traveled in channels allowing them to propagate further in contrast the fortnightly tide msf grows farther inland and its amplitudes at the stations have changed slightly in the long term therefore variations in the principle tides are responsible for the evolution of the rllw in this river network the amplitude ratios between msf and s2 were applied to estimate the change point of the lowest low waters at shilong in recent decades and the location of the rllw along the channels the amplitude ratio at shilong continuously declined until 1990 which is the lowest low water change point the location of the rllw along the channel where the msf s2 amplitude ratio was equal to 1 moved upstream in the study period and it even extended beyond shilong in the 2000s indicating that the tidal dominated zone has expanded in the past decades to further elucidate the possible causes of the changing daily tides the impacts of river discharge sea level rise 18 6 year nodal cycle and topographic changes were also discussed cwt analysis revealed that the influence of annual variations in river discharge on the long term evolution of the astronomical tidal amplitudes was very limited while the fortnightly tides were more sensitive to discharge the impacts of sea level rise and the 18 6 year nodal cycle were negligible when compared to the topographic changes in the east river network the water level slopes before and after sand excavation were analyzed to estimate the variations in the friction term caused by topographic changes the increase in water depth in recent decades reduced the friction term and slowed down the dissipation of tidal energy forcing the astronomical tidal amplitude to increase in summary the extensive sand excavation occurring in the east river network lead to the evolution of rllw credit authorship contribution statement xiaoya luo conceptualization writing original draft

interval trigonometrical function is applied to two high and two low water levels water levels z are model as z t z 1 z 2 2 sin π t t 1 t 2 t 1 0 5 π q π z 1 z 2 2 where t denotes time t1 and t2 are the start and end time respectively z1 and z2 are water levels at t t1 and t t2 respectively q is the coefficient defined as q 1 z 1 z 2 0 z 1 z 2 hourly observed water levels at shilong and sishengwei during 2010 2011 provided by guangdong hydrological bureau are applied for validation of this interpolation the agreement of hourly observed water levels and interpolations of trigonometrical function of high and low water levels is presented in fig a1 the pearson correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are calculated to validate the performance of trigonometrical interpolation results show that the interpolated water level is in well agreement with the measured water level in the upstream shilong and downstream sishengwei with r larger than 0 98 and rmse 0 09 m the fast fourier transform fft is applied to both interpolated and observed time series for comparison of power spectrum fig a2 shows that the frequency structure predicted by interpolation matches the observed one well at d1 d2 d4 and d1 14 although there is some discrepancy in the lower annual frequency band at sishengwei the frequency structure predicted by trigonometrical interpolation performs well for the objective of this paper besides tidal amplitudes and phases of interpolated and observed time series are also compared in fig a3 tidal properties of interpolated time series are overall slightly larger than the observed ones in both upstream and downstream except for the overtide m4 as for the amplitude of m4 the interpolated is smaller than the observed due to its high frequency moreover m4 is the smallest constituents at shilong the largest difference in amplitudes occur in m2 at shilong which is about 10 of its value and the largest difference in phases occurs in m4 at sishengwei the interpolated amplitude ratio between msf and s2 is smaller than the observed at the inland station shilong because of slightly larger s2 and smaller msf while msf s2 amplitude ratio at the seaward station sishengwei changes a little because the interpolated amplitudes of msf and s2 are both slightly larger despite of discrepancy in predicting higher frequency band 1 hour interval trigonometrical interpolation is capable to reconstruct hourly water levels this method is very useful for analysis of low sampling frequency water levels especially when two high and two low water levels are recorded only appendix b the performance of t tide model is assessed by the root mean square error r and the skill score s wu et al 2011 for observed and predicted water levels the model performance is excellent at s 0 65 good at 0 5 s 0 65 and poor at s 0 2 marechal 2004 the root mean square errors are acceptable with a mean value of 0 31 m the average skill score for water level is 0 69 showing that the model performance is excellent although the values are around 0 5 at some stations the performance is good to assess the suitability of t tide for river discharge we applied nonstationary mode of harmonic analysis nsha this method which has been applied to the yangtze river estuary guo et al 2015 is conducted on water level at specific river discharge ranges with t tide specifically the nsha was conducted on the water level at shilong when the river runoff at boluo was between 700 and 1400 m3 s for example the discontinuous observed data were analyzed however as there were fewer flow points higher than 2800 m3 s they were not analyzed owing to data length limits at each discharge range the fortnightly tide msf are not included in fig b1 the m2 amplitudes decreased at shilong from 0 44 m at a river discharge below 700 m3 s to 0 32 m at a discharge of 2100 2800 m3 s fig b1 similar trends were detected for the amplitudes of s2 and k1 however o1 and m4 behave differently with river discharge o1 amplitude increased slightly with discharge and m4 amplitude increased and then decreased increment in o1 amplitude may be due to energy transfer from m2 and k1 to o1 through the m2 k1 o1 triad interactions parker 1991 guo et al 2015 stronger nonlinear interaction under higher discharge is responsible for increment in m4 when river discharge is relatively small but higher discharge will dissipate m4 as a frictional effect godin 1999 godin and martinez 1994 the average amplitude error of m2 was 0 032 m which is 10 of its amplitude the errors of m2 amplitudes increased with discharge and were highest at a discharge of 1400 2100 m3 s and then decreased which may be due to shorter data length at discharge higher than 2100 m3 s the average amplitude error of k1 was 0 04 m which is approximately 15 of its amplitude the errors in the amplitude of k1 increased with discharge ranging from 0 034 m at a discharge below 700 m3 s to 0 044 m when the discharge was between 2100 and 2800 m3 s amplitude errors of other constituents are around the magnitude of 0 01 m mean msf amplitude errors increased along the channel ranging from 12 to 18 of its amplitude fig s1 see the supporting information the largest error of 0 02 m was observed at shilong from 1963 to 2012 which is approximately 16 of the amplitude of msf macmahan et al 2014 reported that an error of 0 02 m in the msf amplitude at new river inlet nc usa which was 13 of its amplitude indicated good model performance therefore the msf amplitude errors in this study were acceptable overall the application of the t tide model to the east river network is reasonable and reliable appendix c supplementary data supplementary data to this
