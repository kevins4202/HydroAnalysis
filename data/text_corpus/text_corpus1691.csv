8455,study region the study area was in the upland peatland within the zoige basin with elevations ranging between 3400 and 3800 m it is located in the source area of upper yellow river that is developed on the qinghai tibet plateau china study focus we examined possible influence of two different types of gullies on groundwater hydrology in this alpine peatland the gullies whose beds cutting through the peat layer and those whose beds are within the peat layer we measured saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head and water table levels both vertically and horizontally in three representative sites distributed in the study area representing blanket peatland and peats surrounded by two types of the gullies during may 11 23 2017 using these data we showed that different patterns of these parameters in both directions may be clearly observed among the three sites new hydrological insights for the region we have shown for the first time in this region that 1 gullies with the bed cutting through the peat layer may have profound impact on peat groundwater hydrology 2 groundwater seepage at the bottom of the peat layer may be enhanced by gullies with the bed cutting through the peat layer and 3 increased groundwater seepage could be an additional cause for peatland degradation during the prolonged dry and cold period of a year keywords zoige peatland saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head water table level natural gully 1 introduction the importance of peatlands is highlighted by the fact that they hold about 10 of the world s freshwater and 30 of global soil carbon while only consisting of 3 of the earth s lands ballard et al 2011 holden 2009a rubec 2005 yet hydrological properties of peatlands can be profoundly altered by gullies developed through natural erosion processes and artificially excavated drainage ditches armstrong et al 2010 sikstrom and hokka 2016 much of attention has been paid to how gullies and ditches change overland flow subsurface flow and macropore pipe flow as well as water table levels we have known thus far that gullies and ditches may 1 increase or decrease peak discharges of channel flow with the total volume of water produced during one storm event unchanged and increase long term runoff efficiency at the watershed scale archer 2003 holden 2009b holden et al 2006 2 significantly increase throughflow and baseflow because of raised water table during storm event catchment dewatering and soil structure alteration daniels et al 2008 holden et al 2007 3 enhance pipe or macropore flow during the dry season holden 2005 holden et al 2004 rossi et al 2012 and 4 cause the well known distance decay effect of the water table from a gully allott et al 2009 holden et al 2006 2011 luscombe et al 2016 in addition studies have revealed that drainage due to ditches and gullies could reduce or increase hydraulic conductivity peat bulk density and storage capacity which further leads to lowered water table and the subsequent peatland shrinkage glaser et al 1981 price et al 2003 ramchunder et al 2009 nonetheless it is still unclear how gullies and ditches affect groundwater by altering hydraulic conductivity and head within the peat layer the objective of this research was to provide evidence that may explain such effect by examining the impacts of natural gullies on saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head and water table in an upland peat within zoige basin china we selected a site in a hollow of peatland and next to a type i and type ii gully defined later respectively at each site we measured 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity both along a vertical profile of the peat and at certain representative depths and 2 hydraulic head at different peat depths in addition we measured water table levels along two transects perpendicular to each of the two selected gullies by comparing the data among the three sites we showed different hydrological properties of groundwater in peats near the two types of gullies and discussed their implications in understanding the cause for the area reduction of peatland 2 methods and materials 2 1 background of the zoige basin the zoige basin is located on the southeastern side of the upper yellow river uyr watershed that sits on the northeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau china fig 1 a it covers the area of about 22 145 km2 with elevations ranging between 3400 and 4800 m li et al 2010 the zoige basin was developed about 13 million years ago by an intense mountain building uplift and subsequent fast sediment fill which created a variety of low mountains and hills within the basin nicoll et al 2013 zoige peatland whose area currently takes about 17 of the total basin area li et al 2011 was initiated in the early holocene and fully developed about 3000 bp chen et al 1999 harkins et al 2007 zeng et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 geological structure of the entire uyr watershed has been controlled by various tectonic movements e g strike slip faulting which generated a few knickpoints along the downstream reach of the first bend with a u shape planform fig 1a in the uyr craddock et al 2010 perrineau et al 2011 these knickpoints initiated the erosion process that has been controlling landscape evolution of the zoige basin downstream of the black river one of the two main tributaries merging into the uyr in the area fig 1b the bridge piers are exposed for about 0 5 m showing the dominance of incision in the river the knickpoint controlled erosion has also catalyzed various gully networks developed through a large part of the basin in the peat areas contributing to the middle and upper reaches of the rivers gullies have been deeply incised such that gully beds generally cut through the peat layer and have reached the underlying mineral layer moving further upslope peatlands may contain first and second order gullies whose beds remain within the peat layer although the boundary between the two types of gullies varies spatially within the zoige peatland their morphological distinction may be readily identified in the field accompanied with these gullies are networks of artificial ditches created between 1960s and 1980s for transferring peatlands to grasslands for grazing li et al 2015 yan and wu 2005 zhang et al 2014 these ditches are typically straight and shallow i e less than 0 5 m and often are connected to nearby natural gullies or meandering rivers because their beds are usually well above the bottom of the peat layer artificial ditches usually serve as concentrated flow paths allowing surface water to drain out of the peatland fast without initiating significant channel bed and bank erosion and sediment transport therefore they have a similar hydrological role to the second type of natural gullies mentioned above over the past six decades the zoige surface peat coverage has been degraded to the grass coverage by about 52 in area from its original 4600 km2 determined using remote sensing data the prevailing explanation states that this area reduction should be mainly ascribed to the increasing trend of annual mean summer temperatures in this region which resulted in the increased evaporation rates li et al 2014 yan and wu 2005 zhang et al 2016 this argument implicitly assumed that higher evaporation rates could result in reduced water supply to the peatland yet it failed to consider the important role of precipitation although from 1960s to 2010s annual average precipitation followed a weak declining trend li et al 2015 comparing the change of mean annual evapotranspiration et with mean precipitation p showed that et increased from 485 to 498 mm while p decreased from 684 to 659 mm for the same period li et al 2015 the p et ratio only changed from 1 41 to 1 32 in the past half century therefore it is unlikely that climate change in this time period would be the only culprit of the peatland shrinkage what remains might be the impact of gullies on the hydrological properties of peatland the above mentioned hydrological changes caused by gullies were mostly for surface runoff and subsurface flow due to storm events during inter storm periods most if not all of these fast flows are gone and peat hydrology is more controlled by groundwater flow however little is known thus far about the effect of gullies on groundwater flow due to the general lack of field based hydrological data therefore this study focused on investigating hydrological properties of groundwater in the zoige peatland under the influence of natural gullies according to a widely used gully classification in peatland allott et al 2009 the zoige peatland generally has class 2 gullies which have a relatively straight form with a lower drainage density and are often located on sloping lands to better understand the altered hydrological properties of groundwater we divide gullies in the zoige peatland into two types from a different perspective type i have beds lying above the bottom of the peat depth whereas type ii have beds cutting through the peat layer and reaching the underlined mineral soils 2 2 study area and sampling sites the zoige basin has a continental monsoon climate that involves a long dry and cold season from october to april and a short wet and warm season from may to september annual precipitation varies around 650 mm and the wettest summer months june august take about 60 of the annual precipitation precipitation from november to march occurs in the form of snow because of low temperature and the accumulated snow melts gradually from april to may the basin features widely and gently inclined valleys separated by low mountain ridges highly sinuous rivers and gullies extend across the valleys guiding flows running from southeast to northwest fig 1b the zoige peatland belongs to ombrogenous mires whose status is mainly controlled by rainfall wheeler 1995 peat depth typically varies between 0 8 and 3 m with some exception that could reach as deep as 10 m observed from a profile of a huge gully wall the main plant community includes carex mulieensis kobresia carex and tibet artemisia li et al 2015 yang et al 2017 our study area was located in the peatland near the south ridge of the black river watershed fig 1b the slope of the peat surface is gentle and varies from 0 048 to 0 070 three characteristic sites were carefully selected to represent three distinct physical settings of the study area site 1 32 59 11 720 n 102 59 23 500 e was located on the peat between a first order type i south and second order type ii north gullies extending from the southwest to northeast direction figs 1c and 2 a it is a geomorphological hollow whose elevations are lower than those of the surrounding hummocks thus site 1 may be easily saturated during rainfall the distance from this site to the edges of the type i and type ii gullies was about 32 and 40 m respectively therefore groundwater under site 1 is ecohydrologically intact site 2 32 59 06 858 n 102 59 13 290 e was close to the left side of the first order type i gully about 0 5 m whose bed was about 35 cm below the peat surface figs 1c and 2b this gully was shallow and had not been subject to discernable bed incision and bank erosion so groundwater under this site is not ecohydrologically intact site 3 32 59 14 151 n 102 59 25 592 e stayed on the near right of a second order type ii gully about 0 5 m figs 1c and 2c the gully bed was about 40 cm below the bottom of the peat layer and gully banks collapsed not long before the sampling indicating very active bank erosion along this gully thus groundwater in the neighboring peat is most possibly disturbed by measuring the exposed vertical profile of the right bank at site 3 we determined that the peat thickness was about 125 cm deep although not measuring it directly we learned through installing piezometers at sites 1 and 3 that their peat thickness should be at least 125 cm deep field measurement began in the middle of may when the daily maximum temperature may be as high as 18 c thus snow covering the study area in the dry season i e from october to april had already melted completely during this period light rain occurred on some nights and daytime was generally dry so our measurements were not directly affected by snowmelt or rainfall 2 3 sampling design both saturated hydraulic conductivity k cm s and hydraulic head h cm were measured at variable depths of the peat at the three sites using self designed piezometers similar to those described in chason and siegel 1986 it was made up of a 150 cm iron pipe with outer and inner calibers of 2 and 1 8 cm respectively four rows of perforation holes four in each row were evenly distributed with equal intervals in the 10 cm section above the bottom of the pipe which is open no filter was installed at the bottom of the piezometer as it was only used within the peat layer following chason and siegel 1968 s procedure of installation an iron rod tightly fitting the piezometer with a tip low end was inserted into the piezometer at the beginning of the installation it extended about 1 cm beyond the piezometer then both of them were pushed or hammed into the desired peat depth and the rod was pull out at site 1 a nest of six piezometers were installed 35 50 65 80 95 and 125 cm deep at location s1e for measuring k and h values fig 2 a at five different locations s1a s1b s1c s1d s1f s1g s1h s1i in fig 2a similar nests of piezometers were placed for measuring h values only the additional two s1j and s1k in fig 2a were placed only at the depth of 125 cm for examining the potential spatial variation of the k values this design not only captured the potential spatial variations of k and h at this site but also allowed for comparing these k values with those at sites 2 and 3 at site 2 a nest of six piezometers s2a s2b s2c s2d s2e s2f was placed 35 50 65 80 95 125 cm deep for obtaining k and h values accompanied by a similar set s2a s2b s2c s2d s2e s2f for h values only fig 2b three additional piezometers that were about 50 cm apart from each other with the first one 50 cm away from the gully edge s2g s2h s2i were placed 35 cm deep along a transect paralleling to the six piezometers for both k and h measurement fig 2b because the 35 cm peat depth is where the type i gully bed was located the three piezometers will be used to examine the potential impact of the type i gully on k and h after the measurement these three s2g s2h s2i were pushed to the 95 cm depth for understanding the spatial variation of k and h at site 3 two nests of piezometers were installed in two locations at the same six different depths i e 35 50 65 80 95 125 cm one for measuring k values s3c in fig 2c and another for h values s3c in fig 2c additional eight piezometers were installed at the depth of 125 cm for understanding spatial variations of k and h at the bottom of the peat three of them s3a s3b s3f made a transect roughly parallel to the gully with the interval of about 100 cm among each other they were about 50 60 and 60 cm away from the gully respectively fig 2c seven of them except s3a together with s3c at the same depth also constituted two perpendicular transects piezometers along each transect have approximately the same spacing of 50 cm the symmetric design of piezometers was used at site 1 because we believed that at this ecohydrologically intact site there is no preferential direction of groundwater the design of piezometers in sites 2 and 3 intended to capture the lateral patterns of groundwater changes more piezometers were used at site 2 than site 3 because we expected a less degree of groundwater variation at site 2 than site 3 although it would be better to measure k values at all locations the harsh weather on the qinghai tibet plateau and limited man power forced us to select only one nest at each site for measuring k values besides k and h values spatial and temporal variations of water table were also examined at sites 2 and 3 along two transects perpendicular to each of the two selected gullies four to five boreholes having the diameter of 10 cm were cored for measuring water table levels 2 4 sampling methods at each peat depth the k value was measured using the classic piezometer slug test method hvorslev 1951 which may be expressed as follow 1 h r h h h h 0 e f k π r 2 t where h is the equalization hydraulic head h 0 is the initial hydraulic head h is the hydraulic head in a piezometer at time t after the equalization process begins r is the inner radius of the piezometer caliber and f is the shape factor after a piezometer was installed at a given depth 14 18 h were waited before measurement for avoiding the potential impact of installation on measurements the amount of water whose depth within a piezometer was typically between 10 20 cm was pumped out and h 0 and h were recorded two to three measurements of h and t were made depending on how fast the hydraulic head raised the value of h with the highest equalization time typically between 90 and 98 was used for calculating the k value the shape factor f was calculated using the equation developed by brand and preemechitt 1982 at each location and depth the hydraulic head h was measured as the length from the water level inside a piezometer to its top this value was subsequently converted to the one based on i an arbitrary datum and ii the mean water table level at the same location described later respectively the h values measured from multiple locations at the same depth were corrected by considering the differences of their surface elevations water table levels along each transect created at sites 2 and 3 were measured from the water surface within the borehole to the peat surface these values were then adjusted in terms of the differences of their surface elevations all measurements were performed from may 11 to 23 2017 with most of them repeated for 3 to 7 times with the average temporal interval of 1 day 3 results and analysis 3 1 hydraulic conductivity in general k values in all sites varied within one order of magnitude table 1 the values of their coefficient variance cv indicated that k values at site 1 had the highest degree of variation at site 1 vertical distribution of k values showed a general increasing trend from the 35 cm depth 1 135 10 7 m s to the 125 cm depth 2 444 10 7 m s though around the 80 cm depth the k value became smaller again 1 442 10 7 m s fig 3 a even taking account the relatively high variations of the k values at most depths i e the error bars in fig 3a this trend apparently persisted at the 125 cm depth which was close to the bottom of the peat at this site k values along the jek transect with the interval of 100 cm fig 2a did not display any spatial pattern fig 3b indeed k values at both j and k locations which were 3 194 and 2 518 10 7 m s were about three and two times higher than that at location e making the mean of k values at the 1 25 m depth higher this further confirmed the increasing trend of k values with peat depths at site 1 given that the peat in site 1 was not disturbed by gullies the k values at all depths and the associated vertical trend at site 1 represent standard characteristics of saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with those in the other two sites at site 2 k values also displayed an increasing trend with the depth but had greater variations among the depths fig 3a in particular this trend was highlighted by a higher k value at the 1 25 m depth 2 335 10 7 m s and a lower one at the 35 cm depth 0 641 10 7 m s than those at site 1 along the ghi transect perpendicular to the type i gully at the 95 cm depth fig 2b k values were 3 079 3 520 and 2 872 10 7 m s fig 3c showing spatial and temporal variations of the k values their mean 3 157 10 7 m s was greater than those at both the 95 and 125 cm depths of site 1 2 109 and 2 444 10 7 m s but still comparable thus the differences more likely reflected the spatial variation of the k values rather than the impact of the type i gully on hydraulic conductivity at these depths at the 35 cm depth k values along a similar transect to that at the 95 cm depth increased from 0 515 to 0 625 and then decreased to 0 572 10 7 m s fig 3c these values did not show any specific trend along the transect but their mean which was 0 571 10 7 m s was slightly less than that at the top of the vertical profile depth 0 641 10 7 m s compared with that at the same depth of site 1 the k value was reduced by 44 to 50 at this site representing a significant reduction from the standard value this reduction reflected the clear impact of type i gully on hydraulic conductivity as this is the depth of the gully bed at site 3 hydraulic conductivity was mainly measured at the 125 cm depth i e the bottom of the peat layer with merely one k value available at the 95 cm depth of location c fig 2c this was because water table at this site varied greatly and may drop to around the 90 cm depth during the sampling period based on our field observation along the fghi transect k values slightly increased from 1 651 to 1 757 10 7 m s and decreased to 1 640 10 7 m s at the location i the farthest away from the gully edge fig 3d a similar trend with generally lower magnitudes may be observed along the bcde transect the k value increased from 0 860 to 1 104 10 7 m s and then continuously decreased till 0 434 10 7 m s at location e fig 3d these trends indicated that hydraulic conductivity was highly variable at the bottom of the peat layer nearby the type ii gully along the abf transect fig 2c k values increased significantly from location a 0 254 10 7 m s to f 1 165 10 7 m s yet the three distances to the gully edge increased from 35 cm at a to 60 cm at f fig 3d these two different trends suggested that the type ii gully could cause a significant reduction of hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the peat close to it and this influence gradually declined with the increase of the distance from it comparing that at site 1 the mean k value at the 125 cm depth was decreased by 54 fig 3a further confirmed the strong impact of the type ii gully on hydraulic conductivity at the 95 cm depth the k value at site 3 was 1 892 10 7 m s which was 10 less than that at site 1 suggesting the weakened effect of the type ii gully on hydraulic conductivity as the peat depth decreases 3 2 hydraulic heads values of hydraulic heads for site 1 were summarized using the data measured from locations of a b c d e f g h and i at different peat depths fig 2a the vertical profile of hydraulic heads did not show a clear gradient below the 50 cm peat depth fig 4 a while the hydraulic head increased from the 50 cm to the 35 cm depth this spatial pattern implied relatively less vertical movement of groundwater in the lower zone from the 50 cm depth to the bottom of the intact peat though hydraulic conductivity increased with the depth comparison of the mean hydraulic heads at multiple peat depths with the mean water table indicated fig 4b that the lower zone in the intact peat belonged to a recharge zone suggesting that groundwater may be supplied from the upper peat above the 50 cm to this zone although the hydraulic heads in the 35 40 cm depth which were higher than water table fig 4b may cause possible groundwater upwelling siegel and glaser 1987 this upward discharge may not be stable because of variable water table which will be described later nonetheless figs 4a and b described the standard patterns of the hydraulic head along a vertical profile of the intact peat in the study area values of hydraulic heads measured by two nests of piezometers at six different depths of site 2 fig 2b were averaged at each depth for the entire sampling duration these data displayed fig 5 a that though hydraulic heads were generally lower than those at site 1 fig 4a they developed a gentle gradient from the 35 to 80 cm peat depth and then remained similar from the 80 cm to the 125 cm depth comparing with the vertical pattern at site 1 the gradient at site 2 was apparently caused by the less reduced hydraulic heads from the 80 cm to the 35 cm depth furthermore these less reduced hydraulic heads were higher than the mean water table fig 5b generating a similar vertical pattern to that at site 1 on the one hand higher hydraulic heads around the 35 60 cm depth turned the deep peat between 80 and 125 cm into a recharge zone on the other hand the higher hydraulic heads at these depths created a possibility of groundwater upwelling horizontally the mean hydraulic heads along a transect perpendicular to the type i gully at the 35 cm peat depth not only showed no significant gradient but also changed in magnitudes only by less than 3 among each other fig 5c indicating no clear lateral hydraulic gradient toward the type i gully in its neighboring peat hydraulic heads at site 3 were only measured from the 60 to 125 cm depths due to significantly lowered water table these values were also less than those at similar depths of site 1 and the degree of reduction was greater than those at site 2 figs 4a 5a and 6a vertically they created a steeper gradient within the 60 95 cm depth compared with that at site 2 fig 5a and 6a from the 95 cm depth to the bottom of the peat the hydraulic head continued to decrease but with a less gradient these changes led to a discernable low hydraulic head at the bottom of the peat layer this low value clearly indicated the strong impact of the type ii gully on the hydraulic head at the bottom of the peat layer levels of the hydraulic heads at all depths were much lower than that of water table fig 6 b again indicating groundwater in the peat depths close to the bottom was recharged from that in the upper part associated with this spatial pattern were the relatively higher variations of the hydraulic heads at each peat depth compared with those at sites 1 and 2 figs 4a 5a and 6a which further embodied the impact of the type ii gully on the hydraulic heads of the nearby peat horizontally at the 125 cm depth averaged values of hydraulic heads along two transects perpendicular to the type ii gully demonstrated evident gradients toward the gully edge fig 6c the gradient along the bcde transect fig 2c was greater than that along the fghi transect which is associated with the fact that the former was closer to the gully edge than the latter these gradients suggested the existence of groundwater flow to the gully bank at the depth equivalent to the bottom of the peat layer 3 3 water table levels much of the time during the field measurement the peat surface at site 1 was saturated its temporal variation was limited with the mean value approximately around the 5 cm depth which was the one used as a reference for calculating relative hydraulic heads at the same site fig 4b along transect 1 at site 2 the mean water table level was lower at the location 100 cm away from the gully edge fig 7 a and linearly increased to that 200 cm away from the gully edge it then stayed about the same level in the next 100 cm this spatial pattern was apparently similar to the drawdown effect of water table yet water table along transect 2 displayed a different trend while it raised from the distance of 100 to 150 cm away from the edge water table dropped in the following 150 cm distance to lower levels fig 7a on average the two transects at site 2 were apart from each other for only about 160 cm thus the different trends of water table levels along them suggested that reduction of water table as the distance away from the gully edge increases was not consistent in the peat next to the type i gully the relatively high error bars in all locations at site 2 fig 7a suggested that temporal variation of water table at site 2 was relatively high our field observation at site 3 indicated that water table changed obviously and consistently along the distance away from the gully edge this was corroborated by the measured changes of water table along two transects perpendicular to the type ii gully fig 7b at the location around 100 cm away from the gully edge water table level was on average 61 6 cm and 51 8 cm below the peat surface respectively regarding to each transect in the following 400 cm distance it raised to 39 5 and 35 1 cm along the two transects respectively the significant and consistent changes of water table along these two transects suggested that the type ii gully clearly caused the drawdown effect of water table in the peat close to it water table levels were generally lower with higher degrees of variation in transect 1 than in transect 2 this might reflect the nature of its high spatial variation 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties in measuring hydraulic conductivity and its variability field methods of determining hydraulic conductivity are essentially derived from the rigid soil theory assuming that darcy s law holds and soil is incompressible eq 1 holds when i soil is incompressible and ii water table is not affected by flow required for equalization hvorslev 1951 unfortunately the compressible nature of the peat and possible smearing of the peat around the piezometer intake could affect the equalization process baird et al 2004 hogan et al 2006 holden and burt 2003b leading to errors in calculating k values although this method has been widely used fraser et al 2001 mccarter and price 2013 robbins et al 2009 rossi et al 2012 whittington and price 2006 few have addressed potential errors explicitly holden and burt 2003a s investigation showed that k 90 was generally six times higher than k 50 where k 90 and k 50 are values of hydraulic conductivity calculated using the 90 and 50 equalization time in eq 1 respectively they also reported that k values calculated using the monograph method brand and preemechitt 1982 was not only significantly smaller than those based on eq 1 but also more sensitive to spatial locations baird et al 2004 found that the equalization process is consistent with that based on eq 1 for root mat surridge et al 2005 scrutinized eq 1 by performing carefully designed slug tests and concluded that though the recovery processes were generally not log linear the estimated k values using eq 1 were acceptable thus we think that eq 1 is the appropriate one for determining k values and used it in this study in reality however peat matrix is highly deformable price and schlotzhauer 1999 and the resultant peat expansion and compaction inevitably affect the k values computed using eq 1 during our field measurement we examined the stability of the equalization hydraulic head i e h cm by recording water levels within piezometers adjacent to the test piezometer at the beginning and end of each slug test and comparing these levels between the two we found that in many tests these water levels changed with different magnitudes at different peat depths fig 8 a the greater error bar of the top point indicated a higher temporal variation of the hydraulic head changes at the 35 cm depth these changes suggested that the inflow rate was not stable during the slug test thus the assumption that the original inflow rate remained unchanged as required by eq 1 freeze and cherry 1979 was invalid this variation directly affected calculation of the head ratio i e hr and subsequently the k values our examination showed that k values estimated by considering the variable inflow rates were on average close to the non adjusted ones except at the 50 and 80 cm peat depths where the former were about 35 higher than the latter fig 8b this relatively small difference compared with the high variability of hydraulic conductivity holden and burt 2003b surridge et al 2005 allowed us to treat the variable equalization hydraulic head as one of the errors in the calculation and adopt the non adjusted k values in the analysis as site 1 was located in the ecohydrologically intact peat the k values at this site represent the first measured set of primitive saturated hydraulic conductivity in the zoige peatland which varied from 1 135 to 2 520 10 5 cm s table 1 the variation was within one order of magnitude and seemed less than that in many other peatlands hobbs 1986 surridge et al 2005 whittington and price 2006 although these k values were within the same range as those in the north pennines uk holden and burt 2003a they were at least one order of magnitude less than those in an undisturbed blanket peat in british isles the difference might be due to the fact that the latter were measured using a different method based on a mini disc tension infiltrometer wallage and holden 2011 since the study area is representative of the zoige peatland that is mainly made of fabric peats with a low deteriorated root system chai and jing 1963 sun 1992 our measured k values may be compared with those obtained in canada and indeed were within the range of those values letts et al 2000 the increasing trend of the mean k values with the peat depth fig 3a is at odds with many previously reported results fraser et al 2001 glaser et al 1981 hoag and price 1995 whittington and price 2006 while consistent with others in different peatlands baird et al 2008 clymo 2004 apparently saturated hydraulic conductivity in the study area within the zoige peatland seems not drastically different from that in blanket peatlands of other places though more measurements in other summer months are needed to show its temporal variations 4 2 distinct impacts of two types of gullies on peat groundwater according to darcy s law hydraulic properties of groundwater flow are primarily controlled by hydraulic conductivity k and hydraulic head h the different k and h values between site 1 and the other two sites presented a possibility that two types of gullies might have different impact on groundwater flow in the zoige peatland the type i gully modestly reduced hydraulic conductivity at the 35 cm depth by about 30 as the gully bed only reached this depth fig 3a from this depth to the bottom of the peat the differences of the k values between sites 1 and 2 were well within the typical range of spatially variable hydraulic conductivity in blanket peats surridge et al 2005 suggesting that these values were not subject to the impact of the type i gully at least during the study period the relatively lower h values at all depths than those at site 1 and a gentle hydraulic gradient crated by the higher h values at the 35 65 cm depths than the mean water table level fig 5a and b signified a possibly greater influence of the type i gully on the hydraulic head than the hydraulic conductivity while these changes of h values may result in possible groundwater downwelling the reduced hydraulic conductivity fig 3a within these depths may offset this possibility therefore the type i gully had limited influence on hydraulic properties of groundwater this limited influence was supported by the insignificant changes of water table levels along the two horizontal transects perpendicular to the gully at the 35 cm depth comparing with the variation of water table at site 1 which was typically between 0 and 15 cm depths the change at site 2 ranged from 20 to 31 cm depths this difference is more likely related to the topographic difference of the two sites elevations of site 1 were much lower than those of surrounding hummocks than those at site 2 as earlier studies have shown that topography is a dominant control on the change of water table levels of peats holden et al 2006 2011 at site 3 the type ii gully had a significant impact on not only water table but also k and h values the water table level at the location of 100 cm away from the gully edge dropped about 22 cm compared with that at the location 500 cm away from the gully edge fig 7b clearly showing the distance decay effect as observed in other peatlands allott et al 2009 boelter 1972 compared with that at site 1 the water table level decreased significantly but the k value at the 95 cm depth was very close to that at the same depth of site 1 fig 3a nonetheless at the bottom of the peat the mean k value was reduced by 50 compared with that at site 1 this reduction was more likely affected by the nearby type ii gully which cut through the peat layer along the banks in addition this gully induced significantly decreased hydraulic heads at all depths such that their levels were all lower than that of the water table fig 6b these decreased hydraulic heads also created a significant downward hydraulic gradient with the slope of 0 305 fig 6b which was much steeper than that in a blanket bog located in newfoundland canada price 1992 it followed that the peat body around the bottom became a strong recharge zone the discovery of this recharge zone explained the significant drop of water table at this site and suggested that groundwater steadily moved toward the bottom of the peat layer more importantly at or near the bottom of the peat i e 125 cm deep the type ii gully created a clear and strong hydraulic gradient horizontally toward the gully edge with an average slope of 0 051 fig 6c therefore though the mean hydraulic conductivity decreased from 2 444 to 1 129 10 5 cm s at this peat depth the emerged horizontal gradient i e 0 051 led to an approximate rate of groundwater flow i e specific discharge at 0 0576 mm day draining out of the gully banks given that this calculation ignored anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity it may not be truly accurate beckwith et al 2003 fraser et al 2001 however this flow rate provided the first estimation of groundwater flow through the broken bottom of the peat at the banks of the type ii gully in the zoige peatland holden et al 2006 believed that enhanced flow in deeper peat that is affected by artificial ditches is possibly attributed to the increased hydraulic conductivity however our data showed that the k value at the bottom of the peat the 125 cm depth next to the type ii gully was indeed decreased compared with that of the intact peat i e site 1 thus the increased lateral discharge at site 3 was groundwater flow mainly due to the development of both vertical downward and horizontal toward the gully edge hydraulic gradients because our findings were only based on measurements in 13 days of may 2017 whether these interpretations remain true in other summer months is still unknown and requires further data collection to confirm nonetheless these findings provided the first field based evidence on how the type ii gully may change the groundwater of the zoige peatland it should be noted that though hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the peat was reduced it is still two orders of magnitude higher than that in deeper peats in north pennine uk holden and burt 2002 whether it is due to the limitation of the current data or the fact that the pennine peat depth which is about 250 cm is higher than that i e 125 cm in our study area awaits for more in situ studies our data signified the possibility that the altered groundwater hydrology of peatland by a neighboring type ii gully may occur at or near the bottom of peat since the type ii gully has already cut through the peat layer exactly how deep the gully bed goes further down seems to have no impact on the altered groundwater hydrology of peat on the contrary the change of hydraulic properties of groundwater in the peat next to a type i gully appears to be related to the depth of the gully bed though in our case at site 2 the change was not significant so it is not clear whether a type i gully with a deeper bed would cause an alteration of groundwater at the similar depth in the nearby peat putting these together gully depth in general may not be a sensitive parameter that can test the impact of gullies on water table this might be a factor causing the poor relationship between the two in an earlier study allott et al 2009 nonetheless the high degree of water table drop near the type ii gully did support the term erosional acrotelm coined to describe the enlarged acrotelm due to the nearby gully daniels et al 2008 4 3 possible implication of gully impact on peat our field observation indicated that groundwater seepage from the bottom of the peat layer may be easily identified along banks of the type ii gully different from that caused by perched water table which may be substantial and initiate soil erosion fox et al 2007 this groundwater seepage was not large enough to even contribute to the baseflow of the gully channel yet it had persisted over the entire sampling period keeping the underlying mineral bank wet all the time fig 9 we noticed that the wet mineral banks did not necessarily exist everywhere along the longitudinal direction of the gully some sections of gully banks were covered by collapsed bank materials and hence groundwater seepage was not observable wherever the mineral bank and its immediate top peat were dry the peat layer that constitutes a series of roughly paralleled stratification or stratigraphy hughes et al 2000 showed horizontal cracks near or at the bottom of the peat or a few small holes fig 10 these cracks and or small holes that have been also reported in other peatlands grab and deschamps 2004 holden and burt 2002 suggested that the preferential flow or pipe flow which moves much faster than groundwater flow holden and burt 2002 holden et al 2001 wallage and holden 2011 facilitated water to drain quickly and resulted in the dried minerals at these locations our data and field observation suggested that enhanced groundwater flow through type ii gullies created by intense erosion processes could be a significant cause for it though data collected over longer time periods e g two to three years are required to further confirm our findings 5 conclusions impact of gullies on hydrological properties of groundwater in the zoige peatland china was investigated using field measured data for saturated hydraulic conductivity k hydraulic head h and water table levels at three representative sites one site 1 on the intact peat that has not been disturbed by gullies and the other two sites 2 and 3 next to the type i and type ii gullies respectively in comparison with those at site 1 spatial patterns of these data at sites 2 and 3 revealed the distinct effects of the two types of gullies on groundwater hydrology the type i gully with a shallow bed located at the 35 cm peat depth only caused the reduction of the k value at this depth by 30 which was most likely related to the lowered water table level that may be at the 25 cm peat depth and may had less effect on the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the gully it also led to generally decreased hydraulic heads along a vertical profile of the peat these h values created a downward hydraulic gradient with the upper peat at the 35 50 cm depth having hydraulic heads higher than the mean water table level this change may cause possibly weak upwelling and downwelling of groundwater from this depth because of the gentle hydraulic gradient thus the impact of the type i gully on groundwater seems to be fairly limited given that artificial ditches created in the zoige peatland during 1950 1980 s generally have beds within the peat layer these ditches share similar hydrological functions with type i gullies and might have limited impact on groundwater hydrology as well groundwater in the peat near the type ii gully could be strongly affected by the broken bottom of the peat water table level decreased significantly and demonstrated a strong distance decay effect associated with it was the decrease of hydraulic conductivity by 50 around the bottom of the peat in addition hydraulic heads along a vertical profile were all lower than the mean water table level with a steep downward hydraulic gradient this change made the deep peat a recharge zone and had maintained groundwater moving downward horizontally at the bottom of the peat reduced hydraulic heads formed a clear hydraulic gradient toward the gully edge which resulted in a leaking effect i e groundwater seepage at the bottom of the peat along the gully banks because our data were only obtained in may 2017 whether this leaking effect persists through the summer and winter is uncertain if it exists over the whole year then enhanced groundwater flow from the type ii gullies may be a significant cause for zoige peatland shrinkage since gully erosion in the zoige peatland is geomorphologically controlled by the geologically lowered base level of the upper yellow river downstream of the zoige basin development of the type ii gullies will continue even if climate change remains the minimum therefore more studies are necessary for confirming

8455,study region the study area was in the upland peatland within the zoige basin with elevations ranging between 3400 and 3800 m it is located in the source area of upper yellow river that is developed on the qinghai tibet plateau china study focus we examined possible influence of two different types of gullies on groundwater hydrology in this alpine peatland the gullies whose beds cutting through the peat layer and those whose beds are within the peat layer we measured saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head and water table levels both vertically and horizontally in three representative sites distributed in the study area representing blanket peatland and peats surrounded by two types of the gullies during may 11 23 2017 using these data we showed that different patterns of these parameters in both directions may be clearly observed among the three sites new hydrological insights for the region we have shown for the first time in this region that 1 gullies with the bed cutting through the peat layer may have profound impact on peat groundwater hydrology 2 groundwater seepage at the bottom of the peat layer may be enhanced by gullies with the bed cutting through the peat layer and 3 increased groundwater seepage could be an additional cause for peatland degradation during the prolonged dry and cold period of a year keywords zoige peatland saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head water table level natural gully 1 introduction the importance of peatlands is highlighted by the fact that they hold about 10 of the world s freshwater and 30 of global soil carbon while only consisting of 3 of the earth s lands ballard et al 2011 holden 2009a rubec 2005 yet hydrological properties of peatlands can be profoundly altered by gullies developed through natural erosion processes and artificially excavated drainage ditches armstrong et al 2010 sikstrom and hokka 2016 much of attention has been paid to how gullies and ditches change overland flow subsurface flow and macropore pipe flow as well as water table levels we have known thus far that gullies and ditches may 1 increase or decrease peak discharges of channel flow with the total volume of water produced during one storm event unchanged and increase long term runoff efficiency at the watershed scale archer 2003 holden 2009b holden et al 2006 2 significantly increase throughflow and baseflow because of raised water table during storm event catchment dewatering and soil structure alteration daniels et al 2008 holden et al 2007 3 enhance pipe or macropore flow during the dry season holden 2005 holden et al 2004 rossi et al 2012 and 4 cause the well known distance decay effect of the water table from a gully allott et al 2009 holden et al 2006 2011 luscombe et al 2016 in addition studies have revealed that drainage due to ditches and gullies could reduce or increase hydraulic conductivity peat bulk density and storage capacity which further leads to lowered water table and the subsequent peatland shrinkage glaser et al 1981 price et al 2003 ramchunder et al 2009 nonetheless it is still unclear how gullies and ditches affect groundwater by altering hydraulic conductivity and head within the peat layer the objective of this research was to provide evidence that may explain such effect by examining the impacts of natural gullies on saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head and water table in an upland peat within zoige basin china we selected a site in a hollow of peatland and next to a type i and type ii gully defined later respectively at each site we measured 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity both along a vertical profile of the peat and at certain representative depths and 2 hydraulic head at different peat depths in addition we measured water table levels along two transects perpendicular to each of the two selected gullies by comparing the data among the three sites we showed different hydrological properties of groundwater in peats near the two types of gullies and discussed their implications in understanding the cause for the area reduction of peatland 2 methods and materials 2 1 background of the zoige basin the zoige basin is located on the southeastern side of the upper yellow river uyr watershed that sits on the northeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau china fig 1 a it covers the area of about 22 145 km2 with elevations ranging between 3400 and 4800 m li et al 2010 the zoige basin was developed about 13 million years ago by an intense mountain building uplift and subsequent fast sediment fill which created a variety of low mountains and hills within the basin nicoll et al 2013 zoige peatland whose area currently takes about 17 of the total basin area li et al 2011 was initiated in the early holocene and fully developed about 3000 bp chen et al 1999 harkins et al 2007 zeng et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 geological structure of the entire uyr watershed has been controlled by various tectonic movements e g strike slip faulting which generated a few knickpoints along the downstream reach of the first bend with a u shape planform fig 1a in the uyr craddock et al 2010 perrineau et al 2011 these knickpoints initiated the erosion process that has been controlling landscape evolution of the zoige basin downstream of the black river one of the two main tributaries merging into the uyr in the area fig 1b the bridge piers are exposed for about 0 5 m showing the dominance of incision in the river the knickpoint controlled erosion has also catalyzed various gully networks developed through a large part of the basin in the peat areas contributing to the middle and upper reaches of the rivers gullies have been deeply incised such that gully beds generally cut through the peat layer and have reached the underlying mineral layer moving further upslope peatlands may contain first and second order gullies whose beds remain within the peat layer although the boundary between the two types of gullies varies spatially within the zoige peatland their morphological distinction may be readily identified in the field accompanied with these gullies are networks of artificial ditches created between 1960s and 1980s for transferring peatlands to grasslands for grazing li et al 2015 yan and wu 2005 zhang et al 2014 these ditches are typically straight and shallow i e less than 0 5 m and often are connected to nearby natural gullies or meandering rivers because their beds are usually well above the bottom of the peat layer artificial ditches usually serve as concentrated flow paths allowing surface water to drain out of the peatland fast without initiating significant channel bed and bank erosion and sediment transport therefore they have a similar hydrological role to the second type of natural gullies mentioned above over the past six decades the zoige surface peat coverage has been degraded to the grass coverage by about 52 in area from its original 4600 km2 determined using remote sensing data the prevailing explanation states that this area reduction should be mainly ascribed to the increasing trend of annual mean summer temperatures in this region which resulted in the increased evaporation rates li et al 2014 yan and wu 2005 zhang et al 2016 this argument implicitly assumed that higher evaporation rates could result in reduced water supply to the peatland yet it failed to consider the important role of precipitation although from 1960s to 2010s annual average precipitation followed a weak declining trend li et al 2015 comparing the change of mean annual evapotranspiration et with mean precipitation p showed that et increased from 485 to 498 mm while p decreased from 684 to 659 mm for the same period li et al 2015 the p et ratio only changed from 1 41 to 1 32 in the past half century therefore it is unlikely that climate change in this time period would be the only culprit of the peatland shrinkage what remains might be the impact of gullies on the hydrological properties of peatland the above mentioned hydrological changes caused by gullies were mostly for surface runoff and subsurface flow due to storm events during inter storm periods most if not all of these fast flows are gone and peat hydrology is more controlled by groundwater flow however little is known thus far about the effect of gullies on groundwater flow due to the general lack of field based hydrological data therefore this study focused on investigating hydrological properties of groundwater in the zoige peatland under the influence of natural gullies according to a widely used gully classification in peatland allott et al 2009 the zoige peatland generally has class 2 gullies which have a relatively straight form with a lower drainage density and are often located on sloping lands to better understand the altered hydrological properties of groundwater we divide gullies in the zoige peatland into two types from a different perspective type i have beds lying above the bottom of the peat depth whereas type ii have beds cutting through the peat layer and reaching the underlined mineral soils 2 2 study area and sampling sites the zoige basin has a continental monsoon climate that involves a long dry and cold season from october to april and a short wet and warm season from may to september annual precipitation varies around 650 mm and the wettest summer months june august take about 60 of the annual precipitation precipitation from november to march occurs in the form of snow because of low temperature and the accumulated snow melts gradually from april to may the basin features widely and gently inclined valleys separated by low mountain ridges highly sinuous rivers and gullies extend across the valleys guiding flows running from southeast to northwest fig 1b the zoige peatland belongs to ombrogenous mires whose status is mainly controlled by rainfall wheeler 1995 peat depth typically varies between 0 8 and 3 m with some exception that could reach as deep as 10 m observed from a profile of a huge gully wall the main plant community includes carex mulieensis kobresia carex and tibet artemisia li et al 2015 yang et al 2017 our study area was located in the peatland near the south ridge of the black river watershed fig 1b the slope of the peat surface is gentle and varies from 0 048 to 0 070 three characteristic sites were carefully selected to represent three distinct physical settings of the study area site 1 32 59 11 720 n 102 59 23 500 e was located on the peat between a first order type i south and second order type ii north gullies extending from the southwest to northeast direction figs 1c and 2 a it is a geomorphological hollow whose elevations are lower than those of the surrounding hummocks thus site 1 may be easily saturated during rainfall the distance from this site to the edges of the type i and type ii gullies was about 32 and 40 m respectively therefore groundwater under site 1 is ecohydrologically intact site 2 32 59 06 858 n 102 59 13 290 e was close to the left side of the first order type i gully about 0 5 m whose bed was about 35 cm below the peat surface figs 1c and 2b this gully was shallow and had not been subject to discernable bed incision and bank erosion so groundwater under this site is not ecohydrologically intact site 3 32 59 14 151 n 102 59 25 592 e stayed on the near right of a second order type ii gully about 0 5 m figs 1c and 2c the gully bed was about 40 cm below the bottom of the peat layer and gully banks collapsed not long before the sampling indicating very active bank erosion along this gully thus groundwater in the neighboring peat is most possibly disturbed by measuring the exposed vertical profile of the right bank at site 3 we determined that the peat thickness was about 125 cm deep although not measuring it directly we learned through installing piezometers at sites 1 and 3 that their peat thickness should be at least 125 cm deep field measurement began in the middle of may when the daily maximum temperature may be as high as 18 c thus snow covering the study area in the dry season i e from october to april had already melted completely during this period light rain occurred on some nights and daytime was generally dry so our measurements were not directly affected by snowmelt or rainfall 2 3 sampling design both saturated hydraulic conductivity k cm s and hydraulic head h cm were measured at variable depths of the peat at the three sites using self designed piezometers similar to those described in chason and siegel 1986 it was made up of a 150 cm iron pipe with outer and inner calibers of 2 and 1 8 cm respectively four rows of perforation holes four in each row were evenly distributed with equal intervals in the 10 cm section above the bottom of the pipe which is open no filter was installed at the bottom of the piezometer as it was only used within the peat layer following chason and siegel 1968 s procedure of installation an iron rod tightly fitting the piezometer with a tip low end was inserted into the piezometer at the beginning of the installation it extended about 1 cm beyond the piezometer then both of them were pushed or hammed into the desired peat depth and the rod was pull out at site 1 a nest of six piezometers were installed 35 50 65 80 95 and 125 cm deep at location s1e for measuring k and h values fig 2 a at five different locations s1a s1b s1c s1d s1f s1g s1h s1i in fig 2a similar nests of piezometers were placed for measuring h values only the additional two s1j and s1k in fig 2a were placed only at the depth of 125 cm for examining the potential spatial variation of the k values this design not only captured the potential spatial variations of k and h at this site but also allowed for comparing these k values with those at sites 2 and 3 at site 2 a nest of six piezometers s2a s2b s2c s2d s2e s2f was placed 35 50 65 80 95 125 cm deep for obtaining k and h values accompanied by a similar set s2a s2b s2c s2d s2e s2f for h values only fig 2b three additional piezometers that were about 50 cm apart from each other with the first one 50 cm away from the gully edge s2g s2h s2i were placed 35 cm deep along a transect paralleling to the six piezometers for both k and h measurement fig 2b because the 35 cm peat depth is where the type i gully bed was located the three piezometers will be used to examine the potential impact of the type i gully on k and h after the measurement these three s2g s2h s2i were pushed to the 95 cm depth for understanding the spatial variation of k and h at site 3 two nests of piezometers were installed in two locations at the same six different depths i e 35 50 65 80 95 125 cm one for measuring k values s3c in fig 2c and another for h values s3c in fig 2c additional eight piezometers were installed at the depth of 125 cm for understanding spatial variations of k and h at the bottom of the peat three of them s3a s3b s3f made a transect roughly parallel to the gully with the interval of about 100 cm among each other they were about 50 60 and 60 cm away from the gully respectively fig 2c seven of them except s3a together with s3c at the same depth also constituted two perpendicular transects piezometers along each transect have approximately the same spacing of 50 cm the symmetric design of piezometers was used at site 1 because we believed that at this ecohydrologically intact site there is no preferential direction of groundwater the design of piezometers in sites 2 and 3 intended to capture the lateral patterns of groundwater changes more piezometers were used at site 2 than site 3 because we expected a less degree of groundwater variation at site 2 than site 3 although it would be better to measure k values at all locations the harsh weather on the qinghai tibet plateau and limited man power forced us to select only one nest at each site for measuring k values besides k and h values spatial and temporal variations of water table were also examined at sites 2 and 3 along two transects perpendicular to each of the two selected gullies four to five boreholes having the diameter of 10 cm were cored for measuring water table levels 2 4 sampling methods at each peat depth the k value was measured using the classic piezometer slug test method hvorslev 1951 which may be expressed as follow 1 h r h h h h 0 e f k π r 2 t where h is the equalization hydraulic head h 0 is the initial hydraulic head h is the hydraulic head in a piezometer at time t after the equalization process begins r is the inner radius of the piezometer caliber and f is the shape factor after a piezometer was installed at a given depth 14 18 h were waited before measurement for avoiding the potential impact of installation on measurements the amount of water whose depth within a piezometer was typically between 10 20 cm was pumped out and h 0 and h were recorded two to three measurements of h and t were made depending on how fast the hydraulic head raised the value of h with the highest equalization time typically between 90 and 98 was used for calculating the k value the shape factor f was calculated using the equation developed by brand and preemechitt 1982 at each location and depth the hydraulic head h was measured as the length from the water level inside a piezometer to its top this value was subsequently converted to the one based on i an arbitrary datum and ii the mean water table level at the same location described later respectively the h values measured from multiple locations at the same depth were corrected by considering the differences of their surface elevations water table levels along each transect created at sites 2 and 3 were measured from the water surface within the borehole to the peat surface these values were then adjusted in terms of the differences of their surface elevations all measurements were performed from may 11 to 23 2017 with most of them repeated for 3 to 7 times with the average temporal interval of 1 day 3 results and analysis 3 1 hydraulic conductivity in general k values in all sites varied within one order of magnitude table 1 the values of their coefficient variance cv indicated that k values at site 1 had the highest degree of variation at site 1 vertical distribution of k values showed a general increasing trend from the 35 cm depth 1 135 10 7 m s to the 125 cm depth 2 444 10 7 m s though around the 80 cm depth the k value became smaller again 1 442 10 7 m s fig 3 a even taking account the relatively high variations of the k values at most depths i e the error bars in fig 3a this trend apparently persisted at the 125 cm depth which was close to the bottom of the peat at this site k values along the jek transect with the interval of 100 cm fig 2a did not display any spatial pattern fig 3b indeed k values at both j and k locations which were 3 194 and 2 518 10 7 m s were about three and two times higher than that at location e making the mean of k values at the 1 25 m depth higher this further confirmed the increasing trend of k values with peat depths at site 1 given that the peat in site 1 was not disturbed by gullies the k values at all depths and the associated vertical trend at site 1 represent standard characteristics of saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with those in the other two sites at site 2 k values also displayed an increasing trend with the depth but had greater variations among the depths fig 3a in particular this trend was highlighted by a higher k value at the 1 25 m depth 2 335 10 7 m s and a lower one at the 35 cm depth 0 641 10 7 m s than those at site 1 along the ghi transect perpendicular to the type i gully at the 95 cm depth fig 2b k values were 3 079 3 520 and 2 872 10 7 m s fig 3c showing spatial and temporal variations of the k values their mean 3 157 10 7 m s was greater than those at both the 95 and 125 cm depths of site 1 2 109 and 2 444 10 7 m s but still comparable thus the differences more likely reflected the spatial variation of the k values rather than the impact of the type i gully on hydraulic conductivity at these depths at the 35 cm depth k values along a similar transect to that at the 95 cm depth increased from 0 515 to 0 625 and then decreased to 0 572 10 7 m s fig 3c these values did not show any specific trend along the transect but their mean which was 0 571 10 7 m s was slightly less than that at the top of the vertical profile depth 0 641 10 7 m s compared with that at the same depth of site 1 the k value was reduced by 44 to 50 at this site representing a significant reduction from the standard value this reduction reflected the clear impact of type i gully on hydraulic conductivity as this is the depth of the gully bed at site 3 hydraulic conductivity was mainly measured at the 125 cm depth i e the bottom of the peat layer with merely one k value available at the 95 cm depth of location c fig 2c this was because water table at this site varied greatly and may drop to around the 90 cm depth during the sampling period based on our field observation along the fghi transect k values slightly increased from 1 651 to 1 757 10 7 m s and decreased to 1 640 10 7 m s at the location i the farthest away from the gully edge fig 3d a similar trend with generally lower magnitudes may be observed along the bcde transect the k value increased from 0 860 to 1 104 10 7 m s and then continuously decreased till 0 434 10 7 m s at location e fig 3d these trends indicated that hydraulic conductivity was highly variable at the bottom of the peat layer nearby the type ii gully along the abf transect fig 2c k values increased significantly from location a 0 254 10 7 m s to f 1 165 10 7 m s yet the three distances to the gully edge increased from 35 cm at a to 60 cm at f fig 3d these two different trends suggested that the type ii gully could cause a significant reduction of hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the peat close to it and this influence gradually declined with the increase of the distance from it comparing that at site 1 the mean k value at the 125 cm depth was decreased by 54 fig 3a further confirmed the strong impact of the type ii gully on hydraulic conductivity at the 95 cm depth the k value at site 3 was 1 892 10 7 m s which was 10 less than that at site 1 suggesting the weakened effect of the type ii gully on hydraulic conductivity as the peat depth decreases 3 2 hydraulic heads values of hydraulic heads for site 1 were summarized using the data measured from locations of a b c d e f g h and i at different peat depths fig 2a the vertical profile of hydraulic heads did not show a clear gradient below the 50 cm peat depth fig 4 a while the hydraulic head increased from the 50 cm to the 35 cm depth this spatial pattern implied relatively less vertical movement of groundwater in the lower zone from the 50 cm depth to the bottom of the intact peat though hydraulic conductivity increased with the depth comparison of the mean hydraulic heads at multiple peat depths with the mean water table indicated fig 4b that the lower zone in the intact peat belonged to a recharge zone suggesting that groundwater may be supplied from the upper peat above the 50 cm to this zone although the hydraulic heads in the 35 40 cm depth which were higher than water table fig 4b may cause possible groundwater upwelling siegel and glaser 1987 this upward discharge may not be stable because of variable water table which will be described later nonetheless figs 4a and b described the standard patterns of the hydraulic head along a vertical profile of the intact peat in the study area values of hydraulic heads measured by two nests of piezometers at six different depths of site 2 fig 2b were averaged at each depth for the entire sampling duration these data displayed fig 5 a that though hydraulic heads were generally lower than those at site 1 fig 4a they developed a gentle gradient from the 35 to 80 cm peat depth and then remained similar from the 80 cm to the 125 cm depth comparing with the vertical pattern at site 1 the gradient at site 2 was apparently caused by the less reduced hydraulic heads from the 80 cm to the 35 cm depth furthermore these less reduced hydraulic heads were higher than the mean water table fig 5b generating a similar vertical pattern to that at site 1 on the one hand higher hydraulic heads around the 35 60 cm depth turned the deep peat between 80 and 125 cm into a recharge zone on the other hand the higher hydraulic heads at these depths created a possibility of groundwater upwelling horizontally the mean hydraulic heads along a transect perpendicular to the type i gully at the 35 cm peat depth not only showed no significant gradient but also changed in magnitudes only by less than 3 among each other fig 5c indicating no clear lateral hydraulic gradient toward the type i gully in its neighboring peat hydraulic heads at site 3 were only measured from the 60 to 125 cm depths due to significantly lowered water table these values were also less than those at similar depths of site 1 and the degree of reduction was greater than those at site 2 figs 4a 5a and 6a vertically they created a steeper gradient within the 60 95 cm depth compared with that at site 2 fig 5a and 6a from the 95 cm depth to the bottom of the peat the hydraulic head continued to decrease but with a less gradient these changes led to a discernable low hydraulic head at the bottom of the peat layer this low value clearly indicated the strong impact of the type ii gully on the hydraulic head at the bottom of the peat layer levels of the hydraulic heads at all depths were much lower than that of water table fig 6 b again indicating groundwater in the peat depths close to the bottom was recharged from that in the upper part associated with this spatial pattern were the relatively higher variations of the hydraulic heads at each peat depth compared with those at sites 1 and 2 figs 4a 5a and 6a which further embodied the impact of the type ii gully on the hydraulic heads of the nearby peat horizontally at the 125 cm depth averaged values of hydraulic heads along two transects perpendicular to the type ii gully demonstrated evident gradients toward the gully edge fig 6c the gradient along the bcde transect fig 2c was greater than that along the fghi transect which is associated with the fact that the former was closer to the gully edge than the latter these gradients suggested the existence of groundwater flow to the gully bank at the depth equivalent to the bottom of the peat layer 3 3 water table levels much of the time during the field measurement the peat surface at site 1 was saturated its temporal variation was limited with the mean value approximately around the 5 cm depth which was the one used as a reference for calculating relative hydraulic heads at the same site fig 4b along transect 1 at site 2 the mean water table level was lower at the location 100 cm away from the gully edge fig 7 a and linearly increased to that 200 cm away from the gully edge it then stayed about the same level in the next 100 cm this spatial pattern was apparently similar to the drawdown effect of water table yet water table along transect 2 displayed a different trend while it raised from the distance of 100 to 150 cm away from the edge water table dropped in the following 150 cm distance to lower levels fig 7a on average the two transects at site 2 were apart from each other for only about 160 cm thus the different trends of water table levels along them suggested that reduction of water table as the distance away from the gully edge increases was not consistent in the peat next to the type i gully the relatively high error bars in all locations at site 2 fig 7a suggested that temporal variation of water table at site 2 was relatively high our field observation at site 3 indicated that water table changed obviously and consistently along the distance away from the gully edge this was corroborated by the measured changes of water table along two transects perpendicular to the type ii gully fig 7b at the location around 100 cm away from the gully edge water table level was on average 61 6 cm and 51 8 cm below the peat surface respectively regarding to each transect in the following 400 cm distance it raised to 39 5 and 35 1 cm along the two transects respectively the significant and consistent changes of water table along these two transects suggested that the type ii gully clearly caused the drawdown effect of water table in the peat close to it water table levels were generally lower with higher degrees of variation in transect 1 than in transect 2 this might reflect the nature of its high spatial variation 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties in measuring hydraulic conductivity and its variability field methods of determining hydraulic conductivity are essentially derived from the rigid soil theory assuming that darcy s law holds and soil is incompressible eq 1 holds when i soil is incompressible and ii water table is not affected by flow required for equalization hvorslev 1951 unfortunately the compressible nature of the peat and possible smearing of the peat around the piezometer intake could affect the equalization process baird et al 2004 hogan et al 2006 holden and burt 2003b leading to errors in calculating k values although this method has been widely used fraser et al 2001 mccarter and price 2013 robbins et al 2009 rossi et al 2012 whittington and price 2006 few have addressed potential errors explicitly holden and burt 2003a s investigation showed that k 90 was generally six times higher than k 50 where k 90 and k 50 are values of hydraulic conductivity calculated using the 90 and 50 equalization time in eq 1 respectively they also reported that k values calculated using the monograph method brand and preemechitt 1982 was not only significantly smaller than those based on eq 1 but also more sensitive to spatial locations baird et al 2004 found that the equalization process is consistent with that based on eq 1 for root mat surridge et al 2005 scrutinized eq 1 by performing carefully designed slug tests and concluded that though the recovery processes were generally not log linear the estimated k values using eq 1 were acceptable thus we think that eq 1 is the appropriate one for determining k values and used it in this study in reality however peat matrix is highly deformable price and schlotzhauer 1999 and the resultant peat expansion and compaction inevitably affect the k values computed using eq 1 during our field measurement we examined the stability of the equalization hydraulic head i e h cm by recording water levels within piezometers adjacent to the test piezometer at the beginning and end of each slug test and comparing these levels between the two we found that in many tests these water levels changed with different magnitudes at different peat depths fig 8 a the greater error bar of the top point indicated a higher temporal variation of the hydraulic head changes at the 35 cm depth these changes suggested that the inflow rate was not stable during the slug test thus the assumption that the original inflow rate remained unchanged as required by eq 1 freeze and cherry 1979 was invalid this variation directly affected calculation of the head ratio i e hr and subsequently the k values our examination showed that k values estimated by considering the variable inflow rates were on average close to the non adjusted ones except at the 50 and 80 cm peat depths where the former were about 35 higher than the latter fig 8b this relatively small difference compared with the high variability of hydraulic conductivity holden and burt 2003b surridge et al 2005 allowed us to treat the variable equalization hydraulic head as one of the errors in the calculation and adopt the non adjusted k values in the analysis as site 1 was located in the ecohydrologically intact peat the k values at this site represent the first measured set of primitive saturated hydraulic conductivity in the zoige peatland which varied from 1 135 to 2 520 10 5 cm s table 1 the variation was within one order of magnitude and seemed less than that in many other peatlands hobbs 1986 surridge et al 2005 whittington and price 2006 although these k values were within the same range as those in the north pennines uk holden and burt 2003a they were at least one order of magnitude less than those in an undisturbed blanket peat in british isles the difference might be due to the fact that the latter were measured using a different method based on a mini disc tension infiltrometer wallage and holden 2011 since the study area is representative of the zoige peatland that is mainly made of fabric peats with a low deteriorated root system chai and jing 1963 sun 1992 our measured k values may be compared with those obtained in canada and indeed were within the range of those values letts et al 2000 the increasing trend of the mean k values with the peat depth fig 3a is at odds with many previously reported results fraser et al 2001 glaser et al 1981 hoag and price 1995 whittington and price 2006 while consistent with others in different peatlands baird et al 2008 clymo 2004 apparently saturated hydraulic conductivity in the study area within the zoige peatland seems not drastically different from that in blanket peatlands of other places though more measurements in other summer months are needed to show its temporal variations 4 2 distinct impacts of two types of gullies on peat groundwater according to darcy s law hydraulic properties of groundwater flow are primarily controlled by hydraulic conductivity k and hydraulic head h the different k and h values between site 1 and the other two sites presented a possibility that two types of gullies might have different impact on groundwater flow in the zoige peatland the type i gully modestly reduced hydraulic conductivity at the 35 cm depth by about 30 as the gully bed only reached this depth fig 3a from this depth to the bottom of the peat the differences of the k values between sites 1 and 2 were well within the typical range of spatially variable hydraulic conductivity in blanket peats surridge et al 2005 suggesting that these values were not subject to the impact of the type i gully at least during the study period the relatively lower h values at all depths than those at site 1 and a gentle hydraulic gradient crated by the higher h values at the 35 65 cm depths than the mean water table level fig 5a and b signified a possibly greater influence of the type i gully on the hydraulic head than the hydraulic conductivity while these changes of h values may result in possible groundwater downwelling the reduced hydraulic conductivity fig 3a within these depths may offset this possibility therefore the type i gully had limited influence on hydraulic properties of groundwater this limited influence was supported by the insignificant changes of water table levels along the two horizontal transects perpendicular to the gully at the 35 cm depth comparing with the variation of water table at site 1 which was typically between 0 and 15 cm depths the change at site 2 ranged from 20 to 31 cm depths this difference is more likely related to the topographic difference of the two sites elevations of site 1 were much lower than those of surrounding hummocks than those at site 2 as earlier studies have shown that topography is a dominant control on the change of water table levels of peats holden et al 2006 2011 at site 3 the type ii gully had a significant impact on not only water table but also k and h values the water table level at the location of 100 cm away from the gully edge dropped about 22 cm compared with that at the location 500 cm away from the gully edge fig 7b clearly showing the distance decay effect as observed in other peatlands allott et al 2009 boelter 1972 compared with that at site 1 the water table level decreased significantly but the k value at the 95 cm depth was very close to that at the same depth of site 1 fig 3a nonetheless at the bottom of the peat the mean k value was reduced by 50 compared with that at site 1 this reduction was more likely affected by the nearby type ii gully which cut through the peat layer along the banks in addition this gully induced significantly decreased hydraulic heads at all depths such that their levels were all lower than that of the water table fig 6b these decreased hydraulic heads also created a significant downward hydraulic gradient with the slope of 0 305 fig 6b which was much steeper than that in a blanket bog located in newfoundland canada price 1992 it followed that the peat body around the bottom became a strong recharge zone the discovery of this recharge zone explained the significant drop of water table at this site and suggested that groundwater steadily moved toward the bottom of the peat layer more importantly at or near the bottom of the peat i e 125 cm deep the type ii gully created a clear and strong hydraulic gradient horizontally toward the gully edge with an average slope of 0 051 fig 6c therefore though the mean hydraulic conductivity decreased from 2 444 to 1 129 10 5 cm s at this peat depth the emerged horizontal gradient i e 0 051 led to an approximate rate of groundwater flow i e specific discharge at 0 0576 mm day draining out of the gully banks given that this calculation ignored anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity it may not be truly accurate beckwith et al 2003 fraser et al 2001 however this flow rate provided the first estimation of groundwater flow through the broken bottom of the peat at the banks of the type ii gully in the zoige peatland holden et al 2006 believed that enhanced flow in deeper peat that is affected by artificial ditches is possibly attributed to the increased hydraulic conductivity however our data showed that the k value at the bottom of the peat the 125 cm depth next to the type ii gully was indeed decreased compared with that of the intact peat i e site 1 thus the increased lateral discharge at site 3 was groundwater flow mainly due to the development of both vertical downward and horizontal toward the gully edge hydraulic gradients because our findings were only based on measurements in 13 days of may 2017 whether these interpretations remain true in other summer months is still unknown and requires further data collection to confirm nonetheless these findings provided the first field based evidence on how the type ii gully may change the groundwater of the zoige peatland it should be noted that though hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the peat was reduced it is still two orders of magnitude higher than that in deeper peats in north pennine uk holden and burt 2002 whether it is due to the limitation of the current data or the fact that the pennine peat depth which is about 250 cm is higher than that i e 125 cm in our study area awaits for more in situ studies our data signified the possibility that the altered groundwater hydrology of peatland by a neighboring type ii gully may occur at or near the bottom of peat since the type ii gully has already cut through the peat layer exactly how deep the gully bed goes further down seems to have no impact on the altered groundwater hydrology of peat on the contrary the change of hydraulic properties of groundwater in the peat next to a type i gully appears to be related to the depth of the gully bed though in our case at site 2 the change was not significant so it is not clear whether a type i gully with a deeper bed would cause an alteration of groundwater at the similar depth in the nearby peat putting these together gully depth in general may not be a sensitive parameter that can test the impact of gullies on water table this might be a factor causing the poor relationship between the two in an earlier study allott et al 2009 nonetheless the high degree of water table drop near the type ii gully did support the term erosional acrotelm coined to describe the enlarged acrotelm due to the nearby gully daniels et al 2008 4 3 possible implication of gully impact on peat our field observation indicated that groundwater seepage from the bottom of the peat layer may be easily identified along banks of the type ii gully different from that caused by perched water table which may be substantial and initiate soil erosion fox et al 2007 this groundwater seepage was not large enough to even contribute to the baseflow of the gully channel yet it had persisted over the entire sampling period keeping the underlying mineral bank wet all the time fig 9 we noticed that the wet mineral banks did not necessarily exist everywhere along the longitudinal direction of the gully some sections of gully banks were covered by collapsed bank materials and hence groundwater seepage was not observable wherever the mineral bank and its immediate top peat were dry the peat layer that constitutes a series of roughly paralleled stratification or stratigraphy hughes et al 2000 showed horizontal cracks near or at the bottom of the peat or a few small holes fig 10 these cracks and or small holes that have been also reported in other peatlands grab and deschamps 2004 holden and burt 2002 suggested that the preferential flow or pipe flow which moves much faster than groundwater flow holden and burt 2002 holden et al 2001 wallage and holden 2011 facilitated water to drain quickly and resulted in the dried minerals at these locations our data and field observation suggested that enhanced groundwater flow through type ii gullies created by intense erosion processes could be a significant cause for it though data collected over longer time periods e g two to three years are required to further confirm our findings 5 conclusions impact of gullies on hydrological properties of groundwater in the zoige peatland china was investigated using field measured data for saturated hydraulic conductivity k hydraulic head h and water table levels at three representative sites one site 1 on the intact peat that has not been disturbed by gullies and the other two sites 2 and 3 next to the type i and type ii gullies respectively in comparison with those at site 1 spatial patterns of these data at sites 2 and 3 revealed the distinct effects of the two types of gullies on groundwater hydrology the type i gully with a shallow bed located at the 35 cm peat depth only caused the reduction of the k value at this depth by 30 which was most likely related to the lowered water table level that may be at the 25 cm peat depth and may had less effect on the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the gully it also led to generally decreased hydraulic heads along a vertical profile of the peat these h values created a downward hydraulic gradient with the upper peat at the 35 50 cm depth having hydraulic heads higher than the mean water table level this change may cause possibly weak upwelling and downwelling of groundwater from this depth because of the gentle hydraulic gradient thus the impact of the type i gully on groundwater seems to be fairly limited given that artificial ditches created in the zoige peatland during 1950 1980 s generally have beds within the peat layer these ditches share similar hydrological functions with type i gullies and might have limited impact on groundwater hydrology as well groundwater in the peat near the type ii gully could be strongly affected by the broken bottom of the peat water table level decreased significantly and demonstrated a strong distance decay effect associated with it was the decrease of hydraulic conductivity by 50 around the bottom of the peat in addition hydraulic heads along a vertical profile were all lower than the mean water table level with a steep downward hydraulic gradient this change made the deep peat a recharge zone and had maintained groundwater moving downward horizontally at the bottom of the peat reduced hydraulic heads formed a clear hydraulic gradient toward the gully edge which resulted in a leaking effect i e groundwater seepage at the bottom of the peat along the gully banks because our data were only obtained in may 2017 whether this leaking effect persists through the summer and winter is uncertain if it exists over the whole year then enhanced groundwater flow from the type ii gullies may be a significant cause for zoige peatland shrinkage since gully erosion in the zoige peatland is geomorphologically controlled by the geologically lowered base level of the upper yellow river downstream of the zoige basin development of the type ii gullies will continue even if climate change remains the minimum therefore more studies are necessary for confirming

8456,study region prairie pothole region of canada study focus the prairie region spans across approximately 870 000 km2 of the great plains region of canada 80 and the united states 20 the presence of a large number of depressional wetlands potholes results in dynamic surface water and stream connectivity during wet and dry year necessitating an improved understanding of watershed scale interactions of the prairie potholes the soil water assessment tool swat hydrological model with three structural variants is utilized to assess the degree of accuracy associated with increasing model complexity and its impact on the model calibration of the upper assiniboine river basin at kamsack new hydrologic insight for the region the swat model was calibrated and verified with three different structural arrangements in 1 lumped pothole 2 semi discretized pothole 3 and fully discretized pothole representation the fully discretized pothole version of the swat reflected streamflow best kge of 0 78 but with greater uncertainty larger data and computational resource requirements the fully discretized modified model however was able to capture the high flow and the fill and spill processes which is a defining characteristic of the prairie pothole region ppr significant improvements to the predictive ability of swat in the case of the modified model was observed thus allowing an enhanced understanding of the aggregate effect of potholes in this watershed keywords prairie potholes hydrologic connectivity soil and water assessment tool swat multi model comparison parameter uncertainty 1 introduction the north american prairie pothole region ppr is characterized by a large number of prairie pothole pp wetlands studies suggest that the number of pp fluctuates between 5 8 million such wetlands millett et al 2009 prairie pothole wetlands are traditionally smaller depressional wetlands developed following the last glacial recession winter and rosenberry 1995 numerous studies have indicated these wetlands hereafter simply pothole wetlands significantly influence the hydrology of watersheds in the ppr affecting peak streamflow and flood characteristics bengtson and padmanabhan 1999 phillips et al 2011 shaw et al 2013 vining 2002 muhammad et al 2018a baseflow contributions euliss et al 2014 and biogeochemical processing labaugh et al 2018 rains et al 2016 wetlands play a major role in watershed health and are integral component of much of the canadian prairie landscape nearly 70 of the wetlands has been lost in the ppr despite the numerous benefits to flood mitigation they are still considered a hindrance to agricultural production with 84 of this loss attributed to agricultural development conly and van der kamp 2001 prairie hydrology has been studied for many decades so it is well established that surface runoff in the prairie region often drains into depressions forming wetlands or potholes these depressions are closed basins that retain water for prolonged periods of time and do not necessarily contribute flow to the stream under normal or below normal runoff conditions during times of high runoff the storage capacity of these depressions can be exceeded causing a fill and spill spence and woo 2003 process to be initiated shook et al 2013 once all the depressions are filled overland flow serves to connect such depressions inducing much larger runoff consequently temporary streams can form that result in dynamic increases in the contributing area of the watershed shaw et al 2012 when these depressions become empty the movement of water stops causing a break in their interconnections and consequently reduce the contributing area shook et al 2013 the dynamic nature of these isolated wetlands makes the hydrology of the prairie region difficult to model and quantify protection and restoration of pothole wetlands requires abundant watershed scale data and robust modeling methods evenson et al 2018 golden et al 2017 watershed scale hydrologic models can be valuable tools that enhance our understanding of complex natural processes and aid in examining the potential impacts of land use change and best management practices bmps hydrologic models constructed to study ppr watersheds need to consider the important role that pothole wetlands play in the ppr hydrologic cycle muhammad et al 2018b muhammad et al 2016 a number of modeling studies have evaluated how these wetlands should be assessed in watershed scale models the cold region hydrological model crhm in conjunction with the prairie hydrological model phm were used to establish pothole volume area depth relationships pomeroy et al 2010 to better estimate pothole storage volume crhm pomeroy et al 2014 was further utilized with the dem based ponding model shook et al 2013 for assessing streamflow fluctuation while changing pothole coverage a significant increase 55 in streamflow was observed when all the potholes within the dem ponding model were removed the precipitation runoff modeling system prms was used to simulate the effects of pothole wetlands on downgradient streamflow in north dakota and georgia usa viger et al 2010 vining 2002 the prms however utilize the conceptual and or lumped parameter wetland and thus ignores pothole wetlands spatial representations the prms was further utilized to see if the nearby normalized lake cottonwood elevation measurement would improve model calibration and would improve the simulation of surface water depression storage dynamics and streamflow simulation hay et al 2018 results of the experiment indicated that inclusion of lake elevation measurements give an indication of the change in surface water depression storage in the calibration procedure as well as an accurate representation of the water balance amado et al 2018 applied the hydrogeosphere model on a drained and farmed wetland complex in the ppr of iowa to quantify water balance of wetland complex the timing and duration of surface and groundwater connection in the drained wetland complex results indicated that intermittent ponding was observed in pothole depressions but hydrologic connectivity among three pothole depressions via surface water ponding was rarely established the soil water assessment tool swat a widely utilized model arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 neitsch et al 2011 gassman et al 2007 has been applied to assess the impact of depressions on hydrologic processes at the catchment scale wang et al 2008 for example used the swat model by constructing hydrological equivalent wetlands hew which describes the aggregate functional attributes of wetlands at subbasin scale results suggested that when compared to swat with no wetlands the model with hew had a significant impact on decreasing the probability of exceedance of peak flow almendinger et al 2014 utilized swat to investigate the effect of isolated wetlands on the hydrologic flows and sediment yields in the willow river watershed wisconsin significant reductions in sediment yield were observed at the outlet as most of the sediment was trapped by the potholes and did not reach the outlet evenson et al 2015 modified swat model at the hru scale to simulate the effect of geographically isolated wetlands giws on stream flow and sediment loading in north carolina usa following a series of change scenarios in giws coverage evenson et al 2015 found that change in giw coverage has a significant influence on the downstream streamflow hydrograph in an additional study evenson et al 2016 further modified the swat model to account for depressional storage and to incorporate the fill and spill process of potholes but on a more local scale that overlooks regional scale connectivity several studies table 1 have evaluated the important role that pothole wetlands play in the hydrology of the upper assiniboine river basin uarb for example shrestha et al 2012a b used swat model to assess climate induced hydrological changes and the impact on nutrient loading in the basin the study however utilized the standard representation of swat pothole wetlands representation that is the fill and spill functionality of pothole wetlands was not explicitly represented mekonnen et al 2017 used the swat model in conjuction with the probability distributed landscape depression model pdld to better depict prairie landscape depressions in hydrological modeling mekonnen et al 2016a b and found improved results in comparison to the lumped single storage swat approach to pothole representation mekonnen et al 2016a s approach however did not simulate fill and spill hydrology between pothole wetlands that is hydrologic flow was not routed between depressional wetlands pothole wetlands it simply spilled to the subbasin reach once a pothole wetland is filled to capacity advances in our understanding of how pothole wetlands impact watershed hydrology have been made with the aforementioned studies providing valuable insights into evaluating pothole wetlands at the watershed scales using hydrologic models added complexity in hydrological models however typically results in complex model calibration problems and therefore often limits them in operational use previous studies have mostly focused on multi model performance comparison the selection of model with an appropriate complexity is as crucial as the ability of model performance to replicate hydrologic processes beckers et al 2009 which is often defined based on required data resources and time to parameterized and calibrate the model thus there is a need to investigate the degree of accuracy associated with increasing model complexity and its impact on model calibration in the canadian prairie pothole region cppr the objective of this study was not to identify a singular best method for evaluating pothole wetland complexes within the ppr instead we aimed to evaluate alternative structural i e mechanistic avenues of pothole wetland representation and to highlight their impact on model calibration i e parameter uncertainty which is known to compensate for model structural limitations in complex hydrologic landscapes evenson et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2015 to realize this objective we applied swat and a previously demonstrated method of modifying that model to incorporate an improved structural representation of pothole wetlands see evenson et al 2016 this provided several alternative structural representations of pothole wetlands of varying complexity for our watershed of interest the study was carried in close collaboration with the manitoba hydrologic forecast centre hfc 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the upper assiniboine river basin uarb at kamsack is located in the ppr and spans across saskatchewan and manitoba in canada fig 1 a b the watershed is of critical importance as flow generated in the basin enters the lake of the prairies shellmouth reservoir which was constructed for flood mitigation purposes and is situated approximately 45 km downstream of the watershed outlet the uarb at kamsack drains about 13 000 km2 and is monitored by five streamflow gauging stations see fig 1c also detailed in table 2 with the exception of the gauge located at the uarb outlet gauging stations inside the basin are seasonal with records available from march to october only the uarb is dominated by agriculture 72 followed by forest 14 fig 1d with a significant portion of the watershed labeled as non contributing meaning these regions do not contribute to streamflow under normal conditions resulting from a large number of prairie potholes disconnecting large portions of the basin drainage area fig 1e using geographic information system gis the density of potholes which is the number of pothole wetlands identified divided by total area of the watershed is estimated at 3 5 per km2 covering around 140 km2 of the watershed area as per our analysis an area of 2025 km2 which makes approximately 16 of the total uarb area drain to these pothole wetlands the presence of such a large number of potholes and the dynamics of contributing and non contributing basin area are complex and therefore the uarb has been given the nickname the grave yard of hydrological models shook 2012 black chernozemic soils overlay almost 70 of the basin which are high in organic matter and have generally developed under native grassland saskatchewan water security agency 2000 shrestha et al 2012a b the watershed is flat with elevation ranging from 450 to 690 m above sea level masl and an average slope of 0 002 m m fig 1f the climate of the uarb is continental sub humid characterized by long cold winter and short summer where the mean annual temperature and potential evapotranspiration is about 1 c and 850 mm respectively saskatchewan water security agency 2000 average annual precipitation is 450 mm with approximately 26 of the precipitation falling as snow

routed through the stream network swat also has an internal routine for modeling wetlands ponds potholes and reservoirs explicitly evenson et al 2016 2015 the freely available open source swat code graphical user interface and previous application in the ppr were among the selection criteria for working with swat model 2 4 experimental setup to examine the impact of model structure on streamflow simulation we evaluated multiple methods of pothole wetland representation and spatial discretization within a singular watershed scale hydrologic model three versions of swat were constructed lumped semi distributed fully distributed in this study the definition of lumped and distributed model is strictly based on the pothole wetland representation in the hydrological model landcover discretization and does not refer to the underlying model spatial discretization when pothole wetlands in a sub basin are represented as a single storage entity the model is termed as lumped however when pothole wetlands are spatially discretized are appreciated the model is termed as distributed we describe the differences between these models below 2 4 1 model 1 lumped pothole version of swat model in the lumped modeling system the uarb was portioned into five subbasins where each subbasin drained to one of the five streamflow gauges swat was allowed to use all the combination of land use soil type and slope while constructing its hrus resulting in 271 hrus model 1 utilizes the swat model s lumped wetland representation wherein all pothole wetlands within a subbasin are aggregated i e lumped and the hydrologic effect of the lumped wetland are then proportionally distributed across all hrus within the subbasin hence model 1 does not represent pothole fill and spill processes all pothole wetlands within a subbasin are represented as a single lumped depression flow directed towards pothole wetlands is stored in this lumped depression and when the depression is filled to its capacity it is spilled to the subbasin reach 2 4 2 model 2 semi discretized pothole version of swat model model 2 utilizes the same wetland mechanistic representation of wetlands as model 1 i e the swat model s existing wetland representation however model 2 employs a more discretized version of the swat to account for the spatial heterogeneity in wetland landcover and physiographic characteristics across the landscape and of various forcing data in this version of the swat model the watershed was delineated by creating 45 subbasins with no threshold for hrus defined instead the model setup used all combinations of land use soil type and slope resulting in 971 hrus representing landscape variability again this model version however did not have any specific representation of pothole fill and spill processes evenson et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2016a b instead it uses the internal swat wetland module neitsch et al 2011 to represent prairie potholes 2 4 3 model 3 fully discretized version of swat modified version given the complexity of the ppr landscape swats representation of pothole wetlands was modified to capture the dynamics of contributing and non contributing areas in theory representing the pothole fill and spill routing processes among pothole wetlands within a subbasin more realistically a procedure similar to that of evenson et al 2016 was selected for this model to examine potential improvement in streamflow simulation by adding pothole wetland representation and fill and spill processes to the model structure this study however was conducted on a regional scale 13 000 km2 with the goal of assessing the tradeoff made between model physical accuracy and calibration complexity furthermore the spatial discretization of pothole wetlands and how it impact streamflow simulation were examined on a large scale the research interests of evenson et al 2016 were to investigate on giws hydrologic behavior on local scale water balance i e 2000 km2 which does not examine the regional connectivity of fill and spill processes we first identify potholes hereafter called as the giws following the procedure by lane et al 2012 using the 30 m thematic map from agriculture and agri food canada circa2000 a 10 m buffer 20 m total buffer cross width from the natural stream network obtained from the hydrologic forecasting centre hfc of manitoba was used to identify all wetland areas not crossed by the 20 m buffer as giws out of 4353 wetlands 4012 were identified as giws comprising an area of 142 km2 the storage capacity of the identified giws were computed using eq 1 which is based on experimental studies conducted by ducks unlimited canada and water security agency of saskatchewan wiens 2001 1 v g i w 2 85 a 1 22 if a 70 7 1 a 9 97 if a 70 where a is the surface area of the giw in hectare and v is the volume of giw in cubic decameter dam3 that will be converted to cubic meter the standard representation of potholes at the hru level was redefined in swat fig 2 in the standard swat version hrus are formed using soil information land use and topography data in the modified version the identified giws map was added as a fourth attribute that serves as an indicator of the hrus spatial and hydrological connectivity to identified giws hrus that fall within an identified giws were merged into a single giw hru a pothole equivalent to the storage capacity of the identified giw was placed in the giw hru a set of new text input files were constructed to facilitate giws fill and spill processes all hrus positioned within a giw drainage area were channelized to drain to the immediately down gradient giw hru once filled outflow spillage from giw hru is routed to the giw hru located immediate down gradient therefore in fig 2 the redefinition creates giw hrus hrus 6 and 10 outflow from hrus 4 and 5 which are non giws hru is routed to giw hru 6 as hru 4 and 5 falls inside the catchment area of giw hru 6 outflow spillage from giw hrus hru 6 is routed to the giw hru located immediately downstream e g giw hru 10 in case there is no giw hru or non giw hru present immediately downstream the flow is routed to the stream constructing swats hrus in this manner results in a 1500 increase in the number of hrus totaling 15 235 for the uarb within 45 subbasins for the uarb 2 4 4 model setup the three swat models with various structural arrangements were constructed using meteorological forcing from capa precipitation and narr temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for the 2002 2011 period swat considers each grid point as a station within a particular subbasin using the model uses the grid point nearest to the subbasin centroid for meteorological forcing the models were developed using arc swat interface of swat2012 revision 627 neitsch et al 2011 to ensure a consistent comparison among the three models the technique employed for calibration and validation of the model were kept the same the predefined stream network obtained from the hfc of manitoba are added to the dem while delineating the catchment boundary and the sub watershed draining to the catchment outlet at kamsack potential evapotranspiration et is computed following penman monteith monteith 1965 the degree day method was chosen for estimating snowmelt runoff the soil conservation service scs method estimating rainfall runoff and the variable storage williams 1969 for routing the generated runoff 2 4 5 model calibration validation and uncertainty analysis once all three models were constructed they were calibrated and verified at a daily time step against the observed streamflow records at each gauge location see fig 1c the period from 2002 to 2004 was used for model spin up 2005 2008 for model calibration and 2009 2011 for model verification to ensure robust modeling practice both the calibration and validation period were chosen with approximately matching mean precipitation and temperature statistics e g consisting of both wet and dry periods the year 2011 in the validation period was an extreme high flow year that has resulted slight increase in mean flow across the validation period see table 4 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was employed to explore the feasible parameter space and investigate parameter sensitivity and its associated uncertainty swat cup is a module developed to automate calibration abbaspour 2007 the program provides an interface that links uncertainty techniques such as sufi 2 parameter solution parasol generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue particle swarm optimization pso and markov chain monte carlo mcmc this research used sufi 2 and thus the discussion is limited to the used of this uncertainty algorithm only in sufi 2 parameter uncertainty is described by a multivariate uniform distribution which is expressed in ranges while output uncertainty is described by the 95 prediction uncertainty band 95ppu the 95ppu is calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution function cdf for the output variables abbaspour et al 2004 2007 latin hypercube sampling is used to draw independent parameter sets abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 is considered computationally efficient where good results can be achieved with smaller number of model runs yang et al 2008 which is an important aspect concerning the scope of work of this study the goodness of fit during calibration and prediction uncertainty are evaluated based on the closeness of the p factor to 100 i e all observations fall within the 95ppu and the r factor to 0 i e the width of the 95ppu abbaspour et al 2015 suggested that p factor values above 0 7 and r factor values below 1 5 are satisfactory parameters in swat are process based and therefore must be defined within a realistic range obtaining a single set of acceptable parameters however can be problematic when parameter equifinality is considered and often results in several behavioral sets that statistically equally fit observations beven 2009 1989 beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 kelleher et al 2016 to reduce the issue of equifinality model calibration was constrained with regional signatures local observations and published literature the current study benefits from the published literature in terms of selecting calibration parameters almendinger et al 2014 evenson et al 2016 2015 mekonnen et al 2016a b wang et al 2008 a total of 27 parameters were identified table 5 that may potentially affect the streamflow through a combination of global and trial and error sensitivity analyses and were included within the calibration process the auto calibration interface swat cup was run in a set of four iterations each with 500 simulations for a total of 2000 model simulation calls to get the best possible range for the parameters considered 2 5 performance metrics to guide parameters selection and define the parameter space the kling gupta efficiency criterion gupta et al 2009 or kge was used as the objective function to evaluate model performance kge allows for a multi objective perspective by focusing on correlation error variability error and bias volume error pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 that is kge is the decomposition of the means squared error mse and nse performance criteria gupta et al 2009 and was developed to help reduce model calibration problems when nse is used a kge 0 5 is set as the threshold value for selecting any simulation run while running the auto calibration program 2 k g e 1 r 1 2 1 2 β 1 2 where α σ s σ m β μ s μ m σs and σm stand for the standard deviation of simulated and measured data μs and μm are the means for simulated and measured data and r is the linear regression coefficient between measured and simulated data other performance statistics such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which is a normalized statistic used for comparing the residual variance to measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias which computes the average tendency of the simulated variable to be larger or smaller than the observed variable and the correlation coefficient r2 which is an index that measures the degree of linear relationship between observed and simulated variable were also considered to provide further perspective on model performance the nse ranges between and 1 where values between 0 5 and 1 are generally considered as an acceptable range moriasi et al 2007 although motovilov et al 1999 suggested a value between 0 36 0 75 as satisfactory the optimum value for pbias is 0 however values between 25 are considered satisfactory singh et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 the r2 ranges between 1 and 1 with 1 being perfectly positive and 1 as the perfectly negative relationship the r2 0 5 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 3 results 3 1 comparison of model parameters model parameters table 5 initial and calibrated values were analysed with a focus on how the parameters change in the evolution from a simple to more complex representation and how these changes affect hydrological processes within the watershed wet k increased as model complexity increased changing from 0 95 model 1 to 1 23 model 2 and 3 34 model 3 this leads to higher water loss into the ground which increased as expected percolation and groundwater recharge from model 1 to model 3 respectively this same effect is seen in the rechrg dp and alpha bf parameters which represent ground water recharge and baseflow as both parameter have a higher coefficient of contribution due to more groundwater availability to further validate cn2 which governs the behavior of surface runoff decreases for the most complex model model 3 which therefore results in a reduced capacity to generate surface runoff in model 3 3 2 model comparison based on daily and seasonal streamflow to investigate the impact of model structure on the accuracy of streamflow we first performed visual inspection of the simulated to observed daily streamflow hydrograph for each model at the five gauge locations fig 1c here we present results for the catchment outlet 05md004 assiniboine river at kamsack only fig 3 presents both the observed and simulated streamflow along with 95 uncertainty bounds at the outlet of the catchment for all three models a poor fit is seen in the case of model 1 lumped version of swat during the calibration period especially for peak flows which are highly underestimated a further decrease in the performance of the model is seen during the validation period in particular during the fall 2010 and spring 2011 thus showing the models lack of robustness with respect to simulating peak flows significant improvement can be observed in the case for both the second lumped pothole wetland version of swat with more spatial discretization of the system and third swat fully discretized pothole wetlands version model both model 2 and model 3 were able to produce simulated hydrographs that are representative of the observed daily average flow during the calibration and validation periods more importantly both models fig 3 closely simulate the timing and duration of the peak streamflow model 2 in comparison to model 3 tends to underpredict the larger peaks e g the peaks during 2006 2007 2010 and 2011 we further assess the performance of the models at a daily time step on the basis of multiple statistical metrics table 6 the rating of model performance was based on the guideline presented by abbaspour et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 singh et al 2005 based on the established criteria model 1 is categorized as satisfactory during the calibration period however unsatisfactory during the validation period on the other hand streamflow simulation capabilities of both model 2 and model 3 can be rated as good to very good for the calibration as well validation period due to improved performance metrics kge nse and r2 model 3 however has the most improved performance relative to both model 2 and model 1 to further understand the changes in simulated flow processes results were compared on a seasonal basis the seasons were defined as per standard canadian practice winter wi december to february djf spring sp march to may mam summer su june to august jja and fall fa september to november son since continuous streamflow records were available for the watershed outlet only the analysis was restricted to the outlet of the catchment fall was chosen as the low flow season average daily flow 23 m3 sec and spring as the high flow season average daily flow 43 m3 sec we present results for the high and low flow seasons fig 4 and table 7 only based on table 7 all performance measures suggest that model 3 appears to performs better higher kge nse and r2 followed by model 2 model 1 does not seem to replicate both high and low seasonal flow well the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency suggests that model 2 and model 3 are capable of predicting high seasonal flow this can be visually observed in fig 4 where model 2 and model 3 more closely follow the observed streamflow during the validation period one main interest in testing different model configurations was to evaluate how each model responds to peak flows which we statistically represent as the 10 quantile of the peak stream flows over the 2005 2011 period fig 5 following moriasi et al 2007 both model 2 and model 3 can be rated as good as satisfactory table 8 model 3 however has a slight edge based on higher performance statistics overall higher kge and nse a weakness of all the models was their inability to simulate the peak flow in 2011 fig 6 furthermore all models tend to overestimate median flow why the model fails to adequately capture median flow is debatable this could be due model structural limitations that is they are unable to account for all runoff generating processes or it may be due to overestimation of or bias in the rainfall in general model 2 and model 3 in comparison to model 1 which consistently underestimates high flow perform well for high flows except for the major peaks of 2010 and 2011 also based on fig 6 model 2 and model 3 better replicate low flows relative to model 1 which suggests that these models may be better at representing the full range of flows rather than just the medians as an additional test we assess the models performance utilizing the coefficient of variations cv which is defined as the standard deviation divided by its mean the seasonal mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation is summarized in table 9 for the three models along with the observed flow records based on the table 9 more than half of the total streamflow over the period 2005 2011 occurs during spring the relatively low 1 15 value of the coefficient of variation in spring for the observed streamflow suggests lower inter annual variability during the spring period in general model 3 has similar statistics i e mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation compared to the other two models 3 3 water balance to investigate how various hydrological processes e g evaporation runoff etc respond to change in model structure we analyzed each models water balance in table 10 the total precipitation falling over the watershed pcp is the primary source of inflow whereas the evapotranspiration et and water yield wyld are the major outflows in swat wyild is the summation of surface flow qsurf the lateral flow qlat and the shallow aquifer flow termed as the groundwater flow qgw which at some point returns to the stream minus the transmission losses of tributary channels et is the dominant process during both the calibration and validation period accounting for 70 90 of the water losses which is consistent with the estimates reported by saskatchewan water security agency 2000 in all three models during low to normal conditions potholes are internally drained and are represented in reality as non contributing areas in 2007 a drier year model 2 reports more than 2 2 18 1016 mm3 increase in surface runoff volume compared to model 3 table 9 likewise an approximate 3 65 1016 mm3 increase in volume at the outlet can be observed on the contrary potholes connect via potholes fill and spill during the time of high flows resulting in increasing contributing areas and thus leads to high flows for example the year 2011 which is the wettest year considered in the study model 3 simulates 7 65 1015 mm3 higher surface runoff volume and more than 3 7 0 1018 mm3 flow volume at the outlet 4 discussion calibrating a hydrological model is a difficult task due to the complex interaction and feedback between various hydrological processes complexity is further exacerbated in the prairie region because of the dynamic nature of isolated pothole wetlands and runoff generation mechanisms therefore hydrologic models constructed to study ppr watersheds must account for the important role that pothole wetlands play in the ppr hydrologic cycle a few studies that have attempted to use swat to replicate streamflow in the ppr see chanasyk et al 2003 mekonnen et al 2016a b without explicitly considering landscape depression and have reported poor modeling results consequently we evaluate alternative structural mechanistic avenues of pothole wetland representation with the express intent of comparing model complexity accuracy based on performance metrics and parameter uncertainty for each structural representation embedded within the swat model in the lumped pothole version of swat model 1 where various depressions are represented as a single lumped storage it was seen that the model consistently under estimated high flows during the calibration and validation period fig 3 the results are similar to those obtained by wang et al 2008 and mekonnen et al 2016a b indicating that lumped representation of pothole depressions which varies in storage capacity within the watershed leads to the underestimation of peak flows which is not optimal for flood forecasting applications furthermore parameters in the lumped model are considered as averages across the uarb and thus ignore spatial variation within the catchment for example while the land use soil properties as well as rainfall are spatially distributed the calibration of model 1 was lumped by using single factor for all parameters about these variables on the one hand lumped representations of parameters significantly decrease model s degree of freedom and computational cost during calibration which thus results in a more robust calibration representing long term average watershed conditions on the other hand the setup has resulted in a less physically realistic processes representation thus limiting model performance and adequacy under climate hydrologic feedback scenarios improved performance is obtained in the semi and fully discretized pothole versions of the swat model maximizing the nse value 0 64 to 0 78 from model 2 to model 3 such improvement can be attributed to the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity of various inputs as well as enhanced representation of potholes the giws are a more realistic interpretation of the surface hydrology processes and water distribution for runoff generation leading to better performance statistics overall tables 6 8 none of the models however were able to adequately replicate peak flow events especially the extreme peak event of the year 2011 which was a 1 330 year event mortillaro 2014 this could partially be due to the hydrometric station wsc id 05md004 which is listed as regulated under wsc as there was no flow regulation introduced into our modeling effort one other possible explanation for models being unable to capture the 2011 year event could be watershed heterogeneity for example snow parameters were calibrated at the basin scale meaning one value represents the entire watershed for flat regions such as the prairies significant spatial variability in snow accumulation and therefore snowmelt can be observed based on land cover type lapen and martz 1996 the degree of variability can be especially pronounced in open areas as compared to canopy covered areas where snow tends to sit for a long period latron and lo 2008 improved modeling results may require adjusting snow parameters at finer spatial resolutions preferably at the hru level model calibration is a complex task due to uncertainties arising from simplifying the different processes and because of processes that are not accounted for by the model such as the fill and spill process or the effect of wetlands on the hydrology of a watershed in general we therefore see larger uncertainty in the case of model 3 processed based uncertainty increases due to the added complexity of the model specifically impacting how the wetlands store water either allowing it to stay in the reservoirs and spill if a small value or seep out the bottom if a high value additionally the modified concept of potholes representation in the case of model 3 has resulted in a significant increase over 1500 in the number of hrus since swat operates and performs water balance analysis at hru level the increasing computational units have resulted in a significant increase in the number of parameters to tune thus providing a greater degree of freedom during model calibration however such modifications have led to a significant increases in model complexity and therefore run time for example for a computer with 8 cores 8 gigabyte ram and dual 2 70 ghz processing speed to run an iteration of 500 simulations for uarb it takes 4 h for model 1 48 h for model 2 and 360 h for model 3 to complete the run model execution time can be of critical importance especially in forecasting applications where timely forecasts are required or in the case of climate change studies where many are executed over longer time periods a unique feature of the ppr is the fill spill processes each of the three models utilizes 1 a unique structural representation of the watershed s pothole wetlands and 2 a unique combination of swat model parameters while each of the models shows satisfactory performance in general concerning streamflow table 6 the models produce distinct depictions of the system s internal water balance table 10 this indicates that significant equifinality impacts the models i e distinct structural mathematical representations of the system can replicate observed data approximately well this is important for other modelers looking at this system if we assume that model 3 s water balance is closest to reality because we know that fill and spill hydrology is important for the system then we can say that a modeler that produces something approximate to model 1 or model 2 can get a reasonable streamflow simulation but at the expense of the system s internal representation of water balance furthermore the modification provides additional avenues for evaluating the aggregate effects that pothole wetlands have on the regional hydrology of prairie watersheds the modified giw concept can be adapted to assist in quantifying the nutrient loading to lake winnipeg i e world s 10th largest freshwater resource and the role giws can play in reducing nitrification committee 2005 additionally studies report decreaseing future water availability in the canadian prairies for summer dibike et al 2017 2012 thus the modified concept can be utilized to evaluate the economics of water storage that pothole wetlands may provide when agricultural demands are highest a limitation of this particular study was the lack of high resolution input data e g lidar which could assist with better representing the spatial distribution and characterization of the pothole terrain and internal drainage pathways within the catchment also the computational intensity associated with increasing the number of hrus from 271 lumped to 971 distributed to 15 235 modified distributed which enhances structural physical accuracy but significantly increased the number of parameters to optimize was challenging 5 conclusions in this study we calibrated and validated swat model with three different structural arrangement for a canadian prairie watershed at a daily time step the models were compared and evaluated to assess the impact of model structural complexity on the accuracy of streamflow at daily seasonal and annual basis in general the fully discretized pothole model that represent modified concept of ppr pothole wetlands model 3 performed better reporting a high performance efficiency and better represent the regionally dominant giw hydrological processes also model 3 was better able to capture the peak flows which suggests that it would be a better tool over the other models for flood forecasting on the other hand the added complexity significantly increased the number of parameters which makes the calibration process more complex and therefore is an operational decision factor that would affect the choice of the model given the complexities in calibrating the hydrological model for prairie region it is encouraging to see that the modified structure of model 3 improves simulation of high and peak flows on that positive note the recommendation would be to use the concept of the modified calibrated model to quantify the flooding value of potholes as well as the importance of potholes in reducing nutrient loading in particular to the lake winnipeg the technique and model developed as a result of this study could be of help to the water resources management authorities i e hfcs water stewardship ducks unlimited canada etc working across the prairie region for example the currently used model at manitoba hfc could not simulate pothole wetland dynamics the modified model developed as a result of this research could be utilized in an ensemble fashion with the river forecasting model of hfc to assess any potential improvements in seasonal forecast accuracy and or uncertainty since there are many pothole wetlands that has less storage capacity which when lumped would significantly reduce computational demand without having much affect on the performance of the model hfc of manitoba can utilized the model as an operation tool for future long term water resource management and planning furthermore the ducks unlimited canada can utilize the modified model to assess the economic value of prairie pothole by creating a range of pothole wetlands removal scenarios and see its impact on waterfowl wildlife and people acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial

8456,study region prairie pothole region of canada study focus the prairie region spans across approximately 870 000 km2 of the great plains region of canada 80 and the united states 20 the presence of a large number of depressional wetlands potholes results in dynamic surface water and stream connectivity during wet and dry year necessitating an improved understanding of watershed scale interactions of the prairie potholes the soil water assessment tool swat hydrological model with three structural variants is utilized to assess the degree of accuracy associated with increasing model complexity and its impact on the model calibration of the upper assiniboine river basin at kamsack new hydrologic insight for the region the swat model was calibrated and verified with three different structural arrangements in 1 lumped pothole 2 semi discretized pothole 3 and fully discretized pothole representation the fully discretized pothole version of the swat reflected streamflow best kge of 0 78 but with greater uncertainty larger data and computational resource requirements the fully discretized modified model however was able to capture the high flow and the fill and spill processes which is a defining characteristic of the prairie pothole region ppr significant improvements to the predictive ability of swat in the case of the modified model was observed thus allowing an enhanced understanding of the aggregate effect of potholes in this watershed keywords prairie potholes hydrologic connectivity soil and water assessment tool swat multi model comparison parameter uncertainty 1 introduction the north american prairie pothole region ppr is characterized by a large number of prairie pothole pp wetlands studies suggest that the number of pp fluctuates between 5 8 million such wetlands millett et al 2009 prairie pothole wetlands are traditionally smaller depressional wetlands developed following the last glacial recession winter and rosenberry 1995 numerous studies have indicated these wetlands hereafter simply pothole wetlands significantly influence the hydrology of watersheds in the ppr affecting peak streamflow and flood characteristics bengtson and padmanabhan 1999 phillips et al 2011 shaw et al 2013 vining 2002 muhammad et al 2018a baseflow contributions euliss et al 2014 and biogeochemical processing labaugh et al 2018 rains et al 2016 wetlands play a major role in watershed health and are integral component of much of the canadian prairie landscape nearly 70 of the wetlands has been lost in the ppr despite the numerous benefits to flood mitigation they are still considered a hindrance to agricultural production with 84 of this loss attributed to agricultural development conly and van der kamp 2001 prairie hydrology has been studied for many decades so it is well established that surface runoff in the prairie region often drains into depressions forming wetlands or potholes these depressions are closed basins that retain water for prolonged periods of time and do not necessarily contribute flow to the stream under normal or below normal runoff conditions during times of high runoff the storage capacity of these depressions can be exceeded causing a fill and spill spence and woo 2003 process to be initiated shook et al 2013 once all the depressions are filled overland flow serves to connect such depressions inducing much larger runoff consequently temporary streams can form that result in dynamic increases in the contributing area of the watershed shaw et al 2012 when these depressions become empty the movement of water stops causing a break in their interconnections and consequently reduce the contributing area shook et al 2013 the dynamic nature of these isolated wetlands makes the hydrology of the prairie region difficult to model and quantify protection and restoration of pothole wetlands requires abundant watershed scale data and robust modeling methods evenson et al 2018 golden et al 2017 watershed scale hydrologic models can be valuable tools that enhance our understanding of complex natural processes and aid in examining the potential impacts of land use change and best management practices bmps hydrologic models constructed to study ppr watersheds need to consider the important role that pothole wetlands play in the ppr hydrologic cycle muhammad et al 2018b muhammad et al 2016 a number of modeling studies have evaluated how these wetlands should be assessed in watershed scale models the cold region hydrological model crhm in conjunction with the prairie hydrological model phm were used to establish pothole volume area depth relationships pomeroy et al 2010 to better estimate pothole storage volume crhm pomeroy et al 2014 was further utilized with the dem based ponding model shook et al 2013 for assessing streamflow fluctuation while changing pothole coverage a significant increase 55 in streamflow was observed when all the potholes within the dem ponding model were removed the precipitation runoff modeling system prms was used to simulate the effects of pothole wetlands on downgradient streamflow in north dakota and georgia usa viger et al 2010 vining 2002 the prms however utilize the conceptual and or lumped parameter wetland and thus ignores pothole wetlands spatial representations the prms was further utilized to see if the nearby normalized lake cottonwood elevation measurement would improve model calibration and would improve the simulation of surface water depression storage dynamics and streamflow simulation hay et al 2018 results of the experiment indicated that inclusion of lake elevation measurements give an indication of the change in surface water depression storage in the calibration procedure as well as an accurate representation of the water balance amado et al 2018 applied the hydrogeosphere model on a drained and farmed wetland complex in the ppr of iowa to quantify water balance of wetland complex the timing and duration of surface and groundwater connection in the drained wetland complex results indicated that intermittent ponding was observed in pothole depressions but hydrologic connectivity among three pothole depressions via surface water ponding was rarely established the soil water assessment tool swat a widely utilized model arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 neitsch et al 2011 gassman et al 2007 has been applied to assess the impact of depressions on hydrologic processes at the catchment scale wang et al 2008 for example used the swat model by constructing hydrological equivalent wetlands hew which describes the aggregate functional attributes of wetlands at subbasin scale results suggested that when compared to swat with no wetlands the model with hew had a significant impact on decreasing the probability of exceedance of peak flow almendinger et al 2014 utilized swat to investigate the effect of isolated wetlands on the hydrologic flows and sediment yields in the willow river watershed wisconsin significant reductions in sediment yield were observed at the outlet as most of the sediment was trapped by the potholes and did not reach the outlet evenson et al 2015 modified swat model at the hru scale to simulate the effect of geographically isolated wetlands giws on stream flow and sediment loading in north carolina usa following a series of change scenarios in giws coverage evenson et al 2015 found that change in giw coverage has a significant influence on the downstream streamflow hydrograph in an additional study evenson et al 2016 further modified the swat model to account for depressional storage and to incorporate the fill and spill process of potholes but on a more local scale that overlooks regional scale connectivity several studies table 1 have evaluated the important role that pothole wetlands play in the hydrology of the upper assiniboine river basin uarb for example shrestha et al 2012a b used swat model to assess climate induced hydrological changes and the impact on nutrient loading in the basin the study however utilized the standard representation of swat pothole wetlands representation that is the fill and spill functionality of pothole wetlands was not explicitly represented mekonnen et al 2017 used the swat model in conjuction with the probability distributed landscape depression model pdld to better depict prairie landscape depressions in hydrological modeling mekonnen et al 2016a b and found improved results in comparison to the lumped single storage swat approach to pothole representation mekonnen et al 2016a s approach however did not simulate fill and spill hydrology between pothole wetlands that is hydrologic flow was not routed between depressional wetlands pothole wetlands it simply spilled to the subbasin reach once a pothole wetland is filled to capacity advances in our understanding of how pothole wetlands impact watershed hydrology have been made with the aforementioned studies providing valuable insights into evaluating pothole wetlands at the watershed scales using hydrologic models added complexity in hydrological models however typically results in complex model calibration problems and therefore often limits them in operational use previous studies have mostly focused on multi model performance comparison the selection of model with an appropriate complexity is as crucial as the ability of model performance to replicate hydrologic processes beckers et al 2009 which is often defined based on required data resources and time to parameterized and calibrate the model thus there is a need to investigate the degree of accuracy associated with increasing model complexity and its impact on model calibration in the canadian prairie pothole region cppr the objective of this study was not to identify a singular best method for evaluating pothole wetland complexes within the ppr instead we aimed to evaluate alternative structural i e mechanistic avenues of pothole wetland representation and to highlight their impact on model calibration i e parameter uncertainty which is known to compensate for model structural limitations in complex hydrologic landscapes evenson et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2015 to realize this objective we applied swat and a previously demonstrated method of modifying that model to incorporate an improved structural representation of pothole wetlands see evenson et al 2016 this provided several alternative structural representations of pothole wetlands of varying complexity for our watershed of interest the study was carried in close collaboration with the manitoba hydrologic forecast centre hfc 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the upper assiniboine river basin uarb at kamsack is located in the ppr and spans across saskatchewan and manitoba in canada fig 1 a b the watershed is of critical importance as flow generated in the basin enters the lake of the prairies shellmouth reservoir which was constructed for flood mitigation purposes and is situated approximately 45 km downstream of the watershed outlet the uarb at kamsack drains about 13 000 km2 and is monitored by five streamflow gauging stations see fig 1c also detailed in table 2 with the exception of the gauge located at the uarb outlet gauging stations inside the basin are seasonal with records available from march to october only the uarb is dominated by agriculture 72 followed by forest 14 fig 1d with a significant portion of the watershed labeled as non contributing meaning these regions do not contribute to streamflow under normal conditions resulting from a large number of prairie potholes disconnecting large portions of the basin drainage area fig 1e using geographic information system gis the density of potholes which is the number of pothole wetlands identified divided by total area of the watershed is estimated at 3 5 per km2 covering around 140 km2 of the watershed area as per our analysis an area of 2025 km2 which makes approximately 16 of the total uarb area drain to these pothole wetlands the presence of such a large number of potholes and the dynamics of contributing and non contributing basin area are complex and therefore the uarb has been given the nickname the grave yard of hydrological models shook 2012 black chernozemic soils overlay almost 70 of the basin which are high in organic matter and have generally developed under native grassland saskatchewan water security agency 2000 shrestha et al 2012a b the watershed is flat with elevation ranging from 450 to 690 m above sea level masl and an average slope of 0 002 m m fig 1f the climate of the uarb is continental sub humid characterized by long cold winter and short summer where the mean annual temperature and potential evapotranspiration is about 1 c and 850 mm respectively saskatchewan water security agency 2000 average annual precipitation is 450 mm with approximately 26 of the precipitation falling as snow shrestha et al 2012a b spring freshet occurs from april to june accounting for 82 on average of total mean annual streamflow shrestha et al 2012a b 2 2 data sources and description precipitation maximum and minimum temperature land use soil type and a digital elevation model dem are used to construct swat model for a watershed streamflow data is required to calibrate and validate the model table 3 the canadian precipitation analysis capa lespinas et al 2015 was used as precipitation forcing from 2002 to 2011 supplied at a daily time step and 10 km grid resolution fig 1c land use data at a spatial resolution of 30 m olthof et al 2009 and the 20 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem nrc 2007 data were obtained from the canadian geogratis data portal http geogratis gc ca detailed soil data were obtained from the agriculture and agri food canada manitoba regional office which were collected under a global soil mapping project http www globalsoilmap net at a spatial resolution of 30 m for up to 6 layers of soil depth at 5 15 30 60 100 and 200 cm temperature solar radiation and wind speed data were obtained from the north america regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 the narr data is available at 32 km grid resolution however in this study those data were interpolated to capa grid points these data have been tested and found suitable for hydrological modeling across the canadian prairies choi et al 2009 shrestha et al 2012a b observed streamflow data for gauges in the catchment were obtained from the hydrometric database hydat of the water survey of canada 2 3 hydrological model swat was used to assess the impact of model structure on the accuracy of streamflow simulation swat is a physically based and computationally efficient model capable of continuous simulation at a daily time step analysis of a water balance in swat is done using hydrologic response units hrus which are the most elementary spatial unit of the model hrus are groups consisting of homogenous land use management and soil characteristics to form swat hrus soil type land cover and slope of the area representing the physical characteristics of the catchment are used douglas mankin et al 2010 a daily hydrological balance for each hru is simulated that includes partitioning of precipitation snowmelt water redistribution of water within the soil profile evapotranspiration and return flow neitsch et al 2011 setegn et al 2008 singh et al 2005 white et al 2011 streamflow in swat is simulated as the combined runoff from all hrus in the sub watershed routed through the stream network swat also has an internal routine for modeling wetlands ponds potholes and reservoirs explicitly evenson et al 2016 2015 the freely available open source swat code graphical user interface and previous application in the ppr were among the selection criteria for working with swat model 2 4 experimental setup to examine the impact of model structure on streamflow simulation we evaluated multiple methods of pothole wetland representation and spatial discretization within a singular watershed scale hydrologic model three versions of swat were constructed lumped semi distributed fully distributed in this study the definition of lumped and distributed model is strictly based on the pothole wetland representation in the hydrological model landcover discretization and does not refer to the underlying model spatial discretization when pothole wetlands in a sub basin are represented as a single storage entity the model is termed as lumped however when pothole wetlands are spatially discretized are appreciated the model is termed as distributed we describe the differences between these models below 2 4 1 model 1 lumped pothole version of swat model in the lumped modeling system the uarb was portioned into five subbasins where each subbasin drained to one of the five streamflow gauges swat was allowed to use all the combination of land use soil type and slope while constructing its hrus resulting in 271 hrus model 1 utilizes the swat model s lumped wetland representation wherein all pothole wetlands within a subbasin are aggregated i e lumped and the hydrologic effect of the lumped wetland are then proportionally distributed across all hrus within the subbasin hence model 1 does not represent pothole fill and spill processes all pothole wetlands within a subbasin are represented as a single lumped depression flow directed towards pothole wetlands is stored in this lumped depression and when the depression is filled to its capacity it is spilled to the subbasin reach 2 4 2 model 2 semi discretized pothole version of swat model model 2 utilizes the same wetland mechanistic representation of wetlands as model 1 i e the swat model s existing wetland representation however model 2 employs a more discretized version of the swat to account for the spatial heterogeneity in wetland landcover and physiographic characteristics across the landscape and of various forcing data in this version of the swat model the watershed was delineated by creating 45 subbasins with no threshold for hrus defined instead the model setup used all combinations of land use soil type and slope resulting in 971 hrus representing landscape variability again this model version however did not have any specific representation of pothole fill and spill processes evenson et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2016a b instead it uses the internal swat wetland module neitsch et al 2011 to represent prairie potholes 2 4 3 model 3 fully discretized version of swat modified version given the complexity of the ppr landscape swats representation of pothole wetlands was modified to capture the dynamics of contributing and non contributing areas in theory representing the pothole fill and spill routing processes among pothole wetlands within a subbasin more realistically a procedure similar to that of evenson et al 2016 was selected for this model to examine potential improvement in streamflow simulation by adding pothole wetland representation and fill and spill processes to the model structure this study however was conducted on a regional scale 13 000 km2 with the goal of assessing the tradeoff made between model physical accuracy and calibration complexity furthermore the spatial discretization of pothole wetlands and how it impact streamflow simulation were examined on a large scale the research interests of evenson et al 2016 were to investigate on giws hydrologic behavior on local scale water balance i e 2000 km2 which does not examine the regional connectivity of fill and spill processes we first identify potholes hereafter called as the giws following the procedure by lane et al 2012 using the 30 m thematic map from agriculture and agri food canada circa2000 a 10 m buffer 20 m total buffer cross width from the natural stream network obtained from the hydrologic forecasting centre hfc of manitoba was used to identify all wetland areas not crossed by the 20 m buffer as giws out of 4353 wetlands 4012 were identified as giws comprising an area of 142 km2 the storage capacity of the identified giws were computed using eq 1 which is based on experimental studies conducted by ducks unlimited canada and water security agency of saskatchewan wiens 2001 1 v g i w 2 85 a 1 22 if a 70 7 1 a 9 97 if a 70 where a is the surface area of the giw in hectare and v is the volume of giw in cubic decameter dam3 that will be converted to cubic meter the standard representation of potholes at the hru level was redefined in swat fig 2 in the standard swat version hrus are formed using soil information land use and topography data in the modified version the identified giws map was added as a fourth attribute that serves as an indicator of the hrus spatial and hydrological connectivity to identified giws hrus that fall within an identified giws were merged into a single giw hru a pothole equivalent to the storage capacity of the identified giw was placed in the giw hru a set of new text input files were constructed to facilitate giws fill and spill processes all hrus positioned within a giw drainage area were channelized to drain to the immediately down gradient giw hru once filled outflow spillage from giw hru is routed to the giw hru located immediate down gradient therefore in fig 2 the redefinition creates giw hrus hrus 6 and 10 outflow from hrus 4 and 5 which are non giws hru is routed to giw hru 6 as hru 4 and 5 falls inside the catchment area of giw hru 6 outflow spillage from giw hrus hru 6 is routed to the giw hru located immediately downstream e g giw hru 10 in case there is no giw hru or non giw hru present immediately downstream the flow is routed to the stream constructing swats hrus in this manner results in a 1500 increase in the number of hrus totaling 15 235 for the uarb within 45 subbasins for the uarb 2 4 4 model setup the three swat models with various structural arrangements were constructed using meteorological forcing from capa precipitation and narr temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for the 2002 2011 period swat considers each grid point as a station within a particular subbasin using the model uses the grid point nearest to the subbasin centroid for meteorological forcing the models were developed using arc swat interface of swat2012 revision 627 neitsch et al 2011 to ensure a consistent comparison among the three models the technique employed for calibration and validation of the model were kept the same the predefined stream network obtained from the hfc of manitoba are added to the dem while delineating the catchment boundary and the sub watershed draining to the catchment outlet at kamsack potential evapotranspiration et is computed following penman monteith monteith 1965 the degree day method was chosen for estimating snowmelt runoff the soil conservation service scs method estimating rainfall runoff and the variable storage williams 1969 for routing the generated runoff 2 4 5 model calibration validation and uncertainty analysis once all three models were constructed they were calibrated and verified at a daily time step against the observed streamflow records at each gauge location see fig 1c the period from 2002 to 2004 was used for model spin up 2005 2008 for model calibration and 2009 2011 for model verification to ensure robust modeling practice both the calibration and validation period were chosen with approximately matching mean precipitation and temperature statistics e g consisting of both wet and dry periods the year 2011 in the validation period was an extreme high flow year that has resulted slight increase in mean flow across the validation period see table 4 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was employed to explore the feasible parameter space and investigate parameter sensitivity and its associated uncertainty swat cup is a module developed to automate calibration abbaspour 2007 the program provides an interface that links uncertainty techniques such as sufi 2 parameter solution parasol generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue particle swarm optimization pso and markov chain monte carlo mcmc this research used sufi 2 and thus the discussion is limited to the used of this uncertainty algorithm only in sufi 2 parameter uncertainty is described by a multivariate uniform distribution which is expressed in ranges while output uncertainty is described by the 95 prediction uncertainty band 95ppu the 95ppu is calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution function cdf for the output variables abbaspour et al 2004 2007 latin hypercube sampling is used to draw independent parameter sets abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 is considered computationally efficient where good results can be achieved with smaller number of model runs yang et al 2008 which is an important aspect concerning the scope of work of this study the goodness of fit during calibration and prediction uncertainty are evaluated based on the closeness of the p factor to 100 i e all observations fall within the 95ppu and the r factor to 0 i e the width of the 95ppu abbaspour et al 2015 suggested that p factor values above 0 7 and r factor values below 1 5 are satisfactory parameters in swat are process based and therefore must be defined within a realistic range obtaining a single set of acceptable parameters however can be problematic when parameter equifinality is considered and often results in several behavioral sets that statistically equally fit observations beven 2009 1989 beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 kelleher et al 2016 to reduce the issue of equifinality model calibration was constrained with regional signatures local observations and published literature the current study benefits from the published literature in terms of selecting calibration parameters almendinger et al 2014 evenson et al 2016 2015 mekonnen et al 2016a b wang et al 2008 a total of 27 parameters were identified table 5 that may potentially affect the streamflow through a combination of global and trial and error sensitivity analyses and were included within the calibration process the auto calibration interface swat cup was run in a set of four iterations each with 500 simulations for a total of 2000 model simulation calls to get the best possible range for the parameters considered 2 5 performance metrics to guide parameters selection and define the parameter space the kling gupta efficiency criterion gupta et al 2009 or kge was used as the objective function to evaluate model performance kge allows for a multi objective perspective by focusing on correlation error variability error and bias volume error pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 that is kge is the decomposition of the means squared error mse and nse performance criteria gupta et al 2009 and was developed to help reduce model calibration problems when nse is used a kge 0 5 is set as the threshold value for selecting any simulation run while running the auto calibration program 2 k g e 1 r 1 2 1 2 β 1 2 where α σ s σ m β μ s μ m σs and σm stand for the standard deviation of simulated and measured data μs and μm are the means for simulated and measured data and r is the linear regression coefficient between measured and simulated data other performance statistics such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which is a normalized statistic used for comparing the residual variance to measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias which computes the average tendency of the simulated variable to be larger or smaller than the observed variable and the correlation coefficient r2 which is an index that measures the degree of linear relationship between observed and simulated variable were also considered to provide further perspective on model performance the nse ranges between and 1 where values between 0 5 and 1 are generally considered as an acceptable range moriasi et al 2007 although motovilov et al 1999 suggested a value between 0 36 0 75 as satisfactory the optimum value for pbias is 0 however values between 25 are considered satisfactory singh et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 the r2 ranges between 1 and 1 with 1 being perfectly positive and 1 as the perfectly negative relationship the r2 0 5 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 3 results 3 1 comparison of model parameters model parameters table 5 initial and calibrated values were analysed with a focus on how the parameters change in the evolution from a simple to more complex representation and how these changes affect hydrological processes within the watershed wet k increased as model complexity increased changing from 0 95 model 1 to 1 23 model 2 and 3 34 model 3 this leads to higher water loss into the ground which increased as expected percolation and groundwater recharge from model 1 to model 3 respectively this same effect is seen in the rechrg dp and alpha bf parameters which represent ground water recharge and baseflow as both parameter have a higher coefficient of contribution due to more groundwater availability to further validate cn2 which governs the behavior of surface runoff decreases for the most complex model model 3 which therefore results in a reduced capacity to generate surface runoff in model 3 3 2 model comparison based on daily and seasonal streamflow to investigate the impact of model structure on the accuracy of streamflow we first performed visual inspection of the simulated to observed daily streamflow hydrograph for each model at the five gauge locations fig 1c here we present results for the catchment outlet 05md004 assiniboine river at kamsack only fig 3 presents both the observed and simulated streamflow along with 95 uncertainty bounds at the outlet of the catchment for all three models a poor fit is seen in the case of model 1 lumped version of swat during the calibration period especially for peak flows which are highly underestimated a further decrease in the performance of the model is seen during the validation period in particular during the fall 2010 and spring 2011 thus showing the models lack of robustness with respect to simulating peak flows significant improvement can be observed in the case for both the second lumped pothole wetland version of swat with more spatial discretization of the system and third swat fully discretized pothole wetlands version model both model 2 and model 3 were able to produce simulated hydrographs that are representative of the observed daily average flow during the calibration and validation periods more importantly both models fig 3 closely simulate the timing and duration of the peak streamflow model 2 in comparison to model 3 tends to underpredict the larger peaks e g the peaks during 2006 2007 2010 and 2011 we further assess the performance of the models at a daily time step on the basis of multiple statistical metrics table 6 the rating of model performance was based on the guideline presented by abbaspour et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 singh et al 2005 based on the established criteria model 1 is categorized as satisfactory during the calibration period however unsatisfactory during the validation period on the other hand streamflow simulation capabilities of both model 2 and model 3 can be rated as good to very good for the calibration as well validation period due to improved performance metrics kge nse and r2 model 3 however has the most improved performance relative to both model 2 and model 1 to further understand the changes in simulated flow processes results were compared on a seasonal basis the seasons were defined as per standard canadian practice winter wi december to february djf spring sp march to may mam summer su june to august jja and fall fa september to november son since continuous streamflow records were available for the watershed outlet only the analysis was restricted to the outlet of the catchment fall was chosen as the low flow season average daily flow 23 m3 sec and spring as the high flow season average daily flow 43 m3 sec we present results for the high and low flow seasons fig 4 and table 7 only based on table 7 all performance measures suggest that model 3 appears to performs better higher kge nse and r2 followed by model 2 model 1 does not seem to replicate both high and low seasonal flow well the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency suggests that model 2 and model 3 are capable of predicting high seasonal flow this can be visually observed in fig 4 where model 2 and model 3 more closely follow the observed streamflow during the validation period one main interest in testing different model configurations was to evaluate how each model responds to peak flows which we statistically represent as the 10 quantile of the peak stream flows over the 2005 2011 period fig 5 following moriasi et al 2007 both model 2 and model 3 can be rated as good as satisfactory table 8 model 3 however has a slight edge based on higher performance statistics overall higher kge and nse a weakness of all the models was their inability to simulate the peak flow in 2011 fig 6 furthermore all models tend to overestimate median flow why the model fails to adequately capture median flow is debatable this could be due model structural limitations that is they are unable to account for all runoff generating processes or it may be due to overestimation of or bias in the rainfall in general model 2 and model 3 in comparison to model 1 which consistently underestimates high flow perform well for high flows except for the major peaks of 2010 and 2011 also based on fig 6 model 2 and model 3 better replicate low flows relative to model 1 which suggests that these models may be better at representing the full range of flows rather than just the medians as an additional test we assess the models performance utilizing the coefficient of variations cv which is defined as the standard deviation divided by its mean the seasonal mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation is summarized in table 9 for the three models along with the observed flow records based on the table 9 more than half of the total streamflow over the period 2005 2011 occurs during spring the relatively low 1 15 value of the coefficient of variation in spring for the observed streamflow suggests lower inter annual variability during the spring period in general model 3 has similar statistics i e mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation compared to the other two models 3 3 water balance to investigate how various hydrological processes e g evaporation runoff etc respond to change in model structure we analyzed each models water balance in table 10 the total precipitation falling over the watershed pcp is the primary source of inflow whereas the evapotranspiration et and water yield wyld are the major outflows in swat wyild is the summation of surface flow qsurf the lateral flow qlat and the shallow aquifer flow termed as the groundwater flow qgw which at some point returns to the stream minus the transmission losses of tributary channels et is the dominant process during both the calibration and validation period accounting for 70 90 of the water losses which is consistent with the estimates reported by saskatchewan water security agency 2000 in all three models during low to normal conditions potholes are internally drained and are represented in reality as non contributing areas in 2007 a drier year model 2 reports more than 2 2 18 1016 mm3 increase in surface runoff volume compared to model 3 table 9 likewise an approximate 3 65 1016 mm3 increase in volume at the outlet can be observed on the contrary potholes connect via potholes fill and spill during the time of high flows resulting in increasing contributing areas and thus leads to high flows for example the year 2011 which is the wettest year considered in the study model 3 simulates 7 65 1015 mm3 higher surface runoff volume and more than 3 7 0 1018 mm3 flow volume at the outlet 4 discussion calibrating a hydrological model is a difficult task due to the complex interaction and feedback between various hydrological processes complexity is further exacerbated in the prairie region because of the dynamic nature of isolated pothole wetlands and runoff generation mechanisms therefore hydrologic models constructed to study ppr watersheds must account for the important role that pothole wetlands play in the ppr hydrologic cycle a few studies that have attempted to use swat to replicate streamflow in the ppr see chanasyk et al 2003 mekonnen et al 2016a b without explicitly considering landscape depression and have reported poor modeling results consequently we evaluate alternative structural mechanistic avenues of pothole wetland representation with the express intent of comparing model complexity accuracy based on performance metrics and parameter uncertainty for each structural representation embedded within the swat model in the lumped pothole version of swat model 1 where various depressions are represented as a single lumped storage it was seen that the model consistently under estimated high flows during the calibration and validation period fig 3 the results are similar to those obtained by wang et al 2008 and mekonnen et al 2016a b indicating that lumped representation of pothole depressions which varies in storage capacity within the watershed leads to the underestimation of peak flows which is not optimal for flood forecasting applications furthermore parameters in the lumped model are considered as averages across the uarb and thus ignore spatial variation within the catchment for example while the land use soil properties as well as rainfall are spatially distributed the calibration of model 1 was lumped by using single factor for all parameters about these variables on the one hand lumped representations of parameters significantly decrease model s degree of freedom and computational cost during calibration which thus results in a more robust calibration representing long term average watershed conditions on the other hand the setup has resulted in a less physically realistic processes representation thus limiting model performance and adequacy under climate hydrologic feedback scenarios improved performance is obtained in the semi and fully discretized pothole versions of the swat model maximizing the nse value 0 64 to 0 78 from model 2 to model 3 such improvement can be attributed to the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity of various inputs as well as enhanced representation of potholes the giws are a more realistic interpretation of the surface hydrology processes and water distribution for runoff generation leading to better performance statistics overall tables 6 8 none of the models however were able to adequately replicate peak flow events especially the extreme peak event of the year 2011 which was a 1 330 year event mortillaro 2014 this could partially be due to the hydrometric station wsc id 05md004 which is listed as regulated under wsc as there was no flow regulation introduced into our modeling effort one other possible explanation for models being unable to capture the 2011 year event could be watershed heterogeneity for example snow parameters were calibrated at the basin scale meaning one value represents the entire watershed for flat regions such as the prairies significant spatial variability in snow accumulation and therefore snowmelt can be observed based on land cover type lapen and martz 1996 the degree of variability can be especially pronounced in open areas as compared to canopy covered areas where snow tends to sit for a long period latron and lo 2008 improved modeling results may require adjusting snow parameters at finer spatial resolutions preferably at the hru level model calibration is a complex task due to uncertainties arising from simplifying the different processes and because of processes that are not accounted for by the model such as the fill and spill process or the effect of wetlands on the hydrology of a watershed in general we therefore see larger uncertainty in the case of model 3 processed based uncertainty increases due to the added complexity of the model specifically impacting how the wetlands store water either allowing it to stay in the reservoirs and spill if a small value or seep out the bottom if a high value additionally the modified concept of potholes representation in the case of model 3 has resulted in a significant increase over 1500 in the number of hrus since swat operates and performs water balance analysis at hru level the increasing computational units have resulted in a significant increase in the number of parameters to tune thus providing a greater degree of freedom during model calibration however such modifications have led to a significant increases in model complexity and therefore run time for example for a computer with 8 cores 8 gigabyte ram and dual 2 70 ghz processing speed to run an iteration of 500 simulations for uarb it takes 4 h for model 1 48 h for model 2 and 360 h for model 3 to complete the run model execution time can be of critical importance especially in forecasting applications where timely forecasts are required or in the case of climate change studies where many are executed over longer time periods a unique feature of the ppr is the fill spill processes each of the three models utilizes 1 a unique structural representation of the watershed s pothole wetlands and 2 a unique combination of swat model parameters while each of the models shows satisfactory performance in general concerning streamflow table 6 the models produce distinct depictions of the system s internal water balance table 10 this indicates that significant equifinality impacts the models i e distinct structural mathematical representations of the system can replicate observed data approximately well this is important for other modelers looking at this system if we assume that model 3 s water balance is closest to reality because we know that fill and spill hydrology is important for the system then we can say that a modeler that produces something approximate to model 1 or model 2 can get a reasonable streamflow simulation but at the expense of the system s internal representation of water balance furthermore the modification provides additional avenues for evaluating the aggregate effects that pothole wetlands have on the regional hydrology of prairie watersheds the modified giw concept can be adapted to assist in quantifying the nutrient loading to lake winnipeg i e world s 10th largest freshwater resource and the role giws can play in reducing nitrification committee 2005 additionally studies report decreaseing future water availability in the canadian prairies for summer dibike et al 2017 2012 thus the modified concept can be utilized to evaluate the economics of water storage that pothole wetlands may provide when agricultural demands are highest a limitation of this particular study was the lack of high resolution input data e g lidar which could assist with better representing the spatial distribution and characterization of the pothole terrain and internal drainage pathways within the catchment also the computational intensity associated with increasing the number of hrus from 271 lumped to 971 distributed to 15 235 modified distributed which enhances structural physical accuracy but significantly increased the number of parameters to optimize was challenging 5 conclusions in this study we calibrated and validated swat model with three different structural arrangement for a canadian prairie watershed at a daily time step the models were compared and evaluated to assess the impact of model structural complexity on the accuracy of streamflow at daily seasonal and annual basis in general the fully discretized pothole model that represent modified concept of ppr pothole wetlands model 3 performed better reporting a high performance efficiency and better represent the regionally dominant giw hydrological processes also model 3 was better able to capture the peak flows which suggests that it would be a better tool over the other models for flood forecasting on the other hand the added complexity significantly increased the number of parameters which makes the calibration process more complex and therefore is an operational decision factor that would affect the choice of the model given the complexities in calibrating the hydrological model for prairie region it is encouraging to see that the modified structure of model 3 improves simulation of high and peak flows on that positive note the recommendation would be to use the concept of the modified calibrated model to quantify the flooding value of potholes as well as the importance of potholes in reducing nutrient loading in particular to the lake winnipeg the technique and model developed as a result of this study could be of help to the water resources management authorities i e hfcs water stewardship ducks unlimited canada etc working across the prairie region for example the currently used model at manitoba hfc could not simulate pothole wetland dynamics the modified model developed as a result of this research could be utilized in an ensemble fashion with the river forecasting model of hfc to assess any potential improvements in seasonal forecast accuracy and or uncertainty since there are many pothole wetlands that has less storage capacity which when lumped would significantly reduce computational demand without having much affect on the performance of the model hfc of manitoba can utilized the model as an operation tool for future long term water resource management and planning furthermore the ducks unlimited canada can utilize the modified model to assess the economic value of prairie pothole by creating a range of pothole wetlands removal scenarios and see its impact on waterfowl wildlife and people acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial

8457,study region the study area is the iishana sub basin located in north central namibia the basin is characterised by low lying interconnected ephemeral drainage networks locally known as iishana in the past decade the basin has experienced frequent droughts and flooding events due to recent weather anomalies possibly enhanced by the sprawling urban development study focus although extensive studies have been conducted on water availability in the basin no attempts have been made to update existing hydrological maps which provide limited information on the impacts of geo hydrological dynamics in the area the aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of the advanced land observing satellite digital elevation model alos dem for drainage network extraction archydro tools were used for drainage feature extraction validation of extracted networks was based on field observations and delineated networks from earth observation data and normalized difference wetness index ndwi the accuracy of extracted drainage networks was assessed through visual observation of data overlay and the coefficient of line correspondence clc new hydrological insights the resulting drainage networks will be used to update the current hydrographic map of the area which will aid in the development of flood and drought mitigating measures for environmental management the clc computed metric obtained a 0 91 match between extracted and delineated drainage networks the results show that alos dem is capable of extracting drainage networks within the iishana sub basin keywords semi arid environments drainage networks archydro coefficient of line correspondence normalized difference wetness index iishana sub basin 1 introduction arid to semi arid environments are known to be water scarce and therefore act as driving forces towards the advancement of hydrological assessments luo et al 2018 lack of hydrological data in these water scarce environments limits the ability to understand key hydrological processes it is therefore important to assess the geomorphometric parameters of the drainage systems in order to understand these processes as proposed by genchi et al 2016 for environmental management and monitoring purposes in this regard earth scientists are constantly finding alternative means of environmental monitoring and naturally interested in discovering new reserves of natural resources thereby looking for effective means of deriving necessary information from earth observation eo data jensen and jensen 2013 eo derived information will naturally assist researchers to better understand the environment and its operating systems as attained in the studies by pirotti and tarolli 2010 tarolli et al 2012 persendt and gomez 2016 stanislawski et al 2018 through dem feature extraction a number of studies have been conducted dealing with the identification and extraction of drainage networks from the eo data for instance pirotti and tarolli 2010 used landform curvature as an approach for channel network extraction from light detection and ranging lidar data furthermore the effect of human driven pressure on the geomorphology of different landscapes was assessed by tarolli and giulia 2016 using the lidar datasets to extract anthropogenic induced pressure on the geomorphology across different landscapes equally cavalli et al 2008 assessed the potential of high resolution airborne lidar data in differentiating morphological features of a landscape through the recognition of channel bed morphology persendt and gomez 2016 made use of the airborne lidar data to extract drainage networks in a complex low relief ephemeral river system of the cuvelai river basin similar studies by doctor and young 2013 stanislawski et al 2018 also considered the identification and extraction of morphological and hydrographical features using different geographical information system gis methods although high resolution datasets such as lidar have been proven to provide more reliable extracted information especially drainage networks the data is also known to have high amounts of noise which is expected to exist in mega datasets furthermore dem resolution does not necessarily warrant the data free of artifacts even high resolution dems are expected to contain some noise and errors that could affect the proper extraction of hydrological and geomorphological features to this effect dem manipulation is expected as dems normally contain errors that were generated during dem production such errors can be artificial depressions and pits that result from random noise effects during the dem smoothing operation nourani 2011 nourani et al 2014 genchi et al 2016 proposed an assessment of drainage network systems using a multivariate statistical analysis method for this purpose an automated extraction of hydrographic features from shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem of 90 m resolution was employed using the gravity concept which assumes that water flows from a higher elevation to downslope with no interception or any other means of water loss during this process the extracted drainage networks were validated against delineated drainage networks from the google imagery which were used to compare the accuracy of extracted networks the accuracy thereof was evaluated by setting appropriate catchment area thresholds cat s according to their geomorphometric properties using the principal component analysis pca coupled with the cluster analysis ca multivariate technologies in a similar study by zhang et al 2017 an optimization algorithm was developed to enhance the triangulation irregular network tin based flow routing applications by introducing a simple method of treating sinks and flat terrains while simultaneously enhancing the simulation of flow routing in tin structures this triangulation based reshaping algorithm was used as an underlying terrain model to determine drainage patterns using a triangulation based walking method following studies done by chen et al 2014 jones et al 1990 soukal et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 furthermore qu et al 2014 also developed a new algorithm which automatically extracts drainage networks using tin dem this algorithm was used to remove flat areas known to generate parallel straight lines from the dem by modifying the elevation of the flat triangle nodes the accuracy of the resulting dem derived networks was validated with the efficiency test whereby the extraction of drainage networks shows a linear correlation against the number of triangles from the tin construction sousa and paz 2017 used different methods to assess the quality of dem derived drainage networks from the srtm dem the results thereof were evaluated based on the ability of each method to distinctively distinguish the quality of dem derived drainage networks amongst the evaluated methods the mean distance metric method was deemed to be more adequate as it has the ability to increase the quality of derived networks the authors however advise that this method be used in conjunction with a detailed visual assessment which is useful in identifying complex drainage patterns not easily detected by any metrics in order to optimize the accuracy of derived networks drainage network extraction is mainly based on extracting surface drainage features which are a fundamental requirement in all hydro environmental studies the extraction of surface drainage features has however proven problematic in flat reliefs whereby areas covered by pits and flat terrains generate straight and parallel lines during processing therefore algorithms tailored to solve problems resulting from pits and flat areas have been developed these algorithms are amongst the numerous existing methods developed for the purpose of retrieving environmental parameters from dems however most of these algorithms are area and terrain specific and therefore are not applicable to all areas even those with the same environmental parameters it is therefore imperative to find and identify algorithms that are more accurate in extracting information in specific study areas given their landscape characteristics example of such algorithms can be noted in studies by jones 2002 yang et al 2010 who developed algorithms effective in recognizing and processing pits and flat areas by searching for cells with the lowest elevation between eight adjacent cells these algorithms use a 3 by 3 moving window to determine the maximum drop from all cells to their eight adjacent neighbours however if the elevation of the eight adjacent neighbours are higher than the central cell then the central cell is regarded as a pit or flat area which can be processed further using a specific algorithm such as the heuristic information algorithm proposed by yang et al 2010 the aforementioned studies followed the concept introduced by o callaghan and mark 1984 who also suggested assigning flow directions to flat areas from the adjacent eight neighbouring cells whereby flow is either adjacent or diagonal towards the steepest downslope directional cell this method was however found to produce unrealistic parallel flow patterns as explained in a study by stanislawski et al 2018 therefore it is advisable that further processing be done on the dem to ensure that networks across areas representing natural depressions are correctly extracted stanislawski et al 2018 additionally dems are known to contain errors that can hamper with algorithms used in extracting hydrographic morphological and anthropogenic features in the calculations of water flow directions most of these errors are presented by depressions which are minimal points in the dem locally surrounded by elevated areas generally depressions do not drain and although most of them are errors resulting from dem productions a few of them are actually real depressions especially those found around channel meandering colombo et al 2001 drainage networks automatically derived from dem are in all cases usually denser than digitised networks also when well pre conditioned dem data are used in hydrographic feature extraction the derivatives are more accurate as compared to digitised features which are influenced by scale differences however colombo et al 2001 suggested that the accurate evaluation of extracted hydrographic features is best tested against an existing hydrographic dataset digitised from maps ranging between 1 10 000 and 1 100 000 using qualitative and quantitative validation methods as long as the data is validated and provide an acceptable accuracy in the case of the study area most depressions are representing the numerous seasonal pans that exist in the area therefore in order to ensure that the resulting hydrographic features extracted from the dem are accurate the resulting depression errors need to be removed from the dem before feature extraction since flat areas have no defined flow direction it is necessary to assign flow directions to these areas in the study by jenson and domingue 1988 cells representing flat areas in the dem were assigned flow directions pointing to adjacent cells having flow directions ozulu and gökgöz 2018 emphasized on the importance of determining stream threshold as the basis on which flow accumulation statistics are calculated and are therefore important parameters that have direct influence on drainage network and basin boundary extraction as it is a case of the current study stream thresholds were assessed along other parameters however were not given further attention in a similar study by fairfield and leymarie 1991 a stochastic approach was proposed to solve drainage flow directional problems generated through the d8 algorithm although this method was able to successfully solve the directional problems it was noted to generate unwanted features in some areas such as multiple flow directional lines that are normally noted across pit areas jana et al 2007 jones 2002 tarboton 1997 furthermore the importance of dem in feature extraction is resourceful and therefore the topographic data derived must be sufficiently accurate colombo et al 2001 so as to ensure error free results the accuracy of extracted drainage networks can be validated through various methods such as the conflation analysis method which is a process used to combine geographic information from overlapping data sources in order to obtain accurate data minimize redundancy and reconcile data conflict another method is the coefficient of line correspondence clc a method used to automatically identify matching and mismatching linear features from two separate networks stanislawski et al 2018 stanislawski and buttenfield 2010 this study is organized into five sections as follows section one gives a brief background to the study area section two introduces the study area section three provides highlights on the methodologies used in identifying and extracting drainage networks through the archydro groundwater ahgw extension tools in arcgis 10 3 section four discusses the obtained results section five summarises the conclusions drawn from this study 2 study area the study area is the iishana sub basin located in the north central parts of namibia fig 1 the basin covers an area of approximately 13 625 km2 the area coverage of the basin was calculated from the boundary extend in the arcgis 10 3 software the boundary shape of the basin was developed by bittner water consult cc biwac under the project on the demarcation of water basins on national level which was commissioned by the ministry of water and forestry department of water affairs government republic of namibia in collaboration with the deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit gtz gmbh the basin is mainly characterised by homogeneous landscapes of low lying shallow interconnected water ponds and network systems locally known as oshana singular or iishana plural and sparse vegetation cover these systems have a slight downhill sloping in a north south direction vegetation type is mostly made up of sparsely distributed woody tree stands shrubs and grasses mendelsohn jarvis and robertson 2013 between the network systems exist mounds of elevated sandy soils traditionally used for household construction crop fields and livestock grazing niipele et al 2015 equally the area is fragile and susceptible to extreme climatic events and as a result faces occasional water problems the geology of the area is characterised by sparsely distributed sedimentary rocks clay calcrete and sandy soils which are believed to have been instigated by the foundation of depressed earth slumps and excessive periods of deposition the basin is highly characterised by deep kalahari sandy soils dominated by arenosols the nature of the soil depends on the degree by which they were deposited and influenced by erosional factors such as wind or water the wind blown soils are generally infertile and can only hold a limited amount of water the water borne sediments are concentrated in the main drainage channels these sediments have high clay content deeming it difficult for the cultivation of locally grown staple crops the higher parts of the channel are characterised by darker soils which become lighter towards the center of the channel flow mendelsohn jarvis et al 2002 existing information on the geology of the study area is based on the reconstruction of the marginal outcrops combined with seismic aeromagnetic and gravity surveys that were conducted in the area as well as a few sparsely distributed lithological wells these information do not provide a broad picture of the geology of the wider basin which stretches from angola into northern namibia as the angolan half of the basin is poorly represented hipondoka 2005 3 methods 3 1 remotely sensed data the alos dem with 12 5 m resolution downloaded from the alaska satellite facility asf distributed active archive center daac was used to identify and automatically extract drainage networks in the study area the landsat 8 oli scenes path 179 row 072 and 073 path 189 row 072 and 073 with spatial resolution of 30 30 m retrieved from nasa landsat program 2000 were used to digitise networks as well as for the calculation of the wetness index topographic maps drawn from air photographs taken in 1970 job no 878 70 with a scale factor of 1 250 000 and 1 50 000 respectively surveyed and mapped in 1974 were also used to recognise and digitise drainage networks these maps were acquired from the office of the survey general ministry of land reform government republic of namibia further information pertaining to remote sensing imageries used in the study are indicated in table 1 3 2 drainage network extraction the iishana sub basin has a complex landscape which is characterised by broad and shallow interconnected drainage networks which are not well defined in terms of channel delineation these characteristics hamper the accurate assessments of the landscape of the area also the absence of riparian vegetation stands along ephemeral river channels prevents the application of traditional methods of assessing hydrographic features in this regard an objective and automatic extraction method has been employed to effectively recognise channel features therefore presenting answers to the development of accurate hydrological maps of the study area pirotti and tarolli 2010 drainage patterns have mainly been extracted from dem of higher resolution and smaller pixel sizes as dems with larger cell sizes are considered to be close to the minimum width of channels that might be under investigation as explained in the study by cavalli et al 2008 and hence not suitable for hydrographic and morphological extractions in the case of the current research study the alos dem was considered as alternative dataset for drainage network extraction as opposed to the airborne lidar data which has a much higher spectral resolution the dataset was considered since it provides a finer spatial resolution that can detect much shallower and narrower drainage networks such as those found in the study area which are not detectable from coarse resolution datasets furthermore the dataset is freely available and is error free making it useful for large geographic areas the study was mainly concerned with drainage network feature recognition and extraction for this purpose a depicted dem was used in extracting drainage networks as it is deemed essential in ruling out possibilities of subjectivities of channel identification such as those produced during image interpretation in order to recognise the hydrographic directions the archydro terrain processing tools were used archydro is a gis data structure for hydrographic analysis the archydro application provides the basis for hydrological data modelling esri 2013 the application is also able to automatically remove artifacts from dem by conditioning the dem dataset nourani et al 2014 the process of automatically removing artifacts does not discriminate between true depressions and artifacts generated through the fill process therefore in order to preserve the true depressions manual digitisation of polylines across anthropogenic features such as bridges and culverts is required the digitised features are then burned into the dem to represent a perceived low elevation point that allows water flow to pass through doctor and young 2013 furthermore doctor and young 2013 used the depression extraction processing technique in archydro to automatically detect and derive depressions as well as to incorporate delineated depressions and drainage networks into the dem in order to extract accurate drainage flow lines although the technique was found to be effective the accuracy of extracted features was totally dependent upon the pre conditioning of the dem dataset in a similar study by gopinath et al 2014 the archydro application tools were used to extract drainage networks from the srtm dem dataset however due to the coarse resolution of the dataset the default stream threshold was not sufficient enough to identify all networks especially narrower tributaries that cover an area less than the cell size of the srtm dem therefore the study employed different stream thresholds to determine the threshold most suitable for extracting a sufficient amount of drainage network density in the case of the current study the default stream threshold was adopted as the alos dem used was able to detect all necessary drainage networks as most of them were equivalent to the cell size of the dataset even those that could not be detected from conventional satellite imageries such as landsat 8 oli dataset 3 2 1 drainage network digitisation before commencement it was necessary to manually delineate drainage networks from topographic maps of the study area as the current existing hydrographic network of the area is outdated and does not perfectly match drainage networks from satellite data delineating drainage networks in a complex ephemeral network system proved to be a cumbersome task therefore in order to effectively digitise drainage networks in the study area a combination of datasets were used as back drapes landsat 8 oli and topographic maps were used to manually digitise drainage networks across the study area due to the complexity and dense drainage network system in the northern parts of the study area manually delineating these networks proved problematic even from the landsat 8 oli as it was difficult to identify proper networks from the complex mesh as shown in fig 2 therefore a wetness index was calculated from the landsat 8 oli of the wet season from fig 3 to aid in identifying drainage networks the wetness index was calculated using eq 1 normalized differential wetness index ndwi 1 n d w i n i r g r e e n n i r g r e e n a wet season image was considered as the area is highly characterised by low lying flat terrains made up of ephemeral drainage networks and sparsely distributed vegetation stands of which most will be difficult to identify from a dry season image considering the fact that most parts of the area will be indicated as bare ground during the dry period also a few points collected in the field along drainage networks were overlain and used as guidance through the digitisation process furthermore manual digitisation of networks was limited to drainage networks that run along the drainage lines where field points were available 3 2 2 drainage network identification and extraction drainage networks were extracted through the archydro tools from the alos dem archydro is an arcgis extension tool specifically tailored for hydro geomorphological analysis and modeling esri 2009 nourani et al 2014 given the complexity and shallow seasonal water collecting ponds within the study area it was necessary to conduct dem preprocessing by performing dem manipulation generally preprocessing analyses are conducted on the dem to filter out errors that might exist for this purpose dem reconditioning was considered in order to remove possible existing depressions as well as to increase the degree of agreement between automatically extracted drainage networks and the delineated drainage networks automatic drainage networks were extracted using terrain preprocessing tools under the ndnr hydrology toolbox terrain preprocessing tools provide multiple functionality processing sequence whereby it performs dem reconditioning depression filling while in the same processing step it also creates flow directions flow accumulations catchments drainage lines and drainage head points the first step was to remove depressions from the dem depressions are removed by filling depressions were removed as they are assumed to be artifacts that resulted during dem generation removing depressions limits the interference of drainage flow across the dem which means that the elevation point of depression removal is raised to the level of drainage networks after depressions were removed manually delineated networks were burned into the dem to reduce the possibility of extracting straight and parallel lines across depressions and anthropogenic morphological features e g bridges water canal roads etc however the output hereof in fig 4 a consisted of errors of straight and parallel lines therefore dem manipulation was employed to filter out and minimize or eliminate errors observed in the first output dem manipulation entailed smoothing out the dem in order to preserve the rougher morphology of the depressions and other landforms that might exist in the study area as well as manually erasing known artifacts such as road networks fence boundaries and bridge walls although depression filling is intended to aid in the extraction of accurate drainage networks improper filling can result in disconnected networks especially in filled areas where natural occurring features and pans that act as depressions are located extracted networks may include straight and parallel features appearing in filled areas as observed in fig 4 a drainage networks appearing as straight and parallel features originating or passing through identified depressions were modified by generating a difference raster image the difference raster image was generated by subtracting the smooth dem from the filled dem and the resulting raster converted to a polygon file the smooth dem can also be referred to as the mean dem which was generated by calculating the mean of the original dem using the focal statistics tool in arcgis the resulting polygon file is a representative of the possible depressions from the reconditioned filled difference raster based on the accuracy of the alos dem the new polygon layer was refined by superimposing existing polygon features and pans layers as training feature classes only polygons representing areas with the depths equalling to and greater than 10 m were considered from the extracted depressions furthermore the derived depressions were superimposed onto the landsat imagery to assess the correctness of the extracted polygons existing polygons were equally superimposed onto the landsat imagery and polygons that were not correctly overlain were manually digitised to correct them the resulting polygon file was converted to a polyline feature in order to define depression boundaries the polyline file was further merged with the manually delineated drainage networks and burned into the smooth dem the resulting dem with burned in features was therefore used to re extract drainage networks indicated in fig 4 b 3 2 3 validation of extracted features ideally extracted drainage networks should be validated with existing standard drainage networks covering the same study area extent moreover there is no absolute defined standard method of how validating layers should appear hence it is important to define an absolute practical method of determining the accuracy of extracted features given the characteristics of the study area for the purpose of this study extracted depression features from the difference raster image were validated by superimposing existing feature and pan layers and visually inspecting the accuracy through an overlay operation polygons that were correctly overlain were assumed to be accurate however polygons appearing in areas where depressions are not identifiable from the overlain existing features and raster imageries landsat 8 aerial photographs and topographic maps were manually removed as they were assumed to be errors furthermore extracted drainage networks were validated through visual overlay by superimposing delineated drainage networks and by computing the clc metric of both datasets validating the accuracy of extracted drainage networks by visual inspection alone does not scientifically prove that the result obtained is accurate therefore the clc analysis method was employed to calculate the accuracy of extracted drainage networks in conjunction with visual inspection of overlays the clc metric was computed by dividing the total sum of the drainage network length of the matching lines for both extracted and delineated networks from the total sum of the drainage network of both datasets using eq 2 2 c l c l m l a where lm is the sum of the length of the matching lines from both datasets and la is the sum of the length of all lines in both datasets 4 result and discussion the northern part of the study area is highly characterised by a dense drainage network system which provided a challenge in manually digitizing networks as most networks are not well defined and exist as a mesh fig 2 therefore the wetness index ndwi was calculated to assist with drainage delineation whereby values indicating wet areas are shown by 0 and none wet areas are indicated by 1 in fig 3 the selected dates for landsat 8 scenes were used as they are cloud free and the month falls within a rainfall period making it easy to identify drainage network surface water lines therefore the resulting wetness areas were assumed to be indicative of ephemeral drainage networks the first drainage network results were extracted from the original dem with burned in streams however errors of straight and parallel lines were extracted along drainage meandering as well as over depressions as indicated in fig 4 a furthermore the generated double drainage lines were eliminated by manually identifying and classifying depressions converting them into linear features and then merging them with delineated networks the merged files were then burned into the smoothed dem and the result thereof provided an improved drainage network system as shown in fig 4 b the derived depressions were coupled with existing pans and drainage features delineated from topographic maps and aerial photographs for dem reconditioning the process of burning in drainage networks is also known as stream burning which is performed on dems to force extracted drainage networks along known drainage lines the concept used in this study followed a similar method by hutchinson 1989 who developed an algorithm to automatically remove artificial pits by resampling necessary points from the original dem to construct a new dem although the approach by hutchinson 1989 is different from the conventional methods used in recent years the technique follows similar theories of identifying and removing artifacts from dems as well as using the data enforcement method to input existing features into dems in order to improve the accuracy of derived drainage networks it should also be noted that delineated flow lines cannot always represent the truth this is due to the problem of generalizing the information during the digitisation process as well as the projection of underlying maps used to derive the networks therefore it is important to prepare the dem in terms of projection accuracy and data quality before the commencement of feature extraction furthermore digitised networks from topographic maps of flat terrains usually do not coincide with automatically extracted drainage networks these types of errors originate from the generalisation of the terrain form during dem sampling and can be eliminated through the manual removal of stray streams and other features that might derail the delineation of accurate drainage networks also the automatic extraction of drainage networks can be forced along known accurately digitised drainage networks by burning them into the dem colombo et al 2001 in the case of the current study possible errors originating from the stream burning process were avoided by concentrating the process in areas with insufficient relief represented by depressions the accuracy of the extracted drainage networks was evaluated by visual inspection and by computing the clc metric visual inspection was done through data overlay of the landsat image and ndwi data visual inspection of extracted drainage networks shows that most networks perfectly overlay against delineated networks figs 5 and 6 in a similar study by colombo et al 2001 the visual inspection method was employed to assess the correctness of extracted drainage networks by superimposing derived networks against delineated networks dem derived drainage networks that did not correctly overlay onto delineated drainage networks were corrected by eliminating stray networks that cause problems during the extraction process and also by burning in known flow lines digitised from topographic maps into the dem in order to statistically determine the accuracy of extracted drainage networks the clc metric was computed as proposed in a study by stanislawski et al 2018 and was employed to automatically estimate the similarities between the extracted and manually digitised drainage networks the metric was used as it is able to automatically identify the matching and mismatching of linear features within network systems the accuracy of the extracted drainage networks computed through the clc metric was found to highly match with delineated drainage networks providing an accuracy of 0 91 the accuracy value is based on the clc value range between 0 0 indicating a no match between features and 1 0 which indicates a perfect match between features the clc metric is also known as the line of best fit which best explains the relationship between two or more variables this is based on a straight line that results from a simple linear regression analysis of two or more independent variables although the study employed the clc validation method other methods for determining the accuracy of extracted networks exist the conflation analysis method is another method used for validating extracted drainage networks however this method was not considered in the study as it requires an existing detailed hydrographic dataset which is not available for our current study area similarly the principal component analysis pca cluster analysis multivariate techniques and the coefficient of area correspondence cac are other applicable methods however the aforementioned techniques are more applicable to use for surface areas rather than linear features as provided in studies by genchi et al 2016 stanislawski and buttenfield 2010 although numerous methods exist for validating the accuracy of extracted drainage networks there is still no recognised quantifiable method therefore care should be taken when selecting any method putting into consideration the landscape characteristics of the observed area the data type being used to extract drainage networks and the quality of such data 5 conclusion the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of alos dem data in extracting drainage network features within complex ephemeral river networks as a cost effective dataset in the absence of high resolution imageries such as lidar datasets due to the complex drainage network system accurately extracting drainage networks along meanderings and over depressions proved difficult therefore these errors were eliminated by reconditioning the dem through dem smoothing stream and depression burn in for the purpose of this study it was important to assess delineated drainage networks used in validating the accuracy of extracted drainage networks as they are an important component in the extraction of accurate flow lines moreover due to environmental conditions such as extensive droughts and flooding events that frequently occur in the study area it was assumed that digitised feature boundaries have changed over the years given the low relief and shallow networks that characterise the area hence the accuracy of secondary data was assessed by superimposing features onto the aerial photographs topographic maps and landsat 8 imagery in the case of larger features covering cell size equal to or greater than the landsat grid size of 30 m furthermore for a total error elimination an extensive cleaning and filtering of the extracted networks was employed by erasing features that are known to be representing road networks fencing boundaries and bridge walls this step was necessary as the process of automatically deriving networks does not only extract hydrographic features but also morphometric and anthropogenic features that might be identified as drainage networks as can be observed from the results drainage networks extracted from the alos dem showed promising results therefore deeming the data effective in the identification and extraction of flow lines in complex semi arid environments with low relief even though the study employed the clc metric for testing the accuracy of extracted drainage networks the study is optimistic that alos dem data can effectively be used in detecting and extracting networks using different parameters therefore follow up studies should be conducted on the alos dem focusing on comparing different geomorphometric parameters for hydrographic feature extraction as well as testing the effectiveness of the dataset in different environments in order to assess the full potential of the dataset likewise follow up studies can also make use of different metric calculations for accuracy testing on features extracted from the alos dem data finally the resulting drainage networks generated within this study will be used to update the current hydrographic map of the study area author declaration none author contribution the manuscript and all the

8457,study region the study area is the iishana sub basin located in north central namibia the basin is characterised by low lying interconnected ephemeral drainage networks locally known as iishana in the past decade the basin has experienced frequent droughts and flooding events due to recent weather anomalies possibly enhanced by the sprawling urban development study focus although extensive studies have been conducted on water availability in the basin no attempts have been made to update existing hydrological maps which provide limited information on the impacts of geo hydrological dynamics in the area the aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of the advanced land observing satellite digital elevation model alos dem for drainage network extraction archydro tools were used for drainage feature extraction validation of extracted networks was based on field observations and delineated networks from earth observation data and normalized difference wetness index ndwi the accuracy of extracted drainage networks was assessed through visual observation of data overlay and the coefficient of line correspondence clc new hydrological insights the resulting drainage networks will be used to update the current hydrographic map of the area which will aid in the development of flood and drought mitigating measures for environmental management the clc computed metric obtained a 0 91 match between extracted and delineated drainage networks the results show that alos dem is capable of extracting drainage networks within the iishana sub basin keywords semi arid environments drainage networks archydro coefficient of line correspondence normalized difference wetness index iishana sub basin 1 introduction arid to semi arid environments are known to be water scarce and therefore act as driving forces towards the advancement of hydrological assessments luo et al 2018 lack of hydrological data in these water scarce environments limits the ability to understand key hydrological processes it is therefore important to assess the geomorphometric parameters of the drainage systems in order to understand these processes as proposed by genchi et al 2016 for environmental management and monitoring purposes in this regard earth scientists are constantly finding alternative means of environmental monitoring and naturally interested in discovering new reserves of natural resources thereby looking for effective means of deriving necessary information from earth observation eo data jensen and jensen 2013 eo derived information will naturally assist researchers to better understand the environment and its operating systems as attained in the studies by pirotti and tarolli 2010 tarolli et al 2012 persendt and gomez 2016 stanislawski et al 2018 through dem feature extraction a number of studies have been conducted dealing with the identification and extraction of drainage networks from the eo data for instance pirotti and tarolli 2010 used landform curvature as an approach for channel network extraction from light detection and ranging lidar data furthermore the effect of human driven pressure on the geomorphology of different landscapes was assessed by tarolli and giulia 2016 using the lidar datasets to extract anthropogenic induced pressure on the geomorphology across different landscapes equally cavalli et al 2008 assessed the potential of high resolution airborne lidar data in differentiating morphological features of a landscape through the recognition of channel bed morphology persendt and gomez 2016 made use of the airborne lidar data to extract drainage networks in a complex low relief ephemeral river system of the cuvelai river basin similar studies by doctor and young 2013 stanislawski et al 2018 also considered the identification and extraction of morphological and hydrographical features using different geographical information system gis methods although high resolution datasets such as lidar have been proven to provide more reliable extracted information especially drainage networks the data is also known to have high amounts of noise which is expected to exist in mega datasets furthermore dem resolution does not necessarily warrant the data free of artifacts even high resolution dems are expected to contain some noise and errors that could affect the proper extraction of hydrological and geomorphological features to this effect dem manipulation is expected as dems normally contain errors that were generated during dem production such errors can be artificial depressions and pits that result from random noise effects during the dem smoothing operation nourani 2011 nourani et al 2014 genchi et al 2016 proposed an assessment of drainage network systems using a multivariate statistical analysis method for this purpose an automated extraction of hydrographic features from shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem of 90 m resolution was employed using the gravity concept which assumes that water flows from a higher elevation to downslope with no interception or any other means of water loss during this process the extracted drainage networks were validated against delineated drainage networks from the google imagery which were used to compare the accuracy of extracted networks the accuracy thereof was evaluated by setting appropriate catchment area thresholds cat s according to their geomorphometric properties using the principal component analysis pca coupled with the cluster analysis ca multivariate technologies in a similar study by zhang et al 2017 an optimization algorithm was developed to enhance the triangulation irregular network tin based flow routing applications by introducing a simple method of treating sinks and flat terrains while simultaneously enhancing the simulation of flow routing in tin structures this triangulation based reshaping algorithm was used as an underlying terrain model to determine drainage patterns using a triangulation based walking method following studies done by chen et al 2014 jones et al 1990 soukal et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 furthermore qu et al 2014 also developed a new algorithm which automatically extracts drainage networks using tin dem this algorithm was used to remove flat areas known to generate parallel straight lines from the dem by modifying the elevation of the flat triangle nodes the accuracy of the resulting dem derived networks was validated with the efficiency test whereby the extraction of drainage networks shows a linear correlation against the number of triangles from the tin construction sousa and paz 2017 used different methods to assess the quality of dem derived drainage networks from the srtm dem the results thereof were evaluated based on the ability of each method to distinctively distinguish the quality of dem derived drainage networks amongst the evaluated methods the mean distance metric method was deemed to be more adequate as it has the ability to increase the quality of derived networks the authors however advise that this method be used in conjunction with a detailed visual assessment which is useful in identifying complex drainage patterns not easily detected by any metrics in order to optimize the accuracy of derived networks drainage network extraction is mainly based on extracting surface drainage features which are a fundamental requirement in all hydro environmental studies the extraction of surface drainage features has however proven problematic in flat reliefs whereby areas covered by pits and flat terrains generate straight and parallel lines during processing therefore algorithms tailored to solve problems resulting from pits and flat areas have been developed these algorithms are amongst the numerous existing methods developed for the purpose of retrieving environmental parameters from dems however most of these algorithms are area and terrain specific and therefore are not applicable to all areas even those with the same environmental parameters it is therefore imperative to find and identify algorithms that are more accurate in extracting information in specific study areas given their landscape characteristics example of such algorithms can be noted in studies by jones 2002 yang et al 2010 who developed algorithms effective in recognizing and processing pits and flat areas by searching for cells with the lowest elevation between eight adjacent cells these algorithms use a 3 by 3 moving window to determine the maximum drop from all cells to their eight adjacent neighbours however if the elevation of the eight adjacent neighbours are higher than the central cell then the central cell is regarded as a pit or flat area which can be processed further using a specific algorithm such as the heuristic information algorithm proposed by yang et al 2010 the aforementioned studies followed the concept introduced by o callaghan and mark 1984 who also suggested assigning flow directions to flat areas from the adjacent eight neighbouring cells whereby flow is either adjacent or diagonal towards the steepest downslope directional cell this method was however found to produce unrealistic parallel flow patterns as explained in a study by stanislawski et al 2018 therefore it is advisable that further processing be done on the dem to ensure that networks across areas representing natural depressions are correctly extracted stanislawski et al 2018 additionally dems are known to contain errors that can hamper with algorithms used in extracting hydrographic morphological and anthropogenic features in the calculations of water flow directions most of these errors are presented by depressions which are minimal points in the dem locally surrounded by elevated areas generally depressions do not drain and although most of them are errors resulting from dem productions a few of them are actually real depressions especially those found around channel meandering colombo et al 2001 drainage networks automatically derived from dem are in all cases usually denser than digitised networks also when well pre conditioned dem data are used in hydrographic feature extraction the derivatives are more accurate as compared to digitised features which are influenced by scale differences however colombo et al 2001 suggested that the accurate evaluation of extracted hydrographic features is best tested against an existing hydrographic dataset digitised from maps ranging between 1 10 000 and 1 100 000 using qualitative and quantitative validation methods as long as the data is validated and provide an acceptable accuracy in the case of the study area most depressions are representing the numerous seasonal pans that exist in the area therefore in order to ensure that the resulting hydrographic features extracted from the dem are accurate the resulting depression errors need to be removed from the dem before feature extraction since flat areas have no defined flow direction it is necessary to assign flow directions to these areas in the study by jenson and domingue 1988 cells representing flat areas in the dem were assigned flow directions pointing to adjacent cells having flow directions ozulu and gökgöz 2018 emphasized on the importance of determining stream threshold as the basis on which flow accumulation statistics are calculated and are therefore important parameters that have direct influence on drainage network and basin boundary extraction as it is a case of the current study stream thresholds were assessed along other parameters however were not given further attention in a similar study by fairfield and leymarie 1991 a stochastic approach was proposed to solve drainage flow directional problems generated through the d8 algorithm although this method was able to successfully solve the directional problems it was noted to generate unwanted features in some areas such as multiple flow directional lines that are normally noted across pit areas jana et al 2007 jones 2002 tarboton 1997 furthermore the importance of dem in feature extraction is resourceful and therefore the topographic data derived must be sufficiently accurate colombo et al 2001 so as to ensure error free results the accuracy of extracted drainage networks can be validated through various methods such as the conflation analysis method which is a process used to combine geographic information from overlapping data sources in order to obtain accurate data minimize redundancy and reconcile data conflict another method is the coefficient of line correspondence clc a method used to automatically identify matching and mismatching linear features from two separate networks stanislawski et al 2018 stanislawski and buttenfield 2010 this study is organized into five sections as follows section one gives a brief background to the study area section two introduces the study area section three provides highlights on the methodologies used in identifying and extracting drainage networks through the archydro groundwater ahgw extension tools in arcgis 10 3 section four discusses the obtained results section five summarises the conclusions drawn from this study 2 study area the study area is the iishana sub basin located in the north central parts of namibia fig 1 the basin covers an area of approximately 13 625 km2 the area coverage of the basin was calculated from the boundary extend in the arcgis 10 3 software the boundary shape of the basin was developed by bittner water consult cc biwac under the project on the demarcation of water basins on national level which was commissioned by the ministry of water and forestry department of water affairs government republic of namibia in collaboration with the deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit gtz gmbh the basin is mainly characterised by homogeneous landscapes of low lying shallow interconnected water ponds and network systems locally known as oshana singular or iishana plural and sparse vegetation cover these systems have a slight downhill sloping in a north south direction vegetation type is mostly made up of sparsely distributed woody tree stands shrubs and grasses mendelsohn jarvis and robertson 2013 between the network systems exist mounds of elevated sandy soils traditionally used for household construction crop fields and livestock grazing niipele et al 2015 equally the area is fragile and susceptible to extreme climatic events and as a result faces occasional water problems the geology of the area is characterised by sparsely distributed sedimentary rocks clay calcrete and sandy soils which are believed to have been instigated by the foundation of depressed earth slumps and excessive periods of deposition the basin is highly characterised by deep kalahari sandy soils dominated by arenosols the nature of the soil depends on the degree by which they were deposited and influenced by erosional factors such as wind or water the wind blown soils are generally infertile and can only hold a limited amount of water the water borne sediments are concentrated in the main drainage channels these sediments have high clay content deeming it difficult for the cultivation of locally grown staple crops the higher parts of the channel are characterised by darker soils which become lighter towards the center of the channel flow mendelsohn jarvis et al 2002 existing information on the geology of the study area is based on the reconstruction of the marginal outcrops combined with seismic aeromagnetic and gravity surveys that were conducted in the area as well as a few sparsely distributed lithological wells these information do not provide a broad picture of the geology of the wider basin which stretches from angola into northern namibia as the angolan half of the basin is poorly represented hipondoka 2005 3 methods 3 1 remotely sensed data the alos dem with 12 5 m resolution downloaded from the alaska satellite facility asf distributed active archive center daac was used to identify and automatically extract drainage networks in the study area the landsat 8 oli scenes path 179 row 072 and 073 path 189 row 072 and 073 with spatial resolution of 30 30 m retrieved from nasa landsat program 2000 were used to digitise networks as well as for the calculation of the wetness index topographic maps drawn from air photographs taken in 1970 job no 878 70 with a scale factor of 1 250 000 and 1 50 000 respectively surveyed and mapped in 1974 were also used to recognise and digitise drainage networks these maps were acquired from the office of the survey general ministry of land reform government republic of namibia further information pertaining to remote sensing imageries used in the study are indicated in table 1 3 2 drainage network extraction the iishana sub basin has a complex landscape which is characterised by broad and shallow interconnected drainage networks which are not well defined in terms of channel delineation these characteristics hamper the accurate assessments of the landscape of the area also the absence of riparian vegetation stands along ephemeral river channels prevents the application of traditional methods of assessing hydrographic features in this regard an objective and automatic extraction method has been employed to effectively recognise channel features therefore presenting answers to the development of accurate hydrological maps of the study area pirotti and tarolli 2010 drainage patterns have mainly been extracted from dem of higher resolution and smaller pixel sizes as dems with larger cell sizes are considered to be close to the minimum width of channels that might be under investigation as explained in the study by cavalli et al 2008 and hence not suitable for hydrographic and morphological extractions in the case of the current research study the alos dem was considered as alternative dataset for drainage network extraction as opposed to the airborne lidar data which has a much higher spectral resolution the dataset was considered since it provides a finer spatial resolution that can detect much shallower and narrower drainage networks such as those found in the study area which are not detectable from coarse resolution datasets furthermore the dataset is freely available and is error free making it useful for large geographic areas the study was mainly concerned with drainage network feature recognition and extraction for this purpose a depicted dem was used in extracting drainage networks as it is deemed essential in ruling out possibilities of subjectivities of channel identification such as those produced during image interpretation in order to recognise the hydrographic directions the archydro terrain processing tools were used archydro is a gis data structure for hydrographic analysis the archydro application provides the basis for hydrological data modelling esri 2013 the application is also able to automatically remove artifacts from dem by conditioning the dem dataset nourani et al 2014 the process of automatically removing artifacts does not discriminate between true depressions and artifacts generated through the fill process therefore in order to preserve the true depressions manual digitisation of polylines across anthropogenic features such as bridges and culverts is required the digitised features are then burned into the dem to represent a perceived low elevation point that allows water flow to pass through doctor and young 2013 furthermore doctor and young 2013 used the depression extraction processing technique in archydro to automatically detect and derive depressions as well as to incorporate delineated depressions and drainage networks into the dem in order to extract accurate drainage flow lines although the technique was found to be effective the accuracy of extracted features was totally dependent upon the pre conditioning of the dem dataset in a similar study by gopinath et al 2014 the archydro application tools were used to extract drainage networks from the srtm dem dataset however due to the coarse resolution of the dataset the default stream threshold was not sufficient enough to identify all networks especially narrower tributaries that cover an area less than the cell size of the srtm dem therefore the study employed different stream thresholds to determine the threshold most suitable for extracting a sufficient amount of drainage network density in the case of the current study the default stream threshold was adopted as the alos dem used was able to detect all necessary drainage networks as most of them were equivalent to the cell size of the dataset even those that could not be detected from conventional satellite imageries such as landsat 8 oli dataset 3 2 1 drainage network digitisation before commencement it was necessary to manually delineate drainage networks from topographic maps of the study area as the current existing hydrographic network of the area is outdated and does not perfectly match drainage networks from satellite data delineating drainage networks in a complex ephemeral network system proved to be a cumbersome task therefore in order to effectively digitise drainage networks in the study area a combination of datasets were used as back drapes landsat 8 oli and topographic maps were used to manually digitise drainage networks across the study area due to the complexity and dense drainage network system in the northern parts of the study area manually delineating these networks proved problematic even from the landsat 8 oli as it was difficult to identify proper networks from the complex mesh as shown in fig 2 therefore a wetness index was calculated from the landsat 8 oli of the wet season from fig 3 to aid in identifying drainage networks the wetness index was calculated using eq 1 normalized differential wetness index ndwi 1 n d w i n i r g r e e n n i r g r e e n a wet season image was considered as the area is highly characterised by low lying flat terrains made up of ephemeral drainage networks and sparsely distributed vegetation stands of which most will be difficult to identify from a dry season image considering the fact that most parts of the area will be indicated as bare ground during the dry period also a few points collected in the field along drainage networks were overlain and used as guidance through the digitisation process furthermore manual digitisation of networks was limited to drainage networks that run along the drainage lines where field points were available 3 2 2 drainage network identification and extraction drainage networks were extracted through the archydro tools from the alos dem archydro is an arcgis extension tool specifically tailored for hydro geomorphological analysis and modeling esri 2009 nourani et al 2014 given the complexity and shallow seasonal water collecting ponds within the study area it was necessary to conduct dem preprocessing by performing dem manipulation generally preprocessing analyses are conducted on the dem to filter out errors that might exist for this purpose dem reconditioning was considered in order to remove possible existing depressions as well as to increase the degree of agreement between automatically extracted drainage networks and the delineated drainage networks automatic drainage networks were extracted using terrain preprocessing tools under the ndnr hydrology toolbox terrain preprocessing tools provide multiple functionality processing sequence whereby it performs dem reconditioning depression filling while in the same processing step it also creates flow directions flow accumulations catchments drainage lines and drainage head points the first step was to remove depressions from the dem depressions are removed by filling depressions were removed as they are assumed to be artifacts that resulted during dem generation removing depressions limits the interference of drainage flow across the dem which means that the elevation point of depression removal is raised to the level of drainage networks after depressions were removed manually delineated networks were burned into the dem to reduce the possibility of extracting straight and parallel lines across depressions and anthropogenic morphological features e g bridges water canal roads etc however the output hereof in fig 4 a consisted of errors of straight and parallel lines therefore dem manipulation was employed to filter out and minimize or eliminate errors observed in the first output dem manipulation entailed smoothing out the dem in order to preserve the rougher morphology of the depressions and other landforms that might exist in the study area as well as manually erasing known artifacts such as road networks fence boundaries and bridge walls although depression filling is intended to aid in the extraction of accurate drainage networks improper filling can result in disconnected networks especially in filled areas where natural occurring features and pans that act as depressions are located extracted networks may include straight and parallel features appearing in filled areas as observed in fig 4 a drainage networks appearing as straight and parallel features originating or passing through identified depressions were modified by generating a difference raster image the difference raster image was generated by subtracting the smooth dem from the filled dem and the resulting raster converted to a polygon file the smooth dem can also be referred to as the mean dem which was generated by calculating the mean of the original dem using the focal statistics tool in arcgis the resulting polygon file is a representative of the possible depressions from the reconditioned filled difference raster based on the accuracy of the alos dem the new polygon layer was refined by superimposing existing polygon features and pans layers as training feature classes only polygons representing areas with the depths equalling to and greater than 10 m were considered from the extracted depressions furthermore the derived depressions were superimposed onto the landsat imagery to assess the correctness of the extracted polygons existing polygons were equally superimposed onto the landsat imagery and polygons that were not correctly overlain were manually digitised to correct them the resulting polygon file was converted to a polyline feature in order to define depression boundaries the polyline file was further merged with the manually delineated drainage networks and burned into the smooth dem the resulting dem with burned in features was therefore used to re extract drainage networks indicated in fig 4 b 3 2 3 validation of extracted features ideally extracted drainage networks should be validated with existing standard drainage networks covering the same study area extent moreover there is no absolute defined standard method of how validating layers should appear hence it is important to define an absolute practical method of determining the accuracy of extracted features given the characteristics of the study area for the purpose of this study extracted depression features from the difference raster image were validated by superimposing existing feature and pan layers and visually inspecting the accuracy through an overlay operation polygons that were correctly overlain were assumed to be accurate however polygons appearing in areas where depressions are not identifiable from the overlain existing features and raster imageries landsat 8 aerial photographs and topographic maps were manually removed as they were assumed to be errors furthermore extracted drainage networks were validated through visual overlay by superimposing delineated drainage networks and by computing the clc metric of both datasets validating the accuracy of extracted drainage networks by visual inspection alone does not scientifically prove that the result obtained is accurate therefore the clc analysis method was employed to calculate the accuracy of extracted drainage networks in conjunction with visual inspection of overlays the clc metric was computed by dividing the total sum of the drainage network length of the matching lines for both extracted and delineated networks from the total sum of the drainage network of both datasets using eq 2 2 c l c l m l a where lm is the sum of the length of the matching lines from both datasets and la is the sum of the length of all lines in both datasets 4 result and discussion the northern part of the study area is highly characterised by a dense drainage network system which provided a challenge in manually digitizing networks as most networks are not well defined and exist as a mesh fig 2 therefore the wetness index ndwi was calculated to assist with drainage delineation whereby values indicating wet areas are shown by 0 and none wet areas are indicated by 1 in fig 3 the selected dates for landsat 8 scenes were used as they are cloud free and the month falls within a rainfall period making it easy to identify drainage network surface water lines therefore the resulting wetness areas were assumed to be indicative of ephemeral drainage networks the first drainage network results were extracted from the original dem with burned in streams however errors of straight and parallel lines were extracted along drainage meandering as well as over depressions as indicated in fig 4 a furthermore the generated double drainage lines were eliminated by manually identifying and classifying depressions converting them into linear features and then merging them with delineated networks the merged files were then burned into the smoothed dem and the result thereof provided an improved drainage network system as shown in fig 4 b the derived depressions were coupled with existing pans and drainage features delineated from topographic maps and aerial photographs for dem reconditioning the process of burning in drainage networks is also known as stream burning which is performed on dems to force extracted drainage networks along known drainage lines the concept used in this study followed a similar method by hutchinson 1989 who developed an algorithm to automatically remove artificial pits by resampling necessary points from the original dem to construct a new dem although the approach by hutchinson 1989 is different from the conventional methods used in recent years the technique follows similar theories of identifying and removing artifacts from dems as well as using the data enforcement method to input existing features into dems in order to improve the accuracy of derived drainage networks it should also be noted that delineated flow lines cannot always represent the truth this is due to the problem of generalizing the information during the digitisation process as well as the projection of underlying maps used to derive the networks therefore it is important to prepare the dem in terms of projection accuracy and data quality before the commencement of feature extraction furthermore digitised networks from topographic maps of flat terrains usually do not coincide with automatically extracted drainage networks these types of errors originate from the generalisation of the terrain form during dem sampling and can be eliminated through the manual removal of stray streams and other features that might derail the delineation of accurate drainage networks also the automatic extraction of drainage networks can be forced along known accurately digitised drainage networks by burning them into the dem colombo et al 2001 in the case of the current study possible errors originating from the stream burning process were avoided by concentrating the process in areas with insufficient relief represented by depressions the accuracy of the extracted drainage networks was evaluated by visual inspection and by computing the clc metric visual inspection was done through data overlay of the landsat image and ndwi data visual inspection of extracted drainage networks shows that most networks perfectly overlay against delineated networks figs 5 and 6 in a similar study by colombo et al 2001 the visual inspection method was employed to assess the correctness of extracted drainage networks by superimposing derived networks against delineated networks dem derived drainage networks that did not correctly overlay onto delineated drainage networks were corrected by eliminating stray networks that cause problems during the extraction process and also by burning in known flow lines digitised from topographic maps into the dem in order to statistically determine the accuracy of extracted drainage networks the clc metric was computed as proposed in a study by stanislawski et al 2018 and was employed to automatically estimate the similarities between the extracted and manually digitised drainage networks the metric was used as it is able to automatically identify the matching and mismatching of linear features within network systems the accuracy of the extracted drainage networks computed through the clc metric was found to highly match with delineated drainage networks providing an accuracy of 0 91 the accuracy value is based on the clc value range between 0 0 indicating a no match between features and 1 0 which indicates a perfect match between features the clc metric is also known as the line of best fit which best explains the relationship between two or more variables this is based on a straight line that results from a simple linear regression analysis of two or more independent variables although the study employed the clc validation method other methods for determining the accuracy of extracted networks exist the conflation analysis method is another method used for validating extracted drainage networks however this method was not considered in the study as it requires an existing detailed hydrographic dataset which is not available for our current study area similarly the principal component analysis pca cluster analysis multivariate techniques and the coefficient of area correspondence cac are other applicable methods however the aforementioned techniques are more applicable to use for surface areas rather than linear features as provided in studies by genchi et al 2016 stanislawski and buttenfield 2010 although numerous methods exist for validating the accuracy of extracted drainage networks there is still no recognised quantifiable method therefore care should be taken when selecting any method putting into consideration the landscape characteristics of the observed area the data type being used to extract drainage networks and the quality of such data 5 conclusion the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of alos dem data in extracting drainage network features within complex ephemeral river networks as a cost effective dataset in the absence of high resolution imageries such as lidar datasets due to the complex drainage network system accurately extracting drainage networks along meanderings and over depressions proved difficult therefore these errors were eliminated by reconditioning the dem through dem smoothing stream and depression burn in for the purpose of this study it was important to assess delineated drainage networks used in validating the accuracy of extracted drainage networks as they are an important component in the extraction of accurate flow lines moreover due to environmental conditions such as extensive droughts and flooding events that frequently occur in the study area it was assumed that digitised feature boundaries have changed over the years given the low relief and shallow networks that characterise the area hence the accuracy of secondary data was assessed by superimposing features onto the aerial photographs topographic maps and landsat 8 imagery in the case of larger features covering cell size equal to or greater than the landsat grid size of 30 m furthermore for a total error elimination an extensive cleaning and filtering of the extracted networks was employed by erasing features that are known to be representing road networks fencing boundaries and bridge walls this step was necessary as the process of automatically deriving networks does not only extract hydrographic features but also morphometric and anthropogenic features that might be identified as drainage networks as can be observed from the results drainage networks extracted from the alos dem showed promising results therefore deeming the data effective in the identification and extraction of flow lines in complex semi arid environments with low relief even though the study employed the clc metric for testing the accuracy of extracted drainage networks the study is optimistic that alos dem data can effectively be used in detecting and extracting networks using different parameters therefore follow up studies should be conducted on the alos dem focusing on comparing different geomorphometric parameters for hydrographic feature extraction as well as testing the effectiveness of the dataset in different environments in order to assess the full potential of the dataset likewise follow up studies can also make use of different metric calculations for accuracy testing on features extracted from the alos dem data finally the resulting drainage networks generated within this study will be used to update the current hydrographic map of the study area author declaration none author contribution the manuscript and all the

8458,study region the banjo river basin on kyushu island in the southwest of japan study focus this study focuses on the impact of local and or large scale climate change on the river flow in the small and steep river basin the variability trend correlation and change of extreme and mean precipitation and river flood runoff are investigated new hydrological insights in the small and steep river basins of japan the maximum annual flood runoff which occurs in the wet season is well correlated with maximum precipitation on a daily time scale daily flow and precipitation data recorded in the basin from 1960 to 2015 have a correlation coefficient r2 0 72 a high variability of the maximum and mean annual flows and significant rising trends in daily extreme precipitation and river flood flows were also found in the data analysis the maximum annual flood has increased on average by 5 98 m3 s per year from 330 m3 s in 1960 this increase is fully accounted for by the trend in observed maximum annual precipitation which is 1 1 mm day per year on an annual timescale maximum precipitation and maximum flood discharges have become substantially higher in phase with the enso el nino southern oscillation in the pacific ocean time frequency analyses revealed that a periodic component of the annual maximum flood flow in the banjo river basin with a period of about 6 to 8 years has become significant since the beginning of the 21 st century the number of days with more than 100 200 300 400 and 500 m3 s flows has increased which is important for flood control planning keywords banjo river climate change japan el nino southern oscillation flood flow variability monsoon precipitation variability 1 introduction the annual mean water discharge and the annual maximum of the daily flood discharge of a river are important indicators for water availability and flood risk management the discharge of a river is usually surface runoff from precipitation plus base flow from groundwater minus evaporation and anthropogenic withdrawals from and discharges to the river for planning purposes precipitation in a river basin has usually been assumed to be stationary annual

change ipcc has spoken out against the assumption of stationary hydrology on the earth because global warming by the enhanced greenhouse effect is likely to have significant effects on the hydrological cycle ipcc 2014 hence the effect of climate change on water availability and sustainability in river systems has received considerable attention see e g vorosmarty et al 2000 alcamo et al 2003 milly et al 2005 schroter et al 2005 changes in the mean discharge the amplitudes and phases of the annual stream flow cycle and changes in maximum annual flood discharges of rivers have become of great interest among other hydrologic parameters the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle including river flows has been studied globally e g arnell 1999 nijssen et al 2001 arora and

models and future precipitation river discharge and other hydrologic parameters were simulated under various climate scenarios considering future river discharge in east asia arnell 1999 suggested an increase in precipitation and associated runoff in the mid latitude regions by the 2050s arora and boer 2001 predicted the opposite i e both mean annual discharge and annual flood will decrease in the yangtze and mekong at the end of 21 st century nohara et al 2006 projected that the discharge in the yangtze ganges and mekong would significantly increase due to increases in the precipitation at the end of the 21 st century according to sato et al 2012 river discharges would rise caused by increases in precipitation especially in the northern regions of japan at the end of the 21 st century the effects of future climate change on specific rivers and regional water resources in japan were investigated by shrestha et al 2016 and taniguchi 2016 respectively for flood risk management it is important to know by how much the flood discharge in a river is likely to change in response to climate change in 10 20 and 50 years e g kita et al 2016 miyawaki et al 2016 nguyen le and yamada 2017 the projected precipitation and associated river discharges are likely to be different in each study the projected results therefore need to be compared with observed data for validation and to improve predictions our study focuses on the banjo river basin on kyushu island in the southwest of japan the main objective of the study is to analyze observed changes in maximum annual flood discharges i e the annual maxima of daily flood discharges and annual mean river discharges and their relationship to observed changes in the annual maximum of daily precipitation and annual mean precipitation over the banjo river watershed from 1960 to 2015 observed data from the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government were analyzed to identify what should be taken into account for projections of the effects of climate change on the banjo river discharges in the future effects of global and local scale climate change on the precipitation and river discharge were investigated global scale effects were related to the el nino southern oscillation enso local effects were extracted from observed runoff and precipitation measured by the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government and the japanese meteorological agency jma 2 the banjo river basin 2 1 topography and geology a sketch of the banjo river basin on kyushu island at 33 n latitude in the southwest of japan is shown in fig 1 the banjo river drains a watershed area of 464 km2 and flows into saiki bay the distance from the banjo river s main source at 664 m elevation on mt mikuni to the river s mouth at sea level is 38 km the average slope of the banjo river is about 0 017 which is typical for many rivers in japan this river slope is very steep compared to most rivers in the world neither the main stream nor tributaries of the banjo river have reservoirs for flood control the dam symbols shown on a few tributaries of fig 1 are not reservoirs but slope stabilization structures of 2 m to 5 m height built for erosion prevention accordingly surface water residence time in the banjo river is extremely short i e on the order of 0 5 to 1 day and mean river flow velocities are on the order of 0 5 to 1 0 m s land use in the watershed is mixed about 94 of the catchment area is natural a mountain region and forest land 4 is agricultural and 2 is urban flood plains in the lower river reaches are used for agriculture mainly rice paddies flow in the banjo river upstream of banjo bashi see fig 1 is from natural runoff agricultural surface runoff and groundwater base flow geologically the banjo river basin is composed of sandstone shale and limestone in the upper reaches and gravel and sand beds in the lower reaches it is also known that the subsurface groundwater system in the banjo river basin covers about 60 km2 2 2 hydrology the banjo river exhibits a very flashy flow regime fig 2 illustrates the annual patterns of daily precipitation and stream flow in the banjo river basin of 2015 as an example precipitation occurs mainly in the monsoon season and in typhoons precipitation during the monsoon season june and july plus the typhoon season august and september was 1344 mm or 56 of annual precipitation 2400 mm in 2015 local climate and hydrology on the japanese islands are controlled by seasonally variable prevailing wind directions surrounding oceans latitude 45 n in hokaido to 31 n in kyushu and elevation sea level to 3776 m amsl on mount fuji the banjo river basin is no exception weather data are recorded at many locations in japan and data are readily available precipitation in saiki from 1960 to 2015 ranged from 1221 mm yr in 1994 to 3068 mm yr in 1993 the average for the period was 2070 mm yr and the standard deviation 458 mm yr precipitation during the rainy monsoon season plus typhoons in summer and early autumn from june to september has ranged from 41 2013 to 74 2007 of annual precipitation with an average 56 for the period of record 3 methodology since the banjo river is a short and steep river of 1day residence time the maximum annual flood flows can be expected to depend very strongly on precipitation because the purpose of this study is not to demonstrate the usefulness of available rainfall runoff models e g u s scs 1972 u s epa 1977 u s ace 1981 devries and hromadka 1993 lettenmaier and wood 1993 but to investigate the effects of climate variability and change on precipitation and river discharge in the banjo river basin these rainfall runoff models were not used instead data of river flow and precipitation recorded in the banjo river basin from 1960 to 2015 and available from government agencies were analyzed statistical characteristics such as 1 trends 2 correlations and 3 periodicities were found and applied to 4 flood risk analysis flow in the banjo river is monitored and recorded at banjo bashi fig 1 8 8 km upstream from the river s outlet to the sea by the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government a weir is used to measure water levels in the banjo river and daily river flow discharges q is calculated from the water depths on the weir h by the equation 1 q c 1 h c 2 2 in which c1 and c2 are 11 and 0 65 when the flow discharge is less than 4 0 m3 s q 4 0 m3 s for q 4 0 m3 s c1 and c2 are 52 and 0 32 respectively the average of mean annual river flows from 1960 to 2015 was 11 9 m3 s and the standard deviation was 4 93 m3 s a time series of daily stream flow in the banjo river in 2015 is shown in fig 2 precipitation in the banjo river basin has been measured at five rain gauges shown as stations 1 to 5 in fig 1 over the period 1960 2015 annual average depth of rainfall p over the watershed area a km2 of the basin is estimated by the thiessen method eq 2 from the precipitation pi observed at each of the five rain gages 2 p i p i a i a where ai is the area or weighting factor for each station i respectively 1 trend analysis data trends and variability from year to year were determined by linear regressions and standard deviations and are summarized for river discharges q and precipitation p in tables 1 and 2 respectively significance of temporal trends in the data was determined by the mann kendall test both zmk and p values were obtained to characterize trends and statistical significance zmk is the standardized mann kendall mk statistic which follows the standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one and p is the probability value of the mk statistic also referred to the statistical significance 2 correlation analysis correlations between rainfall in the banjo river basin and runoff in the banjo river were determined at daily and annual time scales the effect of seasonality in precipitation on river discharge was investigated separately by using data from the wet period from may to october 6 months the correlation between the maximum annual flood flow a daily value and maximum annual precipitation was of major interest because of the small size and the steepnes of the banjo river watershed resulting in the 1day water residence time coefficients of determination r2 were used as indicators of the strength of the correlations 3 analysis of periodicities in rainfall and runoff data used a correlogram fig 10 and a spectrogram fig 11 of maximum annual flood flows in the banjo river we also examined the relationship between enso el nino southern oscillation events in the pacific ocean and the occurrence of maximum annual precipitation events in the banjo river basin fig 9 4 flood risk analysis frequencies of floods smaller than the maximum annual flood were also found from the banjo river flow record trends in these flood flows which ranged from 100 to 500 m3 s were determined projections of future banjo river flood flows and mean annual flows can be obtained by extrapolation from the trend lines examples of which are shown in fig 12 4 results 4 1 the trend analysis fig 3 is a plot of maximum annual flood discharges a daily value at banjo bashi from 1960 to 2015 river discharge is affected not only by climate but also by land cover land use river flow regulation water diversion and water use trends in population increase urbanization road construction and land use changes in the banjo river basin were therefore also investigated using public records their contributions to flow variability and trends compared to climate effects were determined to be negligeable the data show a large variability from year to year which is reflected in a large standard deviation of the maximum annual floods see table 1 the linear regression line fitted to the data in fig 3 indicates a strongly increasing trend of 5 98 m3 s per year the significance of trends as investigated by the mann kendall test is shown in table 1 the trend shown in fig 3 is statistically significant only at the 5 level i e p 0 05 but not at the 1 level by comparison with fig 3 the annual mean water discharge at banjo bashi from 1960 to 2015 plotted in fig 4 has a very weak trend i e 0 0527 m3 s year see table 1 which is not at all statistically significant p 0 302 trends in maximum annual precipitation and annual total precipitation over the watershed area are given in figs 5 and 6 respectively the trend in maximum annual precipitation from 1960 to 2015 illustrated in fig 5 is weak and not statistically significant p 0 182 see table 2 if the correlation in fig 8 is applied to the trend for maximum annual precipitation in fig 5 the trend in maximum annual flood shown in fig 3 should be duplicated this comparison has been made and it is good fig 6 shows the annual depth of rainfall over the watershed area of the banjo river basin from 1960 to 2015 an increasing trend expressed by the linear regression line in fig 6 is statistically significant at the 1 level see table 2 4 2 the correlation analysis annual mean water discharge in the banjo river is an integral value whereas maximum annual flood discharge is a daily and extreme value that occurs in the wet season the two are therefore not well correlated r2 0 25 the correlation coefficient was recalculated for data from the rainy seasons only i e may to october 6 months to avoid the impact of groundwater base flow on the relationship the correlation for the 6 month period is improved slightly r2 0 32 the annual mean water discharge at banjo bashi is weakly correlated with the total annual rainfall over the watershed area r2 0 59 fig 7 shows this correlation and also a loss between 500 and 1000 mm of annual precipitation from surface runoff possibly due to evapotranspiration and infiltration the mean annual runoff coefficient was also determined it is remarkable that it increased from 0 18 in 1979 to 0 66 in 2012 even though no changes in land use occurred in the basin since 1960 according to the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government the average in that period was 0 41 fig 8 illustrates the correlation between the maximum annual precipitation over the watershed area in a year and the maximum annual flood discharge a daily value in a year the correlation in fig 8 is good but not exceptional r2 0 72 a good correlation is expected since maximum annual flow and maximum annual precipitation occur in the monsoon typhoon season whereas annual precipitation and mean annual flow occur over a period of one full year with highly variable daily values in both the wet and dry seasons it was found that maximum annual precipitation and maximum annual flow occurrred within less than 2 days of each other in each of 56 years 1960 2015 in 54 of the 56 years they even occurred on the same day since the banjo river is very short and steep and water residence times are on the order of a day an almost zero time lag between the occurrence of maximum annual precipitation and maximum annual flood discharge would be expected this suggests that a change in maximum annual precipitation in the basin should be associated with a strong impact on the flood discharge in the banjo river 4 3 periodicities and change in precipitation and flood discharge periodicities and changes in precipitation and flood discharge can be dependent on slow climate fluctuations and or large scale climate change maximum annual flood discharge can be a good descriptor of climate change and or flood risk in the watershed basin the periodic components in maximum annual flood discharge fluctuating over the period from 1960 to 2015 can be identified in the correlogram of fig 10 the auto correlation coefficient shows periodic variations over the lag time and becomes larger or smaller in response to maximum annual precipitation fig 9 depending on climate change one possible cause of large scale climate variation and or change in japan is the el nino southern oscillatio enso which is an irregularly periodic variation in wind and sea surface temperatures over the tropical pacific ocean the warming phase is el nino and the cooling phase is la nina according to the japan meteorological agency enso has a significant effect on the weather in japan japan meteorological agency 2016 and its period is a few years enso years are shown in fig 9 together with maximum annual precipitation over the banjo river basin watershed area maximum annual precipitation in a given year becomes substantially higher or lower in phase with the enso in order to examine the effect of large scale climate change such as due to enso on the discharge in the banjo river the short time fourier transform sf t ω expressed by eq 3 was obtained for maximum annual flood discharge 3 s f t ω f τ w τ t e i ω τ d τ in which f τ is the maximum annual flood discharge shown in fig 3 and i 1 is the imaginary unit ω is the angular frequency 2π t where t is the period and w t is the window function which is the rectangular window with the interval of 30 years in this study as 4 w τ t 1 t t τ t 0 o t h e r w i s e the square of sf t ω i e s f t ω 2 is the spectrogram the variation of the spectrogram of the maximum annual flood discharge over the period from 1990 to 2015 1990 t 2015 is illustrated in fig 11 before 2000 there are two major periodic components i e periods of 10 years and about 3 years respectively and both of them have the spectrogram density of 4 104 m6 s2 year maximum annual flood discharge appears to depend only on the component whose period is 6 to 8 years which is consistent with the correlogram fig 10 the spectrogram density is 6 to 12 104 m6 s2 year it is much larger than those whose periods are not 6 to 8 years this indicates that the effect of large scale climate change on precipitation in the basin and hence maximum annual flood discharge have become much more significant since 2005 that maximum annual flood discharge has increased because of large scale climate change due to enso is also related to the regional air temperature rise in japan higashino and stefan 2014 and the increasing trend in maximum annual precipitation fig 9 enso has exerted a significant effect on maximum annual precipitation and hence maximum annual flood discharge in the banjo river basin eapecially since 2005 see fig 11 4 4 flood risk analysis for flood control planning it is important to know on how many days the recorded water discharge exceeds a given flow capacity e g bankful flow of the river as an example the annual total number of days on which the daily flood discharge exceeds 200 and 300 m3 s respectively at banjo bashi over the period from 1960 to 2015 is illustrated in fig 12 a daily flood discharge over 100 m3 s was not observed in 1994 and 2009 the number of days counted in fig 12 for each year are for daily floods larger than 200 or 300 m3 s respectively in that year but smaller than the maximum annual flood discharge a daily value shown in fig 3 for that year the regression lines fitted to the data in fig 12 indicate increasing trends as shown in table 3 these trends are weak p values obtained are 0 331 for q 100 m3 s which is not statistically significant 0 0695 for q 200 m3 s which is statistically meaningful at the 10 level and 0 0475 for q 300 m3 s which is statistically meaningful at the 5 level respectively although trends can be weak flood discharges over 300 400 or 500 m3 s have increased from 1960 to 2015 in the banjo river basin 5 discussion in the period 1960 2015 the observed maximum annual precipitation in the banjo river basin has increased from 160 9 to 220 6 mm day i e by 1 07 mm day per year fig 5 this precipitation increase on the 464 km2 watershed would produce a flood runoff increase by 5 75 m3 s assuming that no water is lost to infiltration because of the short water residence time less than 1 day in the watershed or to evaporation because of the high relative humidity 70 80 according to the jma in the monsoon typhoon season the observed trend in flood runoff of 5 98 m3 s per year is very close to the 5 75 m3 s calculated from the observed trend in precipitation the steep rise in maximum annual flood discharge in the 56 years of record can therefore be fully attributed to the observed increase in maximum annual precipitation during the monsoon typhoon season on a daily timescale the maximum annual flood discharge a daily value and the annual mean water discharge in the banjo river have fluctuated considerably from year to year over the period of record 1960 to 2015 as shown by the statistics in table 1 and the illustrations in figs 3 and 4 the fluctuations are so large that the very apparent increasing temporal trends identified in table 1 are statistically hardly significant as is also shown in table 1 the yearly variability appears to have increased after about 1990 this is shown by the illustrations in figs 3 and 4 and the statistics in table 1 interestingly the spectrogram density plot of maximum annual floods shows also an increase over time but it appears in about 2005 and not 1990 if the simple statistical analysis is repeated with records of maximum annual precipitation and mean annual precipitation in each year of record as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively statistical results given in table 2 are obtained again the fluctuations of precipitation from year to year are so large that they mask the statistical significance of the trends an increase in annual river flow variability appears to have occurred again around 1990 enso events are often considered as causes and or indicators of climate variability at time scales of less than 10 years it is less known that they can also be linked to climate change noaa http www noaa gov and jma https www jma go jp jma index html according to the jma summer can be cooler and more rainy when el nino is present compared to the common year in japan more precipitation can be attributed to the longer rainy season induced by weakening pacific pressure the rainy season in japan is usually in june and july i e one and a half months but can be longer when el nino is present since precipitation has fluctuated from year to year in recent decades it is difficult to detect rainfall anomalies but upward rainfall trends can be seen in figs 5 and 6 historical flood maps can illustrate increasing susceptibility to flooding in a watershed but no such maps for the small banjo river basin could be located if not available from aerial surveys such maps could be hindcast by computer simulation models similarly a projections of climate change effects on precipitation and river discharges can be made by existing gcms coupled with hydrologic rainfall runoff models e g for 2050 or 2100 and various climate scenarios model simulations of flood flows in the banjo river basin are beyond the scope of this anlysis simulation results need to be calibrated with observed data to maintain the accuracy of the predictions it is important to update the projections and the model formulations and their predictions by incorporating the analysis of the latest observed data 6 conclusions 1 japanese watersheds are typically small and steep and subjected to very large seasonal and interannual hydro climatic fluctuations due to monsoons typhoons and extended dry periods responses to climate variability and climate change appear to be strong in these watersheds analysis of hydrologic data from the banjo river basin on kyushu island as an example of such a watershed led to this conclusion 2 significant upward trends in maximum annual precipitation during the monsoon and typhoon seasons and weaker trends in mean annual precipitation were found from the data over the 56 year period 1960 2015 these precipitation trends appear to be driven by enso events in the pacific ocean 3 daily values of observed maximum annual flow in the river and maximum annual precipitation in the watershed are well correlated r2 0 72 and have occurred on the same day in the monsoon typhoon season in 54 of 56 years of record by comparison mean annual flow and total annual precipitation are not as well correlated r2 0 59 the reason is that the effect of a dry season is incorporated in the mean annual values dry season river flow is driven by base flow from groundwater whereas wet season river flow depends essentially on rainfall and surface runoff higashino and stefan 2016 4 maximum annual flood flow and mean annual flow in the banjo river show increasing trends over the period 1960 2015 of 5 98 m3 s year and 0 0527 m3 s year respectively average values of the two river flows over the same period are 503 m3 s and 11 9 m3 s respectively the trends therefore represent annual increases by 1 19 and 0 44 of the average respectively because of large fluctuations in precipitation from year to year these large trends are not statistically significant p 0 01 5 maximum annual river flood flow a daily value and mean annual banjo river flow are not correlated r2 0 25 because the flood flows depend exclusively on monsoon typhoon conditions whereas the mean annual flow is also impacted by the dry season nov april 6 a periodic component with a period of about 6 8 years in the maximum annual flood a daily value discharge fluctuations over the period 1960 2015 was identified periodic fluctuations in maximum annual precipitation were also investigated and found to be in phase with the enso el nino southern oscillation in the pacific ocean precipitation in the banjo river basin was found to be higher when el nino was present and lower when el nino was absent 7 results of a time frequency analysis of maximum annual floods revealed a period of 6 8 years indicating that a large scale climate change effect such as due to enso on precipitation in the banjo river basin is associated with a similar change in maximum river discharges and has become significant since the beginning of the 21 st century 8 the number of days in a year when flood discharge in the banjo river exceeds 200 300 400 or 500 m3 s has increased in the period 1960 2015 even though the trend is weak or not statistically significant p 0 01 because of large interannual fluctuations for flood risk management in a river that is short steep and highly responsive it is necessary to take intermediate flood flows into account in addition to maximum annual flood discharges 9 observed increasing trends in maximum annual flood discharge and annual mean water discharge in the banjo river are consistent with results simulated by gcms arnell 1999 nohara et al 2006 10 short term 10 to 20 year projections of precipitation and river discharges can be made by extrapolation with the information on trends correlations and periodicities presented in this paper but longterm projections e g for 2050 or 2100 need to be frequently updated with newly acquired data and analytical results conflict of interest none acknowledgement the authors are grateful to mantaro kawano and toi mizuno dept of civil and environmental eng national institute of technology oita college

8458,study region the banjo river basin on kyushu island in the southwest of japan study focus this study focuses on the impact of local and or large scale climate change on the river flow in the small and steep river basin the variability trend correlation and change of extreme and mean precipitation and river flood runoff are investigated new hydrological insights in the small and steep river basins of japan the maximum annual flood runoff which occurs in the wet season is well correlated with maximum precipitation on a daily time scale daily flow and precipitation data recorded in the basin from 1960 to 2015 have a correlation coefficient r2 0 72 a high variability of the maximum and mean annual flows and significant rising trends in daily extreme precipitation and river flood flows were also found in the data analysis the maximum annual flood has increased on average by 5 98 m3 s per year from 330 m3 s in 1960 this increase is fully accounted for by the trend in observed maximum annual precipitation which is 1 1 mm day per year on an annual timescale maximum precipitation and maximum flood discharges have become substantially higher in phase with the enso el nino southern oscillation in the pacific ocean time frequency analyses revealed that a periodic component of the annual maximum flood flow in the banjo river basin with a period of about 6 to 8 years has become significant since the beginning of the 21 st century the number of days with more than 100 200 300 400 and 500 m3 s flows has increased which is important for flood control planning keywords banjo river climate change japan el nino southern oscillation flood flow variability monsoon precipitation variability 1 introduction the annual mean water discharge and the annual maximum of the daily flood discharge of a river are important indicators for water availability and flood risk management the discharge of a river is usually surface runoff from precipitation plus base flow from groundwater minus evaporation and anthropogenic withdrawals from and discharges to the river for planning purposes precipitation in a river basin has usually been assumed to be stationary annual precipitation maximum annual precipitation maximum annual flood discharges and other hydrologic parameters are often considered to be stochastic quantities and probability density functions e g normal distribution log normal distribution gumbel distribution are applied to their statistical distributions chow et al 1988 ponce 1989 maidment 1992 dingman 2002 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has spoken out against the assumption of stationary hydrology on the earth because global warming by the enhanced greenhouse effect is likely to have significant effects on the hydrological cycle ipcc 2014 hence the effect of climate change on water availability and sustainability in river systems has received considerable attention see e g vorosmarty et al 2000 alcamo et al 2003 milly et al 2005 schroter et al 2005 changes in the mean discharge the amplitudes and phases of the annual stream flow cycle and changes in maximum annual flood discharges of rivers have become of great interest among other hydrologic parameters the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle including river flows has been studied globally e g arnell 1999 nijssen et al 2001 arora and boer 2001 palmer et al 2008 and regionally e g christensen et al 2004 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 chen et al 2011 jothityangkoon et al 2013 xu et al 2013 schwank et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 tofiq and guven 2015 devkota and gyawali 2015 leta et al 2016 lu et al 2016 amin et al 2017 reshmidevi et al 2017 the general circulation models gcms of the earth s atmosphere have been coupled with hydrologic models and future precipitation river discharge and other hydrologic parameters were simulated under various climate scenarios considering future river discharge in east asia arnell 1999 suggested an increase in precipitation and associated runoff in the mid latitude regions by the 2050s arora and boer 2001 predicted the opposite i e both mean annual discharge and annual flood will decrease in the yangtze and mekong at the end of 21 st century nohara et al 2006 projected that the discharge in the yangtze ganges and mekong would significantly increase due to increases in the precipitation at the end of the 21 st century according to sato et al 2012 river discharges would rise caused by increases in precipitation especially in the northern regions of japan at the end of the 21 st century the effects of future climate change on specific rivers and regional water resources in japan were investigated by shrestha et al 2016 and taniguchi 2016 respectively for flood risk management it is important to know by how much the flood discharge in a river is likely to change in response to climate change in 10 20 and 50 years e g kita et al 2016 miyawaki et al 2016 nguyen le and yamada 2017 the projected precipitation and associated river discharges are likely to be different in each study the projected results therefore need to be compared with observed data for validation and to improve predictions our study focuses on the banjo river basin on kyushu island in the southwest of japan the main objective of the study is to analyze observed changes in maximum annual flood discharges i e the annual maxima of daily flood discharges and annual mean river discharges and their relationship to observed changes in the annual maximum of daily precipitation and annual mean precipitation over the banjo river watershed from 1960 to 2015 observed data from the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government were analyzed to identify what should be taken into account for projections of the effects of climate change on the banjo river discharges in the future effects of global and local scale climate change on the precipitation and river discharge were investigated global scale effects were related to the el nino southern oscillation enso local effects were extracted from observed runoff and precipitation measured by the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government and the japanese meteorological agency jma 2 the banjo river basin 2 1 topography and geology a sketch of the banjo river basin on kyushu island at 33 n latitude in the southwest of japan is shown in fig 1 the banjo river drains a watershed area of 464 km2 and flows into saiki bay the distance from the banjo river s main source at 664 m elevation on mt mikuni to the river s mouth at sea level is 38 km the average slope of the banjo river is about 0 017 which is typical for many rivers in japan this river slope is very steep compared to most rivers in the world neither the main stream nor tributaries of the banjo river have reservoirs for flood control the dam symbols shown on a few tributaries of fig 1 are not reservoirs but slope stabilization structures of 2 m to 5 m height built for erosion prevention accordingly surface water residence time in the banjo river is extremely short i e on the order of 0 5 to 1 day and mean river flow velocities are on the order of 0 5 to 1 0 m s land use in the watershed is mixed about 94 of the catchment area is natural a mountain region and forest land 4 is agricultural and 2 is urban flood plains in the lower river reaches are used for agriculture mainly rice paddies flow in the banjo river upstream of banjo bashi see fig 1 is from natural runoff agricultural surface runoff and groundwater base flow geologically the banjo river basin is composed of sandstone shale and limestone in the upper reaches and gravel and sand beds in the lower reaches it is also known that the subsurface groundwater system in the banjo river basin covers about 60 km2 2 2 hydrology the banjo river exhibits a very flashy flow regime fig 2 illustrates the annual patterns of daily precipitation and stream flow in the banjo river basin of 2015 as an example precipitation occurs mainly in the monsoon season and in typhoons precipitation during the monsoon season june and july plus the typhoon season august and september was 1344 mm or 56 of annual precipitation 2400 mm in 2015 local climate and hydrology on the japanese islands are controlled by seasonally variable prevailing wind directions surrounding oceans latitude 45 n in hokaido to 31 n in kyushu and elevation sea level to 3776 m amsl on mount fuji the banjo river basin is no exception weather data are recorded at many locations in japan and data are readily available precipitation in saiki from 1960 to 2015 ranged from 1221 mm yr in 1994 to 3068 mm yr in 1993 the average for the period was 2070 mm yr and the standard deviation 458 mm yr precipitation during the rainy monsoon season plus typhoons in summer and early autumn from june to september has ranged from 41 2013 to 74 2007 of annual precipitation with an average 56 for the period of record 3 methodology since the banjo river is a short and steep river of 1day residence time the maximum annual flood flows can be expected to depend very strongly on precipitation because the purpose of this study is not to demonstrate the usefulness of available rainfall runoff models e g u s scs 1972 u s epa 1977 u s ace 1981 devries and hromadka 1993 lettenmaier and wood 1993 but to investigate the effects of climate variability and change on precipitation and river discharge in the banjo river basin these rainfall runoff models were not used instead data of river flow and precipitation recorded in the banjo river basin from 1960 to 2015 and available from government agencies were analyzed statistical characteristics such as 1 trends 2 correlations and 3 periodicities were found and applied to 4 flood risk analysis flow in the banjo river is monitored and recorded at banjo bashi fig 1 8 8 km upstream from the river s outlet to the sea by the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government a weir is used to measure water levels in the banjo river and daily river flow discharges q is calculated from the water depths on the weir h by the equation 1 q c 1 h c 2 2 in which c1 and c2 are 11 and 0 65 when the flow discharge is less than 4 0 m3 s q 4 0 m3 s for q 4 0 m3 s c1 and c2 are 52 and 0 32 respectively the average of mean annual river flows from 1960 to 2015 was 11 9 m3 s and the standard deviation was 4 93 m3 s a time series of daily stream flow in the banjo river in 2015 is shown in fig 2 precipitation in the banjo river basin has been measured at five rain gauges shown as stations 1 to 5 in fig 1 over the period 1960 2015 annual average depth of rainfall p over the watershed area a km2 of the basin is estimated by the thiessen method eq 2 from the precipitation pi observed at each of the five rain gages 2 p i p i a i a where ai is the area or weighting factor for each station i respectively 1 trend analysis data trends and variability from year to year were determined by linear regressions and standard deviations and are summarized for river discharges q and precipitation p in tables 1 and 2 respectively significance of temporal trends in the data was determined by the mann kendall test both zmk and p values were obtained to characterize trends and statistical significance zmk is the standardized mann kendall mk statistic which follows the standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one and p is the probability value of the mk statistic also referred to the statistical significance 2 correlation analysis correlations between rainfall in the banjo river basin and runoff in the banjo river were determined at daily and annual time scales the effect of seasonality in precipitation on river discharge was investigated separately by using data from the wet period from may to october 6 months the correlation between the maximum annual flood flow a daily value and maximum annual precipitation was of major interest because of the small size and the steepnes of the banjo river watershed resulting in the 1day water residence time coefficients of determination r2 were used as indicators of the strength of the correlations 3 analysis of periodicities in rainfall and runoff data used a correlogram fig 10 and a spectrogram fig 11 of maximum annual flood flows in the banjo river we also examined the relationship between enso el nino southern oscillation events in the pacific ocean and the occurrence of maximum annual precipitation events in the banjo river basin fig 9 4 flood risk analysis frequencies of floods smaller than the maximum annual flood were also found from the banjo river flow record trends in these flood flows which ranged from 100 to 500 m3 s were determined projections of future banjo river flood flows and mean annual flows can be obtained by extrapolation from the trend lines examples of which are shown in fig 12 4 results 4 1 the trend analysis fig 3 is a plot of maximum annual flood discharges a daily value at banjo bashi from 1960 to 2015 river discharge is affected not only by climate but also by land cover land use river flow regulation water diversion and water use trends in population increase urbanization road construction and land use changes in the banjo river basin were therefore also investigated using public records their contributions to flow variability and trends compared to climate effects were determined to be negligeable the data show a large variability from year to year which is reflected in a large standard deviation of the maximum annual floods see table 1 the linear regression line fitted to the data in fig 3 indicates a strongly increasing trend of 5 98 m3 s per year the significance of trends as investigated by the mann kendall test is shown in table 1 the trend shown in fig 3 is statistically significant only at the 5 level i e p 0 05 but not at the 1 level by comparison with fig 3 the annual mean water discharge at banjo bashi from 1960 to 2015 plotted in fig 4 has a very weak trend i e 0 0527 m3 s year see table 1 which is not at all statistically significant p 0 302 trends in maximum annual precipitation and annual total precipitation over the watershed area are given in figs 5 and 6 respectively the trend in maximum annual precipitation from 1960 to 2015 illustrated in fig 5 is weak and not statistically significant p 0 182 see table 2 if the correlation in fig 8 is applied to the trend for maximum annual precipitation in fig 5 the trend in maximum annual flood shown in fig 3 should be duplicated this comparison has been made and it is good fig 6 shows the annual depth of rainfall over the watershed area of the banjo river basin from 1960 to 2015 an increasing trend expressed by the linear regression line in fig 6 is statistically significant at the 1 level see table 2 4 2 the correlation analysis annual mean water discharge in the banjo river is an integral value whereas maximum annual flood discharge is a daily and extreme value that occurs in the wet season the two are therefore not well correlated r2 0 25 the correlation coefficient was recalculated for data from the rainy seasons only i e may to october 6 months to avoid the impact of groundwater base flow on the relationship the correlation for the 6 month period is improved slightly r2 0 32 the annual mean water discharge at banjo bashi is weakly correlated with the total annual rainfall over the watershed area r2 0 59 fig 7 shows this correlation and also a loss between 500 and 1000 mm of annual precipitation from surface runoff possibly due to evapotranspiration and infiltration the mean annual runoff coefficient was also determined it is remarkable that it increased from 0 18 in 1979 to 0 66 in 2012 even though no changes in land use occurred in the basin since 1960 according to the department of land infrastructure transport and tourism of the japanese government the average in that period was 0 41 fig 8 illustrates the correlation between the maximum annual precipitation over the watershed area in a year and the maximum annual flood discharge a daily value in a year the correlation in fig 8 is good but not exceptional r2 0 72 a good correlation is expected since maximum annual flow and maximum annual precipitation occur in the monsoon typhoon season whereas annual precipitation and mean annual flow occur over a period of one full year with highly variable daily values in both the wet and dry seasons it was found that maximum annual precipitation and maximum annual flow occurrred within less than 2 days of each other in each of 56 years 1960 2015 in 54 of the 56 years they even occurred on the same day since the banjo river is very short and steep and water residence times are on the order of a day an almost zero time lag between the occurrence of maximum annual precipitation and maximum annual flood discharge would be expected this suggests that a change in maximum annual precipitation in the basin should be associated with a strong impact on the flood discharge in the banjo river 4 3 periodicities and change in precipitation and flood discharge periodicities and changes in precipitation and flood discharge can be dependent on slow climate fluctuations and or large scale climate change maximum annual flood discharge can be a good descriptor of climate change and or flood risk in the watershed basin the periodic components in maximum annual flood discharge fluctuating over the period from 1960 to 2015 can be identified in the correlogram of fig 10 the auto correlation coefficient shows periodic variations over the lag time and becomes larger or smaller in response to maximum annual precipitation fig 9 depending on climate change one possible cause of large scale climate variation and or change in japan is the el nino southern oscillatio enso which is an irregularly periodic variation in wind and sea surface temperatures over the tropical pacific ocean the warming phase is el nino and the cooling phase is la nina according to the japan meteorological agency enso has a significant effect on the weather in japan japan meteorological agency 2016 and its period is a few years enso years are shown in fig 9 together with maximum annual precipitation over the banjo river basin watershed area maximum annual precipitation in a given year becomes substantially higher or lower in phase with the enso in order to examine the effect of large scale climate change such as due to enso on the discharge in the banjo river the short time fourier transform sf t ω expressed by eq 3 was obtained for maximum annual flood discharge 3 s f t ω f τ w τ t e i ω τ d τ in which f τ is the maximum annual flood discharge shown in fig 3 and i 1 is the imaginary unit ω is the angular frequency 2π t where t is the period and w t is the window function which is the rectangular window with the interval of 30 years in this study as 4 w τ t 1 t t τ t 0 o t h e r w i s e the square of sf t ω i e s f t ω 2 is the spectrogram the variation of the spectrogram of the maximum annual flood discharge over the period from 1990 to 2015 1990 t 2015 is illustrated in fig 11 before 2000 there are two major periodic components i e periods of 10 years and about 3 years respectively and both of them have the spectrogram density of 4 104 m6 s2 year maximum annual flood discharge appears to depend only on the component whose period is 6 to 8 years which is consistent with the correlogram fig 10 the spectrogram density is 6 to 12 104 m6 s2 year it is much larger than those whose periods are not 6 to 8 years this indicates that the effect of large scale climate change on precipitation in the basin and hence maximum annual flood discharge have become much more significant since 2005 that maximum annual flood discharge has increased because of large scale climate change due to enso is also related to the regional air temperature rise in japan higashino and stefan 2014 and the increasing trend in maximum annual precipitation fig 9 enso has exerted a significant effect on maximum annual precipitation and hence maximum annual flood discharge in the banjo river basin eapecially since 2005 see fig 11 4 4 flood risk analysis for flood control planning it is important to know on how many days the recorded water discharge exceeds a given flow capacity e g bankful flow of the river as an example the annual total number of days on which the daily flood discharge exceeds 200 and 300 m3 s respectively at banjo bashi over the period from 1960 to 2015 is illustrated in fig 12 a daily flood discharge over 100 m3 s was not observed in 1994 and 2009 the number of days counted in fig 12 for each year are for daily floods larger than 200 or 300 m3 s respectively in that year but smaller than the maximum annual flood discharge a daily value shown in fig 3 for that year the regression lines fitted to the data in fig 12 indicate increasing trends as shown in table 3 these trends are weak p values obtained are 0 331 for q 100 m3 s which is not statistically significant 0 0695 for q 200 m3 s which is statistically meaningful at the 10 level and 0 0475 for q 300 m3 s which is statistically meaningful at the 5 level respectively although trends can be weak flood discharges over 300 400 or 500 m3 s have increased from 1960 to 2015 in the banjo river basin 5 discussion in the period 1960 2015 the observed maximum annual precipitation in the banjo river basin has increased from 160 9 to 220 6 mm day i e by 1 07 mm day per year fig 5 this precipitation increase on the 464 km2 watershed would produce a flood runoff increase by 5 75 m3 s assuming that no water is lost to infiltration because of the short water residence time less than 1 day in the watershed or to evaporation because of the high relative humidity 70 80 according to the jma in the monsoon typhoon season the observed trend in flood runoff of 5 98 m3 s per year is very close to the 5 75 m3 s calculated from the observed trend in precipitation the steep rise in maximum annual flood discharge in the 56 years of record can therefore be fully attributed to the observed increase in maximum annual precipitation during the monsoon typhoon season on a daily timescale the maximum annual flood discharge a daily value and the annual mean water discharge in the banjo river have fluctuated considerably from year to year over the period of record 1960 to 2015 as shown by the statistics in table 1 and the illustrations in figs 3 and 4 the fluctuations are so large that the very apparent increasing temporal trends identified in table 1 are statistically hardly significant as is also shown in table 1 the yearly variability appears to have increased after about 1990 this is shown by the illustrations in figs 3 and 4 and the statistics in table 1 interestingly the spectrogram density plot of maximum annual floods shows also an increase over time but it appears in about 2005 and not 1990 if the simple statistical analysis is repeated with records of maximum annual precipitation and mean annual precipitation in each year of record as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively statistical results given in table 2 are obtained again the fluctuations of precipitation from year to year are so large that they mask the statistical significance of the trends an increase in annual river flow variability appears to have occurred again around 1990 enso events are often considered as causes and or indicators of climate variability at time scales of less than 10 years it is less known that they can also be linked to climate change noaa http www noaa gov and jma https www jma go jp jma index html according to the jma summer can be cooler and more rainy when el nino is present compared to the common year in japan more precipitation can be attributed to the longer rainy season induced by weakening pacific pressure the rainy season in japan is usually in june and july i e one and a half months but can be longer when el nino is present since precipitation has fluctuated from year to year in recent decades it is difficult to detect rainfall anomalies but upward rainfall trends can be seen in figs 5 and 6 historical flood maps can illustrate increasing susceptibility to flooding in a watershed but no such maps for the small banjo river basin could be located if not available from aerial surveys such maps could be hindcast by computer simulation models similarly a projections of climate change effects on precipitation and river discharges can be made by existing gcms coupled with hydrologic rainfall runoff models e g for 2050 or 2100 and various climate scenarios model simulations of flood flows in the banjo river basin are beyond the scope of this anlysis simulation results need to be calibrated with observed data to maintain the accuracy of the predictions it is important to update the projections and the model formulations and their predictions by incorporating the analysis of the latest observed data 6 conclusions 1 japanese watersheds are typically small and steep and subjected to very large seasonal and interannual hydro climatic fluctuations due to monsoons typhoons and extended dry periods responses to climate variability and climate change appear to be strong in these watersheds analysis of hydrologic data from the banjo river basin on kyushu island as an example of such a watershed led to this conclusion 2 significant upward trends in maximum annual precipitation during the monsoon and typhoon seasons and weaker trends in mean annual precipitation were found from the data over the 56 year period 1960 2015 these precipitation trends appear to be driven by enso events in the pacific ocean 3 daily values of observed maximum annual flow in the river and maximum annual precipitation in the watershed are well correlated r2 0 72 and have occurred on the same day in the monsoon typhoon season in 54 of 56 years of record by comparison mean annual flow and total annual precipitation are not as well correlated r2 0 59 the reason is that the effect of a dry season is incorporated in the mean annual values dry season river flow is driven by base flow from groundwater whereas wet season river flow depends essentially on rainfall and surface runoff higashino and stefan 2016 4 maximum annual flood flow and mean annual flow in the banjo river show increasing trends over the period 1960 2015 of 5 98 m3 s year and 0 0527 m3 s year respectively average values of the two river flows over the same period are 503 m3 s and 11 9 m3 s respectively the trends therefore represent annual increases by 1 19 and 0 44 of the average respectively because of large fluctuations in precipitation from year to year these large trends are not statistically significant p 0 01 5 maximum annual river flood flow a daily value and mean annual banjo river flow are not correlated r2 0 25 because the flood flows depend exclusively on monsoon typhoon conditions whereas the mean annual flow is also impacted by the dry season nov april 6 a periodic component with a period of about 6 8 years in the maximum annual flood a daily value discharge fluctuations over the period 1960 2015 was identified periodic fluctuations in maximum annual precipitation were also investigated and found to be in phase with the enso el nino southern oscillation in the pacific ocean precipitation in the banjo river basin was found to be higher when el nino was present and lower when el nino was absent 7 results of a time frequency analysis of maximum annual floods revealed a period of 6 8 years indicating that a large scale climate change effect such as due to enso on precipitation in the banjo river basin is associated with a similar change in maximum river discharges and has become significant since the beginning of the 21 st century 8 the number of days in a year when flood discharge in the banjo river exceeds 200 300 400 or 500 m3 s has increased in the period 1960 2015 even though the trend is weak or not statistically significant p 0 01 because of large interannual fluctuations for flood risk management in a river that is short steep and highly responsive it is necessary to take intermediate flood flows into account in addition to maximum annual flood discharges 9 observed increasing trends in maximum annual flood discharge and annual mean water discharge in the banjo river are consistent with results simulated by gcms arnell 1999 nohara et al 2006 10 short term 10 to 20 year projections of precipitation and river discharges can be made by extrapolation with the information on trends correlations and periodicities presented in this paper but longterm projections e g for 2050 or 2100 need to be frequently updated with newly acquired data and analytical results conflict of interest none acknowledgement the authors are grateful to mantaro kawano and toi mizuno dept of civil and environmental eng national institute of technology oita college

8459,study region nyangores catchment mara catchment kenya study focus hydrologic models are widely used tools in watershed management to assist in decision making by representing catchment functions under alternative scenarios this study focused on the evaluation of the 5 segment flow duration curve based calibration procedure 5fdc for the period 1975 1978 using the soil water assessment tool swat the normal calibration procedure ncp based on the hydrograph was compared to the 5fdc two separate ensembles each containing 10 pareto calibration runs were obtained individually from each method and evaluated based on their goodness of fit a final combined procedure cp which was an intersection of 5fdc and ncp was executed with this supplementary analysis the parameter distribution and water component balance were analyzed and compared new hydrological insights for the region the comparison of 5fdc and ncp shows that the 5fdc provides a better representation of the low and mid level section of the flow duration curve as compared to the ncp which greatly overestimates these flows this method also closely matches the observed runoff ratios this indicates that the 5fdc calibration may be well suited for water resource applications focused on low flows the cp combines the advantages of both procedures by improving parameter identifiability leading to better representation of high and low flows keywords 5 segmented flow duration curve 5fdc normal calibration procedure ncp parameter identifiability pareto set pareto analysis water balance multimetric calibration latin hypercube sampling performance metrics uncertainty prediction hydrologic model simulation equifinality base flows variability optimum stepwise intersection ensemble water partitioning 1 introduction globally water demand is increasing due to factors such as population growth increasing agricultural and industrial production to meet this ever rising water demand improvement in water resources management is required planning is a fundamental aspect of sustainable water resources management hydrological models are essential tools widely used in planning of water resources hydrologic models are able to efficiently integrate study and evaluate different components of watershed s complex dynamic and spatially variable hydrological processes niehoff et al 2002 bormann et al 2007 hulsman et al 2009 wagner et al 2016 therefore by using reliable and accurate data hydrological models can be used to assess present and future changes in water demands leading to informed management decisions on competing water uses other common applications of hydrological models in water resources management is prediction of impact e g quantity quality timing of land use and climate change on watershed hydrology a wide range of hydrological models exists the models vary depending on how they represent the underlying hydrological processes they also vary depending on how the hydrological components e g model parameters and processes are represented in time and space devi et al 2015 thus the choice of hydrological model depends on the intended purpose based on the output of the model and the model structure including the level of detail of the model inputs processes and the outputs whatever the type of hydrological model chosen the reliability of the model in simulating accurate or observed outputs e g runoff or sediment yield needs to be examined kirchner 2006 wagener and wheater 2006 westerberg et al 2011 this is usually done by calibrating the model based on the desired model output s models are calibrated by adjusting parameters to improve model fit based on objective functions which are used to evaluate the modelling efficiency gupta et al 1998 wagener and wheater 2006 pfannerstill et al 2017 model calibration can be done manually or automatically by use of optimization algorithms such as shuffled complex evaluation method duan et al 1994 general likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 and bayesian recursive parameter estimation encompassing sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 thiemann et al 2001 all these differ in their underlying assumptions residual errors possible iterations and types of uncertainties accounted for and represented explicitly samadi et al 2017 normally the accuracy of calibration of hydrological models is evaluated by statistically assessing the fit of simulated and observed hydrographs hrachowitz et al 2013 wambura et al 2018 one advantage of this method herein after referred as normal calibration procedure ncp is preservation of timing information e g timing of runoff however although hydrographs represent an integrated measure reflecting all the complexity of flow processes occurring in the catchment it is difficult to infer the nature of these processes directly beven 1993 where times for discharge and model input data do not overlap calibration using this method may not be suitable westerberg et al 2011 an alternative to hydrograph calibration can involve use of flow duration curve fdc westerberg et al 2011 fdc is a cumulative frequency curve which shows the percent of time specified discharges were equaled or exceeded vogel and fennessey 1994 the shape of the fdc is highly influenced by the climatological and geophysical characteristics of the catchment yokoo and sivaplan 2011 and calibration of the fdc involves matching discharge magnitudes the method therefore inherently takes into account the influence of catchment characteristics during the calibration however a major limitation of this method is that unlike the ncp the timing information is lost sawicz et al 2011 found that splitting the fdc into individual segments in the calibration procedure led to an overall better representation of catchment characteristics a study conducted by pfannerstill et al 2014 split the flow duration curve into five segments 5fdc representing very high high mid low and very low flow segments in this study calibration on these segments within a multi metric evaluation framework calibrated swat model adequately for both the high and low flows low flows are often of special interest to water resource managers who may need to consider minimum flows in order to avoid over allocation of water dudgeon et al 2006 in this study the main objective was to calibrate the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012a using the 5fdc procedure and compare it with the ncp additionally a hybrid of ncp and 5fdc methods i e combined procedure cp was assessed cp involved intersecting a final set of calibration runs from both the 5fdc and ncp specifically this study aims to compare the differences in selection of optimum parameter ensembles for both the 5fdc and ncp approaches in terms of efficiency criteria parameter distribution and water balance components in addition to assessing the cp method 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the nyangores catchment spanning an area of about 694 km2 is located in the upper part of the mara river basin fig 1 elevation ranges from 1900 m a s l to 2970 m a s l on the mau escapements mwangi et al 2016a the mean annual temperature is approximately 25 c bimodal seasonal rainfall ranging between 1000 mm to 1750 mm is linked to the annual oscillation of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz fürst et al 2015 river nyangores originates from the kiringet area in the mau forest and joins with river amala to form the mara river the population of this catchment according to the census held in 2009 was 300 000 fürst et al 2015 and an annual increase of 3 is projected knbs 2010 there was a 40 deforestation rate between 1972 and 1995 juston et al 2014 this land use shift brought about by increased permanent settlements and agriculture has continued to increase steadily to date juston et al 2014 mwangi et al 2018 this has significantly affected the hydrological regime in the catchment mwangi et al 2016a mango et al 2011 reported that the conversion of forests to agricultural land has and will continue to decrease dry season flows at the same time an increased peak of high flows 7 observed between 1973 and 2000 is expected to rise in the future mati et al 2008 mango et al 2011 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat swat arnold et al 2012a is a mesoscale and semi distributed watershed model developed by the agricultural research service ars of the united states department of agriculture usda bekele and nicklow 2012 swat operates on a daily time step and can predict the effects of alternative management decisions on water sediment and chemical yields winchell et al 2013 the major model components include weather soil dynamics hydrology plant growth nutrient availability land management and pathogens all processes are driven by the hydrologic cycle a digital elevation model dem forms the basis from which the watershed is delineated using the individual reaches the basin is divided into sub basins within sub basins hydrologic response units hru are formed by a unique combination of land use slope and soil characteristics arnold et al 2012a at the hru level all processes of the hydrologic cycle are simulated the daily volume of water yield is then estimated by solving the water budget for each hru a full description of the swat model is provided by neitsch et al 2005 2 3 catchment delineation input data 2 3 1 hydro meteorological data the climatic data was obtained from the kenya meteorological department kmd for kisii kericho and narok stations the data included daily data of relative humidity wind speed maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation daily rainfall data from twenty different individual rain gauge stations located both within and outside nyangores catchment were used for analysis only three of the twenty stations are located within the nyangores catchment these are baraget tenwek and bomet west the rest were included as they were located close to the centroid of the catchment short gaps within each data set were filled using the arithmetic mean method with the neighboring station following mwangi et al 2016b streamflow data for the station near bomet town 1la03 was obtained from water resource authority wra this is the only gauging station with recorded data within the catchment 2 3 2 spatial data the main spatial input datasets used in swat include the digital elevation model dem landuse land cover data and soil data the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m dem was used to obtain topographic information and derive the flow pathways during watershed delineation a land use map of 1983 government of kenya gok 1983 was used for model setup as this time period was the best match for the study a soil vector map with a scale of 1 1 million representing the soils of the study region was obtained from the kenya soil survey and soil terrain database soter of the international soil reference and information centre iscric batjes 2002 2 4 model setup and calibration model setup was conducted using arcswat version 2012 10 2 18 some adjustment to the plant growth module were done according to mwangi et al 2016b the adjustments were made to address the swat model s inability to adequately simulate perennial vegetation dynamics in the tropics strauch and volk 2013 mwangi et al 2016b alemayehu et al 2017a b trees and perennial crops in swat are modelled based on temperate climate which is characterized with day length driven dormancy and seasonal shedding and sprouting of leaves neitsch et al 2005 the adjustments made included 1 increasing the minimum leaf area index lai from the default 0 75 to 3 for perennials 2 reducing the potential heat units phu fraction from 0 15 to 0 001 and 3 using the kill operation to restart the growth cycle of trees and perennial crops the changes in the lai are intended to ensure that continuous evapotranspiration occurs throughout the growing period of the trees and perennials cf mwangi et al 2016b the adjustment in phu ensure there is no delay in growth at the beginning of growth cycles plant growth in swat is modelled using phu and enough heat units must be accumulated for growth to occur start as part of the parameterization exercise and considering that the cn2 parameter value is adjusted daily as a function of plant evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2005 the initial values for the present land uses frse evergreen forest 35 frst mixed forest 35 and agriculture agrr 75 were modified in the database the model was calibrated using daily streamflow data for the station number 1la03 near bomet town the data used for calibration was for the period 1972 1978 the first three years were used as warm up period the selection of this period was based on quality of the data the period had more continuous data than any other period as indicated by hulsman et al 2017 there exists a long term discharge time series between 1955 2015 however the temporal coverage is poor this is especially so for recent years the same has also been acknowledged by other modelling studies in the watershed where authors used similar period of data for calibration e g dessu and melesse 2012 1978 1982 and mwangi et al 2016b 1974 1982 automated latin hypercube sampling lhs was performed using the fme package in r soetaert and petzolt 2010 which was used to obtain 6000 parameter sets the model parameters selected for calibration and the range used to sample the parameter values are presented in table 1 2 5 statistical and graphical model performance evaluation statistical performance measures quantify the ability of a model to simulate measured data legates and mccabe 1999 according to studies by guse et al 2017 on the connective strength between model parameters and performance criteria using regression trees a minimum of three statistical performance measures is required to represent the different parts of the hydrologic system however this is also dependent on the process complexity in the catchment the different performance measures give different results based on the selected periods of observation and the types of performance measure applied beven 1993 in this study three statistical measures of performance were used nse pbias and rsr nse is an ideal dimensionless objective function in evaluating model performances for difference in output responses moriasi et al 2015 krause et al 2005 concluded that its main disadvantage is its lack of sensitivity to low flow over and under prediction percent bias pbias is an error index that measures the average tendency of the simulated constituent values to be larger or smaller than the measured data a positive value indicates the under prediction of a model while a value of zero indicates a perfect fit of data moriasi et al 2007 this may at times be deceiving as this value may be achieved where the model overpredicts as much as it underpredicts moriasi et al 2015 the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr singh et al 2004 is another error index that standardizes the root mean square error rmse its main advantage over the rmse is its scaling factor that enables the reported values to apply to various constituents it is also less focused on high flows graphical performance measures involve direct or derived visual comparison of simulated and measured data moriasi et al 2015 they are usually used to complement statistical performance measures to capture distinct aspects of the model such as identifying differences in peak shapes and timings moriasi et al 2015 biondi et al 2012 the statistical software r was used in analysis of the statistical performance measures r core team 2013 parameter set selection was done based on the statistical metrics described above assessed using the r packages hydrogof and hydrotsm zambrano bigiarini 2014 both the hydrograph and the flow duration curve fdc graphical performance measures were used to complement this analysis 2 6 application of the 5fdc and ncp calibration procedure calibration of the fdcs and hydrographs was undertaken for the years between 1975 and 1978 this step involved the construction of fdcs using the hyrogof package each fdc was split into five segments hereafter referred to as 5fdc according to pfannerstill et al 2014 this constituted the very high flows 0 5 q5 high flows 5 20 q20 medium flows 20 80 qmid low flows 80 95 q80 and the very low flows 95 100 q95 the upper end of the medium flows segment applied by pfannerstill et al 2014 was extended from 70 to 80 to match the flow guidelines stipulated by the water resource authority wra this metric represents the abstraction limit gok 2012 the discharge between q50 and q80 is referred to as available flow gok 2012 the nse segmented rsr and pbias were used to assess the performance of the calibration runs the rsr for each of the five segments was separately estimated and ranked for all of the 6000 model simulations arising from the 6000 parameter sets sampled by lhs these were represented as rsr q5 rsr q20 rsr qmid rsr q80 and rsr q95 haas et al 2016 the best 2000 runs were then extracted from each segment and a minimum threshold determined the optimal value of rsr is zero these best runs were plotted with nse against pbias all simulations having an nse value lower than zero were considered non behavioral and were excluded from further analysis thereafter these selections were intersected with each other two at a time starting from the very low to the very high flows to obtain a final best set of calibration runs appearing within the 2000 calibrations from each individual segment as a final step an overall ranking obtained from the sum of the rank of each calibration run under each performance metrics was determined as a plausibility check for the intersection undertaken this first involved ranking the performance metrics using the minimum threshold lower rsr threshold value means better performance each calibration run under each performance metrics was then separately ranked these ranks were then summed up and a final ranking undertaken it was expected that the final set of calibration runs obtained through the 5fdc would hold a high ranking and would prove the intersection method as being capable of selecting an optimum set of calibration runs analysis of the hydrograph based ncp involved selection of 2000 best simulation runs from the initial 6000 based on the lowest residual rsr 2 7 determination of pareto ensembles and the cp procedure pareto optimization technique allows for the identification of parameter sets pareto ensembles that represent an optimal trade off point between multiple objective functions or criteria used here every parameter set is ranked using two or more criteria represented by maximizing or minimizing objective functions performance criteria the obtained set of solutions are said to be located within the defined feasible parameter space θ ε θ see equation 1 within this space it is impossible to improve one criterion without making the other worse these parameter sets are referred to as a pareto front and represent the trade off between the criteria used calibration of semi distributed hydrologic models with many parameters describing catchment behavior is often faced with parameter equifinality leading to multiple behavioral sets which adequately simulate the observed flows acknowledging equifinality involves simultaneously optimizing and trading off the performance of several user selected criteria to measure the different aspects of the model performance beven 1993 yilmaz et al 2010 the more independent the contradictory selected criteria are e g high and low flow prediction or hydrologic matter and fluxes the greater is the potential for pareto optimization to find meaningful trade off points in the model behavior in order to determine the model runs that adequately represented the different phases of the fdc and the hydrograph a pareto package rpref rooks 2016 was applied in the r environment an ensemble of 10 model runs minimizing pbias and maximizing the nse was selected from the best calibration runs obtained from the stepwise intersection under the 5fdc under the ncp the pareto ensemble was obtained from the 2000 best simulations the performance of the two pareto ensembles was consequently analyzed based on parameter and water balance distribution equation 1 pareto equation m i n o r m a x f m θ f 1 θ f 2 θ f 3 θ f n θ θ ε θ w h e

to create a hybrid that would merge the characteristics qualities of both the ncp and 5fdc it was hypothesized that the cp would reveal superior parameter sets that overcame any limitations exhibited by either the ncp or 5fdc in representation of both the high and low flows the 5fdc and ncp ensembles were intersected to extract those runs that were common in both ensembles these runs were separately analyzed and this performance was compared to that of the ncp and 5fdc 3 results nse and pbias relationship of the calibration runs obtained from analysis on the 5fdc and ncp procedures are summarized in fig 2 the very low and the very high quartiles were not very selective in the selection of calibration runs this resulted in runs that highly overestimated low negative pbias value and underestimated large positive pbias value the observed discharge using the threshold rsr presented in brackets to assess the ranking of the metrics the mid segment 0 46 which performed best followed sequentially by low 0 82 high 1 70 very low 2 52 and very high 6 82 segments the initial intersection of very low and low segments had the largest impact on the calibration runs in which they were reduced to 668 a further intersection with the mid segment also greatly reduced these runs to 315 the impact of the high flow section slightly reduced the simulation runs to 238 the last intersection resulted in 113 runs determination of the pareto ensemble led to a variable range of model runs that represented not necessarily the best parameters in each performance measure but rather the most optimum simulations in each segment 2000 simulation runs from ncp were selected based on a low rsr this highly selective procedure resulted in higher nse values but a wide range of pbias values a plot of pbias nse of the calibration runs under the ncp is displayed in fig 2 f the nse range for the 2000 runs was 0 65 0 38 while that of pbias was 30 7 34 4 3 1 comparing 5fdc and ncp calibration in order to compare the two the pareto ensembles under the ncp were reanalyzed using the 5fdc procedure tables 2 and 3 illustrate the values obtained from 5fdc and ncp respectively nse values of about 0 50 are judged satisfactory for hydrologic evaluation based on a monthly time step moriasi et al 2007 the two calibration procedures performed comparatively well given that daily time step was applied during analysis however the 5fdc procedure gave a wider nse range 0 06 as compared to that of the ncp 0 03 this is not surprising for ncp as the nse is focused on high flows a look into pbias results shows that all the selected simulations were within the satisfactory range a distinct difference was noted in the low flow section of the segmented rsr values 5fdc was superior as it resulted in much lower values see rsrq95 both methods failed to preserve the peak flows with the 5fdc performing worse see hydrograph in fig 3 three calibration runs no 471 no 1254 and no 2382 appeared in both the ncp and the 5fdc ensembles these were taken to represent the calibration runs for the combined procedure cp the fdc of the 5fdc and ncp pareto ensembles fig 4 also shows that the 5fdc procedure tended to underestimate the mid lower segment q60 q80 and the lower segment q95 less than the ncp ncp highly overestimated the low flows the cp produced a concession between the two methods by reducing the overestimation of the low flows by the ncp and of the peak flows by the 5fdc 3 2 parameter selection and water balance components violin boxplots presented in fig 5 act as a fusion between box plot and density trace they not only show the quartile distribution and outlier values box and whisker plot but also illustrate the data probability density at the different values while comparing the ncp and 5fdc variable distribution patterns were observed for parameters with some such as the threshold water level in shallow aquifer for return flow gwqmn the revaporation return flow coefficient gw revap and surlag depicting opposing probability distributions both methods reveal the high level of uncertainty associated with groundwater contribution base flow analysis three parameters exhibited striking differences in the coverage of the parameter space this included channel hydraulic conductivity ch k2 manning s channel value ch n2 and the aquifer percolation coefficient rchg dp the ch k2 is a measure of the rate of loss from the channel into the groundwater channels with low ch k2 have higher transmission losses which are assumed to enter bank storage neitsch et al 2005 channels receiving groundwater contribution have low values gitau and chaubey 2010 ch n2 controls the flow velocity of water in the channel higher values reduce the velocity of water the rchrg dp controls how much water is lost into the deep aquifer and considered lost from the system neitsch et al 2005 the cp method had a profound impact in increasing the identifiability of all parameters by reducing the uncertainty in the distribution fig 6 illustrates an average of water balance components of 5fdc ncp cp the average annual rainfall for the years calibrated was 1549 mm the standard deviation of the runs within each parameter ensemble is represented in brackets the highest variation within the ensembles was noted in the groundwater components the high uncertainty observed within the parameter distribution of groundwater parameters resulted in a wider range of these water balance components this was higher under the 5fdc the execution of the ncp procedure resulted in higher deep aquifer recharge and total water yield a larger proportion of the percolated water was lost into the deep aquifer and no longer contributed to the hydrologic cycle as observable from fig 5 this has been restricted to the upper ranges of the parameter space the 5fdc method on the other hand allowed more water to infiltrate through the soil and percolate into the aquifers most of this water was released as groundwater flow lateral flow and as return flow from shallow aquifers to the rooting zone of the plants the model then impelled the evaporation of this water cp which proved the most superior in terms of parameter identifiability and uncertainty produced the high amounts of shallow aquifer storage the reduced uncertainty in parameter estimated translated to reduced variability in water balance components this method combined the characteristics of the 5fdc and ncp in order to determine which of the calibration procedures closely simulated observed values the runoff ratio and proportion of precipitation translated to evapotranspiration were calculated see values in brackets next to procedures table 4 although both methods closely simulated the observed values the 5fdc produced better results the cp produced values that were between the 5fdc and ncp no procedures matched the value obtained in the third year this may be due to the uncertainty in streamflow data as a result of the use of manual river gauges or from the use of rating equations to convert gauge heights into high flows juston et al 2014 4 discussion the lhs attempts to sample the response surface according to the likelihood density and as such areas with high likelihood are sampled more frequently beven 1993 this makes this sampling method very efficient in reducing the non behavioral parameter values by ensuring that there is no violation of practical or theoretical boundaries for each specific input parameter arnold et al 2012b the multi metric based system resulted from combining the segments based on their objective function performance van werkhoven et al 2009 pfannerstill et al 2014 the stepwise intersection of the 5fdc ensured that a satisfactory set of parameter was obtained as the best performing simulations were selected from each segment the high and very high flows signal the response of the catchment to high intensity precipitation events while the mid range focuses on moderate precipitation events the low flow segment is related to the interaction of base flow with riparian evapotranspiration during extended dry periods yilmaz et al 2010 guse et al 2016 the splitting of the 5fdc resulted in calibration runs that adequately represented the response of the catchment to the different watershed functions each performance metric had its own unique distribution pattern and rejected some poorly performing calibration runs this is further evidenced by the performance of the pareto runs selected under the 5fdc in the plausibility check the determination of a pareto ensemble from the final set supports the equifinality theory in that it refutes the existence of a single best parameter set and recognizes that numerous parameter sets may provide equivalent representations beven 1993 for this reason ensembles of 10 parameter sets were obtained for parameter analysis and water balance component evaluation for both ncp and 5fdc the cp approach narrowed this to an ensemble of 3 parameter sets parameter identification is a complex non linear problem and numerous possible solutions might be obtained by different optimization algorithms nandakumar and mein 1997 as deduced from this study the selection of sensitive parameters does not mean that the parameter is also identifiable linking the parameter performance to the fdc hydrograph of simulated plots reveals that the ncp method better represents the mid upper and high flows here performance was based on lumped global performance measures that were likely influenced by these flows given the high level of uncertainty in the groundwater parameters simulations using observed flows are more reliable and as such the 5fdc tends to produce better results as compared to the ncp the water balance is the driving force behind all processes in hydrologic models arnold et al 2012a all procedures show that evapotranspiration takes the highest proportion of precipitation and is thus an important component in this catchment dessu and melesse 2012 reported that on a basis of a 10 year average annual water budget in nyangores 1978 1982 and 1988 1992 evapotranspiration accounted for 70 of losses of annual rainfall input which is similar to the results found in this study the nyangores catchment is located in the upper part of the larger mara catchment and is home to one of the largest water towers in kenya the mau forest due to their leaf sizes thickness and aerodynamic roughness trees typically provide a large surface area for canopy interception of precipitation and consequently evapotranspiration their deep and extensive roots additionally aid in extracting more water from the groundwater allowing for further evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2005 the main benefit of integrating this type of analysis which incorporates both hard discharge and soft data individual process data into calibration is to ensure that parameter sets selected using both procedures simulate realistic water balance components while comparing the 5fdc and ncp simulations using the pareto ensembles revealed that under the 5fdc a large proportion of water is stored in the rooting zone or is released as base flow this can also be linked to the higher ch k2 values obtained under this method this leads to an increase in bank storage which may move to the adjacent unsaturated zone for use by plants or released as base flow neitsch et al 2005 a modelling study conducted by birundu and mutua 2017 in the nyangores catchment using the hbv model concluded that a major proportion of precipitation received in nyangores catchment is stored and later released as baseflow some of this water could have been transpired by plants contributing to higher evapotranspiration values simulated the lower ch n2 values also resulted in faster response of this catchment to peak rainfall leading to overestimated high flows this can be viewed in fig 3 and fig 4 additionally the 5fdc procedure exhibited runoff ratios closer to the observed values for most years the wider range in groundwater components observed within the 5fdc pareto ensemble can be explained by the fact that this procedure selected calibration runs that attempted to match all the phases of the hydrograph leading to a high tradeoff between the high and low flows by contrast the ncp was quite selective in focusing on the flows favored by the objective functions selected for analysis the higher loss of water to deep aquifer under the ncp can be attributed to the high rchrg dp values this reduces the amount of water released as baseflow or revaporated into the unsaturated zone neitsch et al 2005 higher surlag and low sol awc values also indicated that less water was retained in the soil neitsch et al 2005 this could explain why this procedure performed better under the high flows however water resource managers are mostly concerned with ensuring availability of water to the water uses during water shortages of different levels of severity with better representation of low flows they can establish effective limits that ensure that there is no overallocation of water in theory fdcs are well suited for representing the hydrological response of the catchment they are also easier to use and interpret even for users with limited hydrological background vogel and fennessey 1994 by reshaping the data on the basis of flow frequency the timing component of streamflow is removed this means they cannot be applied for purposes such as flood frequency estimation under the hybrid procedure cp both the high and low flows were adequately represented the parameter identifiability additionally improved this increases confidence in the simulations obtained and does not limit their applicability cp can thus be effectively applied for scenario creation and prediction purposes 5 conclusion in this study a mesoscale hydrologic model was applied for calibration purposes to the nyangores catchment kenya the calibration period selected was from 1975 to 1978 using lhs importance sampling 6000 independent parameter sets were generated and runoff simulated the observed data discharge runoff ratio proportion of precipitation translated to evapotranspiration was then compared to that simulated using pareto ensembles from the 5fdc ncp and cp parameter distribution of the pareto ensembles for each procedure was plotted this distribution was linked to the performance of the model with regards to water balance components this study follows the approach of pfannerstill et al 2014 and yilmaz et al 2010 which developed a multi metric framework to implement the results of an optimum parameter set that adequately represented all the phases of the hydrograph the use of the 5fdc improved the calibration of low and very low flows this improvement has potential for use by watershed resource managers working in low flow environments ncp however performed better than 5fdc where peak flows were considered we additionally recognized the equifinality theory by selecting pareto ensembles within which no single best parameter set is selected the parameter analysis revealed differences in parameters relating to catchment properties surface and groundwater flow between the two procedures this corresponded with the differences in how the model partitioned the water balance components with these differences the intersection of the 5fdc and ncp created a hybrid cp this procedure merged the strengths exhibited by both the 5fdc and ncp leading to reduced parameter uncertainty however there is need for further studies to be undertaken to understand especially the partitioning of the water balance components finally the study demonstrated that the selection of the calibration procedure should be dependent upon the purpose of the modelling exercise the 5fdc however produced simulations closer to the observed values especially for the low flow volumes this was also the case for the runoff ratios the 5fdc method can thus better predict low flows and long term base flows and hence is more suitable for long term water management

8459,study region nyangores catchment mara catchment kenya study focus hydrologic models are widely used tools in watershed management to assist in decision making by representing catchment functions under alternative scenarios this study focused on the evaluation of the 5 segment flow duration curve based calibration procedure 5fdc for the period 1975 1978 using the soil water assessment tool swat the normal calibration procedure ncp based on the hydrograph was compared to the 5fdc two separate ensembles each containing 10 pareto calibration runs were obtained individually from each method and evaluated based on their goodness of fit a final combined procedure cp which was an intersection of 5fdc and ncp was executed with this supplementary analysis the parameter distribution and water component balance were analyzed and compared new hydrological insights for the region the comparison of 5fdc and ncp shows that the 5fdc provides a better representation of the low and mid level section of the flow duration curve as compared to the ncp which greatly overestimates these flows this method also closely matches the observed runoff ratios this indicates that the 5fdc calibration may be well suited for water resource applications focused on low flows the cp combines the advantages of both procedures by improving parameter identifiability leading to better representation of

hypercube sampling performance metrics uncertainty prediction hydrologic model simulation equifinality base flows variability optimum stepwise intersection ensemble water partitioning 1 introduction globally water demand is increasing due to factors such as population growth increasing agricultural and industrial production to meet this ever rising water demand improvement in water resources management is required planning is a fundamental aspect of sustainable water resources management hydrological models are essential tools widely used in planning of water resources hydrologic models are able to efficiently integrate study and evaluate different components of watershed s complex dynamic and spatially variable hydrological processes niehoff et al 2002 bormann et al 2007 hulsman et al 2009 wagner et al 2016 therefore by using reliable and accurate data hydrological models can be used to assess present and future changes in water demands leading to informed management decisions on competing water uses other common applications of hydrological models in water resources management is prediction of impact e g quantity quality timing of land use and climate change on watershed hydrology a wide range of hydrological models exists the models vary depending on how they represent the underlying hydrological processes they also vary depending on how the hydrological components e g model parameters and processes are represented in time and space devi et al 2015 thus the choice of hydrological model depends on the intended purpose based on the output of the model and the model structure including the level of detail of the model inputs processes and the outputs whatever the type of hydrological model chosen the reliability of the model in simulating accurate or observed outputs e g runoff or sediment yield needs to be examined kirchner 2006 wagener and wheater 2006 westerberg et al 2011 this is usually done by calibrating the model based on the desired model output s models are calibrated by adjusting parameters to improve model fit based on objective functions which are used to evaluate the modelling efficiency gupta et al 1998 wagener and wheater 2006 pfannerstill et al 2017 model calibration can be done manually or automatically by use of optimization algorithms such as shuffled complex evaluation method duan et al 1994 general likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 and bayesian recursive parameter estimation encompassing sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 thiemann et al 2001 all these differ in their underlying assumptions residual errors possible iterations and types of uncertainties accounted for and represented explicitly samadi et al 2017 normally the accuracy of calibration of hydrological models is evaluated by statistically assessing the fit of simulated and observed hydrographs hrachowitz et al 2013 wambura et al 2018 one advantage of this method herein after referred as normal calibration procedure ncp is preservation of timing information e g timing of runoff however although hydrographs represent an integrated measure reflecting all the complexity of flow processes occurring in the catchment it is difficult to infer the nature of these processes directly beven 1993 where times for discharge and model input data do not overlap calibration using this method may not be suitable westerberg et al 2011 an alternative to hydrograph calibration can involve use of flow duration curve fdc westerberg et al 2011 fdc is a cumulative frequency curve which shows the percent of time specified discharges were equaled or exceeded vogel and fennessey 1994 the shape of the fdc is highly influenced by the climatological and geophysical characteristics of the catchment yokoo and sivaplan 2011 and calibration of the fdc involves matching discharge magnitudes the method therefore inherently takes into account the influence of catchment characteristics during the calibration however a major limitation of this method is that unlike the ncp the timing information is lost sawicz et al 2011 found that splitting the fdc into individual segments in the calibration procedure led to an overall better representation of catchment characteristics a study conducted by pfannerstill et al 2014 split the flow duration curve into five segments 5fdc representing very high high mid low and very low flow segments in this study calibration on these segments within a multi metric evaluation framework calibrated swat model adequately for both the high and low flows low flows are often of special interest to water resource managers who may need to consider minimum flows in order to avoid over allocation of water dudgeon et al 2006 in this study the main objective was to calibrate the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012a using the 5fdc procedure and compare it with the ncp additionally a hybrid of ncp and 5fdc methods i e combined procedure cp was assessed cp involved intersecting a final set of calibration runs from both the 5fdc and ncp specifically this study aims to compare the differences in selection of optimum parameter ensembles for both the 5fdc and ncp approaches in terms of efficiency criteria parameter distribution and water balance components in addition to assessing the cp method 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the nyangores catchment spanning an area of about 694 km2 is located in the upper part of the mara river basin fig 1 elevation ranges from 1900 m a s l to 2970 m a s l on the mau escapements mwangi et al 2016a the mean annual temperature is approximately 25 c bimodal seasonal rainfall ranging between 1000 mm to 1750 mm is linked to the annual oscillation of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz fürst et al 2015 river nyangores originates from the kiringet area in the mau forest and joins with river amala to form the mara river the population of this catchment according to the census held in 2009 was 300 000 fürst et al 2015 and an annual increase of 3 is projected knbs 2010 there was a 40 deforestation rate between 1972 and 1995 juston et al 2014 this land use shift brought about by increased permanent settlements and agriculture has continued to increase steadily to date juston et al 2014 mwangi et al 2018 this has significantly affected the hydrological regime in the catchment mwangi et al 2016a mango et al 2011 reported that the conversion of forests to agricultural land has and will continue to decrease dry season flows at the same time an increased peak of high flows 7 observed between 1973 and 2000 is expected to rise in the future mati et al 2008 mango et al 2011 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat swat arnold et al 2012a is a mesoscale and semi distributed watershed model developed by the agricultural research service ars of the united states department of agriculture usda bekele and nicklow 2012 swat operates on a daily time step and can predict the effects of alternative management decisions on water sediment and chemical yields winchell et al 2013 the major model components include weather soil dynamics hydrology plant growth nutrient availability land management and pathogens all processes are driven by the hydrologic cycle a digital elevation model dem forms the basis from which the watershed is delineated using the individual reaches the basin is divided into sub basins within sub basins hydrologic response units hru are formed by a unique combination of land use slope and soil characteristics arnold et al 2012a at the hru level all processes of the hydrologic cycle are simulated the daily volume of water yield is then estimated by solving the water budget for each hru a full description of the swat model is provided by neitsch et al 2005 2 3 catchment delineation input data 2 3 1 hydro meteorological data the climatic data was obtained from the kenya meteorological department kmd for kisii kericho and narok stations the data included daily data of relative humidity wind speed maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation daily rainfall data from twenty different individual rain gauge stations located both within and outside nyangores catchment were used for analysis only three of the twenty stations are located within the nyangores catchment these are baraget tenwek and bomet west the rest were included as they were located close to the centroid of the catchment short gaps within each data set were filled using the arithmetic mean method with the neighboring station following mwangi et al 2016b streamflow data for the station near bomet town 1la03 was obtained from water resource authority wra this is the only gauging station with recorded data within the catchment 2 3 2 spatial data the main spatial input datasets used in swat include the digital elevation model dem landuse land cover data and soil data the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m dem was used to obtain topographic information and derive the flow pathways during watershed delineation a land use map of 1983 government of kenya gok 1983 was used for model setup as this time period was the best match for the study a soil vector map with a scale of 1 1 million representing the soils of the study region was obtained from the kenya soil survey and soil terrain database soter of the international soil reference and information centre iscric batjes 2002 2 4 model setup and calibration model setup was conducted using arcswat version 2012 10 2 18 some adjustment to the plant growth module were done according to mwangi et al 2016b the adjustments were made to address the swat model s inability to adequately simulate perennial vegetation dynamics in the tropics strauch and volk 2013 mwangi et al 2016b alemayehu et al 2017a b trees and perennial crops in swat are modelled based on temperate climate which is characterized with day length driven dormancy and seasonal shedding and sprouting of leaves neitsch et al 2005 the adjustments made included 1 increasing the minimum leaf area index lai from the default 0 75 to 3 for perennials 2 reducing the potential heat units phu fraction from 0 15 to 0 001 and 3 using the kill operation to restart the growth cycle of trees and perennial crops the changes in the lai are intended to ensure that continuous evapotranspiration occurs throughout the growing period of the trees and perennials cf mwangi et al 2016b the adjustment in phu ensure there is no delay in growth at the beginning of growth cycles plant growth in swat is modelled using phu and enough heat units must be accumulated for growth to occur start as part of the parameterization exercise and considering that the cn2 parameter value is adjusted daily as a function of plant evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2005 the initial values for the present land uses frse evergreen forest 35 frst mixed forest 35 and agriculture agrr 75 were modified in the database the model was calibrated using daily streamflow data for the station number 1la03 near bomet town the data used for calibration was for the period 1972 1978 the first three years were used as warm up period the selection of this period was based on quality of the data the period had more continuous data than any other period as indicated by hulsman et al 2017 there exists a long term discharge time series between 1955 2015 however the temporal coverage is poor this is especially so for recent years the same has also been acknowledged by other modelling studies in the watershed where authors used similar period of data for calibration e g dessu and melesse 2012 1978 1982 and mwangi et al 2016b 1974 1982 automated latin hypercube sampling lhs was performed using the fme package in r soetaert and petzolt 2010 which was used to obtain 6000 parameter sets the model parameters selected for calibration and the range used to sample the parameter values are presented in table 1 2 5 statistical and graphical model performance evaluation statistical performance measures quantify the ability of a model to simulate measured data legates and mccabe 1999 according to studies by guse et al 2017 on the connective strength between model parameters and performance criteria using regression trees a minimum of three statistical performance measures is required to represent the different parts of the hydrologic system however this is also dependent on the process complexity in the catchment the different performance measures give different results based on the selected periods of observation and the types of performance measure applied beven 1993 in this study three statistical measures of performance were used nse pbias and rsr nse is an ideal dimensionless objective function in evaluating model performances for difference in output responses moriasi et al 2015 krause et al 2005 concluded that its main disadvantage is its lack of sensitivity to low flow over and under prediction percent bias pbias is an error index that measures the average tendency of the simulated constituent values to be larger or smaller than the measured data a positive value indicates the under prediction of a model while a value of zero indicates a perfect fit of data moriasi et al 2007 this may at times be deceiving as this value may be achieved where the model overpredicts as much as it underpredicts moriasi et al 2015 the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr singh et al 2004 is another error index that standardizes the root mean square error rmse its main advantage over the rmse is its scaling factor that enables the reported values to apply to various constituents it is also less focused on high flows graphical performance measures involve direct or derived visual comparison of simulated and measured data moriasi et al 2015 they are usually used to complement statistical performance measures to capture distinct aspects of the model such as identifying differences in peak shapes and timings moriasi et al 2015 biondi et al 2012 the statistical software r was used in analysis of the statistical performance measures r core team 2013 parameter set selection was done based on the statistical metrics described above assessed using the r packages hydrogof and hydrotsm zambrano bigiarini 2014 both the hydrograph and the flow duration curve fdc graphical performance measures were used to complement this analysis 2 6 application of the 5fdc and ncp calibration procedure calibration of the fdcs and hydrographs was undertaken for the years between 1975 and 1978 this step involved the construction of fdcs using the hyrogof package each fdc was split into five segments hereafter referred to as 5fdc according to pfannerstill et al 2014 this constituted the very high flows 0 5 q5 high flows 5 20 q20 medium flows 20 80 qmid low flows 80 95 q80 and the very low flows 95 100 q95 the upper end of the medium flows segment applied by pfannerstill et al 2014 was extended from 70 to 80 to match the flow guidelines stipulated by the water resource authority wra this metric represents the abstraction limit gok 2012 the discharge between q50 and q80 is referred to as available flow gok 2012 the nse segmented rsr and pbias were used to assess the performance of the calibration runs the rsr for each of the five segments was separately estimated and ranked for all of the 6000 model simulations arising from the 6000 parameter sets sampled by lhs these were represented as rsr q5 rsr q20 rsr qmid rsr q80 and rsr q95 haas et al 2016 the best 2000 runs were then extracted from each segment and a minimum threshold determined the optimal value of rsr is zero these best runs were plotted with nse against pbias all simulations having an nse value lower than zero were considered non behavioral and were excluded from further analysis thereafter these selections were intersected with each other two at a time starting from the very low to the very high flows to obtain a final best set of calibration runs appearing within the 2000 calibrations from each individual segment as a final step an overall ranking obtained from the sum of the rank of each calibration run under each performance metrics was determined as a plausibility check for the intersection undertaken this first involved ranking the performance metrics using the minimum threshold lower rsr threshold value means better performance each calibration run under each performance metrics was then separately ranked these ranks were then summed up and a final ranking undertaken it was expected that the final set of calibration runs obtained through the 5fdc would hold a high ranking and would prove the intersection method as being capable of selecting an optimum set of calibration runs analysis of the hydrograph based ncp involved selection of 2000 best simulation runs from the initial 6000 based on the lowest residual rsr 2 7 determination of pareto ensembles and the cp procedure pareto optimization technique allows for the identification of parameter sets pareto ensembles that represent an optimal trade off point between multiple objective functions or criteria used here every parameter set is ranked using two or more criteria represented by maximizing or minimizing objective functions performance criteria the obtained set of solutions are said to be located within the defined feasible parameter space θ ε θ see equation 1 within this space it is impossible to improve one criterion without making the other worse these parameter sets are referred to as a pareto front and represent the trade off between the criteria used calibration of semi distributed hydrologic models with many parameters describing catchment behavior is often faced with parameter equifinality leading to multiple behavioral sets which adequately simulate the observed flows acknowledging equifinality involves simultaneously optimizing and trading off the performance of several user selected criteria to measure the different aspects of the model performance beven 1993 yilmaz et al 2010 the more independent the contradictory selected criteria are e g high and low flow prediction or hydrologic matter and fluxes the greater is the potential for pareto optimization to find meaningful trade off points in the model behavior in order to determine the model runs that adequately represented the different phases of the fdc and the hydrograph a pareto package rpref rooks 2016 was applied in the r environment an ensemble of 10 model runs minimizing pbias and maximizing the nse was selected from the best calibration runs obtained from the stepwise intersection under the 5fdc under the ncp the pareto ensemble was obtained from the 2000 best simulations the performance of the two pareto ensembles was consequently analyzed based on parameter and water balance distribution equation 1 pareto equation m i n o r m a x f m θ f 1 θ f 2 θ f 3 θ f n θ θ ε θ w h e

to create a hybrid that would merge the characteristics qualities of both the ncp and 5fdc it was hypothesized that the cp would reveal superior parameter sets that overcame any limitations exhibited by either the ncp or 5fdc in representation of both the high and low flows the 5fdc and ncp ensembles were intersected to extract those runs that were common in both ensembles these runs were separately analyzed and this performance was compared to that of the ncp and 5fdc 3 results nse and pbias relationship of the calibration runs obtained from analysis on the 5fdc and ncp procedures are summarized in fig 2 the very low and the very high quartiles were not very selective in the selection of calibration runs this resulted in runs that highly overestimated low negative pbias value and underestimated large positive pbias value the observed discharge using the threshold rsr presented in brackets to assess the ranking of the metrics the mid segment 0 46 which performed best followed sequentially by low 0 82 high 1 70 very low 2 52 and very high 6 82 segments the initial intersection of very low and low segments had the largest impact on the calibration runs in which they were reduced to 668 a further intersection with the mid segment also greatly reduced these runs to 315 the impact of the high flow section slightly reduced the simulation runs to 238 the last intersection resulted in 113 runs determination of the pareto ensemble led to a variable range of model runs that represented not necessarily the best parameters in each performance measure but rather the most optimum simulations in each segment 2000 simulation runs from ncp were selected based on a low rsr this highly selective procedure resulted in higher nse values but a wide range of pbias values a plot of pbias nse of the calibration runs under the ncp is displayed in fig 2 f the nse range for the 2000 runs was 0 65 0 38 while that of pbias was 30 7 34 4 3 1 comparing 5fdc and ncp calibration in order to compare the two the pareto ensembles under the ncp were reanalyzed using the 5fdc procedure tables 2 and 3 illustrate the values obtained from 5fdc and ncp respectively nse values of about 0 50 are judged satisfactory for hydrologic evaluation based on a monthly time step moriasi et al 2007 the two calibration procedures performed comparatively well given that daily time step was applied during analysis however the 5fdc procedure gave a wider nse range 0 06 as compared to that of the ncp 0 03 this is not surprising for ncp as the nse is focused on high flows a look into pbias results shows that all the selected simulations were within the satisfactory range a distinct difference was noted in the low flow section of the segmented rsr values 5fdc was superior as it resulted in much lower values see rsrq95 both methods failed to preserve the peak flows with the 5fdc performing worse see hydrograph in fig 3 three calibration runs no 471 no 1254 and no 2382 appeared in both the ncp and the 5fdc ensembles these were taken to represent the calibration runs for the combined procedure cp the fdc of the 5fdc and ncp pareto ensembles fig 4 also shows that the 5fdc procedure tended to underestimate the mid lower segment q60 q80 and the lower segment q95 less than the ncp ncp highly overestimated the low flows the cp produced a concession between the two methods by reducing the overestimation of the low flows by the ncp and of the peak flows by the 5fdc 3 2 parameter selection and water balance components violin boxplots presented in fig 5 act as a fusion between box plot and density trace they not only show the quartile distribution and outlier values box and whisker plot but also illustrate the data probability density at the different values while comparing the ncp and 5fdc variable distribution patterns were observed for parameters with some such as the threshold water level in shallow aquifer for return flow gwqmn the revaporation return flow coefficient gw revap and surlag depicting opposing probability distributions both methods reveal the high level of uncertainty associated with groundwater contribution base flow analysis three parameters exhibited striking differences in the coverage of the parameter space this included channel hydraulic conductivity ch k2 manning s channel value ch n2 and the aquifer percolation coefficient rchg dp the ch k2 is a measure of the rate of loss from the channel into the groundwater channels with low ch k2 have higher transmission losses which are assumed to enter bank storage neitsch et al 2005 channels receiving groundwater contribution have low values gitau and chaubey 2010 ch n2 controls the flow velocity of water in the channel higher values reduce the velocity of water the rchrg dp controls how much water is lost into the deep aquifer and considered lost from the system neitsch et al 2005 the cp method had a profound impact in increasing the identifiability of all parameters by reducing the uncertainty in the distribution fig 6 illustrates an average of water balance components of 5fdc ncp cp the average annual rainfall for the years calibrated was 1549 mm the standard deviation of the runs within each parameter ensemble is represented in brackets the highest variation within the ensembles was noted in the groundwater components the high uncertainty observed within the parameter distribution of groundwater parameters resulted in a wider range of these water balance components this was higher under the 5fdc the execution of the ncp procedure resulted in higher deep aquifer recharge and total water yield a larger proportion of the percolated water was lost into the deep aquifer and no longer contributed to the hydrologic cycle as observable from fig 5 this has been restricted to the upper ranges of the parameter space the 5fdc method on the other hand allowed more water to infiltrate through the soil and percolate into the aquifers most of this water was released as groundwater flow lateral flow and as return flow from shallow aquifers to the rooting zone of the plants the model then impelled the evaporation of this water cp which proved the most superior in terms of parameter identifiability and uncertainty produced the high amounts of shallow aquifer storage the reduced uncertainty in parameter estimated translated to reduced variability in water balance components this method combined the characteristics of the 5fdc and ncp in order to determine which of the calibration procedures closely simulated observed values the runoff ratio and proportion of precipitation translated to evapotranspiration were calculated see values in brackets next to procedures table 4 although both methods closely simulated the observed values the 5fdc produced better results the cp produced values that were between the 5fdc and ncp no procedures matched the value obtained in the third year this may be due to the uncertainty in streamflow data as a result of the use of manual river gauges or from the use of rating equations to convert gauge heights into high flows juston et al 2014 4 discussion the lhs attempts to sample the response surface according to the likelihood density and as such areas with high likelihood are sampled more frequently beven 1993 this makes this sampling method very efficient in reducing the non behavioral parameter values by ensuring that there is no violation of practical or theoretical boundaries for each specific input parameter arnold et al 2012b the multi metric based system resulted from combining the segments based on their objective function performance van werkhoven et al 2009 pfannerstill et al 2014 the stepwise intersection of the 5fdc ensured that a satisfactory set of parameter was obtained as the best performing simulations were selected from each segment the high and very high flows signal the response of the catchment to high intensity precipitation events while the mid range focuses on moderate precipitation events the low flow segment is related to the interaction of base flow with riparian evapotranspiration during extended dry periods yilmaz et al 2010 guse et al 2016 the splitting of the 5fdc resulted in calibration runs that adequately represented the response of the catchment to the different watershed functions each performance metric had its own unique distribution pattern and rejected some poorly performing calibration runs this is further evidenced by the performance of the pareto runs selected under the 5fdc in the plausibility check the determination of a pareto ensemble from the final set supports the equifinality theory in that it refutes the existence of a single best parameter set and recognizes that numerous parameter sets may provide equivalent representations beven 1993 for this reason ensembles of 10 parameter sets were obtained for parameter analysis and water balance component evaluation for both ncp and 5fdc the cp approach narrowed this to an ensemble of 3 parameter sets parameter identification is a complex non linear problem and numerous possible solutions might be obtained by different optimization algorithms nandakumar and mein 1997 as deduced from this study the selection of sensitive parameters does not mean that the parameter is also identifiable linking the parameter performance to the fdc hydrograph of simulated plots reveals that the ncp method better represents the mid upper and high flows here performance was based on lumped global performance measures that were likely influenced by these flows given the high level of uncertainty in the groundwater parameters simulations using observed flows are more reliable and as such the 5fdc tends to produce better results as compared to the ncp the water balance is the driving force behind all processes in hydrologic models arnold et al 2012a all procedures show that evapotranspiration takes the highest proportion of precipitation and is thus an important component in this catchment dessu and melesse 2012 reported that on a basis of a 10 year average annual water budget in nyangores 1978 1982 and 1988 1992 evapotranspiration accounted for 70 of losses of annual rainfall input which is similar to the results found in this study the nyangores catchment is located in the upper part of the larger mara catchment and is home to one of the largest water towers in kenya the mau forest due to their leaf sizes thickness and aerodynamic roughness trees typically provide a large surface area for canopy interception of precipitation and consequently evapotranspiration their deep and extensive roots additionally aid in extracting more water from the groundwater allowing for further evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2005 the main benefit of integrating this type of analysis which incorporates both hard discharge and soft data individual process data into calibration is to ensure that parameter sets selected using both procedures simulate realistic water balance components while comparing the 5fdc and ncp simulations using the pareto ensembles revealed that under the 5fdc a large proportion of water is stored in the rooting zone or is released as base flow this can also be linked to the higher ch k2 values obtained under this method this leads to an increase in bank storage which may move to the adjacent unsaturated zone for use by plants or released as base flow neitsch et al 2005 a modelling study conducted by birundu and mutua 2017 in the nyangores catchment using the hbv model concluded that a major proportion of precipitation received in nyangores catchment is stored and later released as baseflow some of this water could have been transpired by plants contributing to higher evapotranspiration values simulated the lower ch n2 values also resulted in faster response of this catchment to peak rainfall leading to overestimated high flows this can be viewed in fig 3 and fig 4 additionally the 5fdc procedure exhibited runoff ratios closer to the observed values for most years the wider range in groundwater components observed within the 5fdc pareto ensemble can be explained by the fact that this procedure selected calibration runs that attempted to match all the phases of the hydrograph leading to a high tradeoff between the high and low flows by contrast the ncp was quite selective in focusing on the flows favored by the objective functions selected for analysis the higher loss of water to deep aquifer under the ncp can be attributed to the high rchrg dp values this reduces the amount of water released as baseflow or revaporated into the unsaturated zone neitsch et al 2005 higher surlag and low sol awc values also indicated that less water was retained in the soil neitsch et al 2005 this could explain why this procedure performed better under the high flows however water resource managers are mostly concerned with ensuring availability of water to the water uses during water shortages of different levels of severity with better representation of low flows they can establish effective limits that ensure that there is no overallocation of water in theory fdcs are well suited for representing the hydrological response of the catchment they are also easier to use and interpret even for users with limited hydrological background vogel and fennessey 1994 by reshaping the data on the basis of flow frequency the timing component of streamflow is removed this means they cannot be applied for purposes such as flood frequency estimation under the hybrid procedure cp both the high and low flows were adequately represented the parameter identifiability additionally improved this increases confidence in the simulations obtained and does not limit their applicability cp can thus be effectively applied for scenario creation and prediction purposes 5 conclusion in this study a mesoscale hydrologic model was applied for calibration purposes to the nyangores catchment kenya the calibration period selected was from 1975 to 1978 using lhs importance sampling 6000 independent parameter sets were generated and runoff simulated the observed data discharge runoff ratio proportion of precipitation translated to evapotranspiration was then compared to that simulated using pareto ensembles from the 5fdc ncp and cp parameter distribution of the pareto ensembles for each procedure was plotted this distribution was linked to the performance of the model with regards to water balance components this study follows the approach of pfannerstill et al 2014 and yilmaz et al 2010 which developed a multi metric framework to implement the results of an optimum parameter set that adequately represented all the phases of the hydrograph the use of the 5fdc improved the calibration of low and very low flows this improvement has potential for use by watershed resource managers working in low flow environments ncp however performed better than 5fdc where peak flows were considered we additionally recognized the equifinality theory by selecting pareto ensembles within which no single best parameter set is selected the parameter analysis revealed differences in parameters relating to catchment properties surface and groundwater flow between the two procedures this corresponded with the differences in how the model partitioned the water balance components with these differences the intersection of the 5fdc and ncp created a hybrid cp this procedure merged the strengths exhibited by both the 5fdc and ncp leading to reduced parameter uncertainty however there is need for further studies to be undertaken to understand especially the partitioning of the water balance components finally the study demonstrated that the selection of the calibration procedure should be dependent upon the purpose of the modelling exercise the 5fdc however produced simulations closer to the observed values especially for the low flow volumes this was also the case for the runoff ratios the 5fdc method can thus better predict low flows and long term base flows and hence is more suitable for long term water management
