3655,water problems have long been among the most urgent issues affecting china s lower yellow river in recent decades the regime of the streamflow flowing into the lower yellow river has been significantly altered by large reservoirs and dams in this work we investigate the valve function of xiaolangdi dam on the water discharge for multiple scales xiaolangdi dam exhibits little impact on the total streamflow in the long run although it dramatically changes the seasonal distribution the ratio of average daily discharge during non flood seasons to average daily discharge during flood seasons at xiaolangdi station increased progressively from 39 8 during 1971 1989 to 93 2 during 1997 2016 based on a linear relationship determined from historical data the theoretical daily discharge at huayuankou station in the absence of xiaolangdi dam was reconstructed through comparative analysis of the observed and reconstructed daily discharge series we estimate that 78 of the potential flood events that could have happened during 1997 2007 were mitigated due to the construction and operation of xiaolangdi dam meanwhile the peak discharge at huayuankou station was also reduced from 6000 m3 s to 4500 m3 s the redistribution of seasonal discharge by xiaolangdi dam not only is beneficial for meeting water demand but also effectively extirpates the river drying up phenomenon keywords xiaolangdi dam yellow river water consumption flood daily discharge 1 introduction due to the growing demand for agricultural irrigation municipal supply and hydropower river water has become a scarce resource vorosmarty 2000 vörösmarty et al 2010 gou et al 2021 conversely river water can also cause frightening disasters when it floods willner et al 2018 li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 therefore river water in areas inhabited by humans must be rationally utilized and effectively controlled in ancient times natural environmental factors especially climate and topography were the predominant determinants of river water characteristics currently large reservoirs and dams have been built on almost all of the world s large rivers to efficiently allow for water resources development and management best 2018 grill 2015 according to a report by the world commission on dams about 45 000 large dams and an estimated 800 000 small dams had been built worldwide by the end of the 20th century obstructing over 65 of freshwater flow to the oceans wu et al 2004 wcd 2000 all dams and reservoirs are designed for the benefit of human beings with multipurpose functions including flood control water supply hydropower generation and sediment capture miao et al 2022 the primary benefit of dams and reservoirs is unquestionably the storage of floodwaters since construction of the three gorges reservoir on the yangtze river in china large floods below the magnitude of 100 year return period discharge can be effectively controlled jing et al 2020 yang et al 2017 yan et al 2021 after the establishment of garrison dam on the upper missouri river in the united states the peak discharge dropped from the pre dam extreme value of 10 279 m3 s to 4390 m3 s skalak et al 2013 in addition large dams and reservoirs commonly reduce sediment and water discharge into the sea milliman 1997 nittrouer and viparelli 2014 it was reported that the transport of sediment into the sea by the mississippi river has declined from 400 million metric tons yr before 1900 to 145 million metric tons yr 1987 2006 which is mainly attributed to the trapping effect of dams built on the missouri river in the 1950 s meade and moody 2010 additionally large dams and reservoirs regulate river flows between flood and non flood seasons for more efficient water consumption yang et al 2017 consider the case of the mekong river for instance the reservoirs have caused a clear increase of 25 160 in monthly average discharges during the non flood season december may and a decrease of 3 53 in the flood season june october lauri et al 2012 furthermore large dams and reservoirs have been acting as important facilities for renewable and sustainable power generation it was reported that hydropower has been the leading source of renewable energy across the world accounting for up to 71 of the total renewable energy supply in 2016 moran et al 2018 all these functions of large dams and reservoirs rely on the implementation of designed operation strategies that are based on the real time monitoring or forecasting of hydrological processes of rivers oliveira and alegre 2020 with the advancement of technology and the accumulation of experience the operation of these dams and reservoirs can even be controlled by automated computer programs yaseen et al 2019 chen et al 2017 kumar and yadav 2018 sordo ward et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the yellow river is called the cradle of chinese civilization and it nurtured the most prosperous region of china in early chinese history yu 2002 however the yellow river has also been called china s sorrow due to its frequent and devastating flooding chen et al 2012 li et al 2018 in the second half of the last century the lower reach of the yellow river also suffered from serious drying up events yu et al 2011 to prevent floods and the dry up phenomenon a cascade of large dams has been built along the mainstream of the yellow river in recent decades which has made the yellow river one of the most manipulated fluvial systems in the world gou et al 2020 more than most other dams xiaolangdi dam has been assigned many important tasks due to its key location and large watershed control area in many previous studies the influence of xiaolangdi dam and the corresponding xiaolangdi dam based water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs has been investigated from many perspectives wang et al 2017 kong et al 2022 after the start of operation of xiaolangdi dam the downstream channel converted from a siltation state to an erosion state with a total scouring volume of 1 60 109 m3 during 1999 2012 xia et al 2014 kong et al 2020 investigated the morphological change of the lower yellow river channel based on remote sensing image interpretation and found that sandbars in the upper reaches underwent degradation after the beginning of operation of xiaolangdi dam while the reverse was seen in the lower reaches yu et al 2013 noted that the wsrs produces 50 of the annual sediment delivery to the sea of which 60 derives from scoured coarse sediment from the riverbed of the lower reaches since the evolution of the yellow river delta is dependent on sediment delivery to the sea the cross basin influence of xiaolangdi dam on the delta has also been extensively discussed zhou et al 2015 most of the studies mentioned above focused mainly on the effect of xiaolangdi dam on sediment or sediment related issues wang et al 2006 investigated the impact of dams and reservoirs on the variation of the yellow river water discharge from 1950 to 2000 but the influence of xiaolangdi dam in this period has not yet been revealed many previous researchers have qualitatively quantitatively or semi quantitatively analyzed the influence of climate change and human activities on the variation in water discharge of the yellow river wang et al 2012a wang et al 2012b bao et al 2019 hu et al 2019 su et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 ma et al 2014 xu 2005 however no research has isolated the individual impact of xiaolangdi dam from either a qualitative or quantitative perspective here we provide a comprehensive assessment of xiaolangdi dam from the perspective of water flow regulation insights gained from this study will likely be of use to those considering options for future construction of large dams and reservoirs 2 study area data collection and methodology 2 1 study area xiaolangdi dam is located at the mouth of the final gorge in the middle reach of the yellow river approximately 130 km downstream of sanmenxia dam fig 1 the catchment area above xiaolangdi dam is 69 42 106 km2 which represents approximately 92 of the entire yellow river basin kong et al 2017 generally the whole mainstream between sanmenxia dam and xiaolangdi dam is considered the main body of the xiaolangdi reservoir fig 1b a lot of small river networks merge into the reservoir but there are no large tributaries between sanmenxia dam and xiaolangdi dam xiaolangdi dam first intercepted the yellow river in october 1997 which is regarded as the start time of the post dam period in this study stored water starting in october 1999 and was officially put into use in may 2000 the maximum water level is 275 m above sea level and the flood limited water level is 225 m above sea level fig 1c the total capacity of the reservoir is 12 65 109 m3 which includes 7 55 109 m3 for sediment storage and another 5 1 109 m3 allocated to flow regulation and electricity generation 2 2 data source annual water discharge and sediment load data for the period 1950 to 2016 were supplied by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc daily hydrological data of sanmenxia smx xiaolangdi xld and huayuankou hyk stations in the mainstream were also obtained from the yrcc for the periods 1971 to 1989 and 1997 to 2016 in addition daily hydrological data from wuzhi wz station on the qinhe river a yellow river tributary and heishiguan hsg station on the yiluohe river another tributary from 1997 to 2007 were also acquired from the yrcc unreasonable data points were manually excluded during the data checking process to ensure the quality and reliability of the data water level and water storage data of xiaolangdi reservoir were collected from the daily hydrological information released by the yrcc http www yrcc gov cn the drying up information was collected from yellow river yearbook and the literature cong et al 2009 liu and xia 2004 beniston 2006 remote sensing images were archived from the earth resources observation and science eros center http glovis usgs gov 2 3 methods to test the stationarity of peak streamflows the most commonly used method the augmented dickey fuller test adf has been employed in this study dickey and fuller 1981 adf testing was applied to xiaolangdi station data to evaluate their stationarity using the following equation 1 δ s n α β t γ s t 1 j 1 p δ t δ s t 1 e t where δ s is the differenced peak streamflow series at a time lag of n years α is the drift β is the coefficient on a time trend γ is the process root coefficient p is the lag order of the autoregressive process δ t is the lag operator and e t is the independent and identically distributed residual term the adf test was implemented using matlab software for the peak streamflow at both annual and seasonal scales in this study the non parametric sen s slope method was used to detect the peak streamflow trends miao et al 2011 the estimation of sen s slope is obtained using the following equation 2 β m e d i a n x j x k j k where the estimator β is the median of all combinations of recorded pairs for the whole dataset and xj and xk are the data values at times j and k j k when β 0 the peak streamflow sequence shows an upward trend when β 0 there is no obvious trend in the peak streamflow sequence when β 0 the peak streamflow sequence shows a downward trend in this study we also conducted a step change analysis of the peak streamflows at xiaolangdi station there is no continuous time series of peak streamflow data and therefore the commonly used mutation point detection method cannot be applied to divide the time period following the division rules in the literature wang et al 2007 we have selected xiaolangdi dam s first year of operation as the division point for analyzing step changes the averaged peak streamflows of all periods were calculated for comparison it is well known that the peak discharge at huayuankou station is critical to flood control in the lower yellow river according to the regulations issued by the ministry of water resources of china discharge 4000 m3 s at huayuankou station can be identified as a flood event and two consecutive floods require an interval of 24 h gama et al 2014 in order to assess the influence of xiaolangdi dam on flood risk reduction in the lower yellow river we developed a data reconstruction approach to recreate the daily discharge at huayuankou station in the absence of xiaolangdi dam as can be seen in fig 1 the discharge of huayuankou station originates from the mainstream and tributaries qinhe river and yiluohe river which can be considered as the combined discharge of xiaolangdi wuzhi and heishiguan stations therefore the reconstruction of daily discharge at xiaolangdi station is the key to reconstructing the daily discharge at huayuankou station since there are no large tributaries between sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations the daily discharge regime of xiaolangdi station is synchronized with that of sanmenxia station when there is no impact from the reservoir however the operation of xiaolangdi dam has changed the discharge regime and the two stations are no longer synchronized nevertheless the operation of xiaolangdi dam exerts little impact on the total streamflow over the long term therefore we adopted the double mass curve method to determine the relationship between the discharges of xiaolangdi and sanmenxia stations the relationship obtained was used to reconstruct the daily discharge data of xiaolangdi station under the assumption that there was no xiaolangdi dam then we explored the relationship between the combined observed daily discharges of xiaolangdi wuzhi and heishiguan stations and the daily discharge of huayuankou station based on the relationship and the reconstructed daily discharge of xiaolangdi station the daily discharge of huayuankou station without the impact of xiaolangdi dam can be reconstructed 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical water control scheme of xiaolangdi dam after the dam started operating three regulation modes were designed during 2002 2004 for xiaolangdi reservoir kong et al 2015 the mainstream multiple reservoir joint operation scheme proved to be the most effective one and it was adopted in most years since 2004 the valve function water control scheme of xiaolangdi dam consists of pre release and refill operations fig 2 a the pre release operation is used to reduce the reservoir water level to provide adequate flood storage before large inflow occurs the refill operation was adopted to meet conservation demands during the flood recession period to systematically describe the operation scheme we will take the year 2006 as an example generally in the multiple mainstream reservoirs water started to be impounded at the end of the previous flood season it can be seen in fig 2b that most of the region of the xiaolangdi reservoir was filled with water 7 23 109 m3 by may 23 the water level was approximately 259 06 m which is much higher than the flood limited level by june 15 the wsrs was started at a constant water discharge rate of 3700 m3 s this process lasted for 19 days accompanied by a sharp drop in the water level by the end of that year s wsrs period on july 3 the water level of xiaolangdi reservoir decreased to 222 44 m which was below the flood limit level during the wsrs period a total of 5 45 109 m3 water was released from xiaolangdi reservoir accounting for about 21 of the total streamflow into the lower yellow river in 2006 after the pre release operation sufficient storage capacity of xiaolangdi reservoir was freed up for intercepting the high intensity water flow during the flood season which is reflected in the remote sensing image of july 18 it can be seen in fig 2b that xiaolangdi reservoir started to refill by later in august accompanying rapid rise of the water level for comparison we also derived the remote sensing images showing the morphology evolution of the location of xiaolangdi reservoir as shown in fig 2b obviously no visible morphology change happened before the construction of xiaolangdi dam since all discharge from sanmenxia reservoir could go directly through xiaolangdi station and flow downstream without any hindrance therefore the discharge evolution pattern at xiaolangdi station was synchronized with that of sanmenxia station during the pre dam period 3 2 multi scale impact on downstream streamflow typically downstream streamflow is heavily affected by dams and reservoirs and the effects are very complex because of the artificial regulation of discharge fig 3 a shows the variation of annual streamflow at sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations during 1950 2016 taking the construction of xiaolangdi reservoir in 1997 as the demarcation line there is a small difference in the consistency of the variation patterns between sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations before and after this date during 1950 1996 there is a good linear relationship between the annual streamflow of the two stations with a goodness of fit of 0 99 fig 3b however for 1997 2016 the goodness of fit of the linear relationship is slightly worse with r 2 falling to 0 88 fig 3c nevertheless the xiaolangdi dam exhibits little impact on the total streamflow in the long run which can be reflected in the double mass curves of the annual streamflow except for a minor difference in the slope there are excellent linear relationships between the cumulative annual streamflow of the two stations before and after the construction of xiaolangdi dam fig 3d and fig 3e however the downstream streamflow experiences more remarkable changes in daily flow regime due to the construction of xiaolangdi dam in general before dam construction the highest streamflow was in the flood season july october while the lowest streamflow was in the non flood season as shown in fig 4 the annual distribution of daily discharge at xiaolangdi station is very different in the pre dam and post dam periods the highest discharge shifted from the flood season to the dry month mainly in june due to dam construction the peak of the record during 1971 1989 occurred in 1976 with a peak discharge of 7920 m3 s while the peak of the record during 1997 2016 occurred in 2012 with a peak discharge of 4380 m3 s fig 4a the multi year average daily peak flow prior to xiaolangdi dam s construction 1971 1989 was 2449 m3 s fig 4b while it fell to 2212 m3 s after construction 1997 2016 fig 4c there were 58 days per year with multi year average daily discharge over 2000 m3 s during 1971 1989 while the number fell to only 7 days during 1997 2016 the average daily discharges of xiaolangdi station in the flood season and non flood season during 1971 1989 were 1909 m3 s and 759 m3 s respectively after xiaolangdi dam construction the average daily discharge values of xiaolangdi station in the flood season and non flood season were 711 m3 s and 663 m3 s respectively results of the data analysis reveal that the ratio of average daily discharge during non flood seasons to the average daily discharge during flood seasons at xiaolangdi station increases progressively from 39 8 during 1971 1989 to 93 2 during 1997 2016 this increase reflects the flow regulation intensity which largely favors water consumption in non flood seasons 3 3 impact on flood risk mitigation the construction of xiaolangdi dam has largely controlled the frequent floods on the lower reaches that are induced by monsoon rains the reservoir released more water before or during the early flood season and smaller amounts during flood season which can be seen from the change in the reservoir s water level as described in section 3 1 we conducted a series of adf tests of the peak streamflow to check their stationarity at annual and seasonal scales table s1 we found that the peak streamflow at xiaolangdi station is non stationary both annually and seasonally we next conducted a step change analysis of the peak streamflow of xiaolangdi station for the annual and seasonal scale fig 5 it can be seen that the annual average peak streamflow was 5097 m3 s before the construction of xiaolangdi dam while it decreased to 3259 m3 s after the dam s construction for the seasonal scale the average peak streamflows before the construction of xiaolangdi dam were 5097 m3 s and 2047 m3 s during flood season and non flood season respectively a difference of 3050 m3 s however the average peak streamflows after the construction of xiaolangdi dam have been almost at the same level during flood season 2722 m3 s and non flood season 2782 m3 s the peak streamflows during non flood season are even higher than they are during flood season this is mainly attributable to the operation of xiaolangdi dam since the seasonal precipitation changed little in this period these results are consistent with the results of sen s slope analysis of the overall peak streamflow at the xiaolangdi station table s1 we also conducted a monthly step change test fig s1 and found that the peak streamflow in most months after the construction of xiaolangdi dam was lower than it was before the construction of xiaolangdi dam in june alone during which the wsrs is implemented the peak streamflow exhibits a different trend this confirms that xiaolangdi dam has altered the distribution of peak streamflow at xiaolangdi station long term observations of daily water discharge at xiaolangdi station reveal that peak flow 4000 m3 s decreased dramatically from a total of 140 days during 1971 1989 to 15 days during 1997 2016 fig 4 peak flow 5000 m3 s vanished completely after the start of operation of xiaolangdi dam in 1999 since 2000 low flow 2000 m3 s dominates the discharge pattern of the xiaolangdi station most of the year and flow 2000 m3 s is mainly concentrated within the annual wsrs period often 20 days when the released artificial flood peak is confined to 4000 m3 s flood risk in the lower reach of the yellow river decreases significantly with discharge controlled by the xiaolangdi reservoir at huayuankou station pre dam discharge levels 1971 1989 show several flood peaks during the flood season with extreme peaks approaching 13 400 m3 s e g in 1982 after xiaolangdi reservoir was constructed flood peaks 4000 m3 s at huayuankou station were rarely observed in order to more intuitively evaluate the flood resistance of xiaolangdi dam we reconstructed the daily discharge at huayuankou station in the absence of xiaolangdi dam it can be seen from fig 6 a and fig 6c that there is an excellent linear relationship between the daily discharges of sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations during 1971 1989 however the daily discharge at xiaolangdi station is no longer synchronized with that of sanmenxia station after the construction of xiaolangdi dam this is reflected in the linear regression shown in fig 6b no significant linear relationship was found between the daily discharges of sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations during 1997 2016 nevertheless the cumulative daily streamflows of sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations exhibit a good linear relationship although there are local periodic fluctuations fig 6d subsequently this linear fitting relationship was adopted to reconstruct a theoretical daily discharge data series of xiaolangdi station under the scenario that xiaolangdi dam had never been built it can be seen in fig 7 a that there are many new flood peaks 4000 m3 s in the reconstructed daily discharge series of xiaolangdi station we next explored the relationship between the combined daily discharges of xiaolangdi wuzhi and heishiguan stations and the daily discharge of huayuankou station significant linear relationships were identified from the linear regression fig 7b and double mass curve fig 7c based on these relationships and the reconstructed daily discharge of xiaolangdi station the daily discharge of huayuankou station was reconstructed as shown in fig 7d it can be clearly seen in fig 7d that there were nine flood events a total of 28 days from the reconstructed daily discharge data of huayuankou station during 1997 2007 one of which even exceeded peak discharge of 6000 m3 s in 2005 in contrast there were only two flood events a total of 3 days identified from the observed data during 1997 2007 all the discharges of which were lower than 4500 m3 s this indicates that 78 of the potential flood events have been prevented the substantial reduction in flood events demonstrates the effective effect of the xiaolangdi dam on flood risk mitigation the most typical case is in 2003 where five probable flood events were prevented due to the operation of xiaolangdi dam 3 4 impact on water consumption as is well known there is a mismatch between water resource availability and population distribution in china especially in north china liu and xia 2004 the water resources in the yellow river region are insufficient for the 200 million people dwelling along the river and in the neighboring areas wang and liang 2000 therefore it is necessary to efficiently utilize the yellow river water and reduce the amount of water flowing into the ocean that is unavailable for human consumption with a water regulation capacity of 5 1 109 m3 xiaolangdi reservoir controls flooding during the rainy season and guarantees water supply during the low flow or dry season it can be seen in fig 8 a that surface water withdrawal has been exhibiting an increasing trend since the construction of xiaolangdi dam the water regulation scheme using the xiaolangdi dam has efficiently satisfied the increasing water demand without it large amounts of river water would be flowing into the ocean rather than being utilized by neighboring cities or villages during the rainy season and water resources would be tight during the dry season the ratio of surface water withdrawal in the sanmenxia huayuankou section and the huayuankou estuary section to total surface water withdrawal in the entire basin also increased during 1997 2019 fig 8b this indicates that the mismatch between water resources and the distribution of the population probably has been lessened due to the operation of water control measures using xiaolangdi dam in addition to adjusting seasonal water supply to meet demand xiaolangdi reservoir also effectively solves the problem of the river drying up during the dry season in the last three decades of the last century the lower yellow river often ran dry owing to a decline in precipitation and increased water consumption induced by population expansion peng and chen 2010 miao et al 2011 hydrological records from the lijin hydrological station indicate that the river seasonally ran dry for a total of 86 days during the 1970 s and 105 days during the 1980 s during the 1990 s the duration of drying up events surged to 901 days the most extreme drying up phenomenon occurred in 1997 when the river ran dry for 226 days and the dry riverbed length exceeded 700 km although the mean annual streamflow in the huayuankou station during 2000 2016 25 01 109 m3 was slightly lower than it was during the 1990 s 25 69 109 m3 the drying up crisis in the lower yellow river has vanished since xiaolangdi dam became operational 4 conclusions in this work the impact of xiaolangdi dam on water discharge of the yellow river has been investigated for multiple scales xiaolangdi dam exerts little impact on the total streamflow in the long run while it dramatically changes the seasonal distribution the ratio of average daily discharge during non flood seasons to the average daily discharge during flood seasons at xiaolangdi station increased to 93 2 during 1997 2016 flood risk in the lower reach of the yellow river decreased significantly due to the control of discharge by xiaolangdi reservoir through comparative analysis of the observed and reconstructed daily discharge series we found that 78 of the potential flood events were mitigated during 1997 2007 due to the construction and operation of xiaolangdi dam meanwhile the peak discharge at huayuankou station was also reduced from 6000 m3 s to 4500 m3 s the redistribution of seasonal discharge by xiaolangdi dam has not only been beneficial for meeting water demand but has also effectively solved the problem of the river drying up during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement dongxian kong conceptualization methodology software writing original

location and large watershed control area in many previous studies the influence of xiaolangdi dam and the corresponding xiaolangdi dam based water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs has been investigated from many perspectives wang et al 2017 kong et al 2022 after the start of operation of xiaolangdi dam the downstream channel converted from a siltation state to an erosion state with a total scouring volume of 1 60 109 m3 during 1999 2012 xia et al 2014 kong et al 2020 investigated the morphological change of the lower yellow river channel based on remote sensing image interpretation and found that sandbars in the upper reaches underwent degradation after the beginning of operation of xiaolangdi dam while the reverse was seen in the lower reaches yu et al 2013 noted that the wsrs produces 50 of the annual sediment delivery to the sea of which 60 derives from scoured coarse sediment from the riverbed of the lower reaches since the evolution of the yellow river delta is dependent on sediment delivery to the sea the cross basin influence of xiaolangdi dam on the delta has also been extensively discussed zhou et al 2015 most of the studies mentioned above focused mainly on the effect of xiaolangdi dam on sediment or sediment related issues wang et al 2006 investigated the impact of dams and reservoirs on the variation of the yellow river water discharge from 1950 to 2000 but the influence of xiaolangdi dam in this period has not yet been revealed many previous researchers have qualitatively quantitatively or semi quantitatively analyzed the influence of climate change and human activities on the variation in water discharge of the yellow river wang et al 2012a wang et al 2012b bao et al 2019 hu et al 2019 su et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 ma et al 2014 xu 2005 however no research has isolated the individual impact of xiaolangdi dam from either a qualitative or quantitative perspective here we provide a comprehensive assessment of xiaolangdi dam from the perspective of water flow regulation insights gained from this study will likely be of use to those considering options for future construction of large dams and reservoirs 2 study area data collection and methodology 2 1 study area xiaolangdi dam is located at the mouth of the final gorge in the middle reach of the yellow river approximately 130 km downstream of sanmenxia dam fig 1 the catchment area above xiaolangdi dam is 69 42 106 km2 which represents approximately 92 of the entire yellow river basin kong et al 2017 generally the whole mainstream between sanmenxia dam and xiaolangdi dam is considered the main body of the xiaolangdi reservoir fig 1b a lot of small river networks merge into the reservoir but there are no large tributaries between sanmenxia dam and xiaolangdi dam xiaolangdi dam first intercepted the yellow river in october 1997 which is regarded as the start time of the post dam period in this study stored water starting in october 1999 and was officially put into use in may 2000 the maximum water level is 275 m above sea level and the flood limited water level is 225 m above sea level fig 1c the total capacity of the reservoir is 12 65 109 m3 which includes 7 55 109 m3 for sediment storage and another 5 1 109 m3 allocated to flow regulation and electricity generation 2 2 data source annual water discharge and sediment load data for the period 1950 to 2016 were supplied by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc daily hydrological data of sanmenxia smx xiaolangdi xld and huayuankou hyk stations in the mainstream were also obtained from the yrcc for the periods 1971 to 1989 and 1997 to 2016 in addition daily hydrological data from wuzhi wz station on the qinhe river a yellow river tributary and heishiguan hsg station on the yiluohe river another tributary from 1997 to 2007 were also acquired from the yrcc unreasonable data points were manually excluded during the data checking process to ensure the quality and reliability of the data water level and water storage data of xiaolangdi reservoir were collected from the daily hydrological information released by the yrcc http www yrcc gov cn the drying up information was collected from yellow river yearbook and the literature cong et al 2009 liu and xia 2004 beniston 2006 remote sensing images were archived from the earth resources observation and science eros center http glovis usgs gov 2 3 methods to test the stationarity of peak streamflows the most commonly used method the augmented dickey fuller test adf has been employed in this study dickey and fuller 1981 adf testing was applied to xiaolangdi station data to evaluate their stationarity using the following equation 1 δ s n α β t γ s t 1 j 1 p δ t δ s t 1 e t where δ s is the differenced peak streamflow series at a time lag of n years α is the drift β is the coefficient on a time trend γ is the process root coefficient p is the lag order of the autoregressive process δ t is the lag operator and e t is the independent and identically distributed residual term the adf test was implemented using matlab software for the peak streamflow at both annual and seasonal scales in this study the non parametric sen s slope method was used to detect the peak streamflow trends miao et al 2011 the estimation of sen s slope is obtained using the following equation 2 β m e d i a n x j x k j k where the estimator β is the median of all combinations of recorded pairs for the whole dataset and xj and xk are the data values at times j and k j k when β 0 the peak streamflow sequence shows an upward trend when β 0 there is no obvious trend in the peak streamflow sequence when β 0 the peak streamflow sequence shows a downward trend in this study we also conducted a step change analysis of the peak streamflows at xiaolangdi station there is no continuous time series of peak streamflow data and therefore the commonly used mutation point detection method cannot be applied to divide the time period following the division rules in the literature wang et al 2007 we have selected xiaolangdi dam s first year of operation as the division point for analyzing step changes the averaged peak streamflows of all periods were calculated for comparison it is well known that the peak discharge at huayuankou station is critical to flood control in the lower yellow river according to the regulations issued by the ministry of water resources of china discharge 4000 m3 s at huayuankou station can be identified as a flood event and two consecutive floods require an interval of 24 h gama et al 2014 in order to assess the influence of xiaolangdi dam on flood risk reduction in the lower yellow river we developed a data reconstruction approach to recreate the daily discharge at huayuankou station in the absence of xiaolangdi dam as can be seen in fig 1 the discharge of huayuankou station originates from the mainstream and tributaries qinhe river and yiluohe river which can be considered as the combined discharge of xiaolangdi wuzhi and heishiguan stations therefore the reconstruction of daily discharge at xiaolangdi station is the key to reconstructing the daily discharge at huayuankou station since there are no large tributaries between sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations the daily discharge regime of xiaolangdi station is synchronized with that of sanmenxia station when there is no impact from the reservoir however the operation of xiaolangdi dam has changed the discharge regime and the two stations are no longer synchronized nevertheless the operation of xiaolangdi dam exerts little impact on the total streamflow over the long term therefore we adopted the double mass curve method to determine the relationship between the discharges of xiaolangdi and sanmenxia stations the relationship obtained was used to reconstruct the daily discharge data of xiaolangdi station under the assumption that there was no xiaolangdi dam then we explored the relationship between the combined observed daily discharges of xiaolangdi wuzhi and heishiguan stations and the daily discharge of huayuankou station based on the relationship and the reconstructed daily discharge of xiaolangdi station the daily discharge of huayuankou station without the impact of xiaolangdi dam can be reconstructed 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical water control scheme of xiaolangdi dam after the dam started operating three regulation modes were designed during 2002 2004 for xiaolangdi reservoir kong et al 2015 the mainstream multiple reservoir joint operation scheme proved to be the most effective one and it was adopted in most years since 2004 the valve function water control scheme of xiaolangdi dam consists of pre release and refill operations fig 2 a the pre release operation is used to reduce the reservoir water level to provide adequate flood storage before large inflow occurs the refill operation was adopted to meet conservation demands during the flood recession period to systematically describe the operation scheme we will take the year 2006 as an example generally in the multiple mainstream reservoirs water started to be impounded at the end of the previous flood season it can be seen in fig 2b that most of the region of the xiaolangdi reservoir was filled with water 7 23 109 m3 by may 23 the water level was approximately 259 06 m which is much higher than the flood limited level by june 15 the wsrs was started at a constant water discharge rate of 3700 m3 s this process lasted for 19 days accompanied by a sharp drop in the water level by the end of that year s wsrs period on july 3 the water level of xiaolangdi reservoir decreased to 222 44 m which was below the flood limit level during the wsrs period a total of 5 45 109 m3 water was released from xiaolangdi reservoir accounting for about 21 of the total streamflow into the lower yellow river in 2006 after the pre release operation sufficient storage capacity of xiaolangdi reservoir was freed up for intercepting the high intensity water flow during the flood season which is reflected in the remote sensing image of july 18 it can be seen in fig 2b that xiaolangdi reservoir started to refill by later in august accompanying rapid rise of the water level for comparison we also derived the remote sensing images showing the morphology evolution of the location of xiaolangdi reservoir as shown in fig 2b obviously no visible morphology change happened before the construction of xiaolangdi dam since all discharge from sanmenxia reservoir could go directly through xiaolangdi station and flow downstream without any hindrance therefore the discharge evolution pattern at xiaolangdi station was synchronized with that of sanmenxia station during the pre dam period 3 2 multi scale impact on downstream streamflow typically downstream streamflow is heavily affected by dams and reservoirs and the effects are very complex because of the artificial regulation of discharge fig 3 a shows the variation of annual streamflow at sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations during 1950 2016 taking the construction of xiaolangdi reservoir in 1997 as the demarcation line there is a small difference in the consistency of the variation patterns between sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations before and after this date during 1950 1996 there is a good linear relationship between the annual streamflow of the two stations with a goodness of fit of 0 99 fig 3b however for 1997 2016 the goodness of fit of the linear relationship is slightly worse with r 2 falling to 0 88 fig 3c nevertheless the xiaolangdi dam exhibits little impact on the total streamflow in the long run which can be reflected in the double mass curves of the annual streamflow except for a minor difference in the slope there are excellent linear relationships between the cumulative annual streamflow of the two stations before and after the construction of xiaolangdi dam fig 3d and fig 3e however the downstream streamflow experiences more remarkable changes in daily flow regime due to the construction of xiaolangdi dam in general before dam construction the highest streamflow was in the flood season july october while the lowest streamflow was in the non flood season as shown in fig 4 the annual distribution of daily discharge at xiaolangdi station is very different in the pre dam and post dam periods the highest discharge shifted from the flood season to the dry month mainly in june due to dam construction the peak of the record during 1971 1989 occurred in 1976 with a peak discharge of 7920 m3 s while the peak of the record during 1997 2016 occurred in 2012 with a peak discharge of 4380 m3 s fig 4a the multi year average daily peak flow prior to xiaolangdi dam s construction 1971 1989 was 2449 m3 s fig 4b while it fell to 2212 m3 s after construction 1997 2016 fig 4c there were 58 days per year with multi year average daily discharge over 2000 m3 s during 1971 1989 while the number fell to only 7 days during 1997 2016 the average daily discharges of xiaolangdi station in the flood season and non flood season during 1971 1989 were 1909 m3 s and 759 m3 s respectively after xiaolangdi dam construction the average daily discharge values of xiaolangdi station in the flood season and non flood season were 711 m3 s and 663 m3 s respectively results of the data analysis reveal that the ratio of average daily discharge during non flood seasons to the average daily discharge during flood seasons at xiaolangdi station increases progressively from 39 8 during 1971 1989 to 93 2 during 1997 2016 this increase reflects the flow regulation intensity which largely favors water consumption in non flood seasons 3 3 impact on flood risk mitigation the construction of xiaolangdi dam has largely controlled the frequent floods on the lower reaches that are induced by monsoon rains the reservoir released more water before or during the early flood season and smaller amounts during flood season which can be seen from the change in the reservoir s water level as described in section 3 1 we conducted a series of adf tests of the peak streamflow to check their stationarity at annual and seasonal scales table s1 we found that the peak streamflow at xiaolangdi station is non stationary both annually and seasonally we next conducted a step change analysis of the peak streamflow of xiaolangdi station for the annual and seasonal scale fig 5 it can be seen that the annual average peak streamflow was 5097 m3 s before the construction of xiaolangdi dam while it decreased to 3259 m3 s after the dam s construction for the seasonal scale the average peak streamflows before the construction of xiaolangdi dam were 5097 m3 s and 2047 m3 s during flood season and non flood season respectively a difference of 3050 m3 s however the average peak streamflows after the construction of xiaolangdi dam have been almost at the same level during flood season 2722 m3 s and non flood season 2782 m3 s the peak streamflows during non flood season are even higher than they are during flood season this is mainly attributable to the operation of xiaolangdi dam since the seasonal precipitation changed little in this period these results are consistent with the results of sen s slope analysis of the overall peak streamflow at the xiaolangdi station table s1 we also conducted a monthly step change test fig s1 and found that the peak streamflow in most months after the construction of xiaolangdi dam was lower than it was before the construction of xiaolangdi dam in june alone during which the wsrs is implemented the peak streamflow exhibits a different trend this confirms that xiaolangdi dam has altered the distribution of peak streamflow at xiaolangdi station long term observations of daily water discharge at xiaolangdi station reveal that peak flow 4000 m3 s decreased dramatically from a total of 140 days during 1971 1989 to 15 days during 1997 2016 fig 4 peak flow 5000 m3 s vanished completely after the start of operation of xiaolangdi dam in 1999 since 2000 low flow 2000 m3 s dominates the discharge pattern of the xiaolangdi station most of the year and flow 2000 m3 s is mainly concentrated within the annual wsrs period often 20 days when the released artificial flood peak is confined to 4000 m3 s flood risk in the lower reach of the yellow river decreases significantly with discharge controlled by the xiaolangdi reservoir at huayuankou station pre dam discharge levels 1971 1989 show several flood peaks during the flood season with extreme peaks approaching 13 400 m3 s e g in 1982 after xiaolangdi reservoir was constructed flood peaks 4000 m3 s at huayuankou station were rarely observed in order to more intuitively evaluate the flood resistance of xiaolangdi dam we reconstructed the daily discharge at huayuankou station in the absence of xiaolangdi dam it can be seen from fig 6 a and fig 6c that there is an excellent linear relationship between the daily discharges of sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations during 1971 1989 however the daily discharge at xiaolangdi station is no longer synchronized with that of sanmenxia station after the construction of xiaolangdi dam this is reflected in the linear regression shown in fig 6b no significant linear relationship was found between the daily discharges of sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations during 1997 2016 nevertheless the cumulative daily streamflows of sanmenxia and xiaolangdi stations exhibit a good linear relationship although there are local periodic fluctuations fig 6d subsequently this linear fitting relationship was adopted to reconstruct a theoretical daily discharge data series of xiaolangdi station under the scenario that xiaolangdi dam had never been built it can be seen in fig 7 a that there are many new flood peaks 4000 m3 s in the reconstructed daily discharge series of xiaolangdi station we next explored the relationship between the combined daily discharges of xiaolangdi wuzhi and heishiguan stations and the daily discharge of huayuankou station significant linear relationships were identified from the linear regression fig 7b and double mass curve fig 7c based on these relationships and the reconstructed daily discharge of xiaolangdi station the daily discharge of huayuankou station was reconstructed as shown in fig 7d it can be clearly seen in fig 7d that there were nine flood events a total of 28 days from the reconstructed daily discharge data of huayuankou station during 1997 2007 one of which even exceeded peak discharge of 6000 m3 s in 2005 in contrast there were only two flood events a total of 3 days identified from the observed data during 1997 2007 all the discharges of which were lower than 4500 m3 s this indicates that 78 of the potential flood events have been prevented the substantial reduction in flood events demonstrates the effective effect of the xiaolangdi dam on flood risk mitigation the most typical case is in 2003 where five probable flood events were prevented due to the operation of xiaolangdi dam 3 4 impact on water consumption as is well known there is a mismatch between water resource availability and population distribution in china especially in north china liu and xia 2004 the water resources in the yellow river region are insufficient for the 200 million people dwelling along the river and in the neighboring areas wang and liang 2000 therefore it is necessary to efficiently utilize the yellow river water and reduce the amount of water flowing into the ocean that is unavailable for human consumption with a water regulation capacity of 5 1 109 m3 xiaolangdi reservoir controls flooding during the rainy season and guarantees water supply during the low flow or dry season it can be seen in fig 8 a that surface water withdrawal has been exhibiting an increasing trend since the construction of xiaolangdi dam the water regulation scheme using the xiaolangdi dam has efficiently satisfied the increasing water demand without it large amounts of river water would be flowing into the ocean rather than being utilized by neighboring cities or villages during the rainy season and water resources would be tight during the dry season the ratio of surface water withdrawal in the sanmenxia huayuankou section and the huayuankou estuary section to total surface water withdrawal in the entire basin also increased during 1997 2019 fig 8b this indicates that the mismatch between water resources and the distribution of the population probably has been lessened due to the operation of water control measures using xiaolangdi dam in addition to adjusting seasonal water supply to meet demand xiaolangdi reservoir also effectively solves the problem of the river drying up during the dry season in the last three decades of the last century the lower yellow river often ran dry owing to a decline in precipitation and increased water consumption induced by population expansion peng and chen 2010 miao et al 2011 hydrological records from the lijin hydrological station indicate that the river seasonally ran dry for a total of 86 days during the 1970 s and 105 days during the 1980 s during the 1990 s the duration of drying up events surged to 901 days the most extreme drying up phenomenon occurred in 1997 when the river ran dry for 226 days and the dry riverbed length exceeded 700 km although the mean annual streamflow in the huayuankou station during 2000 2016 25 01 109 m3 was slightly lower than it was during the 1990 s 25 69 109 m3 the drying up crisis in the lower yellow river has vanished since xiaolangdi dam became operational 4 conclusions in this work the impact of xiaolangdi dam on water discharge of the yellow river has been investigated for multiple scales xiaolangdi dam exerts little impact on the total streamflow in the long run while it dramatically changes the seasonal distribution the ratio of average daily discharge during non flood seasons to the average daily discharge during flood seasons at xiaolangdi station increased to 93 2 during 1997 2016 flood risk in the lower reach of the yellow river decreased significantly due to the control of discharge by xiaolangdi reservoir through comparative analysis of the observed and reconstructed daily discharge series we found that 78 of the potential flood events were mitigated during 1997 2007 due to the construction and operation of xiaolangdi dam meanwhile the peak discharge at huayuankou station was also reduced from 6000 m3 s to 4500 m3 s the redistribution of seasonal discharge by xiaolangdi dam has not only been beneficial for meeting water demand but has also effectively solved the problem of the river drying up during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement dongxian kong conceptualization methodology software writing original

3656,proper identification of groundwater contaminant sources is vital to assess groundwater contamination however the majority of previous studies focuses on point source identification only a few works have been conducted for non point source parameter identification here we employ the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda to simultaneously identify the spatial architecture of non point contaminant sources and the related release information three different shapes of non point contaminant sources are considered an ellipse a circle and an irregular shape we test the applicability of the es mda for the simultaneous identification using three scenarios in a synthetic confined aquifer by assimilating concentration observations from all time steps multiple times the results demonstrate that the es mda is capable to accurately identify both regular and irregular non point contaminant source information the accuracy of the identification can be improved by increasing the number of iterations keywords non point contaminant source identification data assimilation ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation groundwater contamination concentration 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of fresh water for drinking and also for agricultural domestic and industrial uses barzegar et al 2017 the quality of groundwater may affect human health once it is contaminated it is important to determine where and when contaminants were introduced into the aquifer for this purpose contaminant source identification techniques are used groundwater contaminant sources can be broadly classified into two categories point and non point sources point sources are normally caused by landfills gas stations industry wastewater and urban sewage while non point ones are normally caused by agricultural fertilizers livestock poultry farming manure disposal and leakage from chemical plants it is a big challenge to identify a groundwater contaminant source from observations of the contaminants taken downgradient from the source ayvaz 2007 in many cases the pollution incident is random and accidental and the discovery of its impact has a lagging nature which makes difficult to determine the type properties source location intensity and release history of the contaminants these details are necessary for a proper site remediation design and risk assessment aral et al 2001 to date many approaches have been proposed for the identification of groundwater contamination sources a recent review paper by gómez hernández and xu 2021

et al 2009 only the paper by ayvaz 2016 addresses the problem of identifying an irregular areal source using a genetic algorithm with the limitation that the final shape must be made up by the juxtaposition of some aquifer discretization cells we propose to employ the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilations es mda to solve non point source identification problems the work is based on previous works by xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 where both the restart ensemble kalman filter r enkf and the es mda were shown as capable to identify point contaminant sources in synthetic and laboratory cases in this work we will explore the applicability of the es mda for the identification of the spatial architecture of irregular non point contaminant sources and their release history to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the es mda is used for the identification of non point contaminant source information this paper is organized as follows first we introduce the algorithmic description of the es mda second we test analyze and discuss the ability of the es mda for the identification of regular and irregular non point contaminant sources in a synthetic aquifer and we end with a summary and discussion 2 methodology the es mda developed by emerick and reynolds 2013 is an evolution of the ensemble smoother es proposed by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 to account for the non linearities of the state equation it blends the es with and iteration technique multiple data assimilation unlike the enkf which updates parameters by assimilating observations in time the es only makes a single update by assimilating all observations from all time steps at once hence the update is function of the covariances of all forecasted variables from all time steps and of the misfit of all observations and corresponding forecasts from all time steps since covariances only capture the linear relationship between two variates the es is best suited for linear problems it fails when the state transfer function is non linear e g crestani et al 2013 xu et al 2021 however the iterative application of the es with multiple data assimilation as proposed in the es mda results in multiple progressive parameter updates yielding excellent results for the non linear cases in this work the es mda will be used to identify the parameters defining the spatial architecture of a non point source and the corresponding release parameters including initial release time ti t release duration δ t t and mass loading rate m mt 1 by assimilating observed concentrations c ml 3 from all time steps at a number of locations we assume that the shape of the non point source area can be approximated by an ellipse hence the parameters describing the spatial architecture of the non point source include the x and y coordinates of the center point of the ellipse xs l and ys l its semi major and semi minor axes ra l and rb l and the ellipse clockwise rotation angle b from the x axis we build an augmented model parameter vector s including all the above parameters 1 s xs ys ra rb b ti δ t m like the es the es mda also consists of two steps forecast and analysis first we set the total number of assimilation iterations to na then in the forecast step at iteration j concentrations for all time steps c j f are computed using the last update of the model parameters in vector s j 1 a the initial concentrations c 0 and a solute transport model ψ the forecast equation is 2 c j f ψ c 0 s j 1 a in the analysis step at iteration j the augmented model parameter vector s j a is updated accounting for the misfit c o a j ε j c j f o between forecasted c j f o and observed c o concentrations for all time steps the update equation is 3 s j a s j 1 a k j c o a j ε j c j f o with 4 k j d sc j d cc j a j r 1 where ε j is the observation error with mean zero and covariance r amplified by a non increasing error variance inflation coefficient a j which should satisfy i 1 n a 1 a i 1 emerick and reynolds 2013 in this work we have chosen a j na for all iterations k j is the kalman gain a function of cross covariances d sc j between parameters and forecasted concentrations at observation locations for all time steps and auto covariance d cc j between forecasted concentrations at the observation locations obtained for all time steps 3 application a synthetic confined aquifer is constructed and discretized into 80 by 80 by 1 cells each cell being 10 l by 10 l by 80 l notice that all magnitudes will be unit free any set of consistent units with the given values will provide the results shown a reference log conductivity field fig 1 is generated using the gcosim3d code gómez hernández and journel 1993 a sequential multivariate multi gaussian simulation code using the parameters in table 1 the boundary conditions shown in fig 1 are set as follows north and south boundaries are impermeable west and east boundaries are prescribed heads with values of 300 l and 80 l respectively the initial concentration is zero ml 3 throughout the domain the rest of the parameters controlling transport simulation are homogeneous and take the following values porosity 0 3 longitudinal dispersively 3 0 l transverse to longitudinal dispersivity ratio 0 5 there are 30 observation wells and 2 verification wells within the domain see fig 2 we have analyzed three different contaminant events with sources of different shapes as shown in fig 2 an ellipse a circle and an elongated wiggly shape the values of the parameters describing the shapes are given in table 2 we assume that groundwater flow is at steady state the total simulation time is 10950 t the transport model is run for this time in 100 equal sized time steps the length of each time step is therefore 109 5 t the contaminant enters the aquifer at time 985 5 t around the 10 th time step and ends at time 3285 0 t around the 30 th time step with a constant mass loading rate of 1000 mt 1 the release duration is 2299 5 t around 20 time steps the concentrations have been recorded in the reference field at observation wells at each time step until the 50 th time step around 5475 t and are used as the observation data for the source identification problem here the observation error mean is equal to zero and the variance is equal to 0 01 in this work we only consider advection and dispersion as transport mechanisms the transport equation is zheng 2010 5 θ c t θ d m α v c θ vc q s c s where c is the contaminant concentration ml 3 t is the simulation time t is the divergence operator θ is the effective porosity d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2t 1 α is the dispersivity tensor l

velocity vector lt 1 related to the hydraulic head h through v k h θ where h can be calculated by solving the groundwater steady state equation 6 k h w 0 where w denotes sources and sinks per unit volume lt 1 the numerical transport simulator mt3dms e g zheng 2010 ma et al 2012 is used to solve the transport equation and the numerical groundwater flow simulator modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 is used to solve this equation the steady state head field for the reference field is shown in fig 1 flow is mainly from west to east and so is the spreading of the contaminant plume the objective of the work is to test the capacity of the es mda in the identification of non point contaminant sources for the three scenarios an ellipse is used as the best shape approximating the true source in all three scenarios the initial release time the release duration and the mass loading to be identified are the same see table 2 note that to test the need of multiple assimilation of the observation we show the results after the 1 st 2 nd 4 th and 6 th iterations the location of the three true contaminant source areas is shown in fig 2 and the corresponding contaminant plumes in the reference at the 10 th 30 th and 50 th time steps are shown in fig 3 it is important to note that the differences among the three plumes are not too large which will make difficult for the es mda to correctly identify each source shape an ensemble of 500 8 tuplets for the source parameters is generated each 8 tuplet stores 8 values drawn independently from the following uniform distributions with a wide range around the true values x coordinate of center point of ellipse xs u 110 210 y coordinate of center point of ellipse ys u 460 560 semi major axis of ellipse ra u 40 140 semi minor axis of

these uniform distributions 4 results figs 4 6 show boxplots for all the 8 contaminant source parameters for the three scenarios before any updating and after updating at the 1 st 2 nd 4 th and 6 th assimilation iteration the reference parameter values are omitted for b in s2 circle source and for xs ys ra rb and b in s3 irregular source we can see the large uncertainties of the initial source parameter values and how these uncertainties reduce as the number of assimilation iterations increases with the median of the updated ensembles almost matching the target value after 4 iterations the only parameter that is not almost exactly reproduced by the ensemble median of the updated parameters is the mass loading rate m for scenario s3 for which the final update underestimates the reference value this underestimation of m for scenario s3 is because the area of the assimilated ellipse is larger than the area of the irregular source in s3 as will be discussed below recall that an ellipse is used to approximate all sources including the irregular source area consequently the total mass introduced in the aquifer is well estimated for s3 figs 7 9 show the average absolute bias aab and the ensemble spread esp of the ensemble values of the source parameters for all three scenarios here the aab is used to evaluate the accuracy of the updated source parameters by calculating the average absolute discrepancy between the final updated ensemble values and the true values while the esp is to measure the precision of the updated source parameters by calculating the root square of the ensemble variance the expressions of the aab and the esp are 7 aab 1 n r j 1 n r s j s ref 8 esp σ s 2 where n r is the number of realizations s ref is the reference source parameter value s j is the source parameter value for the j th realization in the ensemble and σ s 2 is the ensemble variance of the source parameters the aab has not been computed for those parameters for which their reference value is undefined an analysis of the figures shows how both aab and esp decrease as the number of assimilation iterations increases reaching a value close to zero at iteration 6 indicating that the es mda has retrieved successfully the source parameters with great accuracy and precision notice also that the ratio esp aab is close to 1 for almost all parameters and all iterations an indication that the smoother is performing well without any filter inbreeding figs 10 and 11 display a statistic about the shape of the source it measures the probability that the source is at a given location this probability is approximated cell by cell by the fraction of realizations in which the source is present 9 p i 1 n r j 1 n r i j i where p i is the probability that the source is present at a cell i and i j i is an indicator function valued 1 if the source is present at cell i for realization j 0 if not fig 10 only displays one map since the ensemble of initial ellipses is the same for all three scenarios whereas fig 11 shows the evolution for each scenario as observations are assimilated in the three scenarios we can notice how the initial ensemble and the first iterations display considerable uncertainty about the location of the source uncertainty that disappears at iteration six where the area of probability 1 identifies almost perfectly the source only s3 with the irregular shape source shows some uncertainty at the edges of the ellipse besides analyzing how well the source parameters are identified by the es mda it is important to analyze how well transport is reproduced with the updated parameters given the very large accuracy and precision of the final estimates it can be anticipated that this reproduction will be very good fig 12 shows the time evolution of contaminant concentrations at the two verification wells 1 and 2 for all scenarios computed with the initial ensemble same for all three scenarios figs 13 and 14 show the time evolution of contaminant concentrations at the two verification wells 1 and 2 for all scenarios computed with the ensembles of updated contaminant source parameters for each scenario after the 1 st 2 st 4 st and 6 th assimilation iterations respectively similarly to what happens with the identification of the source area uncertainties about predicted concentrations are very large with the initial ensemble of parameters and during the first iterations but this uncertainty reduces considerably after six iterations up to the point that the 90 confidence interval almost collapses onto of the reference concentrations figs 15 17 show the contaminant plume in realization 300 top row the ensemble mean middle row and the ensemble variance bottom row of all plumes at the 10 th 30 th and 30 th simulation time steps for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 respectively the plumes are computed using the updated source parameters after the 6 th assimilation iteration as expected when compared with the reference contaminant plumes in fig 3 the shapes and spatial distribution of solute concentrations are well reproduced 5 summary and discussion the main objective of this work is to analyze the capacity of the es mda for the identification of non point contaminant sources we have demonstrated that the es mda is capable to identify the shape of the source area approximated as an ellipse which is defined with five geometrical parameters the initial release time the release duration and the mass loading rate in three scenarios using an elliptical circular and irregular shape source we have shown that the ellipse can not only characterize the regular source area ellipse and circle but also successfully approximate the irregular source area however when we use the ellipse to approximate the irregular source area the final estimate may give an ellipse covering some extra nodes and in order to conserve mass the mass load rate is underestimated besides we also demonstrate that increasing the number of data assimilation iterations is very helpful to improve the performance of the es mda for the purpose of identifying the source but at the cost of higher computation although we have successfully demonstrated the ability of the es mda for the non point contaminant source identification there is still a long way until it could be applied in practice the next step is to couple the identification of the source with that of the underlying heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivities and then to devise a technique that can be applied to the identification of truly irregular shapes furthermore we will test the effect of the ensemble size and employ the covariance localization and covariance inflation techniques to eliminate the effect of spurious correlations and inbreeding which are common for small ensemble sizes credit authorship contribution statement teng xu conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft wenjun zhang methodology investigation formal analysis

3656,proper identification of groundwater contaminant sources is vital to assess groundwater contamination however the majority of previous studies focuses on point source identification only a few works have been conducted for non point source parameter identification here we employ the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda to simultaneously identify the spatial architecture of non point contaminant sources and the related release information three different shapes of non point contaminant sources are considered an ellipse a circle and an irregular shape we test the applicability of the es mda for the simultaneous identification using three scenarios in a synthetic confined aquifer by assimilating concentration observations from all time steps multiple times the results demonstrate that the es mda is capable to accurately identify both regular and irregular non point contaminant source information the accuracy of the identification can be improved by increasing the number of iterations keywords non point contaminant source identification data assimilation ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation groundwater contamination concentration 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of fresh water for drinking and also for agricultural domestic and industrial uses barzegar et al 2017 the quality of groundwater may affect human health once it is contaminated it is important to determine where and when contaminants were introduced into the aquifer for this purpose contaminant source identification techniques are used groundwater contaminant sources can be broadly classified into two categories point and non point sources point sources are normally caused by landfills gas stations industry wastewater and urban sewage while non point ones are normally caused by agricultural fertilizers livestock poultry farming manure disposal and leakage from chemical plants it is a big challenge to identify a groundwater contaminant source from observations of the contaminants taken downgradient from the source ayvaz 2007 in many cases the pollution incident is random and accidental and the discovery of its impact has a lagging nature which makes difficult to determine the type properties source location intensity and release history of the contaminants these details are necessary for a proper site remediation design and risk assessment aral et al 2001 to date many approaches have been proposed for the identification of groundwater contamination sources a recent review paper by gómez hernández and xu 2021 analyzes close of 160 papers published since 1981 most of the approaches fall in the realm of inverse modeling which has been used successfully in hydrogeology for other purposes e g xu et al 2013

classified into three categories according to their characteristics optimization probabilistic and backward in time simulation approaches optimization approaches have been used since early on gorelick et al 1983 they seek minimizing the differences between simulated concentrations and measurement observations e g gorelick et al 1983 sidauruk et al 1998 sun et al 2006 sun et al 2006 mirghani et al

published can also be classified in three categories as a function of how the source is treated during the identification process identification of the release history with known source locations e g gorelick et al 1983 skaggs and kabala 1994 atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 mahar and datta 2000 identification only of the source location s e g dimov et al 1996 neupauer and wilson 1999 simultaneous

papers have addressed the problem of identifying a non point source most of them limit themselves to the identification of the corners of a rectangle or a prism e g mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 jin et al 2009 only the paper by ayvaz 2016 addresses the problem of identifying an irregular areal source using a genetic algorithm with the limitation that the final shape must be made up by the juxtaposition of some aquifer discretization cells we propose to employ the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilations es mda to solve non point source identification problems the work is based on previous works by xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 where both the restart ensemble kalman filter r enkf and the es mda were shown as capable to identify point contaminant sources in synthetic and laboratory cases in this work we will explore the applicability of the es mda for the identification of the spatial architecture of irregular non point contaminant sources and their release history to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the es mda is used for the identification of non point contaminant source information this paper is organized as follows first we introduce the algorithmic description of the es mda second we test analyze and discuss the ability of the es mda for the identification of regular and irregular non point contaminant sources in a synthetic aquifer and we end with a summary and discussion 2 methodology the es mda developed by emerick and reynolds 2013 is an evolution of the ensemble smoother es proposed by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 to account for the non linearities of the state equation it blends the es with and iteration technique multiple data assimilation unlike the enkf which updates parameters by assimilating observations in time the es only makes a single update by assimilating all observations from all time steps at once hence the update is function of the covariances of all forecasted variables from all time steps and of the misfit of all observations and corresponding forecasts from all time steps since covariances only capture the linear relationship between two variates the es is best suited for linear problems it fails when the state transfer function is non linear e g crestani et al 2013 xu et al 2021 however the iterative application of the es with multiple data assimilation as proposed in the es mda results in multiple progressive parameter updates yielding excellent results for the non linear cases in this work the es mda will be used to identify the parameters defining the spatial architecture of a non point source and the corresponding release parameters including initial release time ti t release duration δ t t and mass loading rate m mt 1 by assimilating observed concentrations c ml 3 from all time steps at a number of locations we assume that the shape of the non point source area can be approximated by an ellipse hence the parameters describing the spatial architecture of the non point source include the x and y coordinates of the center point of the ellipse xs l and ys l its semi major and semi minor axes ra l and rb l and the ellipse clockwise rotation angle b from the x axis we build an augmented model parameter vector s including all the above parameters 1 s xs ys ra rb b ti δ t m like the es the es mda also consists of two steps forecast and analysis first we set the total number of assimilation iterations to na then in the forecast step at iteration j concentrations for all time steps c j f are computed using the last update of the model parameters in vector s j 1 a the initial concentrations c 0 and a solute transport model ψ the forecast equation is 2 c j f ψ c 0 s j 1 a in the analysis step at iteration j the augmented model parameter vector s j a is updated accounting for the misfit c o a j ε j c j f o between forecasted c j f o and observed c o concentrations for all time steps the update equation is 3 s j a s j 1 a k j c o a j ε j c j f o with 4 k j d sc j d cc j a j r 1 where ε j is the observation error with mean zero and covariance r amplified by a non increasing error variance inflation coefficient a j which should satisfy i 1 n a 1 a i 1 emerick and reynolds 2013 in this work we have chosen a j na for all iterations k j is the kalman gain a function of cross covariances d sc j between parameters and forecasted concentrations at observation locations for all time steps and auto covariance d cc j between forecasted concentrations at the observation locations obtained for all time steps 3 application a synthetic confined aquifer is constructed and discretized into 80 by 80 by 1 cells each cell being 10 l by 10 l by 80 l notice that all magnitudes will be unit free any set of consistent units with the given values will provide the results shown a reference log conductivity field fig 1 is generated using the gcosim3d code gómez hernández and journel 1993 a sequential multivariate multi gaussian simulation code using the parameters in table 1 the boundary conditions shown in fig 1 are set as follows north and south boundaries are impermeable west and east boundaries are prescribed heads with values of 300 l and 80 l respectively the initial concentration is zero ml 3 throughout the domain the rest of the parameters controlling transport simulation are homogeneous and take the following values porosity 0 3 longitudinal dispersively 3 0 l transverse to longitudinal dispersivity ratio 0 5 there are 30 observation wells and 2 verification wells within the domain see fig 2 we have analyzed three different contaminant events with sources of different shapes as shown in fig 2 an ellipse a circle and an elongated wiggly shape the values of the parameters describing the shapes are given in table 2 we assume that groundwater flow is at steady state the total simulation time is 10950 t the transport model is run for this time in 100 equal sized time steps the length of each time step is therefore 109 5 t the contaminant enters the aquifer at time 985 5 t around the 10 th time step and ends at time 3285 0 t around the 30 th time step with a constant mass loading rate of 1000 mt 1 the release duration is 2299 5 t around 20 time steps the concentrations have been recorded in the reference field at observation wells at each time step until the 50 th time step around 5475 t and are used as the observation data for the source identification problem here the observation error mean is equal to zero and the variance is equal to 0 01 in this work we only consider advection and dispersion as transport mechanisms the transport equation is zheng 2010 5 θ c t θ d m α v c θ vc q s c s where c

volume lt 1 the numerical transport simulator mt3dms e g zheng 2010 ma et al 2012 is used to solve the transport equation and the numerical groundwater flow simulator modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 is used to solve this equation the steady state head field for the reference field is shown in fig 1 flow is mainly from west to east and so is the spreading of the contaminant plume the objective of the work is to test the capacity of the es mda in the identification of non point contaminant sources for the three scenarios an ellipse is used as the best shape approximating the true source in all three scenarios the initial release time the release duration and the mass loading to be identified are the same see table 2 note that to test the need of multiple assimilation of the observation we show the results after the 1 st 2 nd 4 th and 6 th iterations the location of the three true contaminant source areas is shown in fig 2 and the corresponding contaminant plumes in the reference at the 10 th 30 th and 50 th time steps are shown in fig 3 it is important to note that the differences among the three plumes are not too large which will make difficult for the es mda to correctly identify each source shape an ensemble of 500 8 tuplets for the source parameters is generated each 8 tuplet stores 8 values drawn independently from the following uniform distributions with a wide range around the true values x coordinate of center point of ellipse xs u 110 210 y coordinate of center point of ellipse ys u 460 560 semi major axis of ellipse ra u 40 140 semi minor axis of

these uniform distributions 4 results figs 4 6 show boxplots for all the 8 contaminant source parameters for the three scenarios before any updating and after updating at the 1 st 2 nd 4 th and 6 th assimilation iteration the reference parameter values are omitted for b in s2 circle source and for xs ys ra rb and b in s3 irregular source we can see the large uncertainties of the initial source parameter values and how these uncertainties reduce as the number of assimilation iterations increases with the median of the updated ensembles almost matching the target value after 4 iterations the only parameter that is not almost exactly reproduced by the ensemble median of the updated parameters is the mass loading rate m for scenario s3 for which the final update underestimates the reference value this underestimation of m for scenario s3 is because the area of the assimilated ellipse is larger than the area of the irregular source in s3 as will be discussed below recall that an ellipse is used to approximate all sources including the irregular source area consequently the total mass introduced in the aquifer is well estimated for s3 figs 7 9 show the average absolute bias aab and the ensemble spread esp of the ensemble values of the source parameters for all three scenarios here the aab is used to evaluate the accuracy of the updated source parameters by calculating the average absolute discrepancy between the final updated ensemble values and the true values while the esp is to measure the precision of the updated source parameters by calculating the root square of the ensemble variance the expressions of the aab and the esp are 7 aab 1 n r j 1 n r s j s ref 8 esp σ s 2 where n r is the number of realizations s ref is the reference source parameter value s j is the source parameter value for the j th realization in the ensemble and σ s 2 is the ensemble variance of the source parameters the aab has not been computed for those parameters for which their reference value is undefined an analysis of the figures shows how both aab and esp decrease as the number of assimilation iterations increases reaching a value close to zero at iteration 6 indicating that the es mda has retrieved successfully the source parameters with great accuracy and precision notice also that the ratio esp aab is close to 1 for almost all parameters and all iterations an indication that the smoother is performing well without any filter inbreeding figs 10 and 11 display a statistic about the shape of the source it measures the probability that the source is at a given location this probability is approximated cell by cell by the fraction of realizations in which the source is present 9 p i 1 n r j 1 n r i j i where p i is the probability that the source is present at a cell i and i j i is an indicator function valued 1 if the source is present at cell i for realization j 0 if not fig 10 only displays one map since the ensemble of initial ellipses is the same for all three scenarios whereas fig 11 shows the evolution for each scenario as observations are assimilated in the three scenarios we can notice how the initial ensemble and the first iterations display considerable uncertainty about the location of the source uncertainty that disappears at iteration six where the area of probability 1 identifies almost perfectly the source only s3 with the irregular shape source shows some uncertainty at the edges of the ellipse besides analyzing how well the source parameters are identified by the es mda it is important to analyze how well transport is reproduced with the updated parameters given the very large accuracy and precision of the final estimates it can be anticipated that this reproduction will be very good fig 12 shows the time evolution of contaminant concentrations at the two verification wells 1 and 2 for all scenarios computed with the initial ensemble same for all three scenarios figs 13 and 14 show the time evolution of contaminant concentrations at the two verification wells 1 and 2 for all scenarios computed with the ensembles of updated contaminant source parameters for each scenario after the 1 st 2 st 4 st and 6 th assimilation iterations respectively similarly to what happens with the identification of the source area uncertainties about predicted concentrations are very large with the initial ensemble of parameters and during the first iterations but this uncertainty reduces considerably after six iterations up to the point that the 90 confidence interval almost collapses onto of the reference concentrations figs 15 17 show the contaminant plume in realization 300 top row the ensemble mean middle row and the ensemble variance bottom row of all plumes at the 10 th 30 th and 30 th simulation time steps for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 respectively the plumes are computed using the updated source parameters after the 6 th assimilation iteration as expected when compared with the reference contaminant plumes in fig 3 the shapes and spatial distribution of solute concentrations are well reproduced 5 summary and discussion the main objective of this work is to analyze the capacity of the

3657,in cave environments water vapor condensation occurs naturally when warmer wet air masses flow close to colder cave surfaces artificial microclimate perturbations in show caves can enhance this process leading to potential deterioration of rock art and degradation of speleothems here we investigate the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of condensation water in altamira cave cantabria northern spain to evaluate the potential of stable isotopes in the study of condensation mechanisms in caves we assess the role of cave ventilation in the spatiotemporal isotopic variability of condensation water in altamira cave to this end water drops that condense naturally on artificial supports in different parts of the cave were collected for 7 years and their isotopic compositions δ17o δ18o δd and derived parameters 17o excess and d excess were compared to those of droplets with no apparent dripping taken from the cave ceiling i e presumably condensation water and fast dripping points i e infiltration water during the same period condensation waters in the outmost cave sectors closer to the entrance show higher δ17o δ18o and δd values during the cave ventilation period june to october compared to the rest of the year this seasonal pattern can be explained by changes in the contributions of two moisture sources for condensation advection of allochthonous water vapor from outside during the cave ventilation period and recycling of autochthonous vapor generated from cave dripwater during the stagnation period in contrast the isotopic values of condensation waters in the inner cave sectors are similar to those of infiltration water with insignificant seasonal variability this suggests that water condensation in the inner cave sectors is sourced by autochthonous vapor with no significant contributions of external moisture even during the cave ventilation period we conclude that allochthonous water vapor condenses preferentially in the entrance hall and does not affect significantly the rest of the cave these results are relevant for the management of altamira cave and for future investigations on condensation mechanisms in cavities elsewhere keywords cave

plates sarbu and lascu 1997 lysimeters and metallic devices dublyansky and dublyansky 1998 gázquez et al 2015a 2017b and refrigerated containers tarhule lips and ford 1998 liñán et al 2021 in order to quantify the magnitude of these mechanisms electrical devices coupled to data loggers have been utilized also to quantify condensation in caves de freitas and schmekal 2006 in addition indirect measurements of the effects of condensation have been conducted by monitoring weight loss of rock tablets calaforra 1996 klimchouk 1996 tarhule lips and ford 1998 klimchouk and aksem 2002 white et al 2021 using micro erosion meter measurements of cave surface retreatment calaforra et al 1993 klimchouk 1996 gázquez et al 2015a and determining thickness and age of weathering rinds auler and smart 2004 indirect estimates of condensation evaporation can be also obtained from microclimate monitoring of cave atmosphere and rock temperatures de freitas and schmekal 2003 fernández cortés et al 2006 furthermore theoretical approaches to the condensation mechanisms in caves have been developed in the last decades dreybrodt et al 2005 gabrovšek et al 2010 more recently thermal image analyses have been used to quantify condensation evaporation processes in caves liñán et al 2021 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes composition of water 18o 16o and 2h 1h or δ18o and δd respectively when standardized to the international water standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow has been widely used to track a variety of processes in the hydrosphere bowen et al 2019 and references therein including recent preliminary studies of condensation water in caves by liñán et al 2021 these authors found that condensation waters in nerja cave southern spain display higher δ18o and δd values and lower d excess values during the cave ventilation periods than during the rest of the year this seasonal pattern was attributed to the impact of evaporation on condensation water which takes place during the cave ventilation period because of low relative humidity in the cave atmosphere 60 80 in addition to the traditional measurements of δ18o and δd in waters recent analytical advances have permitted obtaining precise measurements of the triple oxygen isotope composition δ17o and δ18o barkan and luz 2005 steig et al 2014 the δ17o deviations with respect to the δ17o δ18o global meteoric water line gmwl which has a proposed slope of 0 528 are expressed as 17o excess 17o excess ln δ17o 1000 1 0 528 ln δ18o 1000 1 luz and barkan 2010 this reference slope is commonly used to express triple oxygen deviation in the hydrological cycle aron et al 2021 surma et al 2021 the 17o excess parameter in rainfall has been found to be sensitive to variations in relative humidity at the moisture source with smaller temperature dependence than d excess d excess δd 8 δ18o barkan and luz 2005 2007 luz and barkan 2010 uechi and uemura 2019 likewise other parameters including raindrop re evaporation and moisture recycling during water vapor transport can modulates the final 17o excess signal of rainwater tian et al 2018 giménez et al 2021 thus measuring the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of water can help to track environmental conditions e g temperature vs relative humidity during water phase changes and during transport of water vapor masses aron et al 2021 surma et al 2021 here we conducted a 7 years monitoring study of stable isotopes δ17o δ18o δ2h and derived parameters d excess and 17o excess in condensation water and dripwater in altamira cave we aim to identify isotopic differences between seepage and condensation water in order to assess whether the numerous droplets observed in the ceiling of the polychrome hall of altamira cave are associated with either condensation or infiltration water in addition we investigate the origin of vapor for water condensation and the spatiotemporal pattern of the condensation mechanisms in this cave to this end we analyzed waters deposited on artificial supports in several locations of the cavity as well as dripwater from fast drips i e discharge point related to seepage of meteoric water and ceiling droplets with no apparent dripping presumably associated with water condensation in the polychrome hall the microclimate characteristics related to cave atmosphere ventilation air temperature relative humidity and co2 content were monitored during the length of the study in order to characterize the parameters that control the cave ventilation pattern and to identify connections with the condensation processes we use an isotopic mixing model to demonstrate that different sources of water vapor contribute to condensation water in altamira cave and that the relevance of these sources change temporally and spatially 2 setting and cave description altamira cave 43o22 37 n 4o07 11 w is located near the village of santillana del mar cantabria northern spain at an elevation of 152 m a s l and 4 5 km from the cantabrian sea the cavern runs nw se and has developed along a subhorizontal sequence of cenomanian turonian marine carbonates hoyos et al 1981 where the difference in level between the entrance and its deepest part grave hall is barely 26 m several cave sections can be distinguished according to their morphology and distance depth from the entrance the entrance hall is a 20 m long horizontal hall from there access to the rest of the cave is via an artificial door located in a narrow passage 2 m wide beyond the cave divides along two branches to the east is the polychrome hall 15 m long 7 m wide and up to 3 m high and lying about 2 m lower than the cave entrance the other branch gives access to the walls hall roughly 50 m in length 20 m wide and up to 7 m high located 6 m below the entrance a passage roughly 60 m long runs se ne into the great hall from here artificial stairs carved in the rock lead to the grave hall lying 15 m below the cave entrance and containing an ephemeral water pool that only appears during periods of high dripwater discharge to the south along a 10 m long passage lies the shower hall this in turn leads into the well hall at the depth of 12 m beneath the cave entrance finally there is a meandriform sub horizontal passage called the horsetail approximately 40 m long that represents the innermost cave area the thickness of the cap rock overlaying the cave varies from 2 to 18 m elez et al 2013 fig 1 there is no permanent running watercourse inside the cave the climate in this region is oceanic cfb climate type according to the köppen climate classification the rainfall is generally abundant exceeding 1 000 mm year july is the driest month 30 mm on average and the rainiest period occurs from october to december fig 2 the mean external air temperatures are minimum in january 9 c and maximum in july 21 c the vegetation coverage over the cave is dominated by grasses with minor presence of scrubs and trees fig 1a altamira cave has a relatively stable microclimate with air temperatures that vary 2 c throughout the year in the innermost areas well hall and horsetail and up to 5 c in the outermost part of the cave entrance hall gázquez et al 2016 the mean temperature in the polychrome hall during the period of study was 14 2 0 5 c maximum value of 15 c and minimum value of 13 2 c the air temperature and ventilation regime of altamira cave are fundamentally controlled by the annual thermal oscillations of the outside air temperature and the water saturation of the epikarst and the soil over the cave cuezva et al 2011 the outside temperature oscillations are transmitted into the cave through the rock which attenuates its amplitude and causes a lag between the outer thermal wave and the temperature of the subterranean atmosphere elez et al 2013 consequently the cave ventilation period occurs in summer june to october while the cave stagnation period takes place in winter november to may the annual variation of in cave air temperature exhibits a sinusoidal pattern with a thermal lag time 2 months on average between the innermost and outermost cave areas that depends on the outside temperature and the thickness of the rock over the different cave sectors cuezva et al 2011 quindós et al 1987 sainz et al 2018 3 methods we assess the spatial gradient and temporal variability of the isotopic composition of condensation water and dripwater as well as cave environmental parameters air temperature relative humidity and co2 content in altamira cave by monitoring and repeatedly sampling from the cave entrance to more stable locations deeper within the cave 3 1 water sampling from november 2014 to march 2017 condensation water that accumulates on a metallic door that separates the entrance hall and the rest of the cave site c1 in fig 1 was collected using disposable pipets 200 μl n 11 from march 2017 to october 2020 sampling was conducted approximately every two weeks in the same location but condensation was collected from the metal support of a thermometer that is 1 m apart from the door in addition condensation water from two inner cave locations sites c2 and c3 in fig 1 was collected from metal supports of thermometers using the same method from march 2017 to august 2020 water samples were stored at 4 c in 2 ml glass tubes provided with a micro insert 300 μl thermo fisher n 10376102 and capped with silicone septum caps a total of 76 surveys were conducted and a total of 192 condensation water samples from artificial supports were collected dripwater samples from a relatively fast discharge point maximum of 143 ml day mean of 61 21 ml day in the polychrome hall site d1 in fig 1 were collected approximately every two weeks between march 2017 and august 2020 a graduated container was placed under the drip point and volumes were recorded between surveys in order to calculate drip rates water samples were collected from this container and stored in 14 ml glass tubes at 4 c a total of 76 dripwater samples were collected from site d1 in addition water droplets from four selected locations of the ceiling of the polychrome hall i e sites with no visibly dripping d2 d5 in fig 1 were collected and stored using the same protocol as for condensation water a total of 254 samples from these four locations were taken every two weeks between march 2017 and october 2020 3 2 stable isotopes analysis samples collected between july 2013 and july 2014 were analyzed for δ18o and δd using a l1102 i picarro water isotope analyzer at the godwin laboratory for paleoclimate research university of cambridge uk samples collected between august 2014 and october 2020 were analyzed for δ17o δ18o and δd at the laboratory of stable isotopes of the university of almeria spain using a l2140 i picarro water isotope analyzer picarro inc santa clara california usa each sample was injected ten times into the vaporizer a0211 manufactured by picarro inc which was heated to 110 c potential contamination produced by organic compounds in water which may affect specially the measurements of 17o excess values was removed by using a picarro micro combustion module mcm coupled to the l2140 i picarro analyzer gázquez et al 2015b memory effects from previous samples were avoided by rejecting the first three analyses values for the final 7 injections were averaged with a typical mean instrumental precision 1sd of 0 02 for δ17o 0 03 for δ18o and 0 19 for δd when using the l2140 i picarro analyzer as observed from repeated analysis of an in house water standard n 54 together with the water samples the instrumental precision of the l1102 i picarro analyzer was 0 05 for δ18o and 0 6 for δd the in run drift of the instruments was monitored by analyzing a water standard botty every 6 samples the results were normalized against v smow slap in the case of triple oxygen isotopes and against v smow slap gisp in the case of hydrogen isotopes by analyzing internal standards before and after each set of fifteen to twenty samples see supplementary table 1 for examples of our calibration to this end three internal water standards jrw δ17o 9 99 δ18o 18 90 and δd 146 5 botty δ17o 3 88 δ18o 7 40 and δd 50 38 spit δ17o 0 09 δ18o 0 15 and δd 0 44 were calibrated previously for triple oxygen isotopes against v smow and slap by a two points calibration using δ17o of 0 0 and 29 69865 respectively and δ18o of 0 0 and 55 5 respectively schoenemann et al 2013 this approach assumes v smow and slap have 17o excess 0 the δd of the internal standards was calibrated against v smow gisp and slap using a three points calibration note that gisp does not have an accepted δ17o value so cannot be used for triple oxygen isotope calibration instead the gisp water standard was analyzed as an unknown during the calibration of our internal standards yielding an average 17o excess value of 19 18 per meg this value is in good agreement with the results reported by previous studies e g schoenemann et al 2013 22 11 per meg the 17o excess was calculated for each injection using the normalized δ17o and δ18o values the final

temperature and air co2 concentrations were conducted at sites c1 c2 and c3 in the polychrome hall fig 1 and outside the cave close to the entrance door between january 2014 and october 2020 rainfall amount was recorded by a meteorological station located in the terrain over the cave during the length of the study a total of 191 monitoring campaigns were conducted during this period typically every two weeks and between 10 a m and 12 p m the in cave temperature measurements used mercury thermometers with a precision of 0 05 c that were installed in the cave at the beginning of this study for the measurements of the external air we used a portable digital temperature probe vaisala hmp155 with a precision of 0 1 c the concentration of co2 in air was analyzed in situ using a testo 445 mod 0560 4450 device with a precision of 5 relative humidity was measured using ee21 series instrument with an accuracy of 3 additionally the automatic measurements performed by this device have being reproduced with grab sampling measurements carried out with an aspiration psicrometer lambrecht kg göttingen model 761 with a resolution of 2 3 4 stable isotope modeling we modeled the stable isotope composition of condensation water at site c1 by using a two endmember mixing model in which the endmembers are the water vapor generated within the cave autochthonous water vapor hereafter and the water vapor that enters the cave from outside during the cave ventilation period allochthonous water vapor hereafter see supplementary table 2 for model parametrization and calculations the co2 content in air is assumed to reflect the degree of atmosphere ventilation at site c1 this means that the maximum co2 content recorded at site c1 during the cave stagnation period 5525 ppm represents 0 ventilation and the outside co2 content during the length of this study 470 ppm represents 100 ventilation we assume a linear relationship between the co2 content and the degree of cave ventilation at site c1 the isotopic composition of the two water vapor reservoirs can be approximated by assuming equilibrium conditions with environmental water i e cave water and meteoric water we use the mean isotopic composition of dripwater at site d1 to represent the isotopic composition of cave water δ18o 5 9 0 1 δd 32 8 0 4 d excess 14 4 0 6 17o excess 25 7 per meg during the length of this study we use the long term i e 15 years mean monthly values of δ18o and δd in rainfall recorded by the meteorological station of santander city 15 km apart from altamira cave data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation of the international atomic energy agency period 2000 2015 iaea wmo 2021 to calculate the isotopic composition of the external vapor because there is no δ17o data and therefore 17o excess cannot be calculated for precipitation near altamira cave we assume that the 17o excess in rainfall correlates linearly with δ18o as reported by giménez et al 2021 in the pyrenees northern spain 220 km from altamira cave these authors found that the δ18o 17o excess relationship has a slope of 3 8 per meg at this site then we use this relationship to calculate the 17o excess of rainfall in the setting of altamira cave from the δ18o of rainfall finally the δ17o is calculated from δ18o and 17o excess the isotopic compositions of both the autochthonous and the allochthonous water vapor are controlled by the in cave and external temperatures respectively equilibrium liquid vapor fractionation factors for δ18o α18oeq and δd αdeq are calculated here as a function of temperature using the equations of horita and wesolowski 1994 the α17oeq is calculated as α17oeq α18oeq θ where θ is 0 529 0 001 barkan and luz 2005 4 results a total of 481 water samples from altamira cave were analyzed for triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the summary of the δ17o δ18o δd values and derived parameters d excess and 17o excess are given in table 1 and supplementary table 3

and ranges from 6 to 60 per meg no systematic differences in this parameter have been between the ventilation period 27 12 per meg and the stagnation period 28 9 per meg probably due to insufficient analytical precision of the measurements 13 per meg 1sd fig 4 the d excess shows more variable values during the ventilation period 14 3 2 1 than during the cave stagnation period 15 2 1 1 figs 2 and

mean of 31 4 1 the d excess varied between 8 0 and 17 3 with a mean of 14 2 1 3 and the 17o excess did between 2 and 61 per meg with a mean of 26 10 per meg no systematic seasonal patterns have been observed in the isotopic parameters during the 4 years monitoring table 1 and fig 4 the δ18o and δd in the four points showed similar patterns with time r2 0 4 and p value 0 05 4 3 microclimate parameters the air temperature in the entrance hall site c1 in fig 1 ranged from 13 1 to 15 7 c with a mean value of 14 5 0 6 c maximum temperatures were recorded in september and minimum temperatures correspond to march in the polychrome hall sites d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 in fig 1 air temperature oscillated between 13 2 and 15 0 c and the mean value was 14 2 0 5 c maximum temperatures were recorded in december while minimum temperatures correspond to june the temperature in the innermost sector of the cave locations c2 and c3 in fig 1 varied between 12 5 and 14 5 c with a mean of 13 7 0 2 c maximum temperatures were recorded between october and february and minimum temperatures corresponded to june and july the temperature outside measured during the visits to the cave between 10 a m and 12 p m ranged from 2 9 to 25 1 c with a mean of 15 1 4 7 c maximum temperatures outside were recorded in august while minimum temperatures correspond to january and february august and july are the driest month of the series while the autumn and spring months concentrate most of the annual precipitation fig 2 the mean co2 in the polychrome hall was 2580 1423 ppm with lower values around 1000 ppm from june to october ventilation period and higher values around 3000 ppm were recorded between november and may stagnation period at site c1 the co2 content varied between 724 and 5525 ppm the change from lower to higher co2 conditions and vice versa generally takes place in around 2 weeks mainly depending on the external meteorology relative humidity rh in the polychrome hall was 96 8 1 9 on average and ranged from 92 to 100 in the outmost part of the cave site c1 rh ranged from 88 to 100 and averaged 96 5 2 3 fig 3e generally the lowest rh values correspond to the cave ventilation period and values closer to 100 are characteristic of the stagnation period the rh in the inner cave sector is slightly higher and closer to saturation 97 with no significant seasonal changes gázquez et al 2016 sainz et al 2018 4 4 results of isotope modeling the modeled δ18o and δd values of condensation water for the sectors near the cave entrance site c1 show a seasonal pattern with higher values up to 2 9 and 8 4 respectively during the cave ventilation period and lower values during the stagnation period down to 6 9 and 43 7 respectively fig 1 the modeled d excess values of condensation water ranges from 10 1 to 16 2 with the lowest values corresponding to the ventilation period and higher values are obtained for the stagnation period we found that the expected range of 17o excess in condensation water is only of 9 per meg note that this variability is smaller than the analytical precision of our 17o excess measurements 13 per meg the highest 17o excess values occur during the cave stagnation period maximum value of 28 per meg and lower values are observed during the cave ventilation period minimum of 19 per meg we tested the sensibility of the isotopic composition of condensation water to the different parameters consider by our model external air temperature and cave atmosphere temperature the isotopic composition of cave dripwater and meteoric water and the degree of cave atmosphere ventilation as expected we found that during the cave stagnation period the isotopic composition of condensation water at site c1 is insensitive to changes in the outside air temperature and variations in the isotopic composition of meteoric water supplementary figs 1 and 3 also changes in the cave atmosphere temperature during the stagnation period have an insignificant impact on the isotopic composition of condensation water supplementary fig 2 given the small variations in the cave atmosphere temperature 5 c in contrast the isotopic composition of condensation water at site c1 during the cave ventilation period is relatively sensitive to the changes in the external air temperature e g 1 δ18o increase for each increment of 10 c supplementary fig 1 we found that the δ18o and δd values of condensation increase linearly with the δ18o and δd values of the external meteoric water supplementary fig 3 while changes in the cave temperature atmosphere have little impact on the δ18o and δd values of condensation water e g 0 2 δ18o increase for an increment of 2 c supplementary fig 2 likewise the secondary parameters d excess and 17o excess are insensitive to change in the external parameters during the cave stagnation period supplementary figs 1 to 3 in contrast during the ventilation period the d excess of condensation water in the outmost cave sectors is significantly impacted by changes the external air temperature i e 3 7 d excess increase for each increment of 10 c and by changes in the d excess of meteoric water the modeled 17o excess values of condensation water at site c1 during the ventilation period are barely affected by changes in the internal and external air temperatures i e 1 per meg increase for each increment of 10 c 5 discussion the difference in isotopic composition of two water reservoirs e g liquid and vapor in equilibrium during phase change depends mostly on temperature that controls the equilibrium isotope fractionation factors between the two phases e g α18owater vapor and αdwater vapor craig et al 1963 horita and wesolowski 1994 additionally when the evaporation condensation process occurs under rh 100 kinetic isotope fractionation can take place which magnitude depends mostly on relative humidity and the degree of turbulence on the liquid vapor boundary layer i e wind cappa et al 2003 landais et al 2006 barkan and luz 2007 luz et al 2009 in caves relative humidity is close to 100 e g fig 2 and wind speed is generally insignificant compared to outside gázquez et al 2016 thus equilibrium isotope process is expected to prevail over kinetic isotope fractionation during phase changes consequently for the particular case of condensation in caves the most important parameters controlling the isotopic composition of condensation water are temperature and the isotopic composition of water vapor our monitoring data show that altamira cave directly and rapidly exchanges gases with the external atmosphere during the cave ventilation period june to october when intakes of water vapor from outside are expected note that the seasonal environmental changes outside are considerably larger than in the cave this includes larger temperature changes and varying isotopic of compositions of water vapor indeed the isotopic composition of summer rainfall in this region is more enriched e g δ18o 3 5 in june than in winter e g δ18o 6 7 in january iaea wmo 2021 and external water vapor is assumed here to be in equilibrium with environmental liquid water outside according to this the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapor outside the cave during summer is expected to increase compared to winter conditions in contrast the isotopic composition of the autochthonous water vapor generated within the cave is expected to be less variable that outside because of cave temperature is nearly constant and the vapor is in equilibrium with the cave dripwater which has almost constant isotopic values table 1 and fig 2 we evaluate the impact of allochthonous water vapor entering the cave during the ventilation period on the isotopic composition of condensation water at site c1 entrance hall by using a two endmember mixing model fig 2 and supplementary table 2 the magnitude and variability of the modeled isotopic values for site c1 agree with our observations of δ18o and δd of condensation water at site c1 fig 2 our model demonstrates that the seasonal cycles recorded by the isotopic composition of condensation water in the outmost part of the cave are a consequence of advection of allochthonous water vapor from the external atmosphere the summer condensation water that accumulates during the ventilation period near the entrance hall is isotopically enriched i e higher δ18o and δd values compared to the winter condensation water that derives from recycling of autochthonous water vapor generated in the cave water during the stagnation period figs 3 and 5 the relatively constant δ18o and δd values of autochthonous water vapor ranges of 0 3 and 2 7 respectively is a consequence of the small cave temperature variability and the almost constant isotopic values of seepage water through the seasonal cycle condensation from allochthonous water vapor in caves seems to be analogue to recharge by occult rain detected in arid regions that occurs because of re evaporation of local water and subsequent condensation of vapor on vegetation and soils aravena et al 1989 kaseke et al 2017 if such vapor is re condensed in any significant quantity before mixing with the larger tropospheric reservoir the isotopic composition of the resulting condensation water will fall slightly above the lmwl i e higher d excess values along a condensation line with a slope similar to the lmwl ingraham and matthews 1988 1990 clark and fritz 1997 indeed we found that y intercept of the δ18o δd correlation line of condensation water in the outmost part of the cave site c1 is slightly higher 9 1 1 1 than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl 7 4 0 8 although their slopes are indistinguishable within errors fig 3 similarly an offset between d excess of condensation water and the lmwl has been observed in other caves gázquez et al 2017b liñán et al 2021 evaporation of condensation water can explain some of the d excess outliers observed in the entrance hall that were recorded mostly during the cave ventilation period e g three d excess values ranging from 7 to 10 5 in summer 2017 2018 and 2019 fig 4 these d excess values are slightly lower than predicted by our model fig 2c note that evaporated water normally show lower d excess values that correlates with δ18o and δd compared to non evaporated waters e g luz et al 2009 gázquez et al 2018 voigt et al 2021 however the correlation between δ18o and d excess of condensation water in altamira cave is weak r2 0 28 the d excess of condensation water remains generally high during the ventilation period 15 and up to 17 3 and can occasionally show lower values during the rest of the year in consequence the seasonal variability of condensation water at site c1 cannot be attributed to the effect of evaporation but to the varying contributions of autochthonous and allocthonous water vapor the modeled 17o excess values of condensation water at site c1 vary from 19 per meg during the cave stagnation period to 28 per meg during the ventilation period fig 2 no statistically significant seasonal trends in 17o excess of our analytical data have been observed in any of the sites investigated in this study either in condensation water nor in dripwater recent studies showed that the δ18o 17o excess relationship in rainwater in northern spain villanua village 220 km from altamira cave has a slope of 3 8 per meg considering that the δ18o of rainwater in santander city varies seasonally by 3 a range of 17o excess in rainwater of 12 per meg would expected the expected 17o excess variability in dripwater of altamira cave is even smaller 2 per meg considering the small δ18o variability observed during the length of this study 0 5 regarding that the mean reproducibility of our 17o excess measurements is 13 per meg 1sd we conclude than the current analytical precision of the crds analyzers is insufficient to investigate the small 17o excess variability expected for condensation water and dripwater in caves as for condensation water in the inner cave sectors the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopic values in dripwater and its temporal variability site d1 are indistinguishable from to those of condensation water collected from the inner cave sectors sites c2 and c3 this suggests that water condensation from autochthonous water vapor in altamira cave cannot be differentiated from seepage water by using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes also the isotopic composition of the ceiling droplets with no apparent dripping sites d2 d3 d4 and d5 of the polychrome hall and the rest of condensation waters from the inner cave sectors sites c2 and c3 show indistinguishable values within errors no clear differences between the ventilation and the stagnation periods has been identified thus it is possible that the ceiling droplets with of the polychrome hall are related to water condensation however contributions of meteoric water infiltration and extremely slow drainage of the epikarst over this chamber cannot be ruled out from our data we found that the small seasonal changes observed in the isotopic composition of dripwater and condensation water in sectors relatively distant from the cave entrance do not seem to be controlled by ventilation stagnation regimen of the cave since no correlation with the co2 content or with in cave air temperature has been observed fig 4 this indicates that the main source of vapor for condensation in these sites is autochthonous water vapor from within the cave with insignificant contributions of allochthonous air masses even during the ventilation period this is probably related to the fact that allochthonous water vapor condenses on cave surfaces closer to the entrance and likely on the artificial door that separates the entrance hall and the rest of the cave which is permanently closed in consequence the allochthonous water vapor does not reach the inner cave sector even during the ventilation periods and does not impact on the isotopic composition of condensation water in these areas 6 conclusions we investigate the spatiotemporal variability of δ17o δ18o δd and derived 17o excess and d excess values of condensation water in altamira cave significant changes in some of these parameters have been observed in the outmost cave sectors while in the inner deeper cave parts the isotopic composition of condensation water is less variable though the seasonal cycles in particular we found that the δ18o and δd of condensation water in the cave sectors closer to the entrance during the ventilation period june to october are higher than during the stagnation period november to may we evaluate the role of cave ventilation pattern in the condensation process in this cave sector by using an isotope mixing model we found that the isotopic composition of condensation water near the cave entrance during the ventilation period agrees with the expected values of water condensed from allochthonous water vapor while the prevailing mechanism during the stagnation period is condensation from autochthonous water vapor generated within the cave importantly no significant differences have been found between the isotopic composition of condensation water in the inner cave sectors and dripwater this suggests that the water condensation process in areas more distant from the cave entrance is sourced by autochthonous water vapor given that the isotopic composition of condensation water though the seasonal cycle is indistinguishable from that of seepage water in the cave we conclude that oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are not useful in identifying the origin condensation vs seepage of the droplets with no apparent dripping that cover the ceiling of the polychrome hall also we found that the analytical precision of the current crds isotope analyzers to measure triple oxygen isotope anomalies in waters is not enough to resolve the small natural seasonal variations expected for cave waters tens per meg the varying contributions of the allochthonous and autochthonous water vapor sources for condensation in the cave can be attributed the natural cave ventilation as well as to the distance of the different chambers to the cave entrance and probably to the role in the cave microclimate of the artificial metal door that separates the entrance hall and the rest of the cave as observed in previous studies gázquez et al 2016 sainz et al 2017 it is possible that a decrease in the airflow speed during the ventilation period in this cave sector favors that water vapor from outside condenses mostly in surfaces near the artificial door thus this artificial element seems to be critical to prevent the polychrome hall and the rest of the cave from receiving additional water vapor from outside during the ventilation period our results are important for the management of the polychrome hall since condensation water can contribute to the deterioration of the its exceptional rock art by washing out the ochre pigments additional efforts should be made to quantify and monitor condensation processes in altamira cave in forthcoming

3657,in cave environments water vapor condensation occurs naturally when warmer wet air masses flow close to colder cave surfaces artificial microclimate perturbations in show caves can enhance this process leading to potential deterioration of rock art and degradation of speleothems here we investigate the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of condensation water in altamira cave cantabria northern spain to evaluate the potential of stable isotopes in the study of condensation mechanisms in caves we assess the role of cave ventilation in the spatiotemporal isotopic variability of condensation water in altamira cave to this end water drops that condense naturally on artificial supports in different parts of the cave were collected for 7 years and their isotopic compositions δ17o δ18o δd and derived parameters 17o excess and d excess were compared to those of droplets with no apparent dripping taken from the cave ceiling i e presumably condensation water and fast dripping points i e infiltration water during the same period condensation waters in the outmost cave sectors closer to the entrance show higher δ17o δ18o and δd values during the cave ventilation period june to october compared to the rest of the year this seasonal pattern can be explained by changes in the contributions of two moisture sources for condensation advection of allochthonous water vapor from outside during the cave ventilation period and recycling of autochthonous vapor generated from cave dripwater during the stagnation period in contrast the isotopic values of condensation waters in the inner cave sectors are similar to those of infiltration water with insignificant seasonal variability this suggests that water condensation in the inner cave sectors is sourced by autochthonous vapor with no significant contributions of external moisture even during the cave ventilation period we conclude that allochthonous water vapor condenses preferentially in the entrance hall and does not affect significantly the rest of the cave these results are relevant for the management of altamira cave and for future investigations on condensation mechanisms in cavities elsewhere keywords cave

integrity of these and others rock art features from natural and anthropic perturbations is a priority in the management of show caves among the several threats to the rock art heritage resuspension and mobilization of pigments mostly ochres and charcoal by cave water including seepage and condensation waters are major hazards water films and drops can accumulate in some parts of the cave walls

garcía antón et al 2013 quindós et al 1987 gázquez et al 2016 sainz et al 2017 when relatively warm and moist air masses enter the cave and cool forcing condensation in order to reduce the inputs of airborne particles i e organic matter fungi and bacteria that could deteriorate the paleolithic rock art of altamira cave an artificial metal door was installed in 2008 between the entrance hall 20 m apart from the entrance and the rest of the cave this intervention has had a positive impact on the microclimate stability of the inner cave sectors in terms of temperature stability and decrease in airborne particles sainz et al 2018 however the role of this artificial barrier in the condensation processes in the cave has not been investigated to date indeed specific studies on water condensation in altamira cave have not been performed yet direct measurements of the condensation evaporation processes have been conducted previously in caves worldwide by using suspended glass plates sarbu and lascu 1997 lysimeters and metallic devices dublyansky and dublyansky 1998 gázquez et al 2015a 2017b and refrigerated containers tarhule lips and ford 1998 liñán et al 2021 in order to quantify the magnitude of these mechanisms electrical devices coupled to data loggers have been utilized also to quantify condensation in caves de freitas and schmekal 2006 in addition indirect

2004 indirect estimates of condensation evaporation can be also obtained from microclimate monitoring of cave atmosphere and rock temperatures de freitas and schmekal 2003 fernández cortés et al 2006 furthermore theoretical approaches to the condensation mechanisms in caves have been developed in the last decades dreybrodt et al 2005 gabrovšek et al 2010 more recently thermal image analyses have been used to quantify condensation evaporation processes in caves liñán et al 2021 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes composition of water 18o 16o and 2h 1h or δ18o and δd respectively when standardized to the international water standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow has been widely used to track a variety of processes in the hydrosphere bowen et al 2019 and references therein including recent preliminary studies of condensation water in caves by liñán et al 2021 these authors found that condensation waters in nerja cave southern spain display higher δ18o and δd values and lower d excess values during the cave ventilation periods than during the rest of the year this seasonal pattern was attributed to the impact of evaporation on condensation water which takes place during the cave ventilation period because of low relative humidity in the cave atmosphere 60 80 in addition to the traditional measurements of δ18o and δd in waters recent analytical advances have permitted obtaining precise measurements of the triple oxygen isotope composition δ17o and δ18o barkan and luz 2005 steig et al 2014 the δ17o deviations with respect to the δ17o δ18o global meteoric water line gmwl which has a proposed slope of 0 528 are expressed as 17o excess 17o excess ln δ17o 1000 1 0 528 ln δ18o 1000 1 luz and barkan 2010 this reference slope is commonly used to express triple oxygen deviation in the hydrological cycle aron et al 2021 surma et al 2021 the 17o excess parameter in rainfall has been found to be sensitive to variations in relative humidity at the moisture source with smaller temperature dependence than d excess d excess δd 8 δ18o barkan and luz 2005 2007 luz and barkan 2010 uechi and uemura 2019 likewise other parameters including raindrop re evaporation and moisture recycling during water vapor transport can modulates the final 17o excess signal of rainwater tian et al 2018 giménez et al 2021 thus measuring the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of water can help to track environmental conditions e g temperature vs relative humidity during water phase changes and during transport of water vapor masses aron et al 2021 surma et al 2021 here we conducted a 7 years monitoring study of stable isotopes δ17o δ18o δ2h and derived parameters d excess and 17o excess in condensation water and dripwater in altamira cave we aim to identify isotopic differences between seepage and condensation water in order to assess whether the numerous droplets observed in the ceiling of the polychrome hall of altamira cave are associated with either condensation or infiltration water in addition we investigate the origin of vapor for water condensation and the spatiotemporal pattern of the condensation mechanisms in this cave to this end we analyzed waters deposited on artificial supports in several locations of the cavity as well as dripwater from fast drips i e discharge point related to seepage of meteoric water and ceiling droplets with no apparent dripping presumably associated with water condensation in the polychrome hall the microclimate characteristics related to cave atmosphere ventilation air temperature relative humidity and co2 content were monitored during the length of the study in order to characterize the parameters that control the cave ventilation pattern and to identify connections with the condensation processes we use an isotopic mixing model to demonstrate that different sources of water vapor contribute to condensation water in altamira cave and that the relevance of these sources change temporally and spatially 2 setting and cave description altamira cave 43o22 37 n 4o07 11 w is located near the village of santillana del mar cantabria northern spain at an elevation of 152 m a s l and 4 5 km from the cantabrian sea the cavern runs nw se and has developed along a subhorizontal sequence of cenomanian turonian marine carbonates hoyos et al 1981 where the difference in level between the entrance and its deepest part grave hall is barely 26 m several cave sections can be distinguished according to their morphology and distance depth from the entrance the entrance hall is a 20 m long horizontal hall from there access to the rest of the cave is via an artificial door located in a narrow passage 2 m wide beyond the cave divides along two branches to the east is the polychrome hall 15 m long 7 m wide and up to 3 m high and lying about 2 m lower than the cave entrance the other branch gives access to the walls hall roughly 50 m in length 20 m wide and up to 7 m high located 6 m below the entrance a passage roughly 60 m long runs se ne into the great hall from here artificial stairs carved in the rock lead to the grave hall lying 15 m below the cave entrance and containing an ephemeral water pool that only appears during periods of high dripwater discharge to the south along a 10 m long passage lies the shower hall this in turn leads into the well hall at the depth of 12 m beneath the cave entrance finally there is a meandriform sub horizontal passage called the horsetail approximately 40 m long that represents the innermost cave area the thickness of the cap rock overlaying the cave varies from 2 to 18 m elez et al 2013 fig 1 there is no permanent running watercourse inside the cave the climate in this region is oceanic cfb climate type according to the köppen climate classification the rainfall is generally abundant exceeding 1 000 mm year july is the driest month 30 mm on average and the rainiest period occurs from october to december fig 2 the mean external air temperatures are minimum in january 9 c and maximum in july 21 c the vegetation coverage over the cave is dominated by grasses with minor presence of scrubs and trees fig 1a altamira cave has a relatively stable microclimate with air temperatures that vary 2 c throughout the year in the innermost areas well hall and horsetail and up to 5 c in the outermost part of the cave entrance hall gázquez et al 2016 the mean temperature in the polychrome hall during the period of study was 14 2 0 5 c maximum value of 15 c and minimum value of 13 2 c the air temperature and ventilation regime of altamira cave are fundamentally controlled by the annual thermal oscillations of the outside air temperature and the water saturation of the epikarst and the soil over the cave cuezva et al 2011 the outside temperature oscillations are transmitted into the cave through the rock which attenuates its amplitude and causes a lag between the outer thermal wave and the temperature of the subterranean atmosphere elez et al 2013 consequently the cave ventilation period occurs in summer june to october while the cave stagnation period takes place in winter november to may the annual variation of in cave air temperature exhibits a sinusoidal pattern with a thermal lag time 2 months on average between the innermost and outermost cave areas that depends on the outside temperature and the thickness of the rock over the different cave sectors cuezva et al 2011 quindós et al 1987 sainz et al 2018 3 methods we assess the spatial gradient and temporal variability of the isotopic composition of condensation water and dripwater as well as cave environmental parameters air temperature relative humidity and co2 content in altamira cave by monitoring and repeatedly sampling from the cave entrance to more stable locations deeper within the cave 3 1 water sampling from november 2014 to march 2017 condensation water that accumulates on a metallic door that separates the entrance hall and the rest of the cave site c1 in fig 1 was collected using disposable pipets 200 μl n 11 from march 2017 to october 2020 sampling was conducted approximately every two weeks in the same location but condensation was collected from the metal support of a thermometer that is 1 m apart from the door in addition condensation water from two inner cave locations sites c2 and c3 in fig 1 was collected from metal supports of thermometers using the same method from march 2017 to august 2020 water samples were stored at 4 c in 2 ml glass tubes provided with a micro insert 300 μl thermo fisher n 10376102 and capped with silicone septum caps a total of 76 surveys were conducted and a total of 192 condensation water samples from artificial supports were collected dripwater samples from a relatively fast discharge point maximum of 143 ml day mean of 61 21 ml day in the polychrome hall site d1 in fig 1 were collected approximately every two weeks between march 2017 and august 2020 a graduated container was placed under the drip point and volumes were recorded between surveys in order to calculate drip rates water samples were collected from this container and stored in 14 ml glass tubes at 4 c a total of 76 dripwater samples were collected from site d1 in addition water droplets from four selected locations of the ceiling of the polychrome hall i e sites with no visibly dripping d2 d5 in fig 1 were collected and stored using the same protocol as for condensation water a total of 254 samples from these four locations were taken every two weeks between march 2017 and october 2020 3 2 stable isotopes analysis samples collected between july 2013 and july 2014 were analyzed for δ18o and δd using a l1102 i picarro water isotope analyzer at the godwin laboratory for paleoclimate research university of cambridge uk samples collected between august 2014 and october 2020 were analyzed for δ17o δ18o and δd at the laboratory of stable isotopes of the university of almeria spain using a l2140 i picarro water isotope analyzer picarro inc santa clara california usa each sample was injected ten times into the vaporizer a0211 manufactured by picarro inc which was heated to 110 c potential contamination produced by organic compounds in water which may affect specially the measurements of 17o excess values was removed by using a picarro micro combustion module mcm coupled to the l2140 i picarro analyzer gázquez et al 2015b memory effects from previous samples were avoided by rejecting the first three analyses values for the final 7 injections were averaged with a typical mean instrumental precision 1sd of 0 02 for δ17o 0 03 for δ18o and 0 19 for δd when using the l2140 i picarro analyzer as observed from repeated analysis of an in house water standard n 54 together with the water samples the instrumental precision of the l1102 i picarro analyzer was 0 05 for δ18o and 0 6 for δd the in run drift of the instruments was monitored by analyzing a water standard botty every 6 samples the results were normalized against v smow slap in the case of triple oxygen isotopes and against v smow slap gisp in the case of hydrogen isotopes by analyzing internal standards before and after each set of fifteen to twenty samples see supplementary table 1 for examples of our calibration to this end three internal water standards jrw δ17o 9 99 δ18o 18 90 and δd 146 5 botty δ17o 3 88 δ18o 7 40 and δd 50 38 spit δ17o 0 09 δ18o 0 15 and δd 0 44 were calibrated previously for triple oxygen isotopes against v smow and slap by a two points calibration using δ17o of 0 0 and 29 69865 respectively and δ18o of 0 0 and 55 5 respectively schoenemann et al 2013 this approach assumes v smow and slap have 17o excess 0 the δd of the internal standards was calibrated against v smow gisp and slap using a three points calibration note that gisp does not have an accepted δ17o value so cannot be used for triple oxygen isotope calibration instead the gisp water standard was analyzed as an unknown during the calibration of our internal standards yielding an average 17o excess value of 19 18 per meg this value is in good agreement with the results reported by previous studies e g schoenemann et al 2013 22 11 per meg the 17o excess was calculated for each injection using the normalized δ17o and δ18o values the final

1sd in water standards botty n 54 were 13 per meg and 0 2 respectively similar to the precision obtained by other crds instruments wassenaar et al 2021 3 3 microclimate monitoring measurements of air temperature and air co2 concentrations were conducted at sites c1 c2 and c3 in the polychrome hall fig 1 and outside the cave close to the entrance door between january 2014 and october 2020 rainfall amount was recorded by a meteorological station located in the terrain over the cave during the length of the study a total of 191 monitoring campaigns were conducted during this period typically every two weeks and between 10 a m and 12 p m the in cave temperature measurements used mercury thermometers with a precision of 0 05 c that were installed in the cave at the beginning of this study for the measurements of the external air we used a portable digital temperature probe vaisala hmp155 with a precision of 0 1 c the concentration of co2 in air was analyzed in situ using a testo 445 mod 0560 4450 device with a precision of 5 relative humidity was measured using ee21 series instrument with an accuracy of 3 additionally the automatic measurements performed by this device have being reproduced with grab sampling measurements carried out with an aspiration psicrometer lambrecht kg göttingen model 761 with a resolution of 2 3 4 stable isotope modeling we modeled the stable isotope composition of condensation water at site c1 by using a two endmember mixing model in which the endmembers are the water vapor generated within the cave autochthonous water vapor hereafter and the water vapor that enters the cave from outside during the cave ventilation period allochthonous water vapor hereafter see supplementary table 2 for model parametrization and calculations the co2 content in air is assumed to reflect the degree of atmosphere ventilation at site c1 this means that the maximum co2 content recorded at site c1 during the cave stagnation period 5525 ppm represents 0 ventilation and the outside co2 content during the length of this study 470 ppm represents 100 ventilation we assume a linear relationship between the co2 content and the degree of cave ventilation at site c1 the isotopic composition of the two water vapor reservoirs can be approximated by assuming equilibrium conditions with environmental water i e cave water and meteoric water we use the mean isotopic composition of dripwater at site d1 to represent the isotopic composition of cave water δ18o 5 9 0 1 δd 32 8 0 4 d excess 14 4 0 6 17o excess 25 7 per meg during the length of this study we use the long term i e 15 years mean monthly values of δ18o and δd in rainfall recorded by the meteorological station of santander city 15 km apart from altamira cave data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation of the international atomic energy agency period 2000 2015 iaea wmo 2021 to calculate the isotopic composition of the external vapor because there is no δ17o data and therefore 17o excess cannot be calculated for precipitation near altamira cave we assume that the 17o excess in rainfall correlates linearly with δ18o as reported by giménez et al 2021 in the pyrenees northern spain 220 km from altamira cave these authors found that the δ18o 17o excess relationship has a slope of 3 8 per meg at this site then we use this relationship to calculate the 17o excess of rainfall in the setting of altamira cave from the δ18o of rainfall finally the δ17o is calculated from δ18o and 17o excess the isotopic compositions of both the autochthonous and the allochthonous water vapor are controlled by the in cave and external temperatures respectively equilibrium liquid vapor fractionation factors for δ18o α18oeq and δd αdeq are calculated here as a function of temperature using the equations of horita and wesolowski 1994 the α17oeq is calculated as α17oeq α18oeq θ where θ is 0 529 0 001 barkan and luz 2005 4 results a total of 481 water samples from altamira cave were analyzed for triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the summary of the δ17o δ18o δd values and derived parameters d excess and 17o excess are given in table 1 and supplementary table 3

values closer to 100 are characteristic of the stagnation period the rh in the inner cave sector is slightly higher and closer to saturation 97 with no significant seasonal changes gázquez et al 2016 sainz et al 2018 4 4 results of isotope modeling the modeled δ18o and δd values of condensation water for the sectors near the cave entrance site c1 show a seasonal pattern with higher values up to 2 9 and 8 4 respectively during the cave ventilation period and lower values during the stagnation period down to 6 9 and 43 7 respectively fig 1 the modeled d excess values of condensation water ranges from 10 1 to 16 2 with the lowest values corresponding to the ventilation period and higher values are obtained for the stagnation period we found that the expected range of 17o excess in condensation water is only of 9 per meg note that this variability is smaller than the analytical precision of our 17o excess measurements 13 per meg the highest 17o excess values occur during the cave stagnation period maximum value of 28 per meg and lower values are observed during the cave ventilation period minimum of 19 per meg we tested the sensibility of the isotopic composition of condensation water to the different parameters consider by our model external air temperature and cave atmosphere temperature the isotopic composition of cave dripwater and meteoric water and the degree of cave atmosphere ventilation as expected we found that during the cave stagnation period the isotopic composition of condensation water at site c1 is insensitive to changes in the outside air temperature and variations in the isotopic composition of meteoric water supplementary figs 1 and 3 also changes in the cave atmosphere temperature during the stagnation period have an insignificant impact on the isotopic composition of condensation water supplementary fig 2 given the small variations in the cave atmosphere temperature 5 c in contrast the isotopic composition of condensation water at site c1 during the cave ventilation period is relatively sensitive to the changes in the external air temperature e g 1 δ18o increase for each increment of 10 c supplementary fig 1 we found that the δ18o and δd values of condensation increase linearly with the δ18o and δd values of the external meteoric water supplementary fig 3 while changes in the cave temperature atmosphere have little impact on the δ18o and δd values of condensation water e g 0 2 δ18o increase for an increment of 2 c supplementary fig 2 likewise the secondary parameters d excess and 17o excess are insensitive to change in the external parameters during the cave stagnation period supplementary figs 1 to 3 in contrast during the ventilation period the d excess of condensation water in the outmost cave sectors is significantly impacted by changes the external air temperature i e 3 7 d excess increase for each increment of 10 c and by changes in the d excess of meteoric water the modeled 17o excess values of condensation water at site c1 during the ventilation period are barely affected by changes in the internal and external air temperatures i e 1 per meg increase for each increment of 10 c 5 discussion the difference in isotopic composition of two water reservoirs e g liquid and vapor in equilibrium during phase change depends mostly on temperature that controls the equilibrium isotope fractionation factors between the two phases e g α18owater vapor and αdwater vapor craig et al 1963 horita and wesolowski 1994 additionally when the evaporation condensation process occurs under rh 100 kinetic isotope fractionation can take place which magnitude depends mostly on relative humidity and the degree of turbulence on the liquid vapor boundary layer i e wind cappa et al 2003 landais et al 2006 barkan and luz 2007 luz et al 2009 in caves relative humidity is close to 100 e g fig 2 and wind speed is generally insignificant compared to outside gázquez et al 2016 thus equilibrium isotope process is expected to prevail over kinetic isotope fractionation during phase changes consequently for the particular case of condensation in caves the most important parameters controlling the isotopic composition of condensation water are temperature and the isotopic composition of water vapor our monitoring data show that altamira cave directly and rapidly exchanges gases with the external atmosphere during the cave ventilation period june to october when intakes of water vapor from outside are expected note that the seasonal environmental changes outside are considerably larger than in the cave this includes larger temperature changes and varying isotopic of compositions of water vapor indeed the isotopic composition of summer rainfall in this region is more enriched e g δ18o 3 5 in june than in winter e g δ18o 6 7 in january iaea wmo 2021 and external water vapor is assumed here to be in equilibrium with environmental liquid water outside according to this the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapor outside the cave during summer is expected to increase compared to winter conditions in contrast the isotopic composition of the autochthonous water vapor generated within the cave is expected to be less variable that outside because of cave temperature is nearly constant and the vapor is in equilibrium with the cave dripwater which has almost constant isotopic values table 1 and fig 2 we evaluate the impact of allochthonous water vapor entering the cave during the ventilation period on the isotopic composition of condensation water at site c1 entrance hall by using a two endmember mixing model fig 2 and supplementary table 2 the magnitude and variability of the modeled isotopic values for site c1 agree with our observations of δ18o and δd of condensation water at site c1 fig 2 our model demonstrates that the seasonal cycles recorded by the isotopic composition of condensation water in the outmost part of the cave are a consequence of advection of allochthonous water vapor from the external atmosphere the summer condensation water that accumulates during the ventilation period near the entrance hall is isotopically enriched i e higher δ18o and δd values compared to the winter condensation water that derives from recycling of autochthonous water vapor generated in the cave water during the stagnation period figs 3 and 5 the relatively constant δ18o and δd values of autochthonous water vapor ranges of 0 3 and 2 7 respectively is a consequence of the small cave temperature variability and the almost constant isotopic values of seepage water through the seasonal cycle condensation from allochthonous water vapor in caves seems to be analogue to recharge by occult rain detected in arid regions that occurs because of re evaporation of local water and subsequent condensation of vapor on vegetation and soils aravena et al 1989 kaseke et al 2017 if such vapor is re condensed in any significant quantity before mixing with the larger tropospheric reservoir the isotopic composition of the resulting condensation water will fall slightly above the lmwl i e higher d excess values along a condensation line with a slope similar to the lmwl ingraham and matthews 1988 1990 clark and fritz 1997 indeed we found that y intercept of the δ18o δd correlation line of condensation water in the outmost part of the cave site c1 is slightly higher 9 1 1 1 than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl 7 4 0 8 although their slopes are indistinguishable within errors fig 3 similarly an offset between d excess of condensation water and the lmwl has been observed in other caves gázquez et al 2017b liñán et al 2021 evaporation of condensation water can explain some of the d excess outliers observed in the entrance hall that were recorded mostly during the cave ventilation period e g three d excess values ranging from 7 to 10 5 in summer 2017 2018 and 2019 fig 4 these d excess values are slightly lower than predicted by our model fig 2c note that evaporated water normally show lower d excess values that correlates with δ18o and δd compared to non evaporated waters e g luz et al 2009 gázquez et al 2018 voigt et al 2021 however the correlation between δ18o and d excess of condensation water in altamira cave is weak r2 0 28 the d excess of condensation water remains generally high during the ventilation period 15 and up to 17 3 and can occasionally show lower values during the rest of the year in consequence the seasonal variability of condensation water at site c1 cannot be attributed to the effect of evaporation but to the varying contributions of autochthonous and allocthonous water vapor the modeled 17o excess values of condensation water at site c1 vary from 19 per meg during the cave stagnation period to 28 per meg during the ventilation period fig 2 no statistically significant seasonal trends in 17o excess of our analytical data have been observed in any of the sites investigated in this study either in condensation water nor in dripwater recent studies showed that the δ18o 17o excess relationship in rainwater in northern spain villanua village 220 km from altamira cave has a slope of 3 8 per meg considering that the δ18o of rainwater in santander city varies seasonally by 3 a range of 17o excess in rainwater of 12 per meg would expected the expected 17o excess variability in dripwater of altamira cave is even smaller 2 per meg considering the small δ18o variability observed during the length of this study 0 5 regarding that the mean reproducibility of our 17o excess measurements is 13 per meg 1sd we conclude than the current analytical precision of the crds analyzers is insufficient to investigate the small 17o excess variability expected for condensation water and dripwater in caves as for condensation water in the inner cave sectors the triple oxygen and hydrogen isotopic values in dripwater and its temporal variability site d1 are indistinguishable from to those of condensation water collected from the inner cave sectors sites c2 and c3 this suggests that water condensation from autochthonous water vapor in altamira cave cannot be differentiated from seepage water by using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes also the isotopic composition of the ceiling droplets with no apparent dripping sites d2 d3 d4 and d5 of the polychrome hall and the rest of condensation waters from the inner cave sectors sites c2 and c3 show indistinguishable values within errors no clear differences between the ventilation and the stagnation periods has been identified thus it is possible that the ceiling droplets with of the polychrome hall are related to water condensation however contributions of meteoric water infiltration and extremely slow drainage of the epikarst over this chamber cannot be ruled out from our data we found that the small seasonal changes observed in the isotopic composition of dripwater and condensation water in sectors relatively distant from the cave entrance do not seem to be controlled by ventilation stagnation regimen of the cave since no correlation with the co2 content or with in cave air temperature has been observed fig 4 this indicates that the main source of vapor for condensation in these sites is autochthonous water vapor from within the cave with insignificant contributions of allochthonous air masses even during the ventilation period this is probably related to the fact that allochthonous water vapor condenses on cave surfaces closer to the entrance and likely on the artificial door that separates the entrance hall and the rest of the cave which is permanently closed in consequence the allochthonous water vapor does not reach the inner cave sector even during the ventilation periods and does not impact on the isotopic composition of condensation water in these areas 6 conclusions we investigate the spatiotemporal variability of δ17o δ18o δd and derived 17o excess and d excess values of condensation water in altamira cave significant changes in some of these parameters have been observed in the outmost cave sectors while in the inner deeper cave parts the isotopic composition of condensation water is less variable though the seasonal cycles in particular we found that the δ18o and δd of condensation water in the cave sectors closer to the entrance during the ventilation period june to october are higher than during the stagnation period november to may we evaluate the role of cave ventilation pattern in the condensation process in this cave sector by using an isotope mixing model we found that the isotopic composition of condensation water near the cave entrance during the ventilation period agrees with the expected values of water condensed from allochthonous water vapor while the prevailing mechanism during the stagnation period is condensation from autochthonous water vapor generated within the cave importantly no significant differences have been found between the isotopic composition of condensation water in the inner cave sectors and dripwater this suggests that the water condensation process in areas more distant from the cave entrance is sourced by autochthonous water vapor given that the isotopic composition of condensation water though the seasonal cycle is indistinguishable from that of seepage water in the cave we conclude that oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are not useful in identifying the origin condensation vs seepage of the droplets with no apparent dripping that cover the ceiling of the polychrome hall also we found that the analytical precision of the current crds isotope analyzers to measure triple oxygen isotope anomalies in waters is not enough to resolve the small natural seasonal variations expected for cave waters tens per meg the varying contributions of the allochthonous and autochthonous water vapor sources for condensation in the cave can be attributed the natural cave ventilation as well as to the distance of the different chambers to the cave entrance and probably to the role in the cave microclimate of the artificial metal door that separates the entrance hall and the rest of the cave as observed in previous studies gázquez et al 2016 sainz et al 2017 it is possible that a decrease in the airflow speed during the ventilation period in this cave sector favors that water vapor from outside condenses mostly in surfaces near the artificial door thus this artificial element seems to be critical to prevent the polychrome hall and the rest of the cave from receiving additional water vapor from outside during the ventilation period our results are important for the management of the polychrome hall since condensation water can contribute to the deterioration of the its exceptional rock art by washing out the ochre pigments additional efforts should be made to quantify and monitor condensation processes in altamira cave in forthcoming

3658,the increasing winter streamflow of major arctic rivers has been well documented however the contribution of climate change to winter streamflow and associated mechanisms of streamflow generation during early mid and late winter are not fully understood among the arctic rivers we selected four rivers with relatively few dam effects lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers and analysed their climate change related responses in streamflow during early mid and late winter our results showed that the winter streamflow qwin of the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers increased from 1980 to 2019 by approximately 43 72 16 and 16 1 7 5 2 times greater than increases in annual streamflow respectively in general the rate of streamflow increase was the greatest in early winter followed by mid and late winter the streamflow in late winter was particularly sensitive to air temperature changes and permafrost degradation due to rising temperatures is likely a major factor driving late winter streamflow increases in contrast to late winter streamflow the larger rate of increase in early winter streamflow can be mainly attributed to the additional influence of increased late summer precipitation on streamflow generation the different change rates in winter streamflow among the four river basins are highly determined by permafrost degradation and related baseflow discharge processes under warming climate conditions winter streamflow generation is strongly associated with the enhanced hydrological cycle that is apparent in both the surface e g precipitation and river ice and the subsurface the active layer and groundwater discharge keywords winter streamflow climate warming precipitation permafrost arctic rivers 1 introduction against the background of climate warming conditions the average annual streamflow of the six largest eurasian rivers increased by approximately 7 from 1936 to 1999 peterson et al 2002 which was shown to be significant even in basins with permafrost tananaev et al 2016 for example the annual streamflow of the lena river a permafrost dominated drainage basin increased by 22 over the last 84 years wang et al 2021a increased streamflow has resulted in a significant increase in the export of riverine heat fluxes park et al 2020 yang et al 2021 organic carbon and mercury to the arctic ocean mu et al 2019 walvoord and striegl 2007 most arctic and sub arctic regions are underlain by permafrost obu et al 2019 zhang et al 1999 increased precipitation and permafrost degradation were considered the main reasons for the increase in streamflow in the cold northern regions wang et al 2021a previous studies have shown that intensified precipitation historically contributed the most to the increased arctic river streamflow e g rawlins et al 2009 wu et al 2005 in basins with permafrost winter streamflow is particularly sensitive to climate warming via permafrost thawing which enhances groundwater discharge to streamflow evans et al 2020 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 wang et al 2021a thus permafrost thawing which may be further strengthened with continuous climate warming is postulated to be an important contributor to increasing streamflow in cold regions gao et al 2021b ma et al 2019 song et al 2020 diagnosing the contributions of climate warming and associated permafrost thaw to streamflow is important for gaining insights into the regional water cycle patterns and for better predicting hydrological responses to future climate change because winter precipitation exists in the form of snow cover in cold regions surface runoff during winter is extremely low thus winter streamflow mostly derives from baseflow st jacques and sauchyn 2009 which is generally associated with the thermal state of the active layer recent studies have shown that the total winter streamflow between december and february for the four largest arctic rivers ob yenisei lena and mackenzie rivers increased by 1 3 from 1980 to 2009 ahmed et al 2020 increased winter streamflow in recent decades has most likely resulted from groundwater input enhanced by permafrost thawing brabets and walvoord 2009 o donnell et al 2012 therefore winter streamflow is generally associated with the spatial extent of permafrost evans et al 2020 and the intensity of seasonal ground thawing freezing processes other studies have suggested that increases in winter streamflow are also likely associated with a shift in precipitation from snow to rain in late autumn which consequently increases streamflow in the early winter period makarieva et al 2019 streletskiy et al 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 a comprehensive review and an updated research processes of arctic hydrology science was recently given in yang and kane 2021 for the pan arctic region winter lasts for half a year from november to the following april lesack et al 2013 streletskiy et al 2015 it remains unclear how streamflow changes throughout the winter and how the changes in temperature precipitation and permafrost degradation affect winter streamflow variations in arctic rivers therefore considering the seasonal change of air temperature we divided the winter period into three stages i e early middle and late according to wegner et al 2017 then we made a first attempt to detect the sub seasonal variation characteristics of winter streamflow and the predominant driving factors in each stage four arctic rivers i e the lena mackenzie yukon and kolyma rivers that are relatively less affected by artificial flow regulation than the other arctic rivers ahmed et al 2020 bobrovitskaya et al 2003 mcclelland et al 2004 raymond et al 2007 were selected for this study the objectives of this study are to i examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of multiyear variations in winter streamflow of four arctic rivers during the period 1980 2019 and ii reveal the potential mechanistic causes of various responses of winter streamflow to climate factors temperature and precipitation during early mid and late winter in permafrost dominated pan arctic basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area to investigate the impact of climate changes and permafrost conditions on winter streamflow four major arctic rivers including the lena and kolyma in eurasia and the yukon and mackenzie in north america were selected in this study based on the coverage of permafrost fig 1 the river lengths are approximately 4260 2410 3190 and 5472 km brabets and walvoord 2009 majhi and yang 2008 motovilov 2017 rood et al 2017 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins respectively these four arctic river basins have a total area at gauging stations of approximately 2 43 million 0 53 million 0 83 million and 1 68 million km2 with population densities of 0 45 0 12 0 18 and 0 27 people km2 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers respectively holmes et al 2012 the lena and kolyma river basins each have only one major dam mcclelland et al 2004 i e the vilyuiskoe 1967 with a 35 9 km3 storage capacity in the lena river basin in the upper vilui valley ye et al 2003 ye et al 2009 and the kolymskoye 1986 with volume of 10 km3 in the kolyma river basin majhi and yang 2008 mcclelland et al 2004 there are no large dams in the yukon river basin yang et al 2014 and there are only small dams such as the w a c bennett dam 1968 and the peace canyon dam 1975 in the mackenzie river basin rood et al 2017 the summary characteristics of the four selected arctic river basins are given in table 1 2 2 data daily discharge q mm data for the lena 1936 2020 kolyma 1978 2020 yukon 1975 2020 and mackenzie 1972 2021 river basins are available from the arctic great rivers observatory holmes et al 2013 shiklomanov et al 2021 in this study we selected recent 40 year discharge data spanning 1980 to 2019 for analysis the kyusyur gauging station of the lena river basin is located in the upstream of the lena delta fedorova et al 2015 and the kolymskoe gauging station is approximately 310 km from the mouth of the kolyma river welp et al 2005 the pilot station of the yukon river basin is the downstream gauging station of this river before entering the delta dornblaser and striegl 2009 the gauging station of the arctic red river is located downstream of the mackenzie river and approximately 90 of the river water supplied to the delta from the mackenzie river is above the arctic red river station emmerton et al 2008 to assess the potential impacts of dams on winter streamflow we compared the observed and naturalised daily discharge i e river discharge by removing the dam reservoir impact of the lena river during the 1959 2007 period shiklomanov 2010 the results showed that the temporal variations in annual winter streamflow are quite close between observed and naturalized values although there is a difference between the observed and naturalised values wang et al 2021a this suggests that the observed river discharge can be used to analyse the response of winter streamflow to natural variations for river basins that have a limited number of dams daily ground temperature tsoil c observation data from 1980 to 2013 at

annual streamflow and climatic variables during the period from 1980 to 2019 the lena river had the largest annual mean streamflow 17 98 103 m3 s followed by the mackenzie river 9 04 103 m3 s the yukon river 6 62 103 m3 s and the kolyma river 3 26 103 m3 s nevertheless considering the different drainage areas of river basins the yukon river and mackenzie river have the highest 252 mm and lowest 171 mm annual runoff respectively the average annual runoff of the lena river and the kolyma river are 234 mm and 196 mm respectively during the study period the streamflow of all four rivers showed positive trends that is 9 48 mm decade p 0 05 10 53 mm decade p 0 05 1 98 mm decade p 0 05 and 5 19 mm decade p 0 05 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers respectively table 1 it can be seen that over the past 40 years the annual streamflow increased significantly in the lena and mackenzie rivers while the increasing trend in annual streamflows for the kolyma and yukon rivers were not significant there are notable differences in the mean annual air temperatures mats among the four basins with values of 9 35 c 12 14 c 5 37 c and 3 69 c during the period from 1980 to 2019 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins respectively table 1 the warming rates of the lena kolyma and yukon basins over the past 40 years were 0 42 c decade p 0 001 0 57 c decade p 0 001 and 0 38 c decade p 0 01 respectively this confirms the effect of arctic amplification wherein the most significant warming occurs in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere as noted in ipcc ar6 masson delmotte et al 2021 additionally the warming rates are noticeably larger in the winter than during the annual period table 2 and fig 3 the mean annual precipitation map in the kolyma river basin 298 mm is much lower than those in the lena and yukon both approximately 353 mm river basins and the mackenzie river basin has the highest map of 407 mm although the annual precipitation did not change noticeably in these four arctic river basins over the past 40 years the nonwinter precipitation decreased considerably while the winter precipitation increased significantly table 2 precipitation in the lena river basin changed the most as it decreased at a rate of 28 42 mm 11 37 per decade p 0 001 in nonwinter and increased at a rate of 26 05 mm 25 54 per decade p 0 001 in winter the nonwinter precipitation decreased at a rate of approximately 7 p 0 05 per decade in the kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins while winter precipitation increased by 19 74 11 84 and 15 43 per decade all p 0 001 respectively overall the average annual temperature exhibited a statistically significant increasing trend in three of the four river basins lena kolyma yukon over the past 40 years during the same period a statistically significant increasing trend in annual streamflow was observed for the kolyma and yukon rivers the temporal changes in precipitation exhibited a more complex pattern that is precipitation generally experienced a decreasing trend during nonwinter periods while it showed an increasing trend during winter periods 3 2 spatio temporal variations in winter streamflow the proportion of winter streamflow qw to annual streamflow q varies considerably among the four river basins from 5 4 to 21 6 of table 1 notably the streamflow of the mackenzie river is the lowest 171 mm yr among these study basins however its winter streamflow is as high as 37 mm yr which is higher than those of the lena 21 mm yr and kolyma 10 mm yr rivers during the period from 1980 to 2019 winter streamflow increased much faster than the annual streamflow the increasing rates of qw from 1980 to 2019 were 1 7 5 2 times greater than the rate of increase in q table 3 additionally the river basins with larger percentages of continuous permafrost showed a stronger increasing trend in winter streamflow that is the increasing rates of qw from 1980 to 2019 varied significantly at 72 37 p 0 05 42 87 p 0 001 16 29 p 0 001 for the kolyma lena mackenzie river basins respectively and their corresponding percentages of continuous permafrost areas were approximately 95 0 66 7 and 27 9 table 1 respectively for the multiyear trends the qw in these four arctic basins increased by 1 42 2 39 mm per decade among the four basins the coldest the kolyma river basin had the highest rate of increase in winter streamflow at 72 4 over the past 40 years table 3 and the increase in winter streamflow was more significant in the lena river basin which showed rapid active layer changes than that of the mackenzie river basin table 4 meanwhile the changes in streamflow during the three different winter periods i e early mid and late winter vary considerably and vary among the four river basins generally qew accounted for most of the total winter streamflow 37 8 49 9 while qlw was the lowest for the kolyma river streamflow nearly doubled in early winter increased by 91 61 but the increasing trends during mid and late winter from 1980 to 2019 were not significant qmw in the lena river basin increased more significantly 46 72 than those in early winter 41 68 and late winter 38 67 however the streamflow in the mackenzie river increased relatively evenly throughout winter 4 discussion 4 1 temperature warming drives increased winter streamflow 4 1 1 response of winter streamflow to temperature warming the space for time substitution approach is usually used to understand temporal processes in static spatial datasets assuming that spatial and temporal variation are equivalent pickett 1989 here we used this approach to evaluate the effects of climatic factors t and p on qw considering the four basins as a whole hydrological system compared with annual streamflow qw exhibited a higher correlation with t and p for four arctic river basins in the past 40 years changes in qw are highly sensitive to changes in t but less responsive to changes in p fig 4 a a b b generally a 1 degree increase in t results in an 11 3 increase in qw r2 0 77 and 10 4 r2 0 52 11 0 r2 0 75 and 13 5 r2 0 87 increases in qew qmw and qlw respectively fig 4 b c d e our results confirmed the increase in winter streamflow and its positive response to warming table 1 and fig 4 such an increasing winter streamflow has been documented in discontinuous liu et al 2011 morse and wolfe 2017 patchy lu et al 2014 isolated and sporadic frolova et al 2017 permafrost regions across the northern hemisphere 4 1 2 increased winter streamflow due to permafrost thawing comparing the soil temperature tsoil changes between the 1980 1996 and 1997 2013 periods at meteorological stations with the world meteorological organization wmo no 24966 in the lena river basin and meteorological station wmo no 25400 in the kolyma river basin fig 1 shows that tsoil has been affected by climate warming in recent decades at both seasonal fig 5 a b and multiyear scales fig 5 c d ground warming has mainly occurred between depths of 0 cm and 100 cm in early winter and deepened constantly in mid and late winter an increase in tsoil below a depth of 150 cm has mainly occurred in mid and late winter for the selected meteorological station of the kolyma river basin while for the selected meteorological station of the lena river basin it occurred in late winter and spring from april to june among the different driving factors for increased winter streamflow one of the most important factors is the increasing ground temperature based on the tsoil data we found that the underground temperature is increasing inhomogeneously fig 5 although changes in tsoil are more notable in winter tsoil exhibited large spatial variations due to soil heterogeneities such an uneven ground warming results in permafrost degradation with an alt increase peng et al 2018 previous studies indicated that the permafrost thawing promotes the winter streamflow by enhancing the groundwater circulation biskaborn et al 2019 duan et al 2017 evans et al 2020 makarieva et al 2019 wang et al 2021a the volume of dynamic permafrost thawing δ v dy shows a notable correlation with winter streamflow and each of its stages i e early mid and late winter fig 6 in general the greater the volume of permafrost degradation is the faster the rate of increase of winter streamflow as alt thickens gradually 2 1 3 2 cm decade as shown in table 1 permafrost thawing leads to an increase in qwin which is indicated by the significant correlation between permafrost degradation and qwin fig 6 this is probably one instance of evidence that the meltwater from permafrost degradation replenishes the winter streamflow fig 7 ① 4 1 3 increased winter streamflow due to changes in the ice regime of the rivers climate warming can also lead to winter streamflow changes by influencing the ice regime of rivers fig 7 ② during the period from 1979 to 2009 the mean annual pan arctic river ice volume decreased by 0 5 due to climate warming park et al 2016b the decrease in river ice thickness is mainly converted to streamflow frolova et al 2017 obyazov and smakhtin 2013 and causes a higher winter streamflow makarieva et al 2019 moreover climate warming prolongs the freeze free period in high latitude regions zhong et al 2021 which further reduces the seasonal freezing depth and allows more water storage and pathways for the groundwater during the winter streletskiy et al 2015 thus ultimately increasing winter streamflow late winter streamflow qlw was the most sensitive to temperature changes fig 4 e i this may be because river ice and frozen soil are in the most stable freezing status during late winter ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 as a result the increases of later winter streamflow are mainly caused by groundwater discharge from long term permafrost thawing evans et al 2015 ge et al 2011 walvoord et al 2012 however quantifying the influence of changes in the ice regime of the rivers on the winter streamflow still needs further investigations although river ice is measurably declining at a global scale yang et al 2020 the overall shortening of ice cover periods in recent decades for arctic rivers pavelsky and smith 2004 has large spatial variability our results show that river ice duration of the yukon river decreased at a rate of 5 4 days decade during the period from 1969 to 1993 with a delay in ice on and an advance in ice off while the mackenzie river basin experienced a shortened river ice duration by only 1 1 days per decade during the 1956 1992 period fig 8 in addition other factors such as the differences of river ice roughness may have a varying impact on winter streamflow ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 4 2 precipitation enhances winter streamflow increasing precipitation is projected to increase at 4 5 per degree of warming in the arctic with seasonal variations bintanja and selten 2014 increased precipitation under warming conditions chen and wang 2021 wang et al 2021b is believed to be the other important driver of increased streamflow in arctic rivers wang et al 2021a its influences on winter streamflow are mainly due to the change in precipitation phases and rainwater infiltration fig 7 ④ ⑤ on the one hand the shift in precipitation from snowfall to rainfall during autumn winter periods bintanja and andry 2017 makarieva et al 2019 could directly increase the streamflow ionita et al 2014 on the other hand the deepening of the active layer and the reduction in the seasonal freezing depth allow more precipitation to enter into the subsurface aquifer streletskiy et al 2015 correspondingly the active layer will be further deepened by enhancing precipitation heat transfer and ground thermal conductivity mekonnen et al 2021 thus the underlying soil moisture increases zhang et al 2013 when the groundwater movement is enhanced walvoord and striegl 2007 in early winter the streamflow in the selected four river basins was still affected by synchronous precipitation fig 4 r2 in g is larger than c as previous studies have indicated ionita et al 2014 troy et al 2012 but in mid and late winter such effects almost disappeared fig 4 r2 in h and i is larger than that in d and e instead the delayed effect of infiltrated precipitation of the year can be observed in mid and late winter fig 4 d e however the precipitation of two months before winter pls affects the qew more fig 4 k therefore qew accounted for nearly half of the winter streamflow table 3 and its increase is also likely related to two month precipitation changes in late summer furthermore changes in precipitation could in turn affect the regional snow depth and snow cover duration thus indirectly influencing the river ice thickness park et al 2016b and affecting the winter streamflow moreover spatial heterogeneities in precipitation could always result in different winter streamflow responses to climate change and permafrost degradation for example regional snow depth in western north america generally decreases dyer and mote 2006 but increases in siberia bulygina et al 2009 and such different trends in snow cover results in opposite effects on river ice which leads to variable changes in winter streamflow 4 3 uncertainties in winter streamflow analysis it is important to note that the results derived in this study are based on the observations of winter streamflow streamflow measurements generally have errors on the order of 3 6 which is even larger due to the frozen surface in winter sauer and meyer 1992 as indicated by shiklomanov et al 2006 the mean relative error in daily winter discharge is significant during ice affected periods however this error will decrease on the seasonal scale for the arctic river basins the changes in streamflow are caused by both anthropic factors such as dam construction and natural variations ye et al 2003 however the impact from reservoir regulation is relatively small compared with the magnitude of the increase in annual discharge mcclelland et al 2004 in this study we carefully selected four river basins which are less effected by reservoir regulations ahmed et al 2020 in our opinion although there are some uncertainties in the observed winter streamflow data due to changes in hydraulic morphological conditions of the river flow and random errors associated with discharge measurements shiklomanov et al 2006 as well as data quality and time series selection it can still be assumed that this does not affect the main conclusions furthermore the winter streamflow generation is a complex process and factors that affect the winter streamflow such as snow cover precipitation phase permafrost degradation and river ice thickness and roughness are correlated and interact with each other pi et al 2021 sergeant et al 2021 another factor contributing to the uncertainty in winter streamflow analysis is the nonlinearity of the storage discharge relationship dominated by topography and landscape heterogeneity according to gao et al 2021a which is enhanced in permafrost dominated sub arctic river basins hinzman et al 2020 additionally permafrost degradation also has significant interbasin variability and internal basin heterogeneity table 4 which affect the streamflow changes during winter in addition there are also some factors that cannot be ignored for example the teleconnections between climate oscillations and rivers might be one of the reasons for the complex and different responses of winter streamflow to climate factor variations in arctic river basins analogous to other rivers in the northern hemisphere the water supply of these four arctic rivers is also affected by the el niño southern oscillation enso and the arctic oscillation ao fleming and dahlke 2014 with the river ice break time likely associated with the pacific decadal oscillation pavelsky and smith 2004 therefore a full understanding of mechanisms behind the uneven increases of early mid and late winter streamflow in high latitudes requires further investigation 5 conclusions in this study we attempted to identify and understand the mechanisms of uneven winter streamflow increases of four permafrost dominated arctic rivers lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie based on analyses of long term meteorological and hydrological data 1980 2019 the results showed that increases in winter streamflow were 1 7 5 2 times greater than the increases in annual streamflow over the past 40 years the observed temporal change trends in the early mid and late winter streamflow confirm that the winter streamflow change is uneven with a greater increase in early and mid winter this increase in winter streamflow is mainly influenced by changes in temperature and precipitation including both synchronous and delayed effects among them temperature affects winter streamflow mainly by directly changing the soil sediment freezing thawing cycle while precipitation mainly by strengthening the water cycle process comparison of the three winter stages early mid and late winter in the four basins indicated that the increase in winter streamflow is more pronounced in the continuous permafrost developed arctic river basins among these river basins the late winter streamflow had the lowest discharge but it was most sensitive to temperature variations which can be considered an indicator of the warming effect on a long time scale river discharge during the early winter is much larger than those in mid and late winter and changes in precipitation during the late summer september october can be reflected in the early winter streamflow to some extent however the delayed effect of annual precipitation is mainly reflected in mid and late winter after its movement as part of the groundwater as winter streamflow reflects the gradual processes of the hydrological cycle its increase is the result of the combined effects of permafrost degradation river ice reduction and snow melt under climate warming conditions the mechanism of influence is different for each winter stage and cannot be directly regarded as the result of a unified process therefore under the influence of different uncertainty factors strengthening the monitoring and modelling of the cold region hydrological cycle with the inclusion of non linear freeze thaw processes is necessary in arctic basins with developed permafrost credit authorship contribution statement pw sl jy and spp designed the study sl pw hc qh tw and yz collected and analysed the data pw

3658,the increasing winter streamflow of major arctic rivers has been well documented however the contribution of climate change to winter streamflow and associated mechanisms of streamflow generation during early mid and late winter are not fully understood among the arctic rivers we selected four rivers with relatively few dam effects lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers and analysed their climate change related responses in streamflow during early mid and late winter our results showed that the winter streamflow qwin of the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers increased from 1980 to 2019 by approximately 43 72 16 and 16 1 7 5 2 times greater than increases in annual streamflow respectively in general the rate of streamflow increase was the greatest in early winter followed by mid and late winter the streamflow in late winter was particularly sensitive to air temperature changes and permafrost degradation due to rising temperatures is likely a major factor driving late winter streamflow increases in contrast to late winter streamflow the larger rate of increase in early winter streamflow can be mainly attributed to the additional influence of increased late summer precipitation on streamflow generation the different change rates in winter streamflow among the four river basins are highly determined by permafrost degradation and related baseflow discharge processes under warming climate conditions winter streamflow generation is strongly associated with the enhanced hydrological cycle that is apparent in both the surface e g precipitation and river ice and the subsurface the active layer and groundwater discharge keywords winter streamflow climate warming precipitation permafrost arctic rivers 1 introduction against the background of climate warming conditions the average annual streamflow of the six largest eurasian rivers increased by approximately 7 from 1936 to 1999 peterson et al 2002 which was shown to be significant even in basins with permafrost tananaev et al 2016 for example the annual streamflow of the lena river a permafrost dominated drainage basin increased by 22 over the last 84 years wang et al 2021a increased streamflow has resulted in a significant increase in the export of riverine heat fluxes park et al 2020 yang et al 2021 organic carbon and mercury to the arctic ocean mu et al 2019 walvoord and striegl 2007 most arctic and sub arctic regions are underlain by permafrost obu et al 2019 zhang et al 1999 increased precipitation and permafrost degradation were considered the main reasons for the increase in streamflow in the cold northern regions wang et al 2021a previous studies have shown that intensified precipitation historically contributed the most to the increased arctic river streamflow e g rawlins et al 2009 wu et al 2005 in basins with permafrost winter streamflow is particularly sensitive to climate warming via permafrost thawing which enhances groundwater discharge to streamflow evans et al 2020 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 wang et al 2021a thus permafrost thawing which may be further strengthened with continuous climate warming is postulated to be an important contributor to increasing streamflow in cold regions gao et al 2021b ma et al 2019 song et al 2020 diagnosing the contributions of climate warming and associated permafrost thaw to streamflow is important for gaining insights into the regional water cycle patterns and for better predicting hydrological responses to future climate change because winter precipitation exists in the form of snow cover in cold regions surface runoff during winter is extremely low thus winter streamflow mostly derives from baseflow st jacques and sauchyn 2009 which is generally associated with the thermal state of the active layer recent studies have shown that the total winter streamflow between december and february for the four largest arctic rivers ob yenisei lena and mackenzie rivers increased by 1 3 from 1980 to 2009 ahmed et al 2020 increased winter streamflow in recent decades has most likely resulted from groundwater input enhanced by permafrost thawing brabets and walvoord 2009 o donnell et al 2012 therefore winter streamflow is generally associated with the spatial extent of permafrost evans et al 2020 and the intensity of seasonal ground thawing freezing processes other studies have suggested that increases in winter streamflow are also likely associated with a shift in precipitation from snow to rain in late autumn which consequently increases streamflow in the early winter period makarieva et al 2019 streletskiy et al 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 a comprehensive review and an updated research processes of arctic hydrology science was recently given in yang and kane 2021 for the pan arctic region winter lasts for half a year from november to the following april lesack et al 2013 streletskiy et al 2015 it remains unclear how streamflow changes throughout the winter and how the changes in temperature precipitation and permafrost degradation affect winter streamflow variations in arctic rivers therefore considering the seasonal change of air temperature we divided the winter period into three stages i e early middle and late according to wegner et al 2017 then we made a first attempt to detect the sub seasonal variation characteristics of winter streamflow and the predominant driving factors in each stage four arctic rivers i e the lena mackenzie yukon and kolyma rivers that are relatively less affected by artificial flow regulation than the other arctic rivers ahmed et al 2020 bobrovitskaya et al 2003 mcclelland et al 2004 raymond et al 2007 were selected for this study the objectives of this study are to i examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of multiyear variations in winter streamflow of four arctic rivers during the period 1980 2019 and ii reveal the potential mechanistic causes of various responses of winter streamflow to climate factors temperature and precipitation during early mid and late winter in permafrost dominated pan arctic basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area to investigate the impact of climate changes and permafrost conditions on winter streamflow four major arctic rivers including the lena and kolyma in eurasia and the yukon and mackenzie in north america were selected in this study based on the coverage of permafrost fig 1 the river lengths are approximately 4260 2410 3190 and 5472 km brabets and walvoord 2009 majhi and yang 2008 motovilov 2017 rood et al 2017 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins respectively these four arctic river basins have a total area at gauging stations of approximately 2 43 million 0 53 million 0 83 million and 1 68 million km2 with population densities of 0 45 0 12 0 18 and 0 27 people km2 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers respectively holmes et al 2012 the lena and kolyma river basins each have only one major dam mcclelland et al 2004 i e the vilyuiskoe 1967 with a 35 9 km3 storage capacity in the lena river basin in the upper vilui valley ye et al 2003 ye et al 2009 and the kolymskoye 1986 with volume of 10 km3 in the kolyma river basin majhi and yang 2008 mcclelland et al 2004 there are no large dams in the yukon river basin yang et al 2014 and there are only small dams such as the w a c bennett dam 1968 and the peace canyon dam 1975 in the mackenzie river basin rood et al 2017 the summary characteristics of the four selected arctic river basins are given in table 1 2 2 data daily discharge q mm data for the

selected recent 40 year discharge data spanning 1980 to 2019 for analysis the kyusyur gauging station of the lena river basin is located in the upstream of the lena delta fedorova et al 2015 and the kolymskoe gauging station is approximately 310 km from the mouth of the kolyma river welp et al 2005 the pilot station of the yukon river basin is the downstream gauging station of this river before entering the delta dornblaser and striegl 2009 the gauging station of the arctic red river is located downstream of the mackenzie river and approximately 90 of the river water supplied to the delta from the mackenzie river is above the arctic red river station emmerton et al 2008 to assess the potential impacts of dams on winter streamflow we compared the observed and naturalised daily discharge i e river discharge by removing the dam reservoir impact of the lena river during the 1959 2007 period shiklomanov 2010 the results showed that the temporal variations in annual winter streamflow are quite close between observed and naturalized values although there is a difference between the observed and naturalised values wang et al 2021a this suggests that the observed river discharge can be used to analyse the response of winter streamflow to natural variations for river basins that have a limited number of dams daily ground temperature tsoil c observation data from 1980 to 2013 at

annual streamflow and climatic variables during the period from 1980 to 2019 the lena river had the largest annual mean streamflow 17 98 103 m3 s followed by the mackenzie river 9 04 103 m3 s the yukon river 6 62 103 m3 s and the kolyma river 3 26 103 m3 s nevertheless considering the different drainage areas of river basins the yukon river and mackenzie river have the highest 252 mm and lowest 171 mm annual runoff respectively the average annual runoff of the lena river and the kolyma river are 234 mm and 196 mm respectively during the study period the streamflow of all four rivers showed positive trends that is 9 48 mm decade p 0 05 10 53 mm decade p 0 05 1 98 mm decade p 0 05 and 5 19 mm decade p 0 05 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers respectively table 1 it can be seen that over the past 40 years the annual streamflow increased significantly in the lena and mackenzie rivers while the increasing trend in annual streamflows for the kolyma and yukon rivers were not significant there are notable differences in the mean annual air temperatures mats among the four basins with values of 9 35 c 12 14 c 5 37 c and 3 69 c during the period from 1980 to 2019 for the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins respectively table 1 the warming rates of the lena kolyma and yukon basins over the past 40 years were 0 42 c decade p 0 001 0 57 c decade p 0 001 and 0 38 c decade p 0 01 respectively this confirms the effect of arctic amplification wherein the most significant warming occurs in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere as noted in ipcc ar6 masson delmotte et al 2021 additionally the warming rates are noticeably larger in the winter than during the annual period table 2 and fig 3 the mean annual precipitation map in the kolyma river basin 298 mm is much lower than those in the lena and yukon both approximately 353 mm river basins and the mackenzie river basin has the highest map of 407 mm although the annual precipitation did not change noticeably in these four arctic river basins over the past 40 years the nonwinter precipitation decreased considerably while the winter precipitation increased significantly table 2 precipitation in the lena river basin changed the most as it decreased at a rate of 28 42 mm 11 37 per decade p 0 001 in nonwinter and increased at a rate of 26 05 mm 25 54 per decade p 0 001 in winter the nonwinter precipitation decreased at a rate of approximately 7 p 0 05 per decade in the kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins while winter precipitation increased by 19 74 11 84 and 15 43 per decade all p 0 001 respectively overall the average annual temperature exhibited a statistically significant increasing trend in three of the four river basins lena kolyma yukon over the past 40 years during the same period a statistically significant increasing trend in annual streamflow was observed for the kolyma and yukon rivers the temporal changes in precipitation exhibited a more complex pattern that is precipitation generally experienced a decreasing trend during nonwinter periods while it showed an increasing trend during winter periods 3 2 spatio temporal variations in winter streamflow the proportion of winter streamflow qw to annual streamflow q varies considerably among the four river basins from 5 4 to 21 6 of table 1 notably the streamflow of the mackenzie river is the lowest 171 mm yr among these study basins however its winter streamflow is as high as 37 mm yr which is higher than those of the lena 21 mm yr and kolyma 10 mm yr rivers during the period from 1980 to 2019 winter streamflow increased much faster than the annual streamflow the increasing rates of qw from 1980 to 2019 were 1 7 5 2 times greater than the rate of increase in q table 3 additionally the river basins with larger percentages of continuous permafrost showed a stronger increasing trend in winter streamflow that is the increasing rates of qw from 1980 to 2019 varied significantly at 72 37 p 0 05 42 87 p 0 001 16 29 p 0 001 for the kolyma lena mackenzie river basins respectively and their corresponding percentages of continuous permafrost areas were approximately 95 0 66 7 and 27 9 table 1 respectively for the multiyear trends the qw in these four arctic basins increased by 1 42 2 39 mm per decade among the four basins the coldest the kolyma river basin had the highest rate of increase in winter streamflow at 72 4 over the past 40 years table 3 and the increase in winter streamflow was more significant in the lena river basin which showed rapid active layer changes than that of the mackenzie river basin table 4 meanwhile the changes in streamflow during the three different winter periods i e early mid and late winter vary considerably and vary among the four river basins generally qew accounted for most of the total winter streamflow 37 8 49 9 while qlw was the lowest for the kolyma river streamflow nearly doubled in early winter increased by 91 61 but the increasing trends during mid and late winter from 1980 to 2019 were not significant qmw in the lena river basin increased more significantly 46 72 than those in early winter 41 68 and late winter 38 67 however the streamflow in the mackenzie river increased relatively evenly throughout winter 4 discussion 4 1 temperature warming drives increased winter streamflow 4 1 1 response of winter streamflow to temperature warming the space for time substitution approach is usually used to understand temporal processes in static spatial datasets assuming that spatial and temporal variation are equivalent pickett 1989 here we used this approach to evaluate the effects of climatic factors t and p on qw considering the four basins as a whole hydrological system compared with annual streamflow qw exhibited a higher correlation with t and p for four arctic river basins in the past 40 years changes in qw are highly sensitive to changes in t but less responsive to changes in p fig 4 a a b b generally a 1 degree increase in t results in an 11 3 increase in qw r2 0 77 and 10 4 r2 0 52 11 0 r2 0 75 and 13 5 r2 0 87 increases in qew qmw and qlw respectively fig 4 b c d e our results confirmed the increase in winter streamflow and its positive response to warming table 1 and fig 4 such an increasing winter streamflow has been documented in discontinuous liu et al 2011 morse and wolfe 2017 patchy lu et al 2014 isolated and sporadic frolova et al 2017 permafrost regions across the northern hemisphere 4 1 2 increased winter streamflow due to permafrost thawing comparing the soil temperature tsoil changes between the 1980 1996 and 1997 2013 periods at meteorological stations with the world meteorological organization wmo no 24966 in the lena river basin and meteorological station wmo no 25400 in the kolyma river basin fig 1 shows that tsoil has been affected by climate warming in recent decades at both seasonal fig 5 a b and multiyear scales fig 5 c d ground warming has mainly occurred between depths of 0 cm and 100 cm in early winter and deepened constantly in mid and late winter an increase in tsoil below a depth of 150 cm has mainly occurred in mid and late winter for the selected meteorological station of the kolyma river basin while for the selected meteorological station of the lena river basin it occurred in late winter and spring from april to june among the different driving factors for increased winter streamflow one of the most important factors is the increasing ground temperature based on the tsoil data we found that the underground temperature is increasing inhomogeneously fig 5 although changes in tsoil are more notable in winter tsoil exhibited large spatial variations due to soil heterogeneities such an uneven ground warming results in permafrost degradation with an alt increase peng et al 2018 previous studies indicated that the permafrost thawing promotes the winter streamflow by enhancing the groundwater circulation biskaborn et al 2019 duan et al 2017 evans et al 2020 makarieva et al 2019 wang et al 2021a the volume of dynamic permafrost thawing δ v dy shows a notable correlation with winter streamflow and each of its stages i e early mid and late winter fig 6 in general the greater the volume of permafrost degradation is the faster the rate of increase of winter streamflow as alt thickens gradually 2 1 3 2 cm decade as shown in table 1 permafrost thawing leads to an increase in qwin which is indicated by the significant correlation between permafrost degradation and qwin fig 6 this is probably one instance of evidence that the meltwater from permafrost degradation replenishes the winter streamflow fig 7 ① 4 1 3 increased winter streamflow due to changes in the ice regime of the rivers climate warming can also lead to winter streamflow changes by influencing the ice regime of rivers fig 7 ② during the period from 1979 to 2009 the mean annual pan arctic river ice volume decreased by 0 5 due to climate warming park et al 2016b the decrease in river ice thickness is mainly converted to streamflow frolova et al 2017 obyazov and smakhtin 2013 and causes a higher winter streamflow makarieva et al 2019 moreover climate warming prolongs the freeze free period in high latitude regions zhong et al 2021 which further reduces the seasonal freezing depth and allows more water storage and pathways for the groundwater during the winter streletskiy et al 2015 thus ultimately increasing winter streamflow late winter streamflow qlw was the most sensitive to temperature changes fig 4 e i this may be because river ice and frozen soil are in the most stable freezing status during late winter ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 as a result the increases of later winter streamflow are mainly caused by groundwater discharge from long term permafrost thawing evans et al 2015 ge et al 2011 walvoord et al 2012 however quantifying the influence of changes in the ice regime of the rivers on the winter streamflow still needs further investigations although river ice is measurably declining at a global scale yang et al 2020 the overall shortening of ice cover periods in recent decades for arctic rivers pavelsky and smith 2004 has large spatial variability our results show that river ice duration of the yukon river decreased at a rate of 5 4 days decade during the period from 1969 to 1993 with a delay in ice on and an advance in ice off while the mackenzie river basin experienced a shortened river ice duration by only 1 1 days per decade during the 1956 1992 period fig 8 in addition other factors such as the differences of river ice roughness may have a varying impact on winter streamflow ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 4 2 precipitation enhances winter streamflow increasing precipitation is projected to increase at 4 5 per degree of warming in the arctic with seasonal variations bintanja and selten 2014 increased precipitation under warming conditions chen and wang 2021 wang et al 2021b is believed to be the other important driver of increased streamflow in arctic rivers wang et al 2021a its influences on winter streamflow are mainly due to the change in precipitation phases and rainwater infiltration fig 7 ④ ⑤ on the one hand the shift in precipitation from snowfall to rainfall during autumn winter periods bintanja and andry 2017 makarieva et al 2019 could directly increase the streamflow ionita et al 2014 on the other hand the deepening of the active layer and the reduction in the seasonal freezing depth allow more precipitation to enter into the subsurface aquifer streletskiy et al 2015 correspondingly the active layer will be further deepened by enhancing precipitation heat transfer and ground thermal conductivity mekonnen et al 2021 thus the underlying soil moisture increases zhang et al 2013 when the groundwater movement is enhanced walvoord and striegl 2007 in early winter the streamflow in the selected four river basins was still affected by synchronous precipitation fig 4 r2 in g is larger than c as previous studies have indicated ionita et al 2014 troy et al 2012 but in mid and late winter such effects almost disappeared fig 4 r2 in h and i is larger than that in d and e instead the delayed effect of infiltrated precipitation of the year can be observed in mid and late winter fig 4 d e however the precipitation of two months before winter pls affects the qew more fig 4 k therefore qew accounted for nearly half of the winter streamflow table 3 and its increase is also likely related to two month precipitation changes in late summer furthermore changes in precipitation could in turn affect the regional snow depth and snow cover duration thus indirectly influencing the river ice thickness park et al 2016b and affecting the winter streamflow moreover spatial heterogeneities in precipitation could always result in different winter streamflow responses to climate change and permafrost degradation for example regional snow depth in western north america generally decreases dyer and mote 2006 but increases in siberia bulygina et al 2009 and such different trends in snow cover results in opposite effects on river ice which leads to variable changes in winter streamflow 4 3 uncertainties in winter streamflow analysis it is important to note that the results derived in this study are based on the observations of winter streamflow streamflow measurements generally have errors on the order of 3 6 which is even larger due to the frozen surface in winter sauer and meyer 1992 as indicated by shiklomanov et al 2006 the mean relative error in daily winter discharge is significant during ice affected periods however this error will decrease on the seasonal scale for the arctic river basins the changes in streamflow are caused by both anthropic factors such as dam construction and natural variations ye et al 2003 however the impact from reservoir regulation is relatively small compared with the magnitude of the increase in annual discharge mcclelland et al 2004 in this study we carefully selected four river basins which are less effected by reservoir regulations ahmed et al 2020 in our opinion although there are some uncertainties in the observed winter streamflow data due to changes in hydraulic morphological conditions of the river flow and random errors associated with discharge measurements shiklomanov et al 2006 as well as data quality and time series selection it can still be assumed that this does not affect the main conclusions furthermore the winter streamflow generation is a complex process and factors that affect the winter streamflow such as snow cover precipitation phase permafrost degradation and river ice thickness and roughness are correlated and interact with each other pi et al 2021 sergeant et al 2021 another factor contributing to the uncertainty in winter streamflow analysis is the nonlinearity of the storage discharge relationship dominated by topography and landscape heterogeneity according to gao et al 2021a which is enhanced in permafrost dominated sub arctic river basins hinzman et al 2020 additionally permafrost degradation also has significant interbasin variability and internal basin heterogeneity table 4 which affect the streamflow changes during winter in addition there are also some factors that cannot be ignored for example the teleconnections between climate oscillations and rivers might be one of the reasons for the complex and different responses of winter streamflow to climate factor variations in arctic river basins analogous to other rivers in the northern hemisphere the water supply of these four arctic rivers is also affected by the el niño southern oscillation enso and the arctic oscillation ao fleming and dahlke 2014 with the river ice break time likely associated with the pacific decadal oscillation pavelsky and smith 2004 therefore a full understanding of mechanisms behind the uneven increases of early mid and late winter streamflow in high latitudes requires further investigation 5 conclusions in this study we attempted to identify and understand the mechanisms of uneven winter streamflow increases of four permafrost dominated arctic rivers lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie based on analyses of long term meteorological and hydrological data 1980 2019 the results showed that increases in winter streamflow were 1 7 5 2 times greater than the increases in annual streamflow over the past 40 years the observed temporal change trends in the early mid and late winter streamflow confirm that the winter streamflow change is uneven with a greater increase in early and mid winter this increase in winter streamflow is mainly influenced by changes in temperature and precipitation including both synchronous and delayed effects among them temperature affects winter streamflow mainly by directly changing the soil sediment freezing thawing cycle while precipitation mainly by strengthening the water cycle process comparison of the three winter stages early mid and late winter in the four basins indicated that the increase in winter streamflow is more pronounced in the continuous permafrost developed arctic river basins among these river basins the late winter streamflow had the lowest discharge but it was most sensitive to temperature variations which can be considered an indicator of the warming effect on a long time scale river discharge during the early winter is much larger than those in mid and late winter and changes in precipitation during the late summer september october can be reflected in the early winter streamflow to some extent however the delayed effect of annual precipitation is mainly reflected in mid and late winter after its movement as part of the groundwater as winter streamflow reflects the gradual processes of the hydrological cycle its increase is the result of the combined effects of permafrost degradation river ice reduction and snow melt under climate warming conditions the mechanism of influence is different for each winter stage and cannot be directly regarded as the result of a unified process therefore under the influence of different uncertainty factors strengthening the monitoring and modelling of the cold region hydrological cycle with the inclusion of non linear freeze thaw processes is necessary in arctic basins with developed permafrost credit authorship contribution statement pw sl jy and spp designed the study sl pw hc qh tw and yz collected and analysed the data pw

3659,deforestation has been reported to increase annual streamflow baseflow and sediment load in many parts of the world however studies about the hydrological effects of deforestation are scant in the tropical monsoon region in this study these effects were examined in the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb which is a typical tropical monsoon basin and is an important area of water resources in thailand a significant breakpoint for annual streamflow and annual precipitation in the entire ucprb is identified as 1993 and this breakpoint is also identified for annual baseflow in most upstream sub basins during the past decades 1981 2015 significant increasing trend is detected in the annual suspended sediment load of the wang river sub basin land use maps generated by a ca markov model suggest that continuous deforestation occurred during the study period the contributions of climate change and deforestation to the hydrological and sedimentary changes are then attributed within the budyko framework precipitation increment dominates the annual streamflow increment in the entire ucprb and the annual baseflow increment in the ping river sub basin and deforestation dominates the annual streamflow increment in the upstream sub basins the annual baseflow increment in most of the upstream sub basins and the increasing suspended sediment load in the wang river sub basin the hydrological and sedimentary response to deforestation is then quantified in the entire ucprb one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow by 1 9 in the upstream sub basins one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow and annual baseflow by 2 5 5 4 and 2 6 6 7 respectively one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual suspended sediment load by 8 7 these findings will help develop better understanding of land use management in the ucprb for water soil conservation keywords climate change deforestation streamflow change baseflow change sediment change 1 introduction the tropics covers one fifth of the global area and produce more runoff than any other climate regions fekete et al 2002 in the tropics deforestation has become an important issue for decades and is most serious in southeast asia and amazon over the world gibbs et al 2010 hansen et al 2013 hansen et al 2009 in recent years the deforestation rate in most countries in southeast asia shows a significant increasing trend hansen et al 2013 qin et al 2019 which have decreased the local precipitation and may exacerbate the changes in high flows and soil erosion kanae et al 2001 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 valentin et al 2008 a comprehensive understanding on the effects of deforestation on runoff and sediment in southeast asia is required for better soil water conservation and water resources management previous studies about the hydrological and sedimentary effects of deforestation mainly focused on the deforestation of the amazon forests zhang et al 2017 these studies believe that deforestation in the amazon rainforest will bring more streamflow coe et al 2009 coe et al 2011 costa et al 2003 and deforestation in the monsoon region of amazon will bring more streamflow and baseflow cavalcante et al 2019 hayhoe et al 2011 by decreasing evapotranspiration deforestation is also believed to bring more sediment due to less protection from canopy and understory during the sediment production process in both rainforest and monsoon region of amazon latuf and amaral 2016 however the hydrological effects of deforestation are also influenced by local watershed properties climate type and land cover after deforestation das et al 2018 knighton et al 2020 peña arancibia et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 which implies that the hydrological effects of deforestation depend on the local and regional biophysical and climate characteristics and the post forest land use compared to most of the basins in the amazon rainforest the large basins in southeast asia have substantially smaller runoff coefficients larger aridity index potential evaporation divided by precipitation and stronger seasonality in precipitation berghuijs et al 2017 coe et al 2009 takahashi and yasunari 2006 the post forest land use in the large basins of southeast asia has found to be mainly cropland for food production such as paddy fields and upland fields foley et al 2011 zeng et al 2018a while the post forest land use is found to be mainly pasture for cattle ranching and soybean cropping in the arc of deforestation of amazon cavalcante et al 2019 therefore the runoff response of deforestation in the southeast asian monsoon region might be different from that in the amazon tropical rainforest however there is still limited understanding between the answers to the limited studies of the response of annual streamflow baseflow and sediment to deforestation in the southeast asian monsoon region some modelling studies have been carried out on the forest change issues in this region wangpimool et al 2013 proposed three afforestation scenarios in the upper nan river basin and suggested that afforestation will increase dry season flow and decrease wet season flow meanwhile the change of annual streamflow is quite mild and the direction is determined by the trade off between decreasing wet season flow and increasing dry season flow khoi and suetsugi 2014 proposed three deforestation scenarios in the be river basin of vietnam and suggested that deforestation will decrease dry season flow and increase wet season flow while the annual streamflow is mildly amplified by the deforestation as for sediment load deforestation is found to increase sediment load both in wet season and dry season in the be river basin the limited observational studies however give different results wilk et al 2001 found that large scale deforestation from local forests to farm forests in the nam pong river basin had led to nearly no change in both annual streamflow and baseflow tebakari et al 2018 found strong increasing trend in both high flow and low flow in the upper nan river basin in the past 6 decades and suggested that a close relationship might exist between the large scale deforestation and a significant increasing trend in low flow in the nan river basin of thailand where the primary crop is corn zeng et al 2018b the negative relationship between forest cover and low flow is in contrast to the answers above while the negative relationship is not confirmed yet due to difficulties in obtaining the actual forest change tebakari et al 2018 therefore the historical annual streamflow baseflow and sediment response to deforestation in large tropical monsoon basins of southeast asia needs better understandings the objective of this research is to understand the impacts of deforestation on streamflow baseflow and sediment at a multiannual scale in the southeast asian tropical monsoon basins where forests are converted to paddy fields and upland fields to this end the ucprb is selected as a typical catchment located in the tropical monsoon region in the southeast asia the well gauged observation system makes the ucprb a good example for the studying of deforestation effects in such tropical regions the ucprb is mainly covered by forests paddy fields and upland fields with the three land use types covering 62 9 17 1 and 12 5 respectively based on the land use map in year 2005 in the past decades deforestation has been continuously reported in thailand kanae et al 2001 zeng et al 2018b and the deforestation has been accelerating in many southeast asian countries hansen et al 2013 kanae et al 2001 zeng et al 2018a zeng et al 2018b however the effects of the ongoing deforestation on streamflow baseflow and sediment load are still not studied and whether deforestation of the ucprb plays a more important role in the hydrological and sedimentary change still remains a question to be studied kiguchi et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the study is organized as follows the details of the study area and the data used in the research are presented in section 2 the methods used in this study are introduced in section 3 section 4 shows the long term hydrological and sedimentary change the spatiotemporal change of land use the streamflow baseflow and sediment response to deforestation and the contributions of deforestation and climate change to streamflow baseflow and sediment section 5 discusses the uncertainty of this analysis and the comparison with the previous studies the conclusions are then drawn in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb fig 1 is part of the chao phraya river basin located at the upstream of nakhon sawan which consists of the four main tributaries including the ping river the wang river the yom river and the nan river the jica report https openjicareport jica go jp pdf 11356094 04 pdf quantified the water resources in the sub basins of the chao phraya river basin and the ucprb makes up 64 of the total water resources of the chao phraya river therefore the ucprb is the major area of the water resources in the whole chao phraya river basin the ucprb receives an annual precipitation of about 1100 mm and generates an annual runoff of about 200 mm 90 of the annual precipitation falls during the wet season from april to october two peaks in precipitation occur in may and september and are dominated by indian summer monsoon and tropical cyclones respectively takahashi and yasunari 2006 the annual mean temperature is about 27 degrees celsius the temperature reaches its peak from april to may and reaches its lowest from december to the following january there are two large reservoirs in the ucprb the one built on the ping river in the 1960s is the bhumipol reservoir holding 13 5 billion cube meters the other one built on the nan river in the 1970s is the sirikit reservoir holding 9 5 billion cube meters as shown in fig 1 the four upper tributaries are mainly covered by forest and the plain region in the downstream reach is mainly covered by cropland paddy field and upland field the different land covers distinguish the hydrological behaviors in the different parts of the study area 2 2 data used in the study this study uses the meteorological observations from 1981 to 2015 including daily air temperature mean maxima and minima air pressure relative humidity sunshine duration and daily precipitation at 41 meteorological stations obtained from the royal meteorological department and additional 29 rain gauges obtained from the royal irrigation department see fig 1 for details windspeed is obtained from the noah gldas 2 0 reanalysis product the angular distance weighting interpolation with elevation correction mark et al 1999 yang et al 2004 is applied to the daily meteorological data to obtain 2 5 km resolution distributions and the potential evaporation pet is estimated by penman equation daily runoff and monthly suspended sediment load are both provided by the royal irrigation department daily runoff is obtained from 5 hydrological stations located on the ping river the wang river the yom river the nan river and the main stream of the chao phraya river from 1981 to 2015 and the daily runoff observations are then aggregated into monthly values monthly suspended sediment load data is from the wang river sub basin with the longest series from 1989 to 2014 this study uses the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scale hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 from the united states geological survey usgs the 90 m resolution dem is used to generate the river network in the study the river network generated by hydrosheds fits well with the river network provided by the royal irrigation department land use maps in year 2005 year 2010 and year 2015 are provided by the land development department of thailand http sql ldd go th ldddata mapsoilb1 html and are converted to raster files with a spatial resolution of 100 m the land use types are classified into 16 types in the original map and are then reclassified into 8 types in this study as in fig 1 see table 1 for details 3 methodologies 3 1 abrupt hydrological change and trend detection in this study the moving t test wang et al 2018 is employed to detect change points in the annual runoff series the moving t test is based on t test it applies the t test to the subseries with a fixed length before and after the potential change points herein the significance level is set as 0 05 which means that if the calculated t value is greater than the critical value 2 101 for a 10 year moving window in this study the point is then accepted as a change point at the significance of 0 05 mann kendall test is applied to detect the potential trends in the hydrological series kendall 1970 mann 1945 herein the significance level is set as 0 05 which means that if the calculated statistic is larger than 1 96 the potential trend is identified as a significant trend the double mass curve method is based on linear regression evaluation of hydrological time series wei and zhang 2010 accumulated precipitation and accumulated streamflow are thought to be strongly linearly correlated if the precipitation runoff relationship is stable the hydrological meaning of the slope on the double mass curve is runoff coefficient consequently the change of the slope in the double mass curve reflects the change of the precipitation runoff relationship which can be due to potential evaporation change or anthropogenic activities such as land use change the change of watershed properties is identified by the movement of state variables in the budyko space xu et al 2014 change of watershed properties should have little influence on streamflow change if the changes of state variables are along the budyko curve otherwise the streamflow change induced by changes of watershed properties is estimated based on the change of the watershed parameter of the budyko curve the budyko method will be further introduced in 3 3 3 2 generation of land use maps the land use change process during the study period is captured using the ca markov model the model is composed of two parts including the markov model and the ca model the markov model is applied to explain the quantification of conversion states and reveal the transfer rate between different land use types sang et al 2011 and the ca model is applied to modulate the spatial distribution of the different land use types the markov model is usually applied in a forward direction to predict the future land use as eq 1 muller and middleton 1994 1 m t 1 m lc m t where m t and m t 1 refers to the area distribution of period t and t 1 respectively m lc is the transition matrix representing the probability of land use transitions since the area of each land use type is more than 0 the rank of m t and m t 1 should both be the number of land use types and m lc should be invertible herein we need the historical land use maps from 1981 to 2015 therefore we use an inverse markov chain as eq 2 2 m t m lc inv m t the ca markov model is herein applied based on the ca markov module of idrisi software guan et al 2019 the land use maps of years 2015 and 2010 are selected to apply the markov chain and the transition matrix obtained from the markov chain is then modified by the transition matrix suggested by luh2 product hurtt et al 2020 the land use map of 2005 is taken as the ground truth to evaluate the obtained result the accuracy of the result is evaluated via the kappa indices cohen 1986 3 3 analysis framework of deforestation induced hydrology change the analysis framework is established via the budyko framework the budyko framework is a brief effective and widely used method to analyze hydrological change and its attributors various studies have used the budyko framework to analyze the streamflow response of climate change and human activities for a detailed explanation in attribution studies please see dey and mishra 2017 and references therein there are also some attempts to take baseflow or sediment yield into the budyko framework gnann et al 2019 neto et al 2020 wang and wu 2013 zhang et al 2019 and anthropogenic activities such as land use change have been considered into the parameterization of the budyko framework jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2001 nevertheless the parameterization of land use change such as deforestation may not be extended to the case in the monsoon region of southeast asia as the relationships established by previous studies are mainly set up by statistical methods in different climate zones therefore based on the parameterization of forest into the budyko framework in the ucprb a more precise knowledge about the hydrological response to climate change and deforestation can be derived the analysis framework is composed of four parts as fig 2 the quantification of the land use change in the ucprb in part 3 2 serves as the input of the framework the first part aims to quantify the streamflow response to climate change and deforestation and give an attribution analysis of annual streamflow change the second part aims to quantify the response of baseflow and direct flow fast flow component as the rest of streamflow except for baseflow to climate change and deforestation in the upstream sub basins the last part aims to estimate the sensitivity of suspended sediment load to deforestation and estimate the deforestation induced sediment change in the wang river sub basin 3 3 1 attribution analysis of annual streamflow change the existence of change points in annual streamflow is the integrated effect from the climate change impact and direct impacts of human activities including irrigation and intense land use changes in the ucprb as the precise information about irrigation is not available we herein suppose that the intensity of irrigation is determined by the area of paddy fields so land use change is chosen as the estimator of human activities elasticity method within budyko framework xu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 is herein applied to separate the streamflow change induced by land use change and climate change in the budyko framework mean annual evapotranspiration e is determined by mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet and mean annual precipitation p via the following relationship 3 r p e p f p pet n where n is a parameter controlling the separation from precipitation to evapotranspiration and streamflow the elasticity method supposes that the change of annual streamflow at multiannual scale is attributed into the change of annual precipitation annual potential evaporation rate and watershed properties as shown in eq 4 4 δ r r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t p e t ε n δ n n where ε p ε pet ε n are the streamflow elasticity coefficients corresponding to annual precipitation annual pet and watershed paremeter n standing for watershed properties in the case of choudhury equation change of watershed parameter n was always regarded as landscape change yang et al 2009 while as shown in previous studies rainfall intensity cong et al 2015 donohue et al 2012 is also a significant factor affecting annual streamflow consequently land use and rainfall intensity are chosen as the explanatory variable of watershed parameter n together via the following equation 5 log n α log f β log sdii γ where sdii is the mean annual simple daily intensity index sdii frich et al 2002 and f is the ratio of forest area and the total area sdii is defined as the average precipitation on wet days with wet days defined as days when daily precipitation exceeds 1 mm chen and knutson 2008 the relationship in eq 5 is estimated via a moving window method as in jiang et al 2015 which is explained more precisely in the supplementary material sm it is worthwhile mentioning that the precondition of forest serving as the indicator of land use is that strong linear relationship should exist between forest cover and other land use such as farmland based on eq 4 and eq 5 the attribution equation of streamflow change can be rewritten as 6 δ r r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t pet α ε n δ f f β ε n δ s d i i sdii where α ε n and β ε n are the streamflow elasticity of forest cover and rainfall intensity and is later referred to as ε f and ε sdii respectively streamflow change induced by climate change δ r c and forest cover change δ r f are then attributed as 7a δ r c r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t pet ε sdii δ s d i i sdii 7b δ r f r ε f δ f f based on the choudhury equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 the streamflow elasticity coefficients are estimated by a set of equations as eq 8 xu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 8a ε p 1 1 1 pet p n 1 1 pet p n 1 n 8b ε pet 1 1 pet p n 1 1 pet p n 1 n 8c ε n p pet p p

baseflow budyko curve is not enough to capture basins with varying underlying conditions herein we use a set of baseflow boyko curves to estimate the deforestation induced baseflow change the attribution analysis of annual baseflow change is composed of two steps including baseflow separation and attribution analysis to minimize the uncertainties in the baseflow separation step zhang et al 2020 we estimate daily baseflow by a combination of four filters daily direct flow and baseflow series are separated by the average of four filters including the lh79 filter lyne and hollick 1979 the c91 filer chapman 1991 cm96 filter chapman and maxwell 1996 and eck05 filter eckhardt 2005 the average of the four series is set as a benchmark for the estimation and analysis of baseflow change the benchmark baseflow series are then accumulated into annual series annual baseflow is connected with annual pet and annual precipitation via a baseflow budyko curve as eq 10 wang and wu 2013 10 r b p f b p pet n b where r b is mean annual baseflow f b refers to the baseflow budyko curve and n b is a parameter controlling the baseflow generation therefore based on elasticity method the baseflow change can be attributed via following equation 11 δ r b r b ε p b δ p p ε pet b δ p e t pet ε n b δ n b n b where ε p b ε pet b ε n b are the baseflow elasticity coefficients of precipitation pet and parameter n b as rainfall intensity affects more in direct flow generation in tropical humid regions weemstra et al 2014 parameter n b should be affected mainly by forest cover change similar with that of parameter n a moving window method is applied here to estimate the relationship between forest cover and parameter n b as 12 log n b α 1 log f γ 1 therefore relative change as δ n b n b can be estimated by eq 13 as 13 δ n b n b α 1 δ f f turc pike equation is employed in wang and wu 2013 while we use the choudhury equation here as eq 14 14 r b p p pet p n b pet n b 1 n b since the baseflow budyko curve eq 14 has the same structure with the traditional choudhury equation replace the annual streamflow and parameter n by annual baseflow and parameter n b respectively and the elasticity coefficients can be estimated by the following equations 15a ε p b 1 1 1 pet p n b 1 1 pet p n b 1 n b 15b ε pet b 1 1 pet p n b 1 1 pet p n b 1 n b 15c ε n b p pet p p pet p n b pet n b 1 n b p n b log p pet n b log pet p n b pet n b n b 1 n b log p n b pet n b n b p n b pet n b 1 n b the deforestation induced baseflow change can then be estimated by eq 11 and eq 15 3 3 3 quantification of sediment trend induced by deforestation sediment load is determined by the sediment generation process and sediment transport process and can thus be influenced by many factors including climate factors such as annual precipitation and rainfall intensity and anthropogenic factors such as land cover and water and soil conservation measures previous study has shown that the construction of the longest barrage in thailand did not bring significant changes to sediment in the nearby yom river sub basin namsai et al 2020 the water and soil conservation measures are herein represented by land use change therefore herein land use change represented by deforestation is taken as the major driving factor of anthropogenic activities we use a method coming from the sediment identify method wang et al 2016 to estimate the land use change induced sediment change the sediment identify method regard precipitation runoff coefficient and sediment concentration as the factors that affect sediment yield while herein we use two factors as streamflow and sediment concentration the total suspended sediment load s is sediment concentration c multiplied by streamflow r therefore the value of relative trend of sediment transport modulus should be the sum of the relative trend of sediment concentration and streamflow as shown in eq 16 16 δ s s δ c c δ r r where c s refers to mean annual sediment concentration and mean annual suspended sediment modulus and δ c δ r refers to sediment concentration trend and deforestation induced streamflow trend δ s s δ c c and δ r r are the relative trend of suspended sediment load sediment concentration and streamflow respectively the sediment concentration is estimated by forest cover and annual precipitation based on stepwise regression see the sm for detail as 17 log c ω p log p ω f log f ω 0 where ω p ω f and ω 0 are the regression coefficients and the relative change of sediment concentration is estimated by 18 δ c c ω p δ p p ω f δ f f based on the relationship above and eq 7 the elasticity form of sediment load is derived as 19 δ s s ε p ω p δ p p ε f ω f δ f f ε pet δ p e t pet ε sdii δ s d i i sdii where ε p ω p δ p p ε f ω f δ f f ε pet δ p e t pet and ε sdii δ s d i i sdii are the sediment load change induced by change of annual precipitation forest cover pet and rainfall intensity respectively 4 results 4 1 hydrological change in the ucprb the hydrological changes in a basin are well reflected by the hydrological fluxes as annual precipitation annual pet and annual streamflow the annual hydrological series precipitation pet and streamflow show very similar temporal patterns among all of the sub basins the year 1993 is identified as a significant abrupt increasing point in the annual precipitation series and annual streamflow series in all of the sub basins the long term variations of the annual streamflow and precipitation are shown in fig 3 the entire study period is consequently divided into two periods based on the detected abrupt change point i e period 1 1981 1993 and period 2 1994 2015 the hydrological changes from period 1 to period 2 in the sub basins are listed in table 2 the change in streamflow generation is well reflected by the double mass curve as shown in fig 4 as the runoff coefficient in the two time periods increased 25 in the entire ucprb the runoff coefficient increments in the wang river sub basin and the yom river sub basin even reached 59 and 53 respectively the change of watershed properties is further reflected by the hydrological change in the budyko space fig 5 shows the mean annual evaporation ratio e p versus the mean annual aridity index pet p in the budyko curve by using data in the two sub periods for the entire ucprb and the sub basins the evaporation ratio and aridity index in all of the sub basins decreased the budyko curves of the entire ucprb and the sub basins moved downward in the budyko space indicating that the change in watershed property parameter n tend to increase the streamflow the change in baseflow is shown in table 2 see the sm for the results of the benchmark filter for the upstream sub basins the baseflow variation is highly similar to the variation of streamflow and year 1993 is also identified as a significant increasing point most of the basins except for the ping river sub basin the variation of annual sediment transport modulus is shown in fig 6 as far as the measurements are concerned increasing trend exists in annual sediment transport modulus in the wang river sub basin annual sediment transport modulus shows significant positive correlation with annual streamflow in all of the basins therefore the increment of sediment transport modulus is herein contributed to two factors one is streamflow the other is sediment concentration since only the sediment yield record at w 4a has captured the whole process of increasing sediment yield since 1989 the wang river sub basin with w 4a as its outlet is herein taken as an example to show the change in the two factors an increasing but not significant trend is found in the annual streamflow while a significant increasing trend is detected in the sediment concentration 4 2 spatiotemporal change of land use in the ucprb land use maps from 1981 to 2015 are generated on an annual basis by ca markov algorithm in the grid size of 100 m the result is satisfactory with kappa coefficient and overall accuracy both exceeding 0 8 suggesting that the result is convincing with a good accuracy landis and koch 1977 the land use in the ucprb show different patterns in the upper tributaries and the plain region forest upland field and paddy field are the major land use types in the ucprb covering an area of 61 16 and 12 respectively forest is the dominant land use type in the ucprb especially the upper tributaries where the forest covers 70 to 80 of the total area paddy field is mainly in the plain region with its cover reaching more than 30 upland field is mainly in the nan river sub basin and the plain region with its area reaching 17 in the nan river sub basin the change of the land use from 1981 to 2015 in the ucprb is shown in fig 7 the forest cover shows a continuous decreasing trend in all sub basins during the study period the deforestation rate is high during the 1980 s then the deforestation rate slowed down in the 1990 s and accelerated after 2000 especially after 2005 finally after 2015 the deforestation process slowed down the temporal variation of forest cover shows strong correlation with paddy field and upland fields see fig s4 for detail indicating that forest cover can be an indicator of the land use change in basin scale 4 3 hydrological change induced by climate change and deforestation 4 3 1 annual streamflow response to land use change and climate change the response of 1 decrease in forest area can result in 1 9 increase in annual streamflow in the entire ucprb the annual streamflow is more sensitive to forest change in the upper tributaries than in the entire ucprb as the response of 1 decrease in forest area can result in an increase of annual streamflow ranging from 2 5 the ping river sub basin to 5 5 the yom river sub basin the difference in the streamflow elasticity coefficients to forest cover may come from difference in basin area difference in the post forest land use and difference in geological factors the response of 1 increase in rainfall intensity s d i i can result in 0 4 increase of annual streamflow in the entire ucprb the response of 1 increase in rainfall intensity s d i i can result in an increase of annual streamflow ranging from 0 1 the nan river sub basin to 1 6 the wang river sub basin the result of attribution analysis is shown in table 3 in the entire ucprb annual precipitation increment can account for 27 6 mm 54 8 in the 49 3 mm streamflow increment between the two periods while change in pet and rainfall intensity accounts for only 2 3 mm 4 6 and 1 4 mm 2 8 respectively deforestation accounts for a 23 7 mm 47 0 increment which is only a little smaller than the streamflow increment induced by precipitation increment the results show that precipitation increment and deforestation are the two dominant driving factors of the streamflow increment between the two periods and the two factors make similar contribution in the upper sub basins the contribution of pet and rainfall intensity change is relatively small compared to the contribution of precipitation change and forest cover change the contribution of deforestation to streamflow increments ranges from 54 0 the ping river sub basin to 69 9 the nan river sub basin while the contribution of precipitation increments ranges from 50 8 the ping river sub basin to 33 0 the nan river sub basin deforestation dominates the streamflow increments in all sub basins while precipitation increments play a less important role in annual streamflow change in the upper sub basins 4 3 2 effects of climate change and deforestation on annual baseflow as the baseflow of the entire ucprb is definitely affected by the two large reservoirs the effects of climate change and deforestation on annual baseflow is analyzed merely in the upstream sub basins the baseflow elasticity coefficients are shown in table 4 in all of the basins deforestation and precipitation increment dominates the baseflow increment precipitation increment plays a more important role in the ping river sub basin with the contribution of precipitation increasing exceeding 60 deforestation plays a more important role in the other sub basins than precipitation increment with a contribution around 60 the difference between the precipitation increasing dominant basins and deforestation dominant basins mainly comes from the difference in the response of baseflow to deforestation in these basins meanwhile a higher precipitation increment makes the contribution of precipitation increasing higher in the yom river sub basin based on the baseflow elasticity coefficients and streamflow elasticity coefficients the effects of climate change on direct flow is estimated via the difference between climate change induced streamflow and baseflow the contribution of deforestation to direct flow change is also larger than the contribution of precipitation increasing in the upper sub basins compared to deforestation the contribution of increasing rainfall intensity on direct flow is smaller indicating that the influence of deforestation is also quite strong in the direct flow generation process 4 3 3 response of the suspended sediment load to deforestation based on the elasticity form of sediment load eq 17 the sediment yield elasticity of forest cover annual precipitation annual pet and rainfall intensity is estimated a 1 reduction in forest cover can result in 4 7 increment in sediment concentration and 4 0 increment in annual streamflow thus 8 7 increment in annual sediment yield a 1 increment in annual precipitation can result in 1 6 increment in sediment concentration and 2 7 increment in annual streamflow thus 4 3 increment in annual sediment yield the sediment elasticity coefficients of pet and rainfall intensity are similar with the streamflow elasticity coefficients since the impacts of the two factors on sediment concentration are neglected the annual suspended sediment load of the wang river sub basin has been increasing at a high rate of 5 1 per year the increasing trend of annual suspended sediment yield is composed of the increasing trend of sediment concentration and annual streamflow as 3 0 per year and 2 1 per year respectively meanwhile the speed of annual suspended load increment induced by deforestation is 4 9 per year and is the dominant driving factor of the increasing trend of the sediment yield sediment trend induced by climate trend is only 0 2 per year sediment trend brought by annual precipitation trend annual pet trend and sdii trend are 0 8 per year 0 1 per year and 0 5 per year respectively 5 discussions 5 1 comparison with previous studies 1 sensitivity of annual streamflow to deforestation the post deforestation land use types are paddy fields and upland fields in the ucprb and are different from that of the nam pong river basin wilk et al 2001 and the projected scenario of be river basin in vietnam khoi and suetsugi 2014 where the post deforestation land use types are farmland forest and perennial crops such as rubber respectively the streamflow elasticity coefficient of forest cover in the entire ucprb and the upper sub basins ranges from 1 9 to 5 5 and is larger than the response of the two basins the stronger streamflow elasticity coefficient in the ucprb indicates that the conversion from primary forest to upland fields and paddy fields will bring more streamflow increment than conversion to farmland forest and perennial tree crops such as rubber it is consistent with the fact that rubber consume more water than local crops guardiola claramonte et al 2008 thus leading to more evapotranspiration in these basins located at the southeast asian monsoon region where the destinations of deforestation are mainly paddy fields and upland fields the response of annual streamflow is more sensitive compared to the amazon rainforests where the runoff elasticity of forest is smaller than 1 zhang et al 2017 the sensitivity of streamflow response to deforestation is determined by many factors including the post forest land use and the regional climate das et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 previous studies also suggest that water limited basins are more sensitive to forest cover change zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 compared to the humid tropical basins of amazon berghuijs et al 2017 the ucprb is highly seasonal and is dryer with a lower streamflow coefficient of only 0 2 drier climate might be the reason leading to a more sensitive streamflow response to deforestation in the ucprb previous studies on the monsoon regions of amazon show runoff elasticity coefficients of forest ranging from 1 3 28 increments in annual runoff due to 22 deforestation to 4 0 annual runoff being amplified fourfold in soy bean croplands which is closer to the runoff elasticity coefficients of the ucprb cavalcante et al 2019 hayhoe et al 2011 2 the effect of deforestation on baseflow as shown by peña arancibia et al 2019 forests can have either negative impacts or positive impacts on dry season flow since dry season flow is mostly composed of baseflow the effects of forests on dry season flow is also the effects of forests on baseflow in dry season forests can either serve as pumps or sponges forests as pumps extract water for evapotranspiration especially in the growing season and reduce baseflow forests as sponges maintain good soil conditions and stores more rainfall in the groundwater during the wet season leading to more baseflow for whole year as reported by wangpimool et al 2013 reforestation can bring more dry season flow in the nan river sub basin of the ucprb the impacts of deforestation on baseflow in dry season depend on the trade off between these two effects the deforestation in the upstream sub basins of the ucprb has led to more annual baseflow if the dry season flow should be attenuated by deforestation as suggested by wangpimool et al 2013 the baseflow in wet season must have been amplified by deforestation in wet season baseflow is composed of the slow flow components generated from the surface and sub surface storages of the watershed there are two types of water storages as detention sub surface detention is the storage held in the sub surface for a long time period and contributes to baseflow for a long time period reforestation may increase the sub surface storage detention due to high infiltration and soil organic matter in forest mapa 1995 surface detention is short term storage in the watershed surface and is depleted by flow out into the rivers which is recognized as baseflow in this study in mountains where uplands are constructed as terraced agricultural fields the rainfall detention might increase as surface storage leading to amplified baseflow in the wet season it is worth noting that the analyses in this study do not provide evidence for the seasonal response of baseflow to deforestation the effects of deforestation on dry season flow is not analyzed in the study as we couldn t apply the budyko framework analysis at seasonal scale because the regulation of reservoir and other water storage is not negligible the responses of baseflow to deforestation in dry season and wet season in the ucprb could be different which needs further study in future 3 the effect of deforestation on suspended sediment load sediment discharge is found to be positively correlated to streamflow in many basins of the world kassa et al 2019 latuf and amaral 2016 namsai et al 2020 therefore the sediment concentration response to deforestation is herein analyzed to remove the streamflow response to deforestation from the sediment response a 1 deforestation can lead to 8 7 increase in annual sediment load in the wang river sub basin and the response can be broken into two parts as a 4 0 increase in annual streamflow and a 4 7 increase in sediment concentration deforestation is also found to increase sediment concentration in the tropical forest of southeast asia as a study in the sambas river of malaysia even showed that a deforestation from 75 2 to 42 3 had led to a sharp sediment concentration increase from 6 mg l to 2392 mg l kundu 2019 corresponding to a 10 3 increase in sediment concentration in response of a 1 deforestation which is even more sensitive than the case of the wang river sub basin the results show that the sediment response to deforestation can be quite sensitive in the large tropical monsoon basins of southeast asia 5 2 uncertainties in the results the uncertainties in the input of the framework may come from the meteorological input and the hydrological and sedimentary observations li et al 2012 the uncertainties in the meteorological data may come from the spatial interpolation most meteorological data except for net radiation and wind speed is obtained from gauge observations 41 meteorological stations and 29 rain gauges used for the interpolation have evenly spatial distribution compared to the previous studies limjirakan and limsakul 2012 tebakari et al 2005 we have a quite dense observation network the uncertainties of the gauge hydrological and sedimentary observations can come from the observation system and the post treatment of the observations since the post treatment is only a sum of daily values we suggest that the uncertainties brought by the hydrological and sedimentary observations be neglected the uncertainties in the framework may lie in land use classification baseflow segmentation and the zero water storage change assumption in the budyko method the uncertainties in land use classification may come from the original uncertainties in the land use maps and the uncertainties in ca markov model moreover the neglection of change in forest density such as logging activities and forest regrowth ziegler et al 2009 may bring uncertainties logging can reduce evapotranspiration after logging however the water consumption of secondary forests can catch up with primary forest leite et al 2018 or even exceed that of primary forest von randow et al 2020 which in turn reduce the effects of logging on evapotranspiration while for baseflow and sediment logging will have its impacts baseflow will be reduced due to lower infiltration and detention and sediment will be amplified due to more erosion leite et al 2018 mapa 1995 more information is required for a quantitative estimation of the effect of logging the uncertainties in the baseflow segmentation have been minimized as suggested by zhang et al 2020 the uncertainties in the budyko method may come from the hypothesis that water storage change is negligible in the 11 year moving window the total water storage change in the basin is checked by grace and it shows that though the interannual variation of total water storage of the ucprb is quite strong the interannual mean value of total water storage change estimated from grace is negligible compared to the hydrological fluxes since 2002 see fig s3 in the sm this phenomenon meets the result of han et al 2020 that a 10 year period is sufficient for catchments in sub humid regions the existence of two large reservoirs have strong influence on the hydrological regime of the entire ucprb tebakari et al 2012 based on the operation of the two reservoirs after their construction the annual outflow of the two reservoirs is both found to be highly correlated with the annual inflow in the year before and the slope is nearly 1 see supplementary material for detail while the boyko framework is herein applied in a multi decadal scale the effect of water storage change because of the two reservoirs is negligible the two reservoirs used a fixed set of rules before 2012 mateo et al 2014 and the nearly unchanged water regulation policy minimizes the effect of reservoir regulation on the outlet streamflow the sediment change here only consists of suspended sediment load the absence of bedload is due to lack of bedload observation however as shown in previous studies bidorn et al 2015 more than 94 of sediment discharge in the wang river sub basin exists as suspended sediment load therefore the change of suspended sediment load can present the sediment change of the wang river sub basin 6 conclusion in this study the ucprb is herein employed as a typical basin in tropical monsoon region to analyze the hydrological responses to climate change and deforestation according to the results the following conclusions can be made a significant breakpoint for annual streamflow and annual precipitation in the entire ucprb is identified as 1993 and this breakpoint is also identified for annual baseflow in most upstream sub basins during the past decades 1981 2015 accordingly we divided the study period into two sub periods as period 1 1981 1993 and period 2 1994 2015 both annual precipitation and annual streamflow of the entire ucprb and the upstream sub basins increased from period 1 to period 2 the annual baseflow of most upstream sub basins except for the ping river sub basin also increased from period 1 to period 2 significant increasing trend is detected in the time series of the annual suspended sediment load the basin underwent continuous deforestation to food cropland such as upland field and paddy field with the forest cover in the ucprb decreased from 65 0 to 56 5 precipitation increment is identified as the dominant driver of the annual streamflow increment in the entire ucprb and the annual baseflow increment in the ping river sub basin deforestation is identified as the dominant driver of the annual streamflow increment in the upstream sub basins the annual baseflow increment in most of the upstream sub basins except for the ping river sub basin and the increasing trend of suspended sediment load in the wang river sub basin in the entire ucprb one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow by 1 9 in the upstream sub basins one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow and annual baseflow by 2 5 the ping river sub basin 5 4 the yom river sub basin and 2 6 the ping river sub basin 6 7 the yom river sub basin respectively one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual suspended sediment load by 8 7 the annual streamflow response is more sensitive than that in humid amazon rainforests and the southeast asia monsoon basins with perennial tree crops as the destination of deforestation annual baseflow is amplified after deforestation while the baseflow response in the wet season and dry season remains to be studied the findings will help develop better understanding of land use management in the ucprb for water soil conservation and the methods used in this study can be applied to other basins to get better understanding of the streamflow response to land use type change credit authorship contribution statement baoxu zhao writing original draft writing review editing conceptualization methodology data curation huimin lei

3659,deforestation has been reported to increase annual streamflow baseflow and sediment load in many parts of the world however studies about the hydrological effects of deforestation are scant in the tropical monsoon region in this study these effects were examined in the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb which is a typical tropical monsoon basin and is an important area of water resources in thailand a significant breakpoint for annual streamflow and annual precipitation in the entire ucprb is identified as 1993 and this breakpoint is also identified for annual baseflow in most upstream sub basins during the past decades 1981 2015 significant increasing trend is detected in the annual suspended sediment load of the wang river sub basin land use maps generated by a ca markov model suggest that continuous deforestation occurred during the study period the contributions of climate change and deforestation to the hydrological and sedimentary changes are then attributed within the budyko framework precipitation increment dominates the annual streamflow increment in the entire ucprb and the annual baseflow increment in the ping river sub basin and deforestation dominates the annual streamflow increment in the upstream sub basins the annual baseflow increment in most of the upstream sub basins and the increasing suspended sediment load in the wang river sub basin the hydrological and sedimentary response to deforestation is then quantified in the entire ucprb one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow by 1 9 in the upstream sub basins one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow and annual baseflow by 2 5 5 4 and 2 6 6 7 respectively one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual suspended sediment load by 8 7 these findings will help develop better understanding of land use management in the ucprb for water soil conservation keywords climate change deforestation streamflow change baseflow change sediment change 1 introduction the tropics covers one fifth of the global area and produce more runoff than any other climate regions fekete et al 2002 in the tropics deforestation has become an important issue for decades and is most serious in southeast asia and amazon over the world gibbs et al 2010 hansen et al 2013 hansen et al 2009 in recent years the deforestation rate in most countries in southeast asia shows a significant increasing trend hansen et al 2013 qin et al 2019 which have decreased the local precipitation and may exacerbate the changes in high flows and soil erosion kanae et al 2001 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 valentin et al 2008 a comprehensive understanding on the effects of deforestation on runoff and sediment in southeast asia is required for better soil water conservation and water resources management previous studies about the hydrological and sedimentary effects of deforestation mainly focused on the deforestation of the amazon forests zhang et al 2017 these studies believe that deforestation in the amazon rainforest will bring more streamflow coe et al 2009 coe et al 2011 costa et al 2003 and deforestation in the monsoon region of amazon will bring more streamflow and baseflow cavalcante et al 2019 hayhoe et al 2011 by decreasing evapotranspiration deforestation is also believed to bring more sediment due to less protection from canopy and understory during the sediment production process in both rainforest and monsoon region of amazon latuf and amaral 2016 however the hydrological effects of deforestation are also influenced by local watershed properties climate type and land cover after deforestation das et al 2018 knighton et al 2020 peña arancibia et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 which implies that the hydrological effects of deforestation depend on the local and regional biophysical and climate characteristics and the post forest land use compared to most of the basins in the amazon rainforest the large basins in southeast asia have substantially smaller runoff coefficients larger aridity index potential evaporation divided by precipitation and stronger seasonality in precipitation berghuijs et al 2017 coe et al 2009 takahashi and yasunari 2006 the post forest land use in the large basins of southeast asia has found to be mainly cropland for food production such as paddy fields and upland fields foley et al 2011 zeng et al 2018a while the post forest land use is found to be mainly pasture for cattle ranching and soybean cropping in the arc of deforestation of amazon cavalcante et al 2019 therefore the runoff response of deforestation in the southeast asian monsoon region might be different from that in the amazon tropical rainforest however there is still limited understanding between the answers to the limited studies of the response of annual streamflow baseflow and sediment to deforestation in the southeast asian monsoon region some modelling studies have been carried out on the forest change issues in this region wangpimool et al 2013 proposed three afforestation scenarios in the upper nan river basin and suggested that afforestation will increase dry season flow and decrease wet season flow meanwhile the change of annual streamflow is quite mild and the direction is determined by the trade off between decreasing wet season flow and increasing dry season flow khoi and suetsugi 2014 proposed three deforestation scenarios in the be river basin of vietnam and suggested that deforestation will decrease dry season flow and increase wet season flow while the annual streamflow is mildly amplified by the deforestation as for sediment load deforestation is found to increase sediment load both in wet season and dry season in the be river basin the limited observational studies however give different results wilk et al 2001 found that large scale deforestation from local forests to farm forests in the nam pong river basin had led to nearly no change in both annual streamflow and baseflow tebakari et al 2018 found strong increasing trend in both high flow and low flow in the upper nan river basin in the past 6 decades and suggested that a close relationship might exist between the large scale deforestation and a significant increasing trend in low flow in the nan river basin of thailand where the primary crop is corn zeng et al 2018b the negative relationship between forest cover and low flow is in contrast to the answers above while the negative relationship is not confirmed yet due to difficulties in obtaining the actual forest change tebakari et al 2018 therefore the historical annual streamflow baseflow and sediment response to deforestation in large tropical monsoon basins of southeast asia needs better understandings the objective of this research is to understand the impacts of deforestation on streamflow baseflow and sediment at a multiannual scale in the southeast asian tropical monsoon basins where forests are converted to paddy fields and upland fields to this end the ucprb is selected as a typical catchment located in the tropical monsoon region in the southeast asia the well gauged observation system makes the ucprb a good example for the studying of deforestation effects in such tropical regions the ucprb is mainly covered by forests paddy fields and upland fields with the three land use types covering 62 9 17 1 and 12 5 respectively based on the land use map in year 2005 in the past decades deforestation has been continuously reported in thailand kanae et al 2001 zeng et al 2018b and the deforestation has been accelerating in many southeast asian countries hansen et al 2013 kanae et al 2001 zeng et al 2018a zeng et al 2018b however the effects of the ongoing deforestation on streamflow baseflow and sediment load are still not studied and whether deforestation of the ucprb plays a more important role in the hydrological and sedimentary change still remains a question to be studied kiguchi et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the study is organized as follows the details of the study area and the data used in the research are presented in section 2 the methods used in this study are introduced in section 3 section 4 shows the long term hydrological and sedimentary change the spatiotemporal change of land use the streamflow baseflow and sediment response to deforestation and the contributions of deforestation and climate change to streamflow baseflow and sediment section 5 discusses the uncertainty of this analysis and the comparison with the previous studies the conclusions are then drawn in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb fig 1 is part of the chao phraya river basin located at the upstream of nakhon sawan which consists of the four main tributaries including the ping river the wang river the yom river and the nan river the jica report https openjicareport jica go jp pdf 11356094 04 pdf quantified the water resources in the sub basins of the chao phraya river basin and the ucprb makes up 64 of the total water resources of the chao phraya river therefore the ucprb is the major area of the water resources in the whole chao phraya river basin the ucprb receives an annual precipitation of about 1100 mm and generates an annual runoff of about 200 mm 90 of the annual precipitation falls during the wet season from april to october two peaks in precipitation occur in may and september and are dominated by indian summer monsoon and tropical cyclones respectively takahashi and yasunari 2006 the annual mean temperature is about 27 degrees celsius the temperature reaches its peak from april to may and reaches its lowest from december to the following january there are two large reservoirs in the ucprb the one built on the ping river in the 1960s is the bhumipol reservoir holding 13 5 billion cube meters the other one built on the nan river in the 1970s is the sirikit reservoir holding 9 5 billion cube meters as shown in fig 1 the four upper tributaries are mainly covered by forest and the plain region in the downstream reach is mainly covered by cropland paddy field and upland field the different land covers distinguish the hydrological behaviors in the different parts of the study area 2 2 data used in the study this study uses the meteorological observations from 1981 to 2015 including daily air temperature mean maxima and minima air pressure relative humidity sunshine duration and daily precipitation at 41 meteorological stations obtained from the royal meteorological department and additional 29 rain gauges obtained from the royal irrigation department see fig 1 for details windspeed is obtained from the noah gldas 2 0 reanalysis product the angular distance weighting interpolation with elevation correction mark et al 1999 yang et al 2004 is applied to the daily meteorological data to obtain 2 5 km resolution distributions and the potential evaporation pet is estimated by penman equation daily runoff and monthly suspended sediment load are both provided by the royal irrigation department daily runoff is obtained from 5 hydrological stations located on the ping river the wang river the yom river the nan river and the main stream of the chao phraya river from 1981 to 2015 and the daily runoff observations are then aggregated into monthly values monthly suspended sediment load data is from the wang river sub basin with the longest series from 1989 to 2014 this study uses the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scale hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 from the united states geological survey usgs the 90 m resolution dem is used to generate the river network in the study the river network generated by hydrosheds fits well with the river network provided by the royal irrigation department land use maps in year 2005 year 2010 and year 2015 are provided by the land development department of thailand http sql ldd go th ldddata mapsoilb1 html and are converted to raster files with a spatial resolution of 100 m the land use types are classified into 16 types in the original map and are then reclassified into 8 types in this study as in fig 1 see table 1 for details 3 methodologies 3 1 abrupt hydrological change and trend detection in this study the moving t test wang et al 2018 is employed to detect change points in the annual runoff series the moving t test is based on t test it applies the t test to the subseries with a fixed length before and after the potential change points herein the significance level is set as 0 05 which means that if the calculated t value is greater than the critical value 2 101 for a 10 year moving window in this study the point is then accepted as a change point at the significance of 0 05 mann kendall test is applied to detect the potential trends in the hydrological series kendall 1970 mann 1945 herein the significance level is set as 0 05 which means that if the calculated statistic is larger than 1 96 the potential trend is identified as a significant trend the double mass curve method is based on linear regression evaluation of hydrological time series wei and zhang 2010 accumulated precipitation and accumulated streamflow are thought to be strongly linearly correlated if the precipitation runoff relationship is stable the hydrological meaning of the slope on the double mass curve is runoff coefficient consequently the change of the slope in the double mass curve reflects the change of the precipitation runoff relationship which can be due to potential evaporation change or anthropogenic activities such as land use change the change of watershed properties is identified by the movement of state variables in the budyko space xu et al 2014 change of watershed properties should have little influence on streamflow change if the changes of state variables are along the budyko curve otherwise the streamflow change induced by changes of watershed properties is estimated based on the change of the watershed parameter of the budyko curve the budyko method will be further introduced in 3 3 3 2 generation of land use maps the land use change process during the study period is captured using the ca markov model the model is composed of two parts including the markov model and the ca model the markov model is applied to explain the quantification of conversion states and reveal the transfer rate between different land use types sang et al 2011 and the ca model is applied to modulate the spatial distribution of the different land use types the markov model is usually applied in a forward direction to predict the future land use as eq 1 muller and middleton 1994 1 m t 1 m lc m t where m t and m t 1 refers to the area distribution of period t and t 1 respectively m lc is the transition matrix representing the probability of land use transitions since the area of each land use type is more than 0 the rank of m t and m t 1 should both be the number of land use types and m lc should be invertible herein we need the historical land use maps from 1981 to 2015 therefore we use an inverse markov chain as eq 2 2 m t m lc inv m t the ca markov model is herein applied based on the ca markov module of idrisi software guan et al 2019 the land use maps of years 2015 and 2010 are selected to apply the markov chain and the transition matrix obtained from the markov chain is then modified by the transition matrix suggested by luh2 product hurtt et al 2020 the land use map of 2005 is taken as the ground truth to evaluate the obtained result the accuracy of the result is evaluated via the kappa indices cohen 1986 3 3 analysis framework of deforestation induced hydrology change the analysis framework is established via the budyko framework the budyko framework is a brief effective and widely used method to analyze hydrological change and its attributors various studies have used the budyko framework to analyze the streamflow response of climate change and human activities for a detailed explanation in attribution studies please see dey and mishra 2017 and references therein there are also some attempts to take baseflow or sediment yield into the budyko framework gnann et al 2019 neto et al 2020 wang and wu 2013 zhang et al 2019 and anthropogenic activities such as land use change have been considered into the parameterization of the budyko framework jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2001 nevertheless the parameterization of land use change such as deforestation may not be extended to the case in the monsoon region of southeast asia as the relationships established by previous studies are mainly set up by statistical methods in different climate zones therefore based on the parameterization of forest into the budyko framework in the ucprb a more precise knowledge about the hydrological response to climate change and deforestation can be derived the analysis framework is composed of four parts as fig 2 the quantification of the land use change in the ucprb in part 3 2 serves as the input of the framework the first part aims to quantify the streamflow response to climate change and deforestation and give an attribution analysis of annual streamflow change the second part aims to quantify the response of baseflow and direct flow fast flow component as the rest of streamflow except for baseflow to climate change and deforestation in the upstream sub basins the last part aims to estimate the sensitivity of suspended sediment load to deforestation and estimate the deforestation induced sediment change in the wang river sub basin 3 3 1 attribution analysis of annual streamflow change the existence of change points in annual streamflow is the integrated effect from the climate change impact and direct impacts of human activities including irrigation and intense land use changes in the ucprb as the precise information about irrigation is not available we herein suppose that the intensity of irrigation is determined by the area of paddy fields so land use change is chosen as the estimator of human activities elasticity method within budyko framework xu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 is herein applied to separate the streamflow change induced by land use change and climate change in the budyko framework mean annual evapotranspiration e is determined by mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet and mean annual precipitation p via the following relationship 3 r p e p f p pet n where n is a parameter controlling the separation from precipitation to evapotranspiration and streamflow the elasticity method supposes that the change of annual streamflow at multiannual scale is attributed into the change of annual precipitation annual potential evaporation rate and watershed properties as shown in eq 4 4 δ r r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t p e t ε n δ n n where ε p ε pet ε n are the streamflow elasticity coefficients corresponding to annual precipitation annual pet and watershed paremeter n standing for watershed properties in the case of choudhury equation change of watershed parameter n was always regarded as landscape change yang et al 2009 while as shown in previous studies rainfall intensity cong et al 2015 donohue et al 2012 is also a significant factor affecting annual streamflow consequently land use and rainfall intensity are chosen as the explanatory variable of watershed parameter n together via the following equation 5 log n α log f β log sdii γ where sdii is the mean annual simple daily intensity index sdii frich et al 2002 and f is the ratio of forest area and the total area sdii is defined as the average precipitation on wet days with wet days defined as days when daily precipitation exceeds 1 mm chen and knutson 2008 the relationship in eq 5 is estimated via a moving window method as in jiang et al 2015 which is explained more precisely in the supplementary material sm it is worthwhile mentioning that the precondition of forest serving as the indicator of land use is that strong linear relationship should exist between forest cover and other land use such as farmland based on eq 4 and eq 5 the attribution equation of streamflow change can be rewritten as 6 δ r r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t pet α ε n δ f f β ε n δ s d i i sdii where α ε n and β ε n are the streamflow elasticity of forest cover and rainfall intensity and is later referred to as ε f and ε sdii respectively streamflow change induced by climate change δ r c and forest cover change δ r f are then attributed as 7a δ r c r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t pet ε sdii δ s d i i sdii 7b δ r f r ε f δ f f based on the choudhury equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 the streamflow elasticity coefficients are estimated by a set of equations as eq 8 xu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 8a ε p 1 1 1 pet p n 1 1 pet p n 1 n 8b ε pet 1 1 pet p n 1 1 pet p n 1 n 8c ε n p pet p p pet p n pet n 1 n p n log p pet n log pet p n pet n n 1 n log p n pet n n p n pet n 1 n the streamflow elasticity coefficients of forest cover and rainfall intensity are derived from eq 9c as 9a ε f α

pet n 1 n 3 3 2 attribution analysis of annual baseflow change wang and wu 2013 employed a baseflow budyko curve to modulate baseflow as suggested by gnann et al 2019 and neto et al 2020 a single baseflow budyko curve is not enough to capture basins with varying underlying conditions herein we use a set of baseflow boyko curves to estimate the deforestation induced baseflow change the attribution analysis of annual baseflow change is composed of two steps including baseflow separation and attribution analysis to minimize the uncertainties in the baseflow separation step zhang et al 2020 we estimate daily baseflow by a combination of four filters daily direct flow and baseflow series are separated by the average of four filters including the lh79 filter lyne and hollick 1979 the c91 filer chapman 1991 cm96 filter chapman and maxwell 1996 and eck05 filter eckhardt 2005 the average of the four series is set as a benchmark for the estimation and analysis of baseflow change the benchmark baseflow series are then accumulated into annual series annual baseflow is connected with annual pet and annual precipitation via a baseflow budyko curve as eq 10 wang and wu 2013 10 r b p f b p pet n b where r b is mean annual baseflow f b refers to the baseflow budyko curve and n b is a parameter controlling the baseflow generation therefore based on elasticity method the baseflow change can be attributed via following equation 11 δ r b r b ε p b δ p p ε pet b δ p e t pet ε n b δ n b n b where ε p b ε pet b ε n b are the baseflow elasticity coefficients of precipitation pet and parameter n b as rainfall intensity affects more in direct flow generation in tropical humid regions weemstra et al 2014 parameter n b should be affected mainly by forest cover change similar with that of parameter n a moving window method is applied here to estimate the relationship between forest cover and parameter n b as 12 log n b α 1 log f γ 1 therefore relative change as δ n b n b can be estimated by eq 13 as 13 δ n b n b α 1 δ f f turc pike equation is employed in wang and wu 2013 while we use the choudhury equation here as eq 14 14 r b p p pet p n b pet n b 1 n b since the baseflow budyko curve eq 14 has the same structure with the traditional choudhury equation replace the annual streamflow and parameter n by annual baseflow and parameter n b respectively and the elasticity coefficients can be estimated by the following equations 15a ε p b 1 1 1 pet p n b 1 1 pet p n b 1 n b 15b ε pet b 1 1 pet p n b 1 1 pet p n b 1 n b 15c ε n b p pet p p pet p n b pet n b 1 n b p n b log p pet n b log pet p n b pet n b n b 1 n b log p n b pet n b n b p n b pet n b 1 n b the deforestation induced baseflow change can then be estimated by eq 11 and eq 15 3 3 3 quantification of sediment trend induced by deforestation sediment load is determined by the sediment generation process and sediment transport process and can thus be influenced by many factors including climate factors such as annual precipitation and rainfall intensity and anthropogenic factors such as land cover and water and soil conservation measures previous study has shown that the construction of the longest barrage in thailand did not bring significant changes to sediment in the nearby yom river sub basin namsai et al 2020 the water and soil conservation measures are herein represented by land use change therefore herein land use change represented by deforestation is taken as the major driving factor of anthropogenic activities we use a method coming from the sediment identify method wang et al 2016 to estimate the land use change induced sediment change the sediment identify method regard precipitation runoff coefficient and sediment concentration as the factors that affect sediment yield while herein we use two factors as streamflow and sediment concentration the total suspended sediment load s is sediment concentration c multiplied by streamflow r therefore the value of relative trend of sediment transport modulus should be the sum of the relative trend of sediment concentration and streamflow as shown in eq 16 16 δ s s δ c c δ r r where c s refers to mean annual sediment concentration and mean annual suspended sediment modulus and δ c δ r refers to sediment concentration trend and deforestation induced streamflow trend δ s s δ c c and δ r r are the relative trend of suspended sediment load sediment concentration and streamflow respectively the sediment concentration is estimated by forest cover and annual precipitation based on stepwise regression see the sm for detail as 17 log c ω p log p ω f log f ω 0 where ω p ω f and ω 0 are the regression coefficients and the relative change of sediment concentration is estimated by 18 δ c c ω p δ p p ω f δ f f based on the relationship above and eq 7 the elasticity form of sediment load is derived as 19 δ s s ε p ω p δ p p ε f ω f δ f f ε pet δ p e t pet ε sdii δ s d i i sdii where ε p ω p δ p p ε f ω f δ f f ε pet δ p e t pet and ε sdii δ s d i i sdii are the sediment load change induced by change of annual precipitation forest cover pet and rainfall intensity respectively 4 results 4 1 hydrological change in the ucprb the hydrological changes in a basin are well reflected by the hydrological fluxes as annual precipitation annual pet and annual streamflow the annual hydrological series precipitation pet and streamflow show very similar temporal patterns among all of the sub basins the year 1993 is identified as a significant abrupt increasing point in the annual precipitation series and annual streamflow series in all of the sub basins the long term variations of the annual streamflow and precipitation are shown in fig 3 the entire study period is consequently divided into two periods based on the detected abrupt change point i e period 1 1981 1993 and period 2 1994 2015 the hydrological changes from period 1 to period 2 in the sub basins are listed in table 2 the change in streamflow generation is well reflected by the double mass curve as shown in fig 4 as the runoff coefficient in the two time periods increased 25 in the entire ucprb the runoff coefficient increments in the wang river sub basin and the yom river sub basin even reached 59 and 53 respectively the change of watershed properties is further reflected by the hydrological change in the budyko space fig 5 shows the mean annual evaporation ratio e p versus the mean annual aridity index pet p in the budyko curve by using data in the two sub periods for the entire ucprb and the sub basins the evaporation ratio and aridity index in all of the sub basins decreased the budyko curves of the entire ucprb and the sub basins moved downward in the budyko space indicating that the change in watershed property parameter n tend to increase the streamflow the change in baseflow is shown in table 2 see the sm for the results of the benchmark filter for the upstream sub basins the baseflow variation is highly similar to the variation of streamflow and year 1993 is also identified as a significant increasing point most of the basins except for the ping river sub basin the variation of annual sediment transport modulus is shown in fig 6 as far as the measurements are concerned increasing trend exists in annual sediment transport modulus in the wang river sub basin annual sediment transport modulus shows significant positive correlation with annual streamflow in all of the basins therefore the increment of sediment transport modulus is herein contributed to two factors one is streamflow the other is sediment concentration since only the sediment yield record at w 4a has captured the whole process of increasing sediment yield since 1989 the wang river sub basin with w 4a as its outlet is herein taken as an example to show the change in the two factors an increasing but not significant trend is found in the annual streamflow while a significant increasing trend is detected in the sediment concentration 4 2 spatiotemporal change of land use in the ucprb land use maps from 1981 to 2015 are generated on an annual basis by ca markov algorithm in the grid size of 100 m the result is satisfactory with kappa coefficient and overall accuracy both exceeding 0 8 suggesting that the result is convincing with a good accuracy landis and koch 1977 the land use in the ucprb show different patterns in the upper tributaries and the plain region forest upland field and paddy field are the major land use types in the ucprb covering an area of 61 16 and 12 respectively forest is the dominant land use type in the ucprb especially the upper tributaries where the forest covers 70 to 80 of the total area paddy field is mainly in the plain region with its cover reaching more than 30 upland field is mainly in the nan river sub basin and the plain region with its area reaching 17 in the nan river sub basin the change of the land use from 1981 to 2015 in the ucprb is shown in fig 7 the forest cover shows a continuous decreasing trend in all sub basins during the study period the deforestation rate is high during the 1980 s then the deforestation rate slowed down in the 1990 s and accelerated after 2000 especially after 2005 finally after 2015 the deforestation process slowed down the temporal variation of forest cover shows strong correlation with paddy field and upland fields see fig s4 for detail indicating that forest cover can be an indicator of the land use change in basin scale 4 3 hydrological change induced by climate change and deforestation 4 3 1 annual streamflow response to land use change and climate change the response of 1 decrease in forest area can result in 1 9 increase in annual streamflow in the entire ucprb the annual streamflow is more sensitive to forest change in the upper tributaries than in the entire ucprb as the response of 1 decrease in forest area can result in an increase of annual streamflow ranging from 2 5 the ping river sub basin to 5 5 the yom river sub basin the difference in the streamflow elasticity coefficients to forest cover may come from difference in basin area difference in the post forest land use and difference in geological factors the response of 1 increase in rainfall intensity s d i i can result in 0 4 increase of annual streamflow in the entire ucprb the response of 1 increase in rainfall intensity s d i i can result in an increase of annual streamflow ranging from 0 1 the nan river sub basin to 1 6 the wang river sub basin the result of attribution analysis is shown in table 3 in the entire ucprb annual precipitation increment can account for 27 6 mm 54 8 in the 49 3 mm streamflow increment between the two periods while change in pet and rainfall intensity accounts for only 2 3 mm 4 6 and 1 4 mm 2 8 respectively deforestation accounts for a 23 7 mm 47 0 increment which is only a little smaller than the streamflow increment induced by precipitation increment the results show that precipitation increment and deforestation are the two dominant driving factors of the streamflow increment between the two periods and the two factors make similar contribution in the upper sub basins the contribution of pet and rainfall intensity change is relatively small compared to the contribution of precipitation change and forest cover change the contribution of deforestation to streamflow increments ranges from 54 0 the ping river sub basin to 69 9 the nan river sub basin while the contribution of precipitation increments ranges from 50 8 the ping river sub basin to 33 0 the nan river sub basin deforestation dominates the streamflow increments in all sub basins while precipitation increments play a less important role in annual streamflow change in the upper sub basins 4 3 2 effects of climate change and deforestation on annual baseflow as the baseflow of the entire ucprb is definitely affected by the two large reservoirs the effects of climate change and deforestation on annual baseflow is analyzed merely in the upstream sub basins the baseflow elasticity coefficients are shown in table 4 in all of the basins deforestation and precipitation increment dominates the baseflow increment precipitation increment plays a more important role in the ping river sub basin with the contribution of precipitation increasing exceeding 60 deforestation plays a more important role in the other sub basins than precipitation increment with a contribution around 60 the difference between the precipitation increasing dominant basins and deforestation dominant basins mainly comes from the difference in the response of baseflow to deforestation in these basins meanwhile a higher precipitation increment makes the contribution of precipitation increasing higher in the yom river sub basin based on the baseflow elasticity coefficients and streamflow elasticity coefficients the effects of climate change on direct flow is estimated via the difference between climate change induced streamflow and baseflow the contribution of deforestation to direct flow change is also larger than the contribution of precipitation increasing in the upper sub basins compared to deforestation the contribution of increasing rainfall intensity on direct flow is smaller indicating that the influence of deforestation is also quite strong in the direct flow generation process 4 3 3 response of the suspended sediment load to deforestation based on the elasticity form of sediment load eq 17 the sediment yield elasticity of forest cover annual precipitation annual pet and rainfall intensity is estimated a 1 reduction in forest cover can result in 4 7 increment in sediment concentration and 4 0 increment in annual streamflow thus 8 7 increment in annual sediment yield a 1 increment in annual precipitation can result in 1 6 increment in sediment concentration and 2 7 increment in annual streamflow thus 4 3 increment in annual sediment yield the sediment elasticity coefficients of pet and rainfall intensity are similar with the streamflow elasticity coefficients since the impacts of the two factors on sediment concentration are neglected the annual suspended sediment load of the wang river sub basin has been increasing at a high rate of 5 1 per year the increasing trend of annual suspended sediment yield is composed of the increasing trend of sediment concentration and annual streamflow as 3 0 per year and 2 1 per year respectively meanwhile the speed of annual suspended load increment induced by deforestation is 4 9 per year and is the dominant driving factor of the increasing trend of the sediment yield sediment trend induced by climate trend is only 0 2 per year sediment trend brought by annual precipitation trend annual pet trend and sdii trend are 0 8 per year 0 1 per year and 0 5 per year respectively 5 discussions 5 1 comparison with previous studies 1 sensitivity of annual streamflow to deforestation the post deforestation land use types are paddy fields and upland fields in the ucprb and are different from that of the nam pong river basin wilk et al 2001 and the projected scenario of be river basin in vietnam khoi and suetsugi 2014 where the post deforestation land use types are farmland forest and perennial crops such as rubber respectively the streamflow elasticity coefficient of forest cover in the entire ucprb and the upper sub basins ranges from 1 9 to 5 5 and is larger than the response of the two basins the stronger streamflow elasticity coefficient in the ucprb indicates that the conversion from primary forest to upland fields and paddy fields will bring more streamflow increment than conversion to farmland forest and perennial tree crops such as rubber it is consistent with the fact that rubber consume more water than local crops guardiola claramonte et al 2008 thus leading to more evapotranspiration in these basins located at the southeast asian monsoon region where the destinations of deforestation are mainly paddy fields and upland fields the response of annual streamflow is more sensitive compared to the amazon rainforests where the runoff elasticity of forest is smaller than 1 zhang et al 2017 the sensitivity of streamflow response to deforestation is determined by many factors including the post forest land use and the regional climate das et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 previous studies also suggest that water limited basins are more sensitive to forest cover change zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 compared to the humid tropical basins of amazon berghuijs et al 2017 the ucprb is highly seasonal and is dryer with a lower streamflow coefficient of only 0 2 drier climate might be the reason leading to a more sensitive streamflow response to deforestation in the ucprb previous studies on the monsoon regions of amazon show runoff elasticity coefficients of forest ranging from 1 3 28 increments in annual runoff due to 22 deforestation to 4 0 annual runoff being amplified fourfold in soy bean croplands which is closer to the runoff elasticity coefficients of the ucprb cavalcante et al 2019 hayhoe et al 2011 2 the effect of deforestation on baseflow as shown by peña arancibia et al 2019 forests can have either negative impacts or positive impacts on dry season flow since dry season flow is mostly composed of baseflow the effects of forests on dry season flow is also the effects of forests on baseflow in dry season forests can either serve as pumps or sponges forests as pumps extract water for evapotranspiration especially in the growing season and reduce baseflow forests as sponges maintain good soil conditions and stores more rainfall in the groundwater during the wet season leading to more baseflow for whole year as reported by wangpimool et al 2013 reforestation can bring more dry season flow in the nan river sub basin of the ucprb the impacts of deforestation on baseflow in dry season depend on the trade off between these two effects the deforestation in the upstream sub basins of the ucprb has led to more annual baseflow if the dry season flow should be attenuated by deforestation as suggested by wangpimool et al 2013 the baseflow in wet season must have been amplified by deforestation in wet season baseflow is composed of the slow flow components generated from the surface and sub surface storages of the watershed there are two types of water storages as detention sub surface detention is the storage held in the sub surface for a long time period and contributes to baseflow for a long time period reforestation may increase the sub surface storage detention due to high infiltration and soil organic matter in forest mapa 1995 surface detention is short term storage in the watershed surface and is depleted by flow out into the rivers which is recognized as baseflow in this study in mountains where uplands are constructed as terraced agricultural fields the rainfall detention might increase as surface storage leading to amplified baseflow in the wet season it is worth noting that the analyses in this study do not provide evidence for the seasonal response of baseflow to deforestation the effects of deforestation on dry season flow is not analyzed in the study as we couldn t apply the budyko framework analysis at seasonal scale because the regulation of reservoir and other water storage is not negligible the responses of baseflow to deforestation in dry season and wet season in the ucprb could be different which needs further study in future 3 the effect of deforestation on suspended sediment load sediment discharge is found to be positively correlated to streamflow in many basins of the world kassa et al 2019 latuf and amaral 2016 namsai et al 2020 therefore the sediment concentration response to deforestation is herein analyzed to remove the streamflow response to deforestation from the sediment response a 1 deforestation can lead to 8 7 increase in annual sediment load in the wang river sub basin and the response can be broken into two parts as a 4 0 increase in annual streamflow and a 4 7 increase in sediment concentration deforestation is also found to increase sediment concentration in the tropical forest of southeast asia as a study in the sambas river of malaysia even showed that a deforestation from 75 2 to 42 3 had led to a sharp sediment concentration increase from 6 mg l to 2392 mg l kundu 2019 corresponding to a 10 3 increase in sediment concentration in response of a 1 deforestation which is even more sensitive than the case of the wang river sub basin the results show that the sediment response to deforestation can be quite sensitive in the large tropical monsoon basins of southeast asia 5 2 uncertainties in the results the uncertainties in the input of the framework may come from the meteorological input and the hydrological and sedimentary observations li et al 2012 the uncertainties in the meteorological data may come from the spatial interpolation most meteorological data except for net radiation and wind speed is obtained from gauge observations 41 meteorological stations and 29 rain gauges used for the interpolation have evenly spatial distribution compared to the previous studies limjirakan and limsakul 2012 tebakari et al 2005 we have a quite dense observation network the uncertainties of the gauge hydrological and sedimentary observations can come from the observation system and the post treatment of the observations since the post treatment is only a sum of daily values we suggest that the uncertainties brought by the hydrological and sedimentary observations be neglected the uncertainties in the framework may lie in land use classification baseflow segmentation and the zero water storage change assumption in the budyko method the uncertainties in land use classification may come from the original uncertainties in the land use maps and the uncertainties in ca markov model moreover the neglection of change in forest density such as logging activities and forest regrowth ziegler et al 2009 may bring uncertainties logging can reduce evapotranspiration after logging however the water consumption of secondary forests can catch up with primary forest leite et al 2018 or even exceed that of primary forest von randow et al 2020 which in turn reduce the effects of logging on evapotranspiration while for baseflow and sediment logging will have its impacts baseflow will be reduced due to lower infiltration and detention and sediment will be amplified due to more erosion leite et al 2018 mapa 1995 more information is required for a quantitative estimation of the effect of logging the uncertainties in the baseflow segmentation have been minimized as suggested by zhang et al 2020 the uncertainties in the budyko method may come from the hypothesis that water storage change is negligible in the 11 year moving window the total water storage change in the basin is checked by grace and it shows that though the interannual variation of total water storage of the ucprb is quite strong the interannual mean value of total water storage change estimated from grace is negligible compared to the hydrological fluxes since 2002 see fig s3 in the sm this phenomenon meets the result of han et al 2020 that a 10 year period is sufficient for catchments in sub humid regions the existence of two large reservoirs have strong influence on the hydrological regime of the entire ucprb tebakari et al 2012 based on the operation of the two reservoirs after their construction the annual outflow of the two reservoirs is both found to be highly correlated with the annual inflow in the year before and the slope is nearly 1 see supplementary material for detail while the boyko framework is herein applied in a multi decadal scale the effect of water storage change because of the two reservoirs is negligible the two reservoirs used a fixed set of rules before 2012 mateo et al 2014 and the nearly unchanged water regulation policy minimizes the effect of reservoir regulation on the outlet streamflow the sediment change here only consists of suspended sediment load the absence of bedload is due to lack of bedload observation however as shown in previous studies bidorn et al 2015 more than 94 of sediment discharge in the wang river sub basin exists as suspended sediment load therefore the change of suspended sediment load can present the sediment change of the wang river sub basin 6 conclusion in this study the ucprb is herein employed as a typical basin in tropical monsoon region to analyze the hydrological responses to climate change and deforestation according to the results the following conclusions can be made a significant breakpoint for annual streamflow and annual precipitation in the entire ucprb is identified as 1993 and this breakpoint is also identified for annual baseflow in most upstream sub basins during the past decades 1981 2015 accordingly we divided the study period into two sub periods as period 1 1981 1993 and period 2 1994 2015 both annual precipitation and annual streamflow of the entire ucprb and the upstream sub basins increased from period 1 to period 2 the annual baseflow of most upstream sub basins except for the ping river sub basin also increased from period 1 to period 2 significant increasing trend is detected in the time series of the annual suspended sediment load the basin underwent continuous deforestation to food cropland such as upland field and paddy field with the forest cover in the ucprb decreased from 65 0 to 56 5 precipitation increment is identified as the dominant driver of the annual streamflow increment in the entire ucprb and the annual baseflow increment in the ping river sub basin deforestation is identified as the dominant driver of the annual streamflow increment in the upstream sub basins the annual baseflow increment in most of the upstream sub basins except for the ping river sub basin and the increasing trend of suspended sediment load in the wang river sub basin in the entire ucprb one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow by 1 9 in the upstream sub basins one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual streamflow and annual baseflow by 2 5 the ping river sub basin 5 4 the yom river sub basin and 2 6 the ping river sub basin 6 7 the yom river sub basin respectively one percent reduction of the forest cover can increase the annual suspended sediment load by 8 7 the annual streamflow response is more sensitive than that in humid amazon rainforests and the southeast asia monsoon basins with perennial tree crops as the destination of deforestation annual baseflow is amplified after deforestation while the baseflow response in the wet season and dry season remains to be studied the findings will help develop better understanding of land use management in the ucprb for water soil conservation and the methods used in this study can be applied to other basins to get better understanding of the streamflow response to land use type change credit authorship contribution statement baoxu zhao writing original draft writing review editing conceptualization methodology data curation huimin lei
