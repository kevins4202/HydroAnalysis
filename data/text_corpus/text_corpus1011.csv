5055,seasonal streamflow forecasting which is important for water resources management is generally a challenging task in hydrology this paper focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow taking the three tributaries of the pearl river in south china as case study five forecasting experiments which forecast the average daily flow in the three month period by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month are devised to elucidate the different roles of base fast and total flow the recursive digital filter rdf model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast flow the bayesian joint probability bjp model is applied to generate ensemble forecasts under cross validation and the schaake shuffle is used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow forecasts in the different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias reliability and skill and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast skill is illustrated the results show that unbiased and reliable seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient meanwhile fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the antecedent month which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as large by contrast base flow tends to always contribute to forecast skill the separation of base flow from fast flow which accounts for the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow can reduce the impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow keywords streamflow forecasting seasonal flow base flow fast flow forecast skill 1 introduction streamflow forecasts provide useful information for water resources management including hydropower generation block 2011 fan et al 2014 turner et al 2017 irrigation scheduling chiew et al 2003 malherbe et al 2014 perera et al 2016 and water supply li et al 2014 zhao and zhao 2014 anghileri et al 2016 based on streamflow forecasts decision makers are able to assess flooding and drought risks in the future and to develop operation schemes that handle risks and yield economic benefits georgakakos et al 2012 turner et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in recent years numerous studies have been devoted to applications of streamflow forecasts to water resources management zhao et al 2011 georgakakos et al 2012 zhao and zhao 2014 anghileri et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 operational systems utilizing streamflow forecasts have been established in the columbia river alemu et al 2010 the nile river block 2011 and the yangtze river chen et al 2017 various methods of streamflow forecasting have been developed including dynamical methods fan et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 statistical methods seo et al 2006 wang et al 2009a mendoza et al 2017 and machine learning methods sun et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015 dynamical methods apply forecasts of precipitation and other climate variables to drive hydrological models to predict hydrological processes at daily monthly and seasonal timescales sinha and sankarasubramanian 2013 fan et al 2014 mo and lettenmaier 2014 tian et al 2018 alizadeh 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 statistical methods set up models such as multiple linear regression noori et al 2010 and time series valipour 2015 to characterize statistical relationships between global climate indices and local streamflow to produce streamflow forecasts with the quantification of uncertainties robertson et al 2013a zhao et al 2016 machine learning methods such as artificial neural network araghinejad et al 2011 support vector machine deka 2014 and random forests tongal and booij 2018 are becoming popular in streamflow forecasting due to their capabilities to cope with a large amount of data and to characterize nonlinear relationships wang et al 2009b tan et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 luo et al 2019 base and fast flow are two integral components of streamflow they represent different dynamical processes in which precipitation or snow is converted into streamflow and provide useful but different information on the variation periodicity and trend of streamflow hall 1968 nathan and mcmahon 1990 wang and wu 2013 tongal and booij 2018 wu et al 2019 base flow is generally smooth and plays a critical role in maintaining water quality for healthy riverine ecosystems while fast flow is overall flashy and usually associated with flooding events hall 1968 nathan and mcmahon 1990 wang and wu 2013 wu et al 2019 a large number of studies have been devoted to developing methods to separate base flow from fast flow including graphical methods nash and hrs 1960 chemical methods miller et al 2015 and numerical simulations lyne and hollick 1979 cheng et al 2016 for these studies the focus is usually on base flow and the estimated base flow has been used for groundwater estimation hydrological simulation and water resources modelling ferket et al 2010 gao et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 to date there are only a few studies considering base and fast flow in streamflow forecasting corzo and solomatine 2007 taormina et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 machine learning models were used firstly streamflow was separated into base flow and fast flow then machine learning models were constructed respectively for base flow and fast flow and finally streamflow forecast was obtained by adding up the forecasts of base flow and fast flow corzo and solomatine 2007 taormina et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 the consideration of base and fast flow yielded skillful forecasts in some case studies corzo and solomatine 2007 tongal and booij 2018 but was shown to be ineffective in some other case studies taormina et al 2015 hydrological explanations of the seemingly contradictory results are yet to be provided in particular the contributions of base and fast flow to the forecast skill of total flow need to be investigated there are generally three objectives of this paper 1 to consider the separation of base flow from fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow 2 to evaluate the ensemble forecasts of base fast and total flow and 3 to investigate the contributions of base and fast flow to the forecast skill of total flow to achieve these objectives five forecasting experiments of seasonal streamflow have been devised through a case study of the three main tributaries of the pearl river in south china the recursive digital filter rdf model is employed for base flow separation nathan and mcmahon 1990 the bayesian joint probability bjp model is used for the ensemble forecasting of base fast and total flow under leave three years out cross validation wang et al 2009a wang et al 2019 and the schaake shuffle is applied to link the forecasts of base flow and fast flow clark et al 2004 as will be illustrated through the comparisons among the experiments base flow contributes to forecast skill while outliers due to fast flow diminish the skill overall the five experiments yield insights into the differing roles of base and fast flow in seasonal streamflow forecasting 2 forecasting experiments 2 1 experiment setting there are five experiments of seasonal streamflow forecasting in this paper in the experiments the predictand is the average daily flow in the three month period hereafter denoted as seasonal flow and the predictor is the average daily flow in the antecedent month hereafter denoted as antecedent monthly flow wang et al 2009a robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 for example the average daily flow in january is used to forecast the average daily flow in fma february march april the average daily flow in february is used to forecast the average daily flow in mam march april may and so on there are in total twelve three month periods under investigation the forecasting experiments are conducted under leave three years out cross validation to deal with the autocorrelation of streamflow schepen et al 2014 bennett et al 2017 harrigan et al 2018 it is because when autocorrelation exists streamflow in the year under investigation will be implied by samples in the following years therefore when forecasting flow in the given three month period for one year the samples in that year and the next two years are excluded from the set of samples to train the forecasting model in this way the testing sample is not implied by the training samples and the forecast skill is not artificially inflated michaelsen 1987 for the three month period under investigation the samples across multiple years are one by one tested the cross validated forecasts are pooled in the verification michaelsen 1987 to be consistent with the literature streamflow is called total flow in the following illustrations of methods and results so as to differentiate it from base and fast flow partington et al 2012 taormina et al 2015 table 1 illustrates the five experiments generally the predictor is selected from monthly base fast and total flow and the predictand is the seasonal base fast or total flow e1 generates seasonal forecasts of total flow directly using the antecedent monthly total flow as the predictor the setting of this experiment has been adopted in peer studies kirono et al 2010 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 as will be illustrated e1 is not without its problems the forecast skill can be unsatisfactory in some cases in which there exists extremely large total flow in the antecedent month adding to e1 e2 e3 forecasts seasonal fast base flow by using the antecedent monthly fast base flow the two experiments are used to attribute problems in e1 to either fast flow or base flow e4 and e5 present two treatments of fast flow which causes problems in e1 in e4 seasonal forecasts of total flow are generated by adding up ensemble forecasts of base flow in e3 and climatology forecasts of fast flow in e5 seasonal forecasts are the sum of ensemble forecasts of fast and base flow in e2 and e3 the two treatments are tested by comparing e4 and e5 to e1 2 2 methods in the experiments 2 2 1 base flow separation the rdf model lyne and hollick 1979 is one of the most popular methods for base flow separation gan and zuo 2016 zhang et al 2017 singh et al 2019 base flow usually relates to discharge from groundwater storage of which the process is relatively slow and smooth hall 1968 from this perspective the rdf model considers low frequency signal as base flow and high frequency signal as fast flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 zhang et al 2013 the equations are 1 q t fast k q t 1 fast 1 k 2 q t total q t 1 total f o r q t fast 0 and 2 q t base q t total q t fast where t is the index of day k is the filter parameter and q t total q t base and q t fast respectively represent daily total base and fast flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 proposed to set k to be 0 925 which has been widely used in subsequent studies fan et al 2013 gan and zuo 2016 wu et al 2019 therefore this paper uses 0 925 and implements the forward backward and forward filtering operations to obtain base flow and fast flow li et al 2013 the daily base fast and total flow are then temporally averaged to derive monthly seasonal base fast and total flow 2 2 2 flow forecasting the bjp model wang et al 2009a wang et al 2019 is used to generate the ensemble seasonal forecasts in the five experiments robertson et al 2013a zhao et al 2016 strazzo et al 2019 the bjp model firstly applies the log sinh transformation to normalize the seasonal and antecedent monthly flow that are generally skewed and heteroscedastic 3 q 1 β log sinh α β q where q represents the original flow q represents the transformed flow α and β are transformation parameters that are determined by the maximum a posterior map estimation schepen et al 2016 then a bi variate normal distribution is used to characterize the relationship between normalized predictors and predictands 4 q q 1 q 2 n μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 where q is a column vector of variables consisting the predictor q 1 and the predictand q 2 u 1 and σ 1 u 2 and σ 2 represent the mean value and the standard deviation of q 1 q 2 and ρ represents the correlation between q 1 and q 2 let θ denote the parameter set that is θ μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 given the training samples q d the posterior distribution of the model parameters p θ q d is obtained through bayesian inference p θ q d p θ p q d θ the prior distribution of parameters p θ is set as non informative multivariate jeffreys prior gelman et al 2013 and p q d θ is the likelihood subsequently the gibbs sampling is formulated to sample p θ q d numerically and draw many sets of parameters 5000 in this paper to represent the parameter uncertainty wang et al 2019 when model parameters are available the forecasting of flow is performed by normalizing the value of predictors and predictands taking the conditional distribution from the joint distribution and drawing samples from the conditional distribution 5 q 2 q 1 n μ 2 ρ σ 2 σ 1 q 1 μ 1 1 ρ 2 σ 2 2 each of the 5000 sets of parameters results in one conditional distribution one random sample is drawn from each conditional distribution the 5000 random samples are pooled and then back transformed to generate ensemble forecasts for more information about the implementation of bjp please refer to wang et al 2009a wang et al 2019 the climatology forecasts are generated by drawing samples directly from the normal distribution of observations after log sinh transformation under the leave three years out cross validation 2 2 3 forecast shuffling in e4 and e5 forecasts of fast flow and base flow are added up to generate ensemble forecasts of total flow the schaake shuffle clark et al 2004 which is an empirical reordering method is applied to inject correlation to link ensemble members in the forecasts of base flow and fast flow robertson et al 2013b wu et al 2018 taking the forecasts for a certain three month period as an example i observations of base fast flow in this three month period in historic records are selected to serve as the templates of shuffling q t q 1 t q n t in which n is the number of years used for template ii forecasts of base fast flow which are to be shuffled are denoted as f f 1 f l f 1 1 f n 1 f 1 l f n l ensemble members of forecasts are divided into l sets and each one consists n members iii let q t q 1 t q n t denote the sorted q t from small to large similarly each set of f is also sorted and is denoted as f f 1 f l f 1 1 f n 1 f 1 l f n l it means that f 1 k f n k for k 1 l iv let b b 1 b n denote the indices of values of q t in q t and it represents the order of historic observations subsequently each set of f is reordered according to b and shuffled forecasts is denoted as f s f s 1 f s l f 1 s 1 f n s 1 f 1 s l f n s l specifically each member of forecasts is reordered that is f b r s k f r k for r 1 n and k 1 l in this way the schaake shuffle is applied to forecasts in e4 and e5 through shuffling the forecasts of base flow and fast flow are linked they are then added up to form the forecasts of total flow for more information on the schaake shuffle please refer to clark et al 2004 2 3 verification of forecasts in the experiments forecasts are verified in terms of bias reliability and skill murphy 1993 robertson et al 2013a 2013b zhao et al 2016 strazzo et al 2019 the percentage of bias is calculated as 6 bias i 1 n f i i 1 n q i obs i 1 n q i obs 100 where n is the number of years under investigation f i represents the mean of the ensemble forecasts of flow for i th year q i obs denotes the observations of flow corresponding to forecasts f i bias is positive negative when forecasts overall tend to be larger smaller than observations forecast reliability describes whether the spread of ensemble forecasts captures the distribution of observations it is assessed by probability integral transform pit 7 pi t i c d f i q i obs where cd f i represents the cumulative distribution function of ensemble forecasts f i pi t i represents the cumulative probability of q i obs in the cd f i the pit uniform plot sorts the pit values and plot them against the quantiles of standard uniform distribution if forecasts are reliable then observations can be regarded as random samples drawn from ensemble forecasts in this case the pit values follow a standard uniform distribution and the pit uniform plot is along the 1 1 line otherwise the plot deviates from the 1 1 line it tends to distribute above below the 1 1 line when forecasts are negatively positively biased and its slope is relatively high low around the center of the quantiles of standard uniform variate when the ensemble spread is too narrow wide thyer et al 2009 wang and robertson 2011 forecasts skill measures the performance of flow forecasts relative to reference forecasts here is climatology forecasts brown et al 2010 pappenberger et al 2015 wang et al 2019 both the root mean square error rmse and the continuous ranked probability score crps are employed to measure the accuracy of forecasts the rmse which is a widely used deterministic measure is calculated from the ensemble mean of forecasts and the observations 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n f i q i obs 2 where f i represents the mean of the ensemble forecasts of flow for i th year q i obs represents the observations of flow corresponding to f i the rmse measures the difference between the ensemble mean of forecasts and the observations and it increases when the difference widens the mean crps crps which is an integrated measure of forecast quality and accounts for forecast reliability resolution and sharpness brown et al 2010 pappenberger et al 2015 harrigan et al 2018 is calculated as 9 crps 1 n i 1 n c d f i x h x q i obs 2 d x where cd f i x is the cumulative distribution function cdf of ensemble forecasts f i and h x q i obs is the heaviside function whose value is 0 when x q i obs 0 and is 1 when x q i obs 0 the crps measures the difference between cdfs of forecasts and observations and is calculated by the numerical integration hersbach 2000 the crps is zero when cd f i matches h and it increases as the difference between cd f i and h widens based on the rmse and the crps forecasts skill in the experiments is evaluated through rmses and crpss 10 rmses rmse reference rmse forecast rmse reference 100 crpss crps reference crps forecast crps reference 100 in which rmse reference crps reference denotes the rmse crps of reference forecasts rmse forecast crps forecast denotes the rmse crps of forecasts in the five experiments and rmses crpss denotes the rmse crps skill score a positive skill score indicates that ensemble forecasts outperform reference forecasts and vice versa 3 case study the three main tributaries of the pearl river in south china are selected to perform the forecasting experiments fig 1 the pearl river which covers approximately 4 54 105 km2 is the fourth largest river in terms of drainage area in china it is located in the tropical and sub tropical zones the mean annual precipitation is between 1200 mm and 2000 mm with most precipitation concentrating in the period from april to september wet season due to the east asia summer monsoon xiao et al 2016 niu et al 2017 daily total flow data is collected from the gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrometric stations which are respectively the control stations of the west river wr north river nr and east river er the elevations of the stations are respectively 11 m 8 m and 15 m the data ranges from 1958 to 2011 the first 20 years 1958 1977 data are used as templates of the schaake shuffle and are not employed in model training and forecasting the last 34 years 1978 2011 data are used in the forecasting experiments based on the daily flow the seasonal antecedent monthly flow are calculated and used as the predictand predictor in the five experiments for the wr nr and er boxplots of monthly flow from january to december during 1958 to 2011 are shown in the fig 2 the lower and upper bounds of the boxes represent 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentile respectively the upper whisker and lower whisker respectively extend to the largest and smallest data falling within q1 1 5iqr q3 1 5iqr iqr stands for interquartile range and the data beyond whiskers are considered as extreme values and are plotted as red cross dekking et al 2005 lima et al 2016 from the boxplots it can be observed that total flow concentrates in the period from april to september which matches the period of summer monsoon for most of the boxes the red horizontal lines representing median locate next to the bottom of the boxes indicating that flow data is positively skewed wr is the largest tributary of the pearl river accounting for nearly 77 8 of the drainage area of the pearl river as a result the flow of wr is much higher than those of nr and er 4 results 4 1 forecasts without considering base and fast flow for the wr nr and er the seasonal total flow the predictand is plotted against the antecedent monthly total flow the predictor by scatter plots in fig 3 in addition the spearman s rank correlation and its p value are marked in the figure the four seasons of mam jja son and djf are respectively spring summer autumn and winter in china it is observed that the correlation coefficients are all positive and most of them are significant at the level of 0 05 suggesting that antecedent monthly flow can be an effective predictor kirono et al 2010 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 meanwhile the correlation coefficient exhibits seasonality it tends to be higher in the dry season son and djf than in the wet season mam and jja in the dry season total flow mainly depends on catchment storage which makes seasonal total flow considerably correlate with antecedent total flow in the wet season monsoon precipitation is the dominate source of total flow and the temporal variability of monsoon precipitation leads to relatively low correlation coefficients e1 forecasts the seasonal total flow using the antecedent monthly total flow as the predictor forecasts of total flow for mam jja son and djf in the wr nr and er are illustrated in fig 4 the observations and the 25 75 and 10 90 ranges of ensemble forecasts are plotted against the forecast ensemble median the bias rmses and crpss of forecasts are illustrated also the ensemble seasonal forecasts are plotted as time series and shown by figs s1 to s3 in the supplementary material overall the ensemble forecasts can capture the distribution of observations the pit uniform plots fig s4 in the supplementary material are generally along the 1 1 line indicating that the ensemble forecasts are overall reliable this result confirms the effectiveness of the bjp model wang et al 2009a 2019 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 strazzo et al 2019 the bias is smaller than 2 across the twelve cases suggesting that systematic errors in the forecasts are small the forecast skill is mostly positive i e ensemble forecasts outperform climatology forecasts in most cases meanwhile it can be negative when correlation coefficient is low this result is attributed to cross validation specifically there are five parameters in the bi variate normal distribution of streamflow forecasting eq 4 while there are only two parameters to fit the marginal distribution to generate climatology forecasts in cross validation the models can overly fit sample specific noises under low correlation and the model with more parameters gets penalized michaelsen 1987 the skill tends to be higher in son and djf than in mam and jja aghelpour and varshavian 2020 this result suggests that monsoon precipitation in the wet season poses challenges to the forecasting of total flow especially for jja that is the peak season of monsoon in the pearl river 4 2 correlation coefficient and forecast skill correlation coefficient and forecast skill which are evaluated for total flow e1 are further assessed for fast and base flow e2 and e3 for the three tributaries and twelve three month periods the correlation coefficients for base and fast flow are plotted against the correlation coefficient of total flow in fig 5 the results of the three tributaries base flow and fast flow are differentiated by color symbol it can be seen that correlation coefficients of base flow and fast flow are mostly positive as the correlation coefficient of total flow increases the correlation coefficients of base and fast flow also increase the scatter points for base flow are mostly above the 1 1 line while the points of fast flow fall below the 1 1 line that is the correlation coefficients of base flow tend to be higher than those of total flow by contrast the correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower it is owing to that base flow is relatively smooth and reacts slowly to precipitation and that fast flow tends to be flashy and represents the water that is rapidly transported from precipitation into flow eckhardt 2005 eckhardt 2008 kronholm and capel 2016 for total fast and base flow the forecast skill under cross validation is plotted against the correlation coefficient in fig 6 the subplots at the left and right hand sides are respectively for rmses and crpss different colors symbols are used to differentiate the forecast skill for different tributaries types of flow overall the results of rmses and crpss exhibit similar patterns that is forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficients for total fast and base flow the forecast skill of fast flow is generally the lowest with some triangles falling below the horizontal line this result is attributed to the relatively low correlation coefficient of fast flow in cross validation it makes forecasting models overly fit sample specific noises and leads to unsatisfactory forecast skill of fast flow michaelsen 1987 while forecast skill generally increases with correlation coefficient it is noted that the forecast skill of total flow can be nearly 0 even when the correlation coefficient is above 0 40 for example for djf in the wr the correlation coefficient is as high as 0 53 the first row and fourth column in fig 3 but the rmses and crpss of forecasts turns out to be 0 45 and 1 54 the first row and fourth column in fig 4 this abnormal case and another similar case are examined in the next section 4 3 ensemble forecasts in selected cases two cases djf in the wr and ond in the nr are selected to analyze the cause of unsatisfactory forecast skill diagnostic plots for the two cases are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively in the upper part of the two figures total fast and base flow are analyzed using scatter plots of the relationships between seasonal and antecedent monthly flow diagnostic plots of observations and forecasts in e1 e2 and e3 are shown in the lower part from figs 7 and 8 outliers are observed in the scatter plots of total flow of two cases specifically the antecedent monthly total flow for certain years can be extremely large but the subsequent seasonal total flow is not as extreme through the scatter plots of fast flow and base flow some similar outliers are observed for fast flow while outliers do not exist for base flow the indication is that outliers in total flow are owing to extremely large fast flow the lower parts of figs 7 and 8 present diagnostic plots of ensemble forecasts of total fast and base flow it can be observed that owing to extremely large antecedent monthly total flow seasonal forecasts of total flow are substantially enlarged in some years for example the monthly total flow in november 2008 is higher than 10 103 m3 s in the wr and the fast flow is estimated by the rdf to be 6 3 103 m3 s and accounts for nearly 60 of total flow fig 7 as is implied by the conditional distribution eq 5 the positive correlation between total flow in november and djf makes use of the outlier and generates ensemble forecasts that indicate extremely high total flow for djf in 2008 however the seasonal flow in djf 2008 turns out to be approximately 3 103 m3 s which is much lower than the forecasts this outcome substantially enlarges rmse and crps by contrast climatology forecasts are generated directly from the marginal distribution and their rmse and crps are not impacted by the positive correlation these results jointly contribute to the reduction of rmses and crpss eq 10 similarly in september 2001 fast flow in the nr is estimated to be 1 3 103 m3 s and accounts for nearly 60 of total flow which leads to unsatisfactory forecast skill of total flow fig 8 4 4 comparison of e4 and e5 to e1 e4 and e5 present two treatments of fast flow in the forecasting of seasonal total flow specifically climatology forecasts of fast flow are added to ensemble forecasts of base flow in e4 and ensemble forecasts of fast and base flow are summed up in e5 the diagnostic plots of total flow forecasts for e4 and e5 are shown in fig 9 which corresponds to the two cases in figs 7 and 8 overall forecasts of total flow in e4 and e5 outperform those in e1 it is observed that the forecasts corresponding to the extremely large antecedent total flow are no longer inflated accordingly forecast skill is improved rmses of djf in the wr increases from 0 45 in e1 to 15 48 in e4 and to 14 15 in e5 and crpss increases from 1 54 to 12 83 in e4 and to 10 64 in e5 in the case of ond in the nr rmses increases from 0 32 in e1 to 8 33 in e4 and to 8 24 in e5 and crpss increases from 0 83 in e1 to 10 70 in e4 and to 10 41 in e5 for the three tributaries and twelve three month periods the forecast skill in e4 and e5 is plotted against the forecast skill in e1 the results of rmses and crpss are respectively shown in the left and right hand sides of fig 10 in the subplots scatters points are generally above the 1 1 line the indication is that the forecast skill of total flow tends to be higher in e4 and e5 than in e1 meanwhile the upper part of fig 10 shows that some points still fall below the 1 1 line in e4 suggesting that the forecast skill in e4 can sometimes be lower than that in e1 forecasts for mam in the er are picked out to investigate the cause diagnostic plots of e1 e2 and e3 are shown in fig s5 of the supplementary material and diagnostic plots of e4 and e5 are shown in fig s6 from fig s5 it is found that the seasonal fast flow significantly correlates with the antecedent monthly fast flow and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0 42 indicating that fast flow can serve as an effective predictor in this case forecast skill of total flow is low in e4 that uses climatology forecasts of fast flow by contrast forecast skill is high in e5 which uses ensemble forecasts of fast flow the implication is that although fast flow can be problematic it still can contribute to forecast skill of total flow in some cases 5 discussion base and fast flow are two integral parts of total flow previous studies have incorporated base flow separation into machine learning models for streamflow forecasting corzo and solomatine 2007 taormina et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 corzo and solomatine 2007 and tongal and booij 2018 found that the consideration of base flow can improve the forecast skill but taormina et al 2015 pointed out that embedding base flow separation in modular models does not yield improved performances for total flow modeling the five experiments in this paper yield insights into the seemingly contradictory findings specifically the separation of base flow from fast flow works when there are outliers of total flow due to extremely large fast flow base flow relates to the dynamical process in which groundwater recharge total flow while fast flow represents the recharge of surface flow and subsurface flow from this perspective the separate considerations of base and fast flow help to consider the influences of different dynamical processes on total flow and to reduce the effects of outliers on forecasts skill the metrics for forecast verification are calculated in python to test the results rigorously the ensemble verification system evs brown et al 2010 is employed to calculate bias rmses and crpss for the two selected cases figs 7 and 8 as shown in figs s7 to s9 in the supplementary material the scatter plots of the three metrics calculated by python against those determined by the evs are generally along the 1 1 line confirming the evaluations of ensemble forecasts of base fast and total flow the five experiments are performed under the framework of cross validation that is the samples in the target year and the next two years are excluded from the set of samples to train the forecasting models lest the forecast skill is inflated while leave one year out cross validation is widely applied in precipitation studies catchment streamflow usually exhibits long term memory schepen et al 2014 harrigan et al 2018 accordingly this paper leaves three years data out to facilitate a stringent test based on the results shown in figs 6 10 it is found that forecast skill in e4 and e5 tends to be higher than that in e1 when there are outliers caused by extremely large antecedent fast flow robertson et al 2013a and zhao et al 2016 found that forecast skill tends to be low when the dominant source of antecedent total flow is in transition between fast flow and base flow in the pearl river september and october are generally the end of wet season and the beginning of dry season the dominate source of antecedent total flow is in transition from fast flow to base flow heavy precipitation in august september and october can induce extremely large fast flow in total flow when antecedent monthly total flow is used as the predictor it is not possible to differentiate the influence of fast flow and base flow given the differing roles of base and fast flow it is important to separate the two and consider them using respective forecasting models in the five experiments the average daily flow in the three month period is selected as the predictand and the average daily flow in the antecedent month is selected as the predictor this setting follows previous studies that considered antecedent monthly streamflow to be an effective predictor kirono et al 2010 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 to test the robustness of the findings five additional forecasting experiments that use average daily flow in the antecedent three month period as the predictor are performed the additional results are illustrated by figs s10 to s14 in the supplementary material it is observed that the correlation coefficients between seasonal flow and the antecedent seasonal flow become lower the implication is that antecedent seasonal flow is not as effective as antecedent monthly flow in representing catchment storage as a result forecast skill is overall lower in the additional experiments given that forecast skill depends on correlation coefficient figs 6 and s13 nevertheless outliers of total flow owing to extremely large antecedent fast flow are observed they are also shown to impact the forecast skill of total flow the separation of base flow from fast flow is observed to deal with the outliers and contribute to the forecast skill of total flow fig s14 6 conclusions this paper has devised five experiments to investigate the differing roles of base and fast flow in the ensemble forecasting of seasonal streamflow in the five experiments average daily flow in the three month period is forecasted by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month as the predictor under leave three years out cross validation the results show that ensemble forecasts of seasonal flow are overall unbiased and reliable the processes of total fast and base flow play important parts in seasonal streamflow forecasting correlation coefficients of total flow tend to be higher than those of fast flow but lower than those of base flow high correlation coefficients generally lead to skillful forecasts however the forecast skill can be unsatisfactory when fast flow leads to extremely large antecedent monthly total flow but the subsequent seasonal total flow is not as large the separation of base flow from fast flow helps to differentiate the effects of base and fast flow on total flow it reduces the influences of outliers and improves the forecast skill the investigation in this paper is concentrated on the three main tributaries of the pearl river in south china the experiments of this paper can be extended to other case studies in the future for more detailed investigations of the consideration of base and fast flow in seasonal streamflow forecasting credit authorship

5055,seasonal streamflow forecasting which is important for water resources management is generally a challenging task in hydrology this paper focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow taking the three tributaries of the pearl river in south china as case study five forecasting experiments which forecast the average daily flow in the three month period by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month are devised to elucidate the different roles of base fast and total flow the recursive digital filter rdf model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast flow the bayesian joint probability bjp model is applied to generate ensemble forecasts under cross validation and the schaake shuffle is used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow forecasts in the different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias reliability and skill and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast skill is illustrated the results show that unbiased and reliable seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient meanwhile fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the antecedent month which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as large by contrast base flow tends to always contribute to forecast skill the separation of base flow from fast flow which accounts for the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow can reduce the impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow keywords streamflow forecasting seasonal flow base flow fast flow forecast skill 1 introduction streamflow forecasts provide useful information for water resources management including hydropower generation block 2011 fan et al 2014 turner et al 2017 irrigation scheduling chiew et al 2003 malherbe et al 2014 perera et al 2016 and water supply li et al 2014 zhao and zhao 2014 anghileri et al 2016 based on streamflow forecasts decision makers are able to assess flooding and drought risks in the future and to develop operation schemes that handle risks and yield economic benefits georgakakos et al 2012 turner et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in recent years numerous studies have been devoted to applications of streamflow forecasts to water resources management zhao et al 2011 georgakakos et al 2012 zhao and zhao 2014 anghileri et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 operational systems utilizing streamflow forecasts have been established in the columbia river alemu et al 2010 the nile river block 2011 and the yangtze river chen et al 2017 various methods of streamflow forecasting have been developed including dynamical methods fan et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 statistical methods seo et al 2006 wang et al 2009a mendoza et al 2017 and machine learning methods sun et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015 dynamical methods apply forecasts of precipitation and other climate variables to drive hydrological models to predict hydrological processes at daily monthly and seasonal timescales sinha and sankarasubramanian 2013 fan et al 2014 mo and lettenmaier 2014 tian et al 2018 alizadeh 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 statistical methods set up models such as multiple linear regression noori et al 2010 and time series valipour 2015 to characterize statistical relationships between global climate indices and local streamflow to produce streamflow forecasts with the quantification of uncertainties robertson et al 2013a zhao et al 2016 machine learning methods such as artificial neural network araghinejad et al 2011 support vector machine deka 2014 and random forests tongal and booij 2018 are becoming popular in streamflow forecasting due to their capabilities to cope with a large amount of data and to characterize nonlinear relationships wang et al 2009b tan et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 luo et al 2019 base and fast flow are two integral components of streamflow they represent different dynamical processes in which precipitation or snow is converted into streamflow and provide useful but different information on the variation periodicity and trend of streamflow hall 1968 nathan and mcmahon 1990 wang and wu 2013 tongal and booij 2018 wu et al 2019 base flow is generally smooth and plays a critical role in maintaining water quality for healthy riverine ecosystems while fast flow is overall flashy and usually associated with flooding events hall 1968 nathan and mcmahon 1990 wang and wu 2013 wu et al 2019 a large number of studies have been devoted to developing methods to separate base flow from fast flow including graphical methods nash and hrs 1960 chemical methods miller et al 2015 and numerical simulations lyne and hollick 1979 cheng et al 2016 for these studies the focus is usually on base flow and the estimated base flow has been used for groundwater estimation hydrological simulation and water resources modelling ferket et al 2010 gao et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 to date there are only a few studies considering base and fast flow in streamflow forecasting corzo and solomatine 2007 taormina et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 machine learning models were used firstly streamflow was separated into base flow and fast flow then machine learning models were constructed respectively for base flow and fast flow and finally streamflow forecast was obtained by adding up the forecasts of base flow and fast flow corzo and solomatine 2007 taormina et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 the consideration of base and fast flow yielded skillful forecasts in some case studies corzo and solomatine 2007 tongal and booij 2018 but was shown to be ineffective in some other case studies taormina et al 2015 hydrological explanations of the seemingly contradictory results are yet to be provided in particular the contributions of base and fast flow to the forecast skill of total flow need to be investigated there are generally three objectives of this paper 1 to consider the separation of base flow from fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow 2 to evaluate the ensemble forecasts of base fast and total flow and 3 to investigate the contributions of base and fast flow to the forecast skill of total flow to achieve these objectives five forecasting experiments of seasonal streamflow have been devised through a case study of the three main tributaries of the pearl river in south china the recursive digital filter rdf model is employed for base flow separation nathan and mcmahon 1990 the bayesian joint probability bjp model is used for the ensemble forecasting of base fast and total flow under leave three years out cross validation wang et al 2009a wang et al 2019 and the schaake shuffle is applied to link the forecasts of base flow and fast flow clark et al 2004 as will be illustrated through the comparisons among the experiments base flow contributes to forecast skill while outliers due to fast flow diminish the skill overall the five experiments yield insights into the differing roles of base and fast flow in seasonal streamflow forecasting 2 forecasting experiments 2 1 experiment setting there are five experiments of seasonal streamflow forecasting in this paper in the experiments the predictand is the average daily flow in the three month period hereafter denoted as seasonal flow and the predictor is the average daily flow in the antecedent month hereafter denoted as antecedent monthly flow wang et al 2009a robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 for example the average daily flow in january is used to forecast the average daily flow in fma february march april the average daily flow in february is used to forecast the average daily flow in mam march april may and so on there are in total twelve three month periods under investigation the forecasting experiments are conducted under leave three years out cross validation to deal with the autocorrelation of streamflow schepen et al 2014 bennett et al 2017 harrigan et al 2018 it is because when autocorrelation exists streamflow in the year under investigation will be implied by samples in the following years therefore when forecasting flow in the given three month period for one year the samples in that year and the next two years are excluded from the set of samples to train the forecasting model in this way the testing sample is not implied by the training samples and the forecast skill is not artificially inflated michaelsen 1987 for the three month period under investigation the samples across multiple years are one by one tested the cross validated forecasts are pooled in the verification michaelsen 1987 to be consistent with the literature streamflow is called total flow in the following illustrations of methods and results so as to differentiate it from base and fast flow partington et al 2012 taormina et al 2015 table 1 illustrates the five experiments generally the predictor is selected from monthly base fast and total flow and the predictand is the seasonal base fast or total flow e1 generates seasonal forecasts of total flow directly using the antecedent monthly total flow as the predictor the setting of this experiment has been adopted in peer studies kirono et al 2010 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 as will be illustrated e1 is not without its problems the forecast skill can be unsatisfactory in some cases in which there exists extremely large total flow in the antecedent month adding to e1 e2 e3 forecasts seasonal fast base flow by using the antecedent monthly fast base flow the two experiments are used to attribute problems in e1 to either fast flow or base flow e4 and e5 present two treatments of fast flow which causes problems in e1 in e4 seasonal forecasts of total flow are generated by adding up ensemble forecasts of base flow in e3 and climatology forecasts of fast flow in e5 seasonal forecasts are the sum of ensemble forecasts of fast and base flow in e2 and e3 the two treatments are tested by comparing e4 and e5 to e1 2 2 methods in the experiments 2 2 1 base flow separation the rdf model lyne and hollick 1979 is one of the most popular methods for base flow separation gan and zuo 2016 zhang et al 2017 singh et al 2019 base flow usually relates to discharge from groundwater storage of which the process is relatively slow and smooth hall 1968 from this perspective the rdf model considers low frequency signal as base flow and high frequency signal as fast flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 zhang et al 2013 the equations are 1 q t fast k q t 1 fast 1 k 2 q t total q t 1 total f o r q t fast 0 and 2 q t base q t total q t fast where t is the index of day k is the filter parameter and q t total q t base and q t fast respectively represent daily total base and fast flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 proposed to set k to be 0 925 which has been widely used in subsequent studies fan et al 2013 gan and zuo 2016 wu et al 2019 therefore this paper uses 0 925 and implements the forward backward and forward filtering operations to obtain base flow and fast flow li et al 2013 the daily base fast and total flow are then temporally averaged to derive monthly seasonal base fast and total flow 2 2 2 flow forecasting the bjp model wang et al 2009a wang et al 2019 is used to generate the ensemble seasonal forecasts in the five experiments robertson et al 2013a zhao et al 2016 strazzo et al 2019 the bjp model firstly applies the log sinh transformation to normalize the seasonal and antecedent monthly flow that are generally skewed and heteroscedastic 3 q 1 β log sinh α β q where q represents the original flow q represents the transformed flow α and β are transformation parameters that are determined by the maximum a posterior map estimation schepen et al 2016 then a bi variate normal distribution is used to characterize the relationship between normalized predictors and predictands 4 q q 1 q 2 n μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 where q is a column vector of variables consisting the predictor q 1 and the predictand q 2 u 1 and σ 1 u 2 and σ 2 represent the mean value and the standard deviation of q 1 q 2 and ρ represents the correlation between q 1 and q 2 let θ denote the parameter set that is θ μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 given the training samples q d the posterior distribution of the model parameters p θ q d is obtained through bayesian inference p θ q d p θ p q d θ the prior distribution of parameters p θ is set as non informative multivariate jeffreys prior gelman et al 2013 and p q d θ is the likelihood subsequently the gibbs sampling is formulated to sample p θ q d numerically and draw many sets of parameters 5000 in this paper to represent the parameter uncertainty wang et al 2019 when model parameters are available the forecasting of flow is performed by normalizing the value of predictors and predictands taking the conditional distribution from the joint distribution and drawing samples from the conditional distribution 5 q 2 q 1 n μ 2 ρ σ 2 σ 1 q 1 μ 1 1 ρ 2 σ 2 2 each of the 5000 sets of parameters results in one conditional distribution one random sample is drawn from each conditional distribution the 5000 random samples are pooled and then back transformed to generate ensemble forecasts for more information about the implementation of bjp please refer to wang et al 2009a wang et al 2019 the climatology forecasts are generated by drawing samples directly from the normal distribution of observations after log sinh transformation under the leave three years out cross validation 2 2 3 forecast shuffling in e4 and e5 forecasts of fast flow and base flow are added up to generate ensemble forecasts of total flow the schaake shuffle clark et al 2004 which is an empirical reordering method is applied to inject correlation to link ensemble members in the forecasts of base flow and fast flow robertson et al 2013b wu et al 2018 taking the forecasts for a certain three month period as an example i observations of base fast flow in this three month period in historic records are selected to serve as the templates of shuffling q t q 1 t q n t in which n is the number of years used for template ii forecasts of base fast flow which are to be shuffled are denoted as f f 1 f l f 1 1 f n 1 f 1 l f n l ensemble members of forecasts are divided into l sets and each one consists n members iii let q t q 1 t q n t denote the sorted q t from small to large similarly each set of f is also sorted and is denoted as f f 1 f l f 1 1 f n 1 f 1 l f n l it means that f 1 k f n k for k 1 l iv let b b 1 b n denote the indices of values of q t in q t and it represents the order of historic observations subsequently each set of f is reordered according to b and shuffled forecasts is denoted as f s f s 1 f s l f 1 s 1 f n s 1 f 1 s l f n s l specifically each member of forecasts is reordered that is f b r s k f r k for r 1 n and k 1 l in this way the schaake shuffle is applied to forecasts in e4 and e5 through shuffling the forecasts of base flow and fast flow are linked they are then added up to form the forecasts of total flow for more information on the schaake shuffle please refer to clark et al 2004 2 3 verification of forecasts in the experiments forecasts are verified in terms of bias reliability and skill murphy 1993 robertson et al 2013a 2013b zhao et al 2016 strazzo et al 2019 the percentage of bias is calculated as 6 bias i 1 n f i i 1 n q i obs i 1 n q i obs 100 where n is the number of years under investigation f i represents the mean of the ensemble forecasts of flow for i th year q i obs denotes the observations of flow corresponding to forecasts f i bias is positive negative when forecasts overall tend to be larger smaller than observations forecast reliability describes whether the spread of ensemble forecasts captures the distribution of observations it is assessed by probability integral transform pit 7 pi t i c d f i q i obs where cd f i represents the cumulative distribution function of ensemble forecasts f i pi t i represents the cumulative probability of q i obs in the cd f i the pit uniform plot sorts the pit values and plot them against the quantiles of standard uniform distribution if forecasts are reliable then observations can be regarded as random samples drawn from ensemble forecasts in this case the pit values follow a standard uniform distribution and the pit uniform plot is along the 1 1 line otherwise the plot deviates from the 1 1 line it tends to distribute above below the 1 1 line when forecasts are negatively positively biased and its slope is relatively high low around the center of the quantiles of standard uniform variate when the ensemble spread is too narrow wide thyer et al 2009 wang and robertson 2011 forecasts skill measures the performance of flow forecasts relative to reference forecasts here is climatology forecasts brown et al 2010 pappenberger et al 2015 wang et al 2019 both the root mean square error rmse and the continuous ranked probability score crps are employed to measure the accuracy of forecasts the rmse which is a widely used deterministic measure is calculated from the ensemble mean of forecasts and the observations 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n f i q i obs 2 where f i represents the mean of the ensemble forecasts of flow for i th year q i obs represents the observations of flow corresponding to f i the rmse measures the difference between the ensemble mean of forecasts and the observations and it increases when the difference widens the mean crps crps which is an integrated measure of forecast quality and accounts for forecast reliability resolution and sharpness brown et al 2010 pappenberger et al 2015 harrigan et al 2018 is calculated as 9 crps 1 n i 1 n c d f i x h x q i obs 2 d x where cd f i x is the cumulative distribution function cdf of ensemble forecasts f i and h x q i obs is the heaviside function whose value is 0 when x q i obs 0 and is 1 when x q i obs 0 the crps measures the difference between cdfs of forecasts and observations and is calculated by the numerical integration hersbach 2000 the crps is zero when cd f i matches h and it increases as the difference between cd f i and h widens based on the rmse and the crps forecasts skill in the experiments is evaluated through rmses and crpss 10 rmses rmse reference rmse forecast rmse reference 100 crpss crps reference crps forecast crps reference 100 in which rmse reference crps reference denotes the rmse crps of reference forecasts rmse forecast crps forecast denotes the rmse crps of forecasts in the five experiments and rmses crpss denotes the rmse crps skill score a positive skill score indicates that ensemble forecasts outperform reference forecasts and vice versa 3 case study the three main tributaries of the pearl river in south china are selected to perform the forecasting experiments fig 1 the pearl river which covers approximately 4 54 105 km2 is the fourth largest river in terms of drainage area in china it is located in the tropical and sub tropical zones the mean annual precipitation is between 1200 mm and 2000 mm with most precipitation concentrating in the period from april to september wet season due to the east asia summer monsoon xiao et al 2016 niu et al 2017 daily total flow data is collected from the gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrometric stations which are respectively the control stations of the west river wr north river nr and east river er the elevations of the stations are respectively 11 m 8 m and 15 m the data ranges from 1958 to 2011 the first 20 years 1958 1977 data are used as templates of the schaake shuffle and are not employed in model training and forecasting the last 34 years 1978 2011 data are used in the forecasting experiments based on the daily flow the seasonal antecedent monthly flow are calculated and used as the predictand predictor in the five experiments for the wr nr and er boxplots of monthly flow from january to december during 1958 to 2011 are shown in the fig 2 the lower and upper bounds of the boxes represent 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentile respectively the upper whisker and lower whisker respectively extend to the largest and smallest data falling within q1 1 5iqr q3 1 5iqr iqr stands for interquartile range and the data beyond whiskers are considered as extreme values and are plotted as red cross dekking et al 2005 lima et al 2016 from the boxplots it can be observed that total flow concentrates in the period from april to september which matches the period of summer monsoon for most of the boxes the red horizontal lines representing median locate next to the bottom of the boxes indicating that flow data is positively skewed wr is the largest tributary of the pearl river accounting for nearly 77 8 of the drainage area of the pearl river as a result the flow of wr is much higher than those of nr and er 4 results 4 1 forecasts without considering base and fast flow for the wr nr and er the seasonal total flow the predictand is plotted against the antecedent monthly total flow the predictor by scatter plots in fig 3 in addition the spearman s rank correlation and its p value are marked in the figure the four seasons of mam jja son and djf are respectively spring summer autumn and winter in china it is observed that the correlation coefficients are all positive and most of them are significant at the level of 0 05 suggesting that antecedent monthly flow can be an effective predictor kirono et al 2010 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 meanwhile the correlation coefficient exhibits seasonality it tends to be higher in the dry season son and djf than in the wet season mam and jja in the dry season total flow mainly depends on catchment storage which makes seasonal total flow considerably correlate with antecedent total flow in the wet season monsoon precipitation is the dominate source of total flow and the temporal variability of monsoon precipitation leads to relatively low correlation coefficients e1 forecasts the seasonal total flow using the antecedent monthly total flow as the predictor forecasts of total flow for mam jja son and djf in the wr nr and er are illustrated in fig 4 the observations and the 25 75 and 10 90 ranges of ensemble forecasts are plotted against the forecast ensemble median the bias rmses and crpss of forecasts are illustrated also the ensemble seasonal forecasts are plotted as time series and shown by figs s1 to s3 in the supplementary material overall the ensemble forecasts can capture the distribution of observations the pit uniform plots fig s4 in the supplementary material are generally along the 1 1 line indicating that the ensemble forecasts are overall reliable this result confirms the effectiveness of the bjp model wang et al 2009a 2019 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 strazzo et al 2019 the bias is smaller than 2 across the twelve cases suggesting that systematic errors in the forecasts are small the forecast skill is mostly positive i e ensemble forecasts outperform climatology forecasts in most cases meanwhile it can be negative when correlation coefficient is low this result is attributed to cross validation specifically there are five parameters in the bi variate normal distribution of streamflow forecasting eq 4 while there are only two parameters to fit the marginal distribution to generate climatology forecasts in cross validation the models can overly fit sample specific noises under low correlation and the model with more parameters gets penalized michaelsen 1987 the skill tends to be higher in son and djf than in mam and jja aghelpour and varshavian 2020 this result suggests that monsoon precipitation in the wet season poses challenges to the forecasting of total flow especially for jja that is the peak season of monsoon in the pearl river 4 2 correlation coefficient and forecast skill correlation coefficient and forecast skill which are evaluated for total flow e1 are further assessed for fast and base flow e2 and e3 for the three tributaries and twelve three month periods the correlation coefficients for base and fast flow are plotted against the correlation coefficient of total flow in fig 5 the results of the three tributaries base flow and fast flow are differentiated by color symbol it can be seen that correlation coefficients of base flow and fast flow are mostly positive as the correlation coefficient of total flow increases the correlation coefficients of base and fast flow also increase the scatter points for base flow are mostly above the 1 1 line while the points of fast flow fall below the 1 1 line that is the correlation coefficients of base flow tend to be higher than those of total flow by contrast the correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower it is owing to that base flow is relatively smooth and reacts slowly to precipitation and that fast flow tends to be flashy and represents the water that is rapidly transported from precipitation into flow eckhardt 2005 eckhardt 2008 kronholm and capel 2016 for total fast and base flow the forecast skill under cross validation is plotted against the correlation coefficient in fig 6 the subplots at the left and right hand sides are respectively for rmses and crpss different colors symbols are used to differentiate the forecast skill for different tributaries types of flow overall the results of rmses and crpss exhibit similar patterns that is forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficients for total fast and base flow the forecast skill of fast flow is generally the lowest with some triangles falling below the horizontal line this result is attributed to the relatively low correlation coefficient of fast flow in cross validation it makes forecasting models overly fit sample specific noises and leads to unsatisfactory forecast skill of fast flow michaelsen 1987 while forecast skill generally increases with correlation coefficient it is noted that the forecast skill of total flow can be nearly 0 even when the correlation coefficient is above 0 40 for example for djf in the wr the correlation coefficient is as high as 0 53 the first row and fourth column in fig 3 but the rmses and crpss of forecasts turns out to be 0 45 and 1 54 the first row and fourth column in fig 4 this abnormal case and another similar case are examined in the next section 4 3 ensemble forecasts in selected cases two cases djf in the wr and ond in the nr are selected to analyze the cause of unsatisfactory forecast skill diagnostic plots for the two cases are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively in the upper part of the two figures total fast and base flow are analyzed using scatter plots of the relationships between seasonal and antecedent monthly flow diagnostic plots of observations and forecasts in e1 e2 and e3 are shown in the lower part from figs 7 and 8 outliers are observed in the scatter plots of total flow of two cases specifically the antecedent monthly total flow for certain years can be extremely large but the subsequent seasonal total flow is not as extreme through the scatter plots of fast flow and base flow some similar outliers are observed for fast flow while outliers do not exist for base flow the indication is that outliers in total flow are owing to extremely large fast flow the lower parts of figs 7 and 8 present diagnostic plots of ensemble forecasts of total fast and base flow it can be observed that owing to extremely large antecedent monthly total flow seasonal forecasts of total flow are substantially enlarged in some years for example the monthly total flow in november 2008 is higher than 10 103 m3 s in the wr and the fast flow is estimated by the rdf to be 6 3 103 m3 s and accounts for nearly 60 of total flow fig 7 as is implied by the conditional distribution eq 5 the positive correlation between total flow in november and djf makes use of the outlier and generates ensemble forecasts that indicate extremely high total flow for djf in 2008 however the seasonal flow in djf 2008 turns out to be approximately 3 103 m3 s which is much lower than the forecasts this outcome substantially enlarges rmse and crps by contrast climatology forecasts are generated directly from the marginal distribution and their rmse and crps are not impacted by the positive correlation these results jointly contribute to the reduction of rmses and crpss eq 10 similarly in september 2001 fast flow in the nr is estimated to be 1 3 103 m3 s and accounts for nearly 60 of total flow which leads to unsatisfactory forecast skill of total flow fig 8 4 4 comparison of e4 and e5 to e1 e4 and e5 present two treatments of fast flow in the forecasting of seasonal total flow specifically climatology forecasts of fast flow are added to ensemble forecasts of base flow in e4 and ensemble forecasts of fast and base flow are summed up in e5 the diagnostic plots of total flow forecasts for e4 and e5 are shown in fig 9 which corresponds to the two cases in figs 7 and 8 overall forecasts of total flow in e4 and e5 outperform those in e1 it is observed that the forecasts corresponding to the extremely large antecedent total flow are no longer inflated accordingly forecast skill is improved rmses of djf in the wr increases from 0 45 in e1 to 15 48 in e4 and to 14 15 in e5 and crpss increases from 1 54 to 12 83 in e4 and to 10 64 in e5 in the case of ond in the nr rmses increases from 0 32 in e1 to 8 33 in e4 and to 8 24 in e5 and crpss increases from 0 83 in e1 to 10 70 in e4 and to 10 41 in e5 for the three tributaries and twelve three month periods the forecast skill in e4 and e5 is plotted against the forecast skill in e1 the results of rmses and crpss are respectively shown in the left and right hand sides of fig 10 in the subplots scatters points are generally above the 1 1 line the indication is that the forecast skill of total flow tends to be higher in e4 and e5 than in e1 meanwhile the upper part of fig 10 shows that some points still fall below the 1 1 line in e4 suggesting that the forecast skill in e4 can sometimes be lower than that in e1 forecasts for mam in the er are picked out to investigate the cause diagnostic plots of e1 e2 and e3 are shown in fig s5 of the supplementary material and diagnostic plots of e4 and e5 are shown in fig s6 from fig s5 it is found that the seasonal fast flow significantly correlates with the antecedent monthly fast flow and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0 42 indicating that fast flow can serve as an effective predictor in this case forecast skill of total flow is low in e4 that uses climatology forecasts of fast flow by contrast forecast skill is high in e5 which uses ensemble forecasts of fast flow the implication is that although fast flow can be problematic it still can contribute to forecast skill of total flow in some cases 5 discussion base and fast flow are two integral parts of total flow previous studies have incorporated base flow separation into machine learning models for streamflow forecasting corzo and solomatine 2007 taormina et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 corzo and solomatine 2007 and tongal and booij 2018 found that the consideration of base flow can improve the forecast skill but taormina et al 2015 pointed out that embedding base flow separation in modular models does not yield improved performances for total flow modeling the five experiments in this paper yield insights into the seemingly contradictory findings specifically the separation of base flow from fast flow works when there are outliers of total flow due to extremely large fast flow base flow relates to the dynamical process in which groundwater recharge total flow while fast flow represents the recharge of surface flow and subsurface flow from this perspective the separate considerations of base and fast flow help to consider the influences of different dynamical processes on total flow and to reduce the effects of outliers on forecasts skill the metrics for forecast verification are calculated in python to test the results rigorously the ensemble verification system evs brown et al 2010 is employed to calculate bias rmses and crpss for the two selected cases figs 7 and 8 as shown in figs s7 to s9 in the supplementary material the scatter plots of the three metrics calculated by python against those determined by the evs are generally along the 1 1 line confirming the evaluations of ensemble forecasts of base fast and total flow the five experiments are performed under the framework of cross validation that is the samples in the target year and the next two years are excluded from the set of samples to train the forecasting models lest the forecast skill is inflated while leave one year out cross validation is widely applied in precipitation studies catchment streamflow usually exhibits long term memory schepen et al 2014 harrigan et al 2018 accordingly this paper leaves three years data out to facilitate a stringent test based on the results shown in figs 6 10 it is found that forecast skill in e4 and e5 tends to be higher than that in e1 when there are outliers caused by extremely large antecedent fast flow robertson et al 2013a and zhao et al 2016 found that forecast skill tends to be low when the dominant source of antecedent total flow is in transition between fast flow and base flow in the pearl river september and october are generally the end of wet season and the beginning of dry season the dominate source of antecedent total flow is in transition from fast flow to base flow heavy precipitation in august september and october can induce extremely large fast flow in total flow when antecedent monthly total flow is used as the predictor it is not possible to differentiate the influence of fast flow and base flow given the differing roles of base and fast flow it is important to separate the two and consider them using respective forecasting models in the five experiments the average daily flow in the three month period is selected as the predictand and the average daily flow in the antecedent month is selected as the predictor this setting follows previous studies that considered antecedent monthly streamflow to be an effective predictor kirono et al 2010 robertson and wang 2012 zhao et al 2016 to test the robustness of the findings five additional forecasting experiments that use average daily flow in the antecedent three month period as the predictor are performed the additional results are illustrated by figs s10 to s14 in the supplementary material it is observed that the correlation coefficients between seasonal flow and the antecedent seasonal flow become lower the implication is that antecedent seasonal flow is not as effective as antecedent monthly flow in representing catchment storage as a result forecast skill is overall lower in the additional experiments given that forecast skill depends on correlation coefficient figs 6 and s13 nevertheless outliers of total flow owing to extremely large antecedent fast flow are observed they are also shown to impact the forecast skill of total flow the separation of base flow from fast flow is observed to deal with the outliers and contribute to the forecast skill of total flow fig s14 6 conclusions this paper has devised five experiments to investigate the differing roles of base and fast flow in the ensemble forecasting of seasonal streamflow in the five experiments average daily flow in the three month period is forecasted by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month as the predictor under leave three years out cross validation the results show that ensemble forecasts of seasonal flow are overall unbiased and reliable the processes of total fast and base flow play important parts in seasonal streamflow forecasting correlation coefficients of total flow tend to be higher than those of fast flow but lower than those of base flow high correlation coefficients generally lead to skillful forecasts however the forecast skill can be unsatisfactory when fast flow leads to extremely large antecedent monthly total flow but the subsequent seasonal total flow is not as large the separation of base flow from fast flow helps to differentiate the effects of base and fast flow on total flow it reduces the influences of outliers and improves the forecast skill the investigation in this paper is concentrated on the three main tributaries of the pearl river in south china the experiments of this paper can be extended to other case studies in the future for more detailed investigations of the consideration of base and fast flow in seasonal streamflow forecasting credit authorship

which is the foundation for gradient based inverse approaches kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1996 based on sensitivity analysis we are able to utilize some more rigorous approaches e g data worth analysis to assess the effectiveness of the observation and pumping scenario design dai et al 2016 finsterle 2015 leube et al 2012 neuman et al 2012 xue et al 2014 compared to traditional aquifer test using homogeneous conceptual model theis 1935 hydraulic tomography treat the aquifer as a heterogeneous medium and can explore the site specific properties by fusing multiple cross hole pumping tests cardiff et al 2012 kitanidis 2015 wang et al 2016 yeh and liu 2000 zha et al 2018 zhao and illman 2017 the design of a proper observation network and pumping test strategy is critical for the effectiveness of hydraulic tomography characterization wöhling et al 2016 since hydraulic tomography relies on the highly parameterized geostatistical inverse model the calculation of sensitivity maps i e the sensitivity of one head observation with respect to all independent spatial parameters in the domain of interest is critical for the characterization of aquifer heterogeneity the sensitivity maps can be obtained numerically by three methods leven and dietrich 2005 i e the perturbation method kitanidis and lee 2014 zha et al 2018 the sensitivity equation method and the adjoint equation method cardiff et al 2013 delay et al 2017 leven and dietrich 2006 liu and kitanidis 2011 lu and vesselinov 2015 sykes et al 1985 the perturbation method is based on the concept of parameter perturbation to approximate the sensitivity derivative the sensitivity equation method which takes a derivative of the governing equation with respect to one parameter is a continuous version of the perturbation method the numerical computational costs for these two methods are related to the number of parameters i e the times for solving the partial differential equation numerically in contrast the adjoint equation method only solves one adjoint state corresponding to the observation location and the sensitivity maps can be constructed by the adjoint state and the original state i e hydraulic head the computational costs for the adjoint method are dependent on the number of observations only thus the adjoint method is a preferred way to provide sensitivity maps in numerical simulations oliver 1993 investigated the influences of transmissivity and storativity perturbations on the drawdown during a pumping test using the frechet derivative concept and the sensitivity maps were given as convoluted integrals leven and dietrich 2006 utilized the adjoint equation to derive the sensitivity maps and the resultant analytical integrations which are equivalent to those in oliver 1993 to assess the configurations of the wells in hydraulic tests knight and kluitenberg 2005 employed the green function which is also equivalent to the adjoint function concept for deriving analytical expressions of the sensitivity maps which are the responses of drawdown on small variations in aquifer properties the analytical solution was presented in explicit expressions leading to a thorough study of the properties of the spatiotemporal sensitivity functions for both cross hole pumping tests and slug tests recently lu and vesselinov 2015 derived the analytical sensitivity maps of bounded rectangular aquifer using the adjoint equation method the solution is in the form of infinite series thus current analytical solutions for sensitivity maps are all based on the adjoint method although the adjoint method is computational efficient in numerical models sykes et al 1985 zhu and yeh 2005 the derivation is not very easy to follow some research has argued that deriving the adjoint equation in discrete form is more straightforward delay et al 2017 liu et al 2013 liu and kitanidis 2011 because the adjoint state equation are usually obtained from a purely mathematical perspective lu and vesselinov 2015 while the physical link between adjoint and sensitivity is lacking whenever there is a different problem e g a different partial differential equation a different adjoint equation needs to be derived thus the derivation of analytical solution based on the adjoint equation is problem specific and is difficult to generalize moreover the computational savings of the adjoint equation is irrelevant when it comes to obtaining analytical solutions in this study we have developed a novel analytical methodology to derive the sensitivity maps via the sensitivity equation in the case of transient groundwater flow induced by pumping in an unbounded two dimensional aquifer as far as we know this is the first time that sensitivity maps in terms of simple spatiotemporal functions are derived directly from the sensitivity equation without the help of the adjoint method by comparing the similarity of the two approaches it is evident that the adjoint equation with a source term at the observation location is the reciprocity of the groundwater flow equation induced by a unit impulse at the parameter perturbation location moreover since the analytical solutions avoid the complex integration with the help of laplace transform we can also derive the sensitivity maps of other observations such as flux due to small variation of hydraulic properties this method can be easily applied to other disciplines since it directly utilizes the similarity of the sensitivity equation and the original governing equation the rest of this technical note is organized as follows section 2 gives the groundwater flow equation initial and boundary conditions and the analytical solutions of head head gradient head temporal derivative based on the assumption of homogeneous mean parameters section 3 depicts the head sensitivity maps based on the sensitivity equations we then discuss the connection between the sensitivity equation method and the adjoint equation method in section 4 section 5 presents the conclusions of the current study 2 statement of the problem 2 1 groundwater flow equation and related analytical solutions we first consider flow in a saturated unbounded two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer induced by a variable rate pumping test the governing equation is 1 t x h x t q t δ x x p s x h x t t where t is time and x x y is the position vector in two dimensions x p is the position vector of the pumping location s x and t x are heterogeneous storativity and transmissivity functions q t is the time varying pumping rate positive when extraction and negative when injection and δ denotes the dirac delta function the initial condition and boundary condition are 2 h x t h 0 at t 0 3 h x t h 0 a t x x p since eqs 1 3 is linear a general solution of eqs 1 3 for pumping at location x p with variable pumping rate can be obtained by the superposition principle suppose h 0 x t is the head solution at location x and time t induced by a unit impulse at time 0 and location x p i e when q t δ t 0 in eq 1 governed by 4 t x h 0 x t δ t 0 δ x x p s x h 0 x t t with initial condition and boundary condition 5 h 0 x t h 0 t 0 6 h 0 x t h 0 x x p a general head solution for eqs 1 3 with arbitrary q t stressed at location x p is given by a temporal convolution see fig 1 for illustration 7 h x t 0 t q τ h 0 x t τ d τ q t h 0 x t where the temporal convolution is defined as f x t g x t 0 t f x t τ g x τ dτ in the case that storativity and transmissivity are spatially uniform with values t and s the solution of eqs 4 6 can be obtained as 8 h 0 x o t h 0 r p o t h 0 1 4 π t t exp u p o where r p o is the distance between observation location x o and pumping location x p u r p o 2 s 4tt if the pumping rate is constant over time q t q in eq 1 the well known theis solution theis 1935 can be obtained by substituting eq 8 into eq 7 and applying a change of variable transform see loáiciga 2010 9 s x o t s r p o t q 4 π t w u p o where drawdown s x t is defined as initial head h 0 minus head h x t q is the constant pumping rate and w u u e z z d z is the exponential integral function the hydraulic gradient h r is obtained by differentiating eq 9 with respect to the variable rp o zha et al 2017 10 h r p o s r p o q 2 π r p o t exp u p o the partial derivative with respect to rp o here implicitly denotes a changing x o the temporal derivative of drawdown s t can be derived in a similar way 11 s t x o h t x o q 4 π t t exp u p o 3 deriving the sensitivity maps via sensitivity equation in this section we derive the sensitivity maps via the sensitivity equation in the following context the mean values of t x and s x are assumed to be spatially uniform i e the heterogeneous field has a uniform mean satisfying the stationary assumption in geostatistical theory with mean values t and s in addition the sensitivity derivatives are evaluated at their ensemble mean parameters values rather than specific realizations of the random field this restriction is necessary to derive an explicit form analytical solution the conceptual model is a heterogeneous model since frechet derivative maps implicitly indicates independence of the parameters at different locations in contrast the sensitivity evaluated at the ensemble mean parameter makes the analytical solution from a homogeneous conceptual model applicable however the approximation embedded in the sensitivity analytical solution restricts its applicability to only small variance heterogeneity as will be shown later the obtained sensitivity equation is similar to the governing equation for groundwater flow eqs 1 3 except that the unknown head variable is replaced by the sensitivity variable and the time varying pumping rate q t is replaced by a function of the head solution thus superposition principle used in eq 7 can be applied again to obtain the sensitivity solution 3 1 sensitivity equations suppose we are interested in the sensitivity of head observation h x o t x p at location x o and time t induced by pumping at location x p with respect to a parameter y e g t or s at location x y by denoting ϕ x o t x p x y h x o t x p y x y and differentiate eq 1 with respect to y we have 12 t ϕ t y h s ϕ t h t s y the term involving pumping rate q vanishes since it is irrelevant to the local perturbation of parameter y furthermore we assume t and s are not cross correlated and their values at different locations are not correlated the spatial correlation can be added later if y refers to s at location x y eq 12 can be simplified as 13 t ϕ h t δ x x y s ϕ t similarly if y refers to t eq 12 can be simplified as 14 t ϕ δ x x y h s ϕ t the initial condition and boundary condition are 15 ϕ x t 0 t 0 16 ϕ x t 0 x x p 3 2 sensitivity of head on storativity it can be observed that the governing equation for sensitivity of head on s i e eq 13 is similar to the governing equation of groundwater flow stressed by pumping test i e eq 1 that is eq 13 defines a groundwater flow problem with a pumping well at x y a variable pumping rate q t h x x y t x p t and homogeneous initial and boundary conditions eqs 15 and 16 the x x y in the brackets indicates that we are only interested in the spatial function h t at the parameter perturbation location x y due to the property of the dirac delta function to solve the sensitivity equation by the superposition principle e g eq 7 a fundamental solution similar to h 0 in eq 7 should be introduced first suppose ϕ 0 x t is the sensitivity solution at location x and time t induced by a unit impulse at time 0 and location x y ϕ 0 x t is governed by the equation 17 t ϕ 0 δ x x y δ t 0 s ϕ 0 t subject to homogeneous initial and boundary conditions i e eqs 15 and 16 with ϕ replaced by ϕ 0 the solution ϕ 0 at location x o is similar to h 0 in eq 8 without the boundary head h 0 and is given as 18 ϕ 0 x o t x y 1 4 π t t exp r y o 2 s 4 t t where ry o is the radial distance between x y and x o assuming stationarity h x y t t is given by eq 11 19 h t x y q 4 π t t exp r p y 2 s 4 t t where rp y is the radial distance between x p and x y since the convoluted integration can be solved conveniently by laplace transform due to the fact that l f t g t l f t l g t we first obtain the laplace transform of h t and ϕ 0 t 20 l h t q 2 π t k 0 r p y 2 s t p 21 l ϕ 0 t 1 2 π t k 0 r y o 2 s t p where p is the transformed variable corresponding to t kn is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order n thus the laplace transform of ϕ x o t x p x y h x o t x p s x y is 22 l ϕ t q 4 π 2 t 2 k 0 r p y 2 s t p k 0 r y o 2 s t p according to eqs 32 and 33 in appendix 6 3 we have 23 h x o t x p s x y q 8 π 2 t 2 t exp s r p y 2 r y o 2 4 t t k 0 s r p y r y o 2 t t it should be noted that this form of analytical solution was firstly presented in knight and kluitenberg 2005 in which the green function was employed compared with other work leven and dietrich 2006 oliver 1993 that uses the integration form as the final analytical solution this form is more straightforward and allow us to explore the mathematical properties of the sensitivity maps easily to the best of our knowledge this is for the first time sensitivity maps are derived directly from the sensitivity equations 3 3 sensitivity of head on transmissivity it should be noted that any function times dirac delta function e g f x δ x a will result in a missing of information of f x except its value at point a that is f x δ x a should be considered as f a δ x a before it is applied with the outer partial derivative operator since f a is a constant number it can be directly taken out of the derivative as a result eq 14 can be rewritten as 24 t ϕ h x y δ x x y s ϕ t the spatial dot product in eq 24 can be further expanded in the x and y directions 25 t ϕ h x x y δ x x y x h y x y δ x x y y s ϕ t the derivative of the dirac delta function can be written in a limit form 26 t ϕ h r p y x y r p y x lim ε 0 δ x δ x x y δ x x y ε r p y y lim ε 0 δ x δ y x y δ x x y ε s ϕ t where δ x ε 0 δ y 0 ε each dirac delta function corresponds to a pumping location again due to the convenience of the temporal convolution we first find the laplace transform of h r 27 l h r x y q 2 π t s tp k 1 r p y 2 s t p recall the laplace transform of ϕ 0 in eq 21 the laplace transform of ϕ x x o t x p x y h x o t x p t x y is 28 l ϕ t q 4 π 2 t 2 s tp k 1 r p y 2 s t p lim ε 0 1 ε r p y x k 0 c r y ε x o 2 k 0 c r y o 2 lim ε 0 1 ε r p y y k 0 c r y ε y o 2 k 0 c r y o 2 where r y ε x o 2 x y δ x x o 2 r y ε y o 2 x y δ y x o 2 c sp t the limit operators can be replaced by the partial derivative and eq 28 becomes 29 l ϕ t q 4 π 2 t 2 s tp k 1 r p y 2 s t p r p y x r y o x r y o k 0 sp t r y o 2 r p y y r y o y r y o k 0 sp t r y o 2 the negative signs in eq 29 comes from the fact that δ x δx x y δ x xy δx and δ x δy x y δ x xy δy applying that k0 x x k1 x we have 30 l ϕ t qs 4 π 2 t 3 k 1 r p y 2 s t p k 1 r y o 2 s t p r p y x r y o x r p y y r y o y without losing generality suppose x o a 0 t x p a 0 t x y x y t we have rp y x x a rp y ry o x x a ry o rp y y y rp y ry o y y ry o substituting these results and using the results in eqs 32 and 33 in the appendix we have 31 h x o t x p t x y qs 8 π 2 t 3 t x 2 y 2 a 2 r p y r y o k 1 s t r p y r y o 2 t exp s r p y 2 r y o 2 4 t t it should be noted that the gradient term i e rp y x ry o x rp y y ry o y in eq 30 is responsible for the change of sign in the sensitivity map h t that is the sensitivity is exactly zero along the circle that cross both the pumping well and observation well it is positive inside the circle and negative outside see fig 2 this is observed by many previous studies leven and dietrich 2006 sun et al 2013 the above derivation for sensitivity of head on transmissivity is straightforward by using a finite difference approximation for the spatial gradient of dirac delta function a more rigid derivation using spatial integration yielding the same result is given in appendix 6 2 the sensitivity solutions eqs 23 and 31 are very useful information linking the parameter heterogeneity with the head observations induced by constant rate pumping test however the assumption of no spatial correlation could limit their applications instead cross correlation maps that links the head observations with spatially correlated parameters could be more useful in geostatistical inversions mathematically the cross correlation is obtained by smoothing the sensitivity function with parameter spatial correlation kernel i e a spatial convolution or blur 4 discussion we have shown that the sensitivity equations have the same form of groundwater flow equation with a different source term stressed at the parameter location of interest x y and we are particularly interested in the solution at location x o for the sensitivity of head with respect to storativity the magnitude of the source term is the temporal derivative of the mean head h t at location x y induced by the real pumping at location x p the sensitivity then can be obtained via the principle of superposition and the final result is the convolution of h t and the unit impulse solution ϕ 0 for sensitivity of head with respect to transmissivity the final result is the temporal convolution and spatial dot product of h and the spatial gradient of unit impulse solution ϕ 0 recall that the definition of sensitivity is ϕ x o t x p x y h x o t x p y x y in which three locations are involved the sensitivity equation is not suitable for numerically calculation of sensitivity maps since the equation is more suitable for sensitivity having fixed pumping location x p parameter location x y but arbitrary observation location x o however in the analytical solution any of the three locations x p x y x o can be treated as arbitrary or fixed values it is interesting to note that in the sensitivity expressions eqs 23 and 31 rp y and ry o are interchangeable this is required by the reciprocity theorem delay et al 2011 which states that the position of pumping location x p and the observation location x o are interchangeable it is easy to observe that the derivations of sensitivity maps from the sensitivity equations and the adjoint equations share many similarities for instance the unit impulse equation with variable ϕ 0 has basically the same form as the adjoint equation with variable transform φ φ see appendix 6 3 for details while the pumping location and the observation location in these two equations are exchanged specifically ϕ 0 x o t x y is the solution of groundwater flow induced by pumping at x y and observed at x o while φ x y t x o is the solution of groundwater flow induced by pumping at x o and observed at x y again they are equivalent due to the reciprocity theorem here we demonstrate the essence of the adjoint equation it is the reciprocity of the unit impulse sensitivity equation by exchanging the pumping and observation locations even though it is generally computationally more intensive in numerical modeling deriving the sensitivity equation as well as the final analytical sensitivity results is much more straightforward than employing the adjoint concept 5 conclusions in this technical note we have demonstrated that the analytical solutions of sensitivity maps can be derived by the sensitivity equation directly which is different from a series of previous results relying on the adjoint equation by comparing the two methods it is found that the sensitivity equation and the adjoint equation are closely connected although the sensitivity equation is not efficient for numerical modeling since it requires many runs to obtain spatial sensitivity maps i e many parameter locations it is efficient in terms of obtaining the analytical solution and it does not require derivation of the adjoint thus the method proposed in this manuscript can be applied to other problems such as ert inversion in geophysics which have different forms of governing equations moreover the analytical solution is expressed as explicit functions without any convoluted integration thus it is easy to further derive the sensitivity maps of flux observation and other quantities that are related to the point head observations declaration of competing interest the authors declare

d has analytical solution as 33 f t 1 2 t exp r 1 2 r 2 2 4 d t k n r 1 r 2 2 d t 6 2 deriving sensitivity of head on transmissivity via integration method it is noted that eq 14 describes a diffusion type equation with source term hδ x x y since the dirac delta function is inside a spatial gradient operator it is equivalent to say that the source term includes several stress locations see a discrete equation in section 3 3 under this situation the solution of eqs 14 16 can be obtained by temporal convolution and spatial integration since there are multiple stress locations 34 ϕ x t ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d ω where ϕ 0 is the solution of eq 17 the r h s of eq 34 can be rewritten as 35 ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d ω ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d ω ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ h x τ δ x x y d τ d ω γ 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d γ ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ h x τ δ x x y d τ d ω where the first term on the r h s of eq 36 applied the divergence theorem and γ is boundary of ω since ϕ 0 is zero at γ x the first term is zero and ϕ can be calculated as 36 ϕ x t ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ h x τ δ x x y d τ d ω 0 t ϕ 0 x y t τ h x y τ d τ ϕ 0 x o t x y x h x y t x p x ϕ 0 x o t x y y h x y t x p y substituting the values of ϕ 0 and h and using laplace transform we can get the same results as in eq 30 it is easy to find that the derivation in section 3 3 is a discrete version of the derivation here more specifically a spatial derivative of ϕ 0 corresponds to the spatial derivative of the dirac delta function in eqs 23 and 24 moreover the derivation in eq 35 is similar to the derivation of the adjoint equation except the adjoint variable φ is the solution at observation location x y stressed at location x o while the sensitivity variable ϕ 0 is the fundamental unit impulse solution at observation location x o stressed at location x y 6 3 deriving the sensitivity maps via adjoint equation this section derive the same analytical sensitivity maps via adjoint equations which was done in knight and kluitenberg 2005 leven and dietrich 2006 oliver 1993 although the adjoint equations may not be explicitly mentioned adjoint equation to calculate the sensitivity of head with respect to spatial hydraulic parameters the adjoint method are frequently employed due to its high efficiency in this problem with only a few observation points and a lot of parameters the adjoint variable φ can be solved via the adjoint state equation lu and vesselinov 2015 zha et al 2017 37 s φ t k φ δ x x o δ t 0 subject to the boundary conditions and initial conditions 38 φ x t 0 t 0 39 φ x t 0 x x p the governing equation of the adjoint variable is analogous to the unit impulse injection at location x o and time t 0 for spatially uniform hydraulic parameters the solution of φ is similar to ϕ 0 in eq 8 without the boundary head h 0 and the negative sign 40 φ r o y t 1 4 π t t exp r o y 2 s 4 t t moreover it is easy to find out that the result of the gradient of φ 41 φ r 1 4 π t t 2 r o y s 4 t t exp r o y 2 s 4 t t the readers can refer to knight and kluitenberg 2005 lu and vesselinov 2015 sykes et al 1985 for the derivation of the adjoint equation for transient flow in 2 d saturated aquifer using divergence theorem and the properties of the divergence operator we can conclude that the sensitivity map of head with respect to storativity is the convolution of the time derivative of the head with adjoint variable or green s function likewise the sensitivity map of head with respect to transmissivity is the combined convolution in the time domain and scalar product of the spatial gradient of the head function with the spatial gradient of adjoint variable sensitivity of head on parameters the sensitivity for the observation h x o t at location x o and time t with respect to the change of parameter y at location x y is obtained via the temporal convolution of head function and adjoint function zha et al 2017 42 h x o x p t t x y φ x t x h x t x φ x t y h x t y φ x t r p y h x t r y o r p y x r y o x r p y y r y o y 43 h x o t o s x y φ x t h x t t we can substitute the analytical results of φ h t φ r and h r into eqs 42 and 43 with the help of laplace transform we also can obtain the sensitivity maps in eq 23 and eq 31 it should be noted there are different variants of the adjoint state equation eqs 37 39 for instance in some studies the sign of the dirac delta function term in eq 37 is negative e g lu and vesselinov 2015 and some authors use a terminal condition instead of initial condition eq 38 for instance mao et al 2013 zhu and yeh 2005 the adjoint equation of in lu and vesselinov 2015 and mao et al 2013 zhu and yeh 2005 can be obtained by transformation φ φ and temporally reverse transformation φ τ φ t τ other than the difference induced by transformation we can easily find that the adjoint equation and the fundamental sensitivity equation eq 17 are reciprocal in the sense that the adjoint variable φ is the solution at observation location x y caused by a stress at location x o while the fundamental sensitivity variable ϕ 0 is the solution at observation location x o caused by a pumping at location x y according the principle of reciprocity they are the same regardless of heterogeneity or boundary conditions however obtaining the sensitivity map via sensitivity equation is more much straightforward

to assess the effectiveness of the observation and pumping scenario design dai et al 2016 finsterle 2015 leube et al 2012 neuman et al 2012 xue et al 2014 compared to traditional aquifer test using homogeneous conceptual model theis 1935 hydraulic tomography treat the aquifer as a heterogeneous medium and can explore the site specific properties by fusing multiple cross hole pumping tests cardiff et al 2012 kitanidis 2015 wang et al 2016 yeh and liu 2000 zha et al 2018 zhao and illman 2017 the design of a proper observation network and pumping test strategy is critical for the effectiveness of hydraulic tomography characterization wöhling et al 2016 since hydraulic tomography relies on the highly parameterized geostatistical inverse model the calculation of sensitivity maps i e the sensitivity of one head observation with respect to all independent spatial parameters in the domain of interest is critical for the characterization of aquifer heterogeneity the sensitivity maps can be obtained numerically by three methods leven and dietrich 2005 i e the perturbation method kitanidis and lee 2014 zha et al 2018 the sensitivity equation method and the adjoint equation method cardiff et al 2013 delay et al 2017 leven and dietrich 2006 liu and kitanidis 2011 lu and vesselinov 2015 sykes et al 1985 the perturbation method is based on the concept of parameter perturbation to approximate the sensitivity derivative the sensitivity equation method which takes a derivative of the governing equation with respect to one parameter is a continuous version of the perturbation method the numerical computational costs for these two methods are related to the number of parameters i e the times for solving the partial differential equation numerically in contrast the adjoint equation method only solves one adjoint state corresponding to the observation location and the sensitivity maps can be constructed by the adjoint state and the original state i e hydraulic head the computational costs for the adjoint method are dependent on the number of observations only thus the adjoint method is a preferred way to provide sensitivity maps in numerical simulations oliver 1993 investigated the influences of transmissivity and storativity perturbations on the drawdown during a pumping test using the frechet derivative concept and the sensitivity maps were given as convoluted integrals leven and dietrich 2006 utilized the adjoint equation to derive the sensitivity maps and the resultant analytical integrations which are equivalent to those in oliver 1993 to assess the configurations of the wells in hydraulic tests knight and kluitenberg 2005 employed the green function which is also equivalent to the adjoint function concept for deriving analytical expressions of the sensitivity maps which are the responses of drawdown on small variations in aquifer properties the analytical solution was presented in explicit expressions leading to a thorough study of the properties of the spatiotemporal sensitivity functions for both cross hole pumping tests and slug tests recently lu and vesselinov 2015 derived the analytical sensitivity maps of bounded rectangular aquifer using the adjoint equation method the solution is in the form of infinite series thus current analytical solutions for sensitivity maps are all based on the adjoint method although the adjoint method is computational efficient in numerical models sykes et al 1985 zhu and yeh 2005 the derivation is not very easy to follow some research has argued that deriving the adjoint equation in discrete form is more straightforward delay et al 2017 liu et al 2013 liu and kitanidis 2011 because the adjoint state equation are usually obtained from a purely mathematical perspective lu and vesselinov 2015 while the physical link between adjoint and sensitivity is lacking whenever there is a different problem e g a different partial differential equation a different adjoint equation needs to be derived thus the derivation of analytical solution based on the adjoint equation is problem specific and is difficult to generalize moreover the computational savings of the adjoint equation is irrelevant when it comes to obtaining analytical solutions in this study we have developed a novel analytical methodology to derive the sensitivity maps via the sensitivity equation in the case of transient groundwater flow induced by pumping in an unbounded two dimensional aquifer as far as we know this is the first time that sensitivity maps in terms of simple spatiotemporal functions are derived directly from the sensitivity equation without the help of the adjoint method by comparing the similarity of the two approaches it is evident that the adjoint equation with a source term at the observation location is the reciprocity of the groundwater flow equation induced by a unit impulse at the parameter perturbation location moreover since the analytical solutions avoid the complex integration with the help of laplace transform we can also derive the sensitivity maps of other observations such as flux due to small variation of hydraulic properties this method can be easily applied to other disciplines since it directly utilizes the similarity of the sensitivity equation and the original governing equation the rest of this technical note is organized as follows section 2 gives the groundwater flow equation initial and boundary conditions and the analytical solutions of head head gradient head temporal derivative based on the assumption of homogeneous mean parameters section 3 depicts the head sensitivity maps based on the sensitivity equations we then discuss the connection between the sensitivity equation method and the adjoint equation method in section 4 section 5 presents the conclusions of the current study 2 statement of the problem 2 1 groundwater flow equation and related analytical solutions we first consider flow in a saturated unbounded two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer induced by a variable rate pumping test the governing equation is 1 t x h x t q t δ x x p s x h x t t where t is time and x x y is the position vector in two dimensions x p is the position vector of the pumping location s x and t x are heterogeneous storativity and transmissivity functions q t is the time varying pumping rate positive when extraction and negative when injection and δ denotes the dirac delta function the initial condition and boundary condition are 2 h x t h 0 at t 0 3 h x t h 0 a t x x p since eqs 1 3 is linear a general solution of eqs 1 3 for pumping at location x p with variable pumping rate can be obtained by the superposition principle suppose h 0 x t is the head solution at location x and time t induced by a unit impulse at time 0 and location x p i e when q t δ t 0 in eq 1 governed by 4 t x h 0 x t δ t 0 δ x x p s x h 0 x t t with initial condition and boundary condition 5 h 0 x t h 0 t 0 6 h 0 x t h 0 x x p a general head solution for eqs 1 3 with arbitrary q t stressed at location x p is given by a temporal convolution see fig 1 for illustration 7 h x t 0 t q τ h 0 x t τ d τ q t h 0 x t where the temporal convolution is defined as f x t g x t 0 t f x t τ g x τ dτ in the case that storativity and transmissivity are spatially uniform with values t and s the solution of eqs 4 6 can be obtained as 8 h 0 x o t h 0 r p o t h 0 1 4 π t t exp u p o where r p o is the distance between observation location x o and pumping location x p u r p o 2 s 4tt if the pumping rate is constant over time q t q in eq 1 the well known theis solution theis 1935 can be obtained by substituting eq 8 into eq 7 and applying a change of variable transform see loáiciga 2010 9 s x o t s r p o t q 4 π t w u p o where drawdown s x t is defined as initial head h 0 minus head h x t q is the constant pumping rate and w u u e z z d z is the exponential integral function the hydraulic gradient h r is obtained by differentiating eq 9 with respect to the variable rp o zha et al 2017 10 h r p o s r p o q 2 π r p o t exp u p o the partial derivative with respect to rp o here implicitly denotes a changing x o the temporal derivative of drawdown s t can be derived in a similar way 11 s t x o h t x o q 4 π t t exp u p o 3 deriving the sensitivity maps via sensitivity equation in this section we derive the sensitivity maps via the sensitivity equation in the following context the mean values of t x and s x are assumed to be spatially uniform i e the heterogeneous field has a uniform mean satisfying the stationary assumption in geostatistical theory with mean values t and s in addition the sensitivity derivatives are evaluated at their ensemble mean parameters values rather than specific realizations of the random field this restriction is necessary to derive an explicit form analytical solution the conceptual model is a heterogeneous model since frechet derivative maps implicitly indicates independence of the parameters at different locations in contrast the sensitivity evaluated at the ensemble mean parameter makes the analytical solution from a homogeneous conceptual model applicable however the approximation embedded in the sensitivity analytical solution restricts its applicability to only small variance heterogeneity as will be shown later the obtained sensitivity equation is similar to the governing equation for groundwater flow eqs 1 3 except that the unknown head variable is replaced by the sensitivity variable and the time varying pumping rate q t is replaced by a function of the head solution thus superposition principle used in eq 7 can be applied again to obtain the sensitivity solution 3 1 sensitivity equations suppose we are interested in the sensitivity of head observation h x o t x p at location x o and time t induced by pumping at location x p with respect to a parameter y e g t or s at location x y by denoting ϕ x o t x p x y h x o t x p y x y and differentiate eq 1 with respect to y we have 12 t ϕ t y h s ϕ t h t s y the term involving pumping rate q vanishes since it is irrelevant to the local perturbation of parameter y furthermore we assume t and s are not cross correlated and their values at different locations are not correlated the spatial correlation can be added later if y refers to s at location x y eq 12 can be simplified as 13 t ϕ h t δ x x y s ϕ t similarly if y refers to t eq 12 can be simplified as 14 t ϕ δ x x y h s ϕ t the initial condition and boundary condition are 15 ϕ x t 0 t 0 16 ϕ x t 0 x x p 3 2 sensitivity of head on storativity it can be observed that the governing equation for sensitivity of head on s i e eq 13 is similar to the governing equation of groundwater flow stressed by pumping test i e eq 1 that is eq 13 defines a groundwater flow problem with a pumping well at x y a variable pumping rate q t h x x y t x p t and homogeneous initial and boundary conditions eqs 15 and 16 the x x y in the brackets indicates that we are only interested in the spatial function h t at the parameter perturbation location x y due to the property of the dirac delta function to solve the sensitivity equation by the superposition principle e g eq 7 a fundamental solution similar to h 0 in eq 7 should be introduced first suppose ϕ 0 x t is the sensitivity solution at location x and time t induced by a unit impulse at time 0 and location x y ϕ 0 x t is governed by the equation 17 t ϕ 0 δ x x y δ t 0 s ϕ 0 t subject to homogeneous initial and boundary conditions i e eqs 15 and 16 with ϕ replaced by ϕ 0 the solution ϕ 0 at location x o is similar to h 0 in eq 8 without the boundary head h 0 and is given as 18 ϕ 0 x o t x y 1 4 π t t exp r y o 2 s 4 t t where ry o is the radial distance between x y and x o assuming stationarity h x y t t is given by eq 11 19 h t x y q 4 π t t exp r p y 2 s 4 t t where rp y is the radial distance between x p and x y since the convoluted integration can be solved conveniently by laplace transform due to the fact that l f t g t l f t l g t we first obtain the laplace transform of h t and ϕ 0 t 20 l h t q 2 π t k 0 r p y 2 s t p 21 l ϕ 0 t 1 2 π t k 0 r y o 2 s t p where p is the transformed variable corresponding to t kn is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order n thus the laplace transform of ϕ x o t x p x y h x o t x p s x y is 22 l ϕ t q 4 π 2 t 2 k 0 r p y 2 s t p k 0 r y o 2 s t p according to eqs 32 and 33 in appendix 6 3 we have 23 h x o t x p s x y q 8 π 2 t 2 t exp s r p y 2 r y o 2 4 t t k 0 s r p y r y o 2 t t it should be noted that this form of analytical solution was firstly presented in knight and kluitenberg 2005 in which the green function was employed compared with other work leven and dietrich 2006 oliver 1993 that uses the integration form as the final analytical solution this form is more straightforward and allow us to explore the mathematical properties of the sensitivity maps easily to the best of our knowledge this is for the first time sensitivity maps are derived directly from the sensitivity equations 3 3 sensitivity of head on transmissivity it should be noted that any function times dirac delta function e g f x δ x a will result in a missing of information of f x except its value at point a that is f x δ x a should be considered as f a δ x a before it is applied with the outer partial derivative operator since f a is a constant number it can be directly taken out of the derivative as a result eq 14 can be rewritten as 24 t ϕ h x y δ x x y s ϕ t the spatial dot product in eq 24 can be further expanded in the x and y directions 25 t ϕ h x x y δ x x y x h y x y δ x x y y s ϕ t the derivative of the dirac delta function can be written in a limit form 26 t ϕ h r p y x y r p y x lim ε 0 δ x δ x x y δ x x y ε r p y y lim ε 0 δ x δ y x y δ x x y ε s ϕ t where δ x ε 0 δ y 0 ε each dirac delta function corresponds to a pumping location again due to the convenience of the temporal convolution we first find the laplace transform of h r 27 l h r x y q 2 π t s tp k 1 r p y 2 s t p recall the laplace transform of ϕ 0 in eq 21 the laplace transform of ϕ x x o t x p x y h x o t x p t x y is 28 l ϕ t q 4 π 2 t 2 s tp k 1 r p y 2 s t p lim ε 0 1 ε r p y x k 0 c r y ε x o 2 k 0 c r y o 2 lim ε 0 1 ε r p y y k 0 c r y ε y o 2 k 0 c r y o 2 where r y ε x o 2 x y δ x x o 2 r y ε y o 2 x y δ y x o 2 c sp t the limit operators can be replaced by the partial derivative and eq 28 becomes 29 l ϕ t q 4 π 2 t 2 s tp k 1 r p y 2 s t p r p y x r y o x r y o k 0 sp t r y o 2 r p y y r y o y r y o k 0 sp t r y o 2 the negative signs in eq 29 comes from the fact that δ x δx x y δ x xy δx and δ x δy x y δ x xy δy applying that k0 x x k1 x we have 30 l ϕ t qs 4 π 2 t 3 k 1 r p y 2 s t p k 1 r y o 2 s t p r p y x r y o x r p y y r y o y without losing generality suppose x o a 0 t x p a 0 t x y x y t we have rp y x x a rp y ry o x x a ry o rp y y y rp y ry o y y ry o substituting these results and using the results in eqs 32 and 33 in the appendix we have 31 h x o t x p t x y qs 8 π 2 t 3 t x 2 y 2 a 2 r p y r y o k 1 s t r p y r y o 2 t exp s r p y 2 r y o 2 4 t t it should be noted that the gradient term i e rp y x ry o x rp y y ry o y in eq 30 is responsible for the change of sign in the sensitivity map h t that is the sensitivity is exactly zero along the circle that cross both the pumping well and observation well it is positive inside the circle and negative outside see fig 2 this is observed by many previous studies leven and dietrich 2006 sun et al 2013 the above derivation for sensitivity of head on transmissivity is straightforward by using a finite difference approximation for the spatial gradient of dirac delta function a more rigid derivation using spatial integration yielding the same result is given in appendix 6 2 the sensitivity solutions eqs 23 and 31 are very useful information linking the parameter heterogeneity with the head observations induced by constant rate pumping test however the assumption of no spatial correlation could limit their applications instead cross correlation maps that links the head observations with spatially correlated parameters could be more useful in geostatistical inversions mathematically the cross correlation is obtained by smoothing the sensitivity function with parameter spatial correlation kernel i e a spatial convolution or blur 4 discussion we have shown that the sensitivity equations have the same form of groundwater flow equation with a different source term stressed at the parameter location of interest x y and we are particularly interested in the solution at location x o for the sensitivity of head with respect to storativity the magnitude of the source term is the temporal derivative of the mean head h t at location x y induced by the real pumping at location x p the sensitivity then can be obtained via the principle of superposition and the final result is the convolution of h t and the unit impulse solution ϕ 0 for sensitivity of head with respect to transmissivity the final result is the temporal convolution and spatial dot product of h and the spatial gradient of unit impulse solution ϕ 0 recall that the definition of sensitivity is ϕ x o t x p x y h x o t x p y x y in which three locations are involved the sensitivity equation is not suitable for numerically calculation of sensitivity maps since the equation is more suitable for sensitivity having fixed pumping location x p parameter location x y but arbitrary observation location x o however in the analytical solution any of the three locations x p x y x o can be treated as arbitrary or fixed values it is interesting to note that in the sensitivity expressions eqs 23 and 31 rp y and ry o are interchangeable this is required by the reciprocity theorem delay et al 2011 which states that the position of pumping location x p and the observation location x o are interchangeable it is easy to observe that the derivations of sensitivity maps from the sensitivity equations and the adjoint equations share many similarities for instance the unit impulse equation with variable ϕ 0 has basically the same form as the adjoint equation with variable transform φ φ see appendix 6 3 for details while the pumping location and the observation location in these two equations are exchanged specifically ϕ 0 x o t x y is the solution of groundwater flow induced by pumping at x y and observed at x o while φ x y t x o is the solution of groundwater flow induced by pumping at x o and observed at x y again they are equivalent due to the reciprocity theorem here we demonstrate the essence of the adjoint equation it is the reciprocity of the unit impulse sensitivity equation by exchanging the pumping and observation locations even though it is generally computationally more intensive in numerical modeling deriving the sensitivity equation as well as the final analytical sensitivity results is much more straightforward than employing the adjoint concept 5 conclusions in this technical note we have demonstrated that the analytical solutions of sensitivity maps can be derived by the sensitivity equation directly which is different from a series of previous results relying on the adjoint equation by comparing the two methods it is found that the sensitivity equation and the adjoint equation are closely connected although the sensitivity equation is not efficient for numerical modeling since it requires many runs to obtain spatial sensitivity maps i e many parameter locations it is efficient in terms of obtaining the analytical solution and it does not require derivation of the adjoint thus the method proposed in this manuscript can be applied to other problems such as ert inversion in geophysics which have different forms of governing equations moreover the analytical solution is expressed as explicit functions without any convoluted integration thus it is easy to further derive the sensitivity maps of flux observation and other quantities that are related to the point head observations declaration of competing interest the authors declare

d has analytical solution as 33 f t 1 2 t exp r 1 2 r 2 2 4 d t k n r 1 r 2 2 d t 6 2 deriving sensitivity of head on transmissivity via integration method it is noted that eq 14 describes a diffusion type equation with source term hδ x x y since the dirac delta function is inside a spatial gradient operator it is equivalent to say that the source term includes several stress locations see a discrete equation in section 3 3 under this situation the solution of eqs 14 16 can be obtained by temporal convolution and spatial integration since there are multiple stress locations 34 ϕ x t ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d ω where ϕ 0 is the solution of eq 17 the r h s of eq 34 can be rewritten as 35 ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d ω ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d ω ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ h x τ δ x x y d τ d ω γ 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ δ x x y h x τ d τ d γ ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ h x τ δ x x y d τ d ω where the first term on the r h s of eq 36 applied the divergence theorem and γ is boundary of ω since ϕ 0 is zero at γ x the first term is zero and ϕ can be calculated as 36 ϕ x t ω 0 t ϕ 0 x t τ h x τ δ x x y d τ d ω 0 t ϕ 0 x y t τ h x y τ d τ ϕ 0 x o t x y x h x y t x p x ϕ 0 x o t x y y h x y t x p y substituting the values of ϕ 0 and h and using laplace transform we can get the same results as in eq 30 it is easy to find that the derivation in section 3 3 is a discrete version of the derivation here more specifically a spatial derivative of ϕ 0 corresponds to the spatial derivative of the dirac delta function in eqs 23 and 24 moreover the derivation in eq 35 is similar to the derivation of the adjoint equation except the adjoint variable φ is the solution at observation location x y stressed at location x o while the sensitivity variable ϕ 0 is the fundamental unit impulse solution at observation location x o stressed at location x y 6 3 deriving the sensitivity maps via adjoint equation this section derive the same analytical sensitivity maps via adjoint equations which was done in knight and kluitenberg 2005 leven and dietrich 2006 oliver 1993 although the adjoint equations may not be explicitly mentioned adjoint equation to calculate the sensitivity of head with respect to spatial hydraulic parameters the adjoint method are frequently employed due to its high efficiency in this problem with only a few observation points and a lot of parameters the adjoint variable φ can be solved via the adjoint state equation lu and vesselinov 2015 zha et al 2017 37 s φ t k φ δ x x o δ t 0 subject to the boundary conditions and initial conditions 38 φ x t 0 t 0 39 φ x t 0 x x p the governing equation of the adjoint variable is analogous to the unit impulse injection at location x o and time t 0 for spatially uniform hydraulic parameters the solution of φ is similar to ϕ 0 in eq 8 without the boundary head h 0 and the negative sign 40 φ r o y t 1 4 π t t exp r o y 2 s 4 t t moreover it is easy to find out that the result of the gradient of φ 41 φ r 1 4 π t t 2 r o y s 4 t t exp r o y 2 s 4 t t the readers can refer to knight and kluitenberg 2005 lu and vesselinov 2015 sykes et al 1985 for the derivation of the adjoint equation for transient flow in 2 d saturated aquifer using divergence theorem and the properties of the divergence operator we can conclude that the sensitivity map of head with respect to storativity is the convolution of the time derivative of the head with adjoint variable or green s function likewise the sensitivity map of head with respect to transmissivity is the combined convolution in the time domain and scalar product of the spatial gradient of the head function with the spatial gradient of adjoint variable sensitivity of head on parameters the sensitivity for the observation h x o t at location x o and time t with respect to the change of parameter y at location x y is obtained via the temporal convolution of head function and adjoint function zha et al 2017 42 h x o x p t t x y φ x t x h x t x φ x t y h x t y φ x t r p y h x t r y o r p y x r y o x r p y y r y o y 43 h x o t o s x y φ x t h x t t we can substitute the analytical results of φ h t φ r and h r into eqs 42 and 43 with the help of laplace transform we also can obtain the sensitivity maps in eq 23 and eq 31 it should be noted there are different variants of the adjoint state equation eqs 37 39 for instance in some studies the sign of the dirac delta function term in eq 37 is negative e g lu and vesselinov 2015 and some authors use a terminal condition instead of initial condition eq 38 for instance mao et al 2013 zhu and yeh 2005 the adjoint equation of in lu and vesselinov 2015 and mao et al 2013 zhu and yeh 2005 can be obtained by transformation φ φ and temporally reverse transformation φ τ φ t τ other than the difference induced by transformation we can easily find that the adjoint equation and the fundamental sensitivity equation eq 17 are reciprocal in the sense that the adjoint variable φ is the solution at observation location x y caused by a stress at location x o while the fundamental sensitivity variable ϕ 0 is the solution at observation location x o caused by a pumping at location x y according the principle of reciprocity they are the same regardless of heterogeneity or boundary conditions however obtaining the sensitivity map via sensitivity equation is more much straightforward 
5057,the ability of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to monitor large scale drought events has been explored well during past few years we develop an alternative method viz weighted water storage deficit wwsd to characterize drought events over yangtze river basin yrb based on water storage deficit wsd method by combining grace rl06 sphere harmonic sh coefficient data and watergap global hydrology model wghm data we use component contribution ratio ccr of single terrestrial water compartment as weight to compute wwsd comparing with other commonly employed drought indices and precipitation data from global precipitation measurement gpm the results show that precipitation is the major trigger of water storage variation over yrb which both have significant seasonal change our findings also indicate different terrestrial water component contributes distinctly to terrestrial water storage tws variability and responds differently to drought features in yrb according to water component storage deficit wcsd eleven drought events are identified in yrb based on wwsd with 2003 2006 and 2011 experiencing the severest drought with drought intensity of 1 22 cm 1 34 cm and 1 02 cm respectively our study suggests that it is more realistic and reasonable to treat water components unequally to construct drought index derived from grace keywords water storage deficit weighted water storage deficit drought index grace 1 introduction it is well known that water resource plays an important role in sustaining the development of society and economy especially when it comes to the issues regarding water scarcity and security a recent study by forootan et al 2019 revealed that there is an increase in magnitude extent and length of hydrological droughts in most of the global basins such as mississippi euphrates terrestrial total water storage tws a key component in the earth s water energy and biogeochemical cycles güntner et al 2007 is composed of water on vegetation surfaces in the biomass in the unsaturated soil or rock zone as groundwater snow and ice and as surface water in rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands schmidt et al 2006 thus it is necessary to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal variation in tws traditional methods including in situ observation remotely sensed data and land surface model lsm were successfully applied to monitor tws change however these techniques have their intrinsic limitations in situ observation s spatial resolution is limited and sometimes it takes much cost to maintain these equipment which are used to collect data continuously chen et al 2006a b remotely sensed data have been used extensively to monitor surface and near surface components of the water cycle but have difficulty in attaining information of deep rooted water swenson et al 2008a b while tws estimates from lsms is still disturbed by uncertainty in water budgets and absence in some fundamental components chen et al 2016 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace launched in march 2002 is a dedicated dual satellite mission to map the global gravity field with unprecedented accuracy tapley et al 2004 as we all know that time variable gravity tvg is produced by mass redistribution in earth system on time scales from months to decades mass redistribution mainly occurs in the fluid envelopes oceans atmosphere ice caps continental reservoirs and is related to climate variability ramillien et al 2005 thus grace has the potential to provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring tws change some pre launch studies by wahr et al 1998 and rodell and famiglietti 1999 who constructed basic theory and equations for inferring surface mass variation demonstrated that tws can be inferred from grace tvg data in the form of expanded sphere harmonic sh coefficients which has launched a new era in studying a series of hydrology problems using standard sh products that are released by different organizations to estimate tws change is simple to implement although the higher sh degrees and orders with finite range are expected to be noisier and magnified by longitudinal stripes due to the orbit geometry of the grace mission davis et al 2008 the commonly used method to alleviate this situation is gaussian averaging filter wahr et al 1998 which is also called isotropic filter because the filter weight is only dependent on sh degrees han et al 2005a b reported accuracy estimates in grace monthly sh have distinct degree and order dependent patterns and developed a non isotropic filter han filter to enhance grace signals with significantly higher resolution in latitude and the same resolution in longitude as compared to the conventional gaussian smoother then swenson and wahr 2006 found this stripes effect is also due to the correlation in the spectral domain of the even and odd order sh thus constructed a decorrelation filter to remove the effect of the correlated errors over past couple of years many authors have designed other different filter methods to weaken the stripes or correlation to varying degree such as dynamic filter seo et al 2006 wiener optimal filter sasgen et al 2006 rms and fm filter chen et al 2006a b empirical orthogonal function filter wouters and schrama 2007 decorrelation filter based on a wavelet decomposition rangelova et al 2007 statistical filter davis et al 2008 fan filter zhang et al 2009 ddk filter kusche et al 2009 and so on however any filter techniques mentioned above to reduce high degree and order sh noise will attenuate signal amplitudes and bias estimates of mass change consequently it is necessary to find a method to restore true hydrological signal there are generally four approaches to reduce the bias and leakage effects long et al 2015 a scaling factor landerer and swenson 2012 b additive correction approach c multiplicative correction approach longuevergne et al 2010 and d data assimilation khaki et al 2018a b the differences and similarities in these methods and how to implement can be found in long et al 2015 with development of these filter technique and improved grace sh product released by center for space research csr jet propulsion laboratory jpl geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz et al using grace to estimate tws change in various locations has been applied like africa anyah et al 2018 yangtze river basin sun et al 2017 laplata basin pereira and pacino 2012 illinois swenson et al 2006 amazon chen et al 2009 although grace has the ability to monitor global or local scale tws change one may resort to other skills to estimate tws components because tvg on land are largely due to corresponding changes in vertically integrated tws which means we can not isolate one component from the others without ancillary data wahr et al 2004 most studies relied on hydrological models like global land data assimilation system gldas lenk 2013 watergap hydrological model wghm zhang et al 2015 long et al 2017 climate prediction center cpc feng et al 2013 or in situ measurement swenson et al 2006 or water balance budget rodell et al 2004 to estimate groundwater evapotranspiration surface water papa et al 2008 even biomass and to validate the accuracy of tws variation from grace meanwhile under demand of higher spatial and temporal resolution than sh product whose spatial resolution is approximately 300 km and temporal is one month han et al 2005a b introduced an alternative method to directly estimate the tws regionally by using grace satellite to satellite tracking and accelerometer data then many other authors jacob et al 2012 schrama et al 2014 have explored the potential of this method to estimate tws variation and called it mascon mass concentration whose spatial and temporal resolution is always improved than sh these mascon products are also released by different organizations and freely downloaded although the tvg is a product of the earth s mass distribution these data provided by grace can be used to study ice sheet mass change velicogna and wahr 2005 sea level change chambers 2006 oceanic mass variation guo et al 2010 improvement of hydrological model through data assimilation and deformation of solid earth davis et al 2004 besides monitoring tws change the unique potential of grace tvg measurements in monitoring extreme climate variability like severe drought and flooding events has also been demonstrated drought is a stochastic natural phenomenon and is known to cause extensive damage to reduce the damage from drought it is crucial to characterize droughts there are many methods to characterize droughts but drought index a quantitative measure that characterize drought levels by assimilating data from one or several variables indicators such as precipitation and evapotranspiration into a single numerical value provides a comprehensive picture for drought analysis and decision making zargar et al 2011 palmer drought severity index pdsi aiguo et al 2004 standard precipitation index spi and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for example are commonly used drought indices different tws components were considered as indicators to analyse the onset severity and duration of droughts like surface water storage keyantash and dracup 2004 groundwater castle et al 2014 and soil moisture abelen et al 2015 while other authors applied the sum of tws components derived from grace to characterize droughts yirdaw et al 2008 employed total storage deficit index tsdi obtained from grace to investigate 2002 2003 canadian prairie drought chen et al 2009 constructed an non seasonal tws change time series after deducting annual and semiannual sinusoids by unweighted least squares and found a significant tws deficit accompanying the 2005 amazon drought on the order of 14 cm of equivalent water thickness in the central amazon while drought s severity from gldas and ladworld land surface model was underestimated thomas et al 2014 calculated the magnitude of the deviation of regional monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies from the time series monthly climatology where negative deviations represent storage deficits and designed a water storage deficit index wsdi to analyse the peak magnitude duration and total severity of droughts in amazon zambezi united states texas respectively table 1 lists the major drought indices superscript a and b indicate the indicators that this index absorbs looking into the table 1 and the studies we read we conclude that these indices derived from grace was either developed to consider the sum of tws components as a whole or single component few of studies consider the roles of water storage components to calculate drought index which means different components are expected to contribute distinctly to tws variability huang et al 2019 thus to drought index in this paper we develop a weighted water storage deficit index wwsdi derived from wsdi but consider the contribution of individual tws components in order to obtain more reasonable droughts characterization by taking yangtze river basin as a case study the yangtze river basin yrb is the longest river in asia with 1 8 million km 2 watershed area originating from the tanggula range in western china and traversing 11 provinces and cities from west to east the yrb is located in subtropical and temperate climate zones with a mean annual air temperature evaporation and precipitation of 14 c 922 mm and 1100 mm respectively sun et al 2018 the yrb has undergone several extreme drought events in the past few years due to climate variability and human activities long et al 2015 applied scale factors from different lsms or ghms to tws anomalies and found two extreme drought periods in 2006 summer and 2011 spring respectively zhang et al 2015 also characterized these two droughts by constructing a normalized grace based tws anomaly examining the connection with el niño southern oscillation enso using artificial neural network approach to extend the grace tws observations 2003 12 to a longer tws time series 1979 2012 zhang et al 2016 concluded yrb experienced 29 times hydrological drought during 1979 2012 sun et al 2018 analyzed the onset severity recovery time and peak magnitude of eight drought over yrb events from 2003 to 2015 by wsdi thus we take yrb as case study and compare the results with these studies fig 1 shows the location of yrb we estimate tws components in the yrb and also compare wwsdi with wsdi and commonly used drought indices including spi spei and self calibrated pdsi scpdsi which is improved based on pdsi to verify its effectiveness this paper is organized as follows datasets are described in section 2 the rationality to develop wwsdi and method to calculate wwsdi are presented in section 3 while section 4 analyses the results along with discussion and section 5 arrives at conclusions 2 datasets 2 1 grace data we estimate tws anomaly twsa from grace using rl06 sh data determined from csr jpl csr sh jpl sh from 2003 1 to 2014 12 including 133 approximately monthly gravity solutions in the form of sh truncated at 60 1 1 anomaly fields are obtained by deducting multiple years time mean baseline c 20 degree 2 and order 0 coefficients are replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging cheng and ries 2017 due to this value determined from grace has a lager uncertainty than from slr the degree 1 coefficients are estimated from method developed by swenson et al 2008a b rl06 data represents the total gravity variability due to land surface hydrology cryospheric changes episodic earthquake processes glacial isostatic adjustment gia and corrections to the background models for atmospheric and oceanic processes although most effects are removed during postprocessing and negligible at time scales from days to years gia is generally separated based on the method from geruo et al 2013 then decorrelation filter swenson and wahr 2006 and gussian filter wahr et al 1998 are applied to reduce north south stripe noise and increased error in high degree and order sh with the annoying effect that attenuates some true hydrological signal and results in leakage error we choose scaling factor to restore lost signal different scaling factors not only impact the signal restoration for the seasonal amplitudes but also disturb the detection of drought events however according to long et al 2015 the leakage in and leakage out errors are offset for the entire yangtze river basin therefore signal restoration may not be critical for the entire basin thus we set scaling factor of 1 consistent with long et al 2015 missing month data are filled using linear interpolation using the mean values determined in the months before and after a missing month we also compare sh solutions with monthly csr and jpl mascon grid solutions csr m jpl m in order to verify our results details about these products can be referred to save et al 2016 2 2 precipitation precipitation is an important indicator to study yrb drought and obtained from global precipitation measurement gpm data products huffman et al 2019 the gpm initiated by nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa as a global successor to trmm is an international network of satellites that provide the next generation global observations of rain and snow the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation relevant satellite passive microwave pmw sensors the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg is the unified u s algorithm that provides the multi satellite precipitation product for the u s gpm team we use gpm imerg final precipitation data whose spatial and temporal resolution is 0 1 0 1 and 1 month respectively spanning from 2004 1 to 2014 12 table 2 2 3 commonly employed drought indices in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of wwsd in characterizing drought event over yrb we compare it with three drought indices including scpdsi spi and spei the spi mckee et al 1993 is calculated from the historical precipitation record at a weather station where precipitation accumulation over a period of time is compared to that same period of time throughout the historical record at that location the spi for any precipitation accumulation value represents the probability that the location would have received at least the observed amount of precipitation over the time period to estimate spi we utilize precipitation data from section 2 2 following the method developed by mckee et al 1993 the primary strength of the spi is that its data can be compared between different climate regions however different from spi which depicts drought only based on precipitation data spei considers potential evapotranspiration combined with precipitation we get spei data from the global spei database speibase which offers long time robust information about drought conditions at the global scale with a 0 5 spatial resolution and a monthly time resolution beguería et al 2010 the two drought indices described above can be computed over different time scales in this paper the 6 month scale was used according to sun et al 2018 scpdsi whose time scale is fixed is another commonly used meteorological drought index by using surface air temperature and a physical water balance model based on pdsi precipitation and soil parameter plus other surface meteorological forcing data for the self calibrating pdsi penman monteith sc pdsi pm case are the major indicators of scpdsi van der schrier et al 2013 it is a standardized index that generally spans 10 dry to 10 wet taking into account the impact of global warming and previous statement and effective in determining long term drought are scpdsi s leading edges this dataset consists of monthly scpdsi over global land areas on a 2 5 grid with spatial coverage from 180 w to 180e and 60s to 77 5 n temporal range from 1850 01 01 to 2014 12 31 2 4 hydrological model the grace tws data is composed of surface water storage sws soil moisture storage sms groundwater storage gws snow water equivalent swe and plant canopy water storage cws to separate these components we use the watergap global hydrology model wghm simulations döll et al 2003 the newest model version watergap 2 2d that simulates both sws and gws not modeled by gldas with global scale except antarctica at 0 5 resolution the key strength of wghm is the impact of climate variability on water availability is taken into account the available time span from january 2000 to december 2016 3 methods 3 1 estimation of components from section 2 4 twsa is defined as follows 1 twsa g w s a s m s a s w e a s w s a where twsa from grace and smsa swea swsa and cwsa it is negligible for the reason described in section 4 is sms swe sws and cws anomaly obtained from wghm gwsa is hard to estimate accurately due to complex soil feature and exchange among other components furthermore in order to close eq 1 we estimate gwsa by deducting twsa from other components from wghm all these components are subject to the same process like grace rl06 data such as truncated to 60 and orders filtered by gussian filter but not decorrelation filter 3 2 weighted water storage deficit index wwsd is inspired by wsd developed by thomas et al 2014 wsd is defined as the deviation of monthly twsa from the time series monthly climatology where negative deviations represent storage deficits as follows 2 ws d i j t w s a i j tws a j 3 wsdi wsd μ σ where tws a i j is the twsa time series from grace for the jth month in ith year tws a j is monthly climatology from january 2003 to december 2014 for example tws a 1 denotes the mean of all january twsa drought events are detected by negative wsd lasting for three or more consecutive months according to thomas et al 2014 to compare with other drought indices wsdi is normalized by wsd mean μ and standard deviation σ the drought intensity can be indicated from wsdi time series although drought index derived from tws rather single component is more reasonable and sensitive to drought events the key reason for designing wwsdi to characterize yrb drought events is that we believe and demonstrate in section 4 that different tws components contribute distinctly to tws change and thus have different response to drought features in order to incorporate these difference to drought index we weight these components by their components contribution ratio ccr huang et al 2019 as follows 4 cc r s ma d s tv where ma d s 1 n t n s t s t v s storages ma d s the subscript s denotes single tws component after obtaining weight we separately calculate swsd swed smsd and gwsd like wsd cwsd is neglected due to its magnitude then wwsd is obtained by summing these water components deficit after multiplied by their individual weight as follows 5 wwsd ω 1 g w s d ω 2 s w s d ω 3 s m s d ω 4 s w e d where ω i i 1 2 3 4 is the weight derived from eq 4 then we compute wwsdi by standardizing wwsd like eq 3 note that weighting these water components storage deficit by ccr may not be the most appropriate way as discussed in section 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 precipitation and terrestrial water components storage precipitation is an important indicator of monitoring drought events from fig 2 a precipitation has an obvious seasonal variability which is consistent with other studies over yrb sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 usually precipitation over yrb comes to peaks in summer and troughs in spring with amplitude about 170 mm and 20 mm respectively fig 2 a also displays twsa derived from five different products including csr m jpl m csr sh jpl sh and wghm with the improvements of grace tvg the gap between sh solutions and mascon solutions is increasingly small with root mean square erorr of 1 26 cm that is also demonstrated by similar peaks in twsa time series with peak value about 7 cm equivalent water thickness ewt and trough value about 6 cm ewt twsa inferred from grace and precipitation reach the peaks and troughs almost simultaneously that indicates precipitation is major input for tws change in yrb twsa obtained from wghm however has lower amplitudes than from grace despite being constantly improved the model s ability in reproducing observed largescale water storage changes is limited due to uncertainties in climate input e g empirical model parameters climate forcing and water use data furthermore incomplete realism of process representations such as complex anthropogenic effects and only one layer of soil moisture water constitute another source of uncertainties eicker et al 2014 fig 2 b shows individual components anomaly in yrb derived from wghm except gwsa from eq 1 obviously gws change plays major role in tws change over yrb which is consistent with the conclusions from jiang et al 2016 but cwsa has the smallest amplitude thus we neglect this component in the following discussion then swea have little larger amplitude than swsa while smsa are second lowest we calculate ccr of these components with gwsa 0 56 swea 0 19 swsa 0 15 and smsa 0 1 fig 2 b also shows that all water components storage are in agreement with twsa in terms of reaching peaks and troughs with swea having an apparent declining trend of 0 18 cm per month from amplitude phase and trend of these components we believe that different components contribute distinctly to tws variability thus it is natural for us to ask whether these differences among water components also respond distinctly to drought feature over yrb we answer this question in following section 4 2 terrestrial water components deficit to further demonstrate the rationality behind wwsd we firstly calculate terrestrial water components storage deficit wcsd including swsd smsd gwsd swed and terrestrial water components storage deficit index wcsdi including surface water storage deficit index swsdi soil moisture storage deficit index smsdi groundwater storage deficit index gwsdi and snow water equivalent deficit index swedi by imitating eqs 2 and 3 from fig 3 a showing wsd and wcsd wsd are correlated well with gwsd but divergent from other three water component deficit for example swed has a declining trend from 2003 1 to 2014 12 but until 2009 1 it is still in a positive surplus stage however smsd and swsd has stable deficit which floats around zero these differences among wcsd demonstrates that different tws components do play different roles in response to drought events in yrb theoretically every wcsd can be used as an indicator of drought in yrb thus we also use these wcsd to identify yrb drought events based on lasting three or more negative deficit during 2003 1 to 2014 12 showed in fig 4 apparently the onset and duration of drought events vary with adoption of different wcsd consistent with fig 3 a the wsd and gwsd almost have the same sensitivity to drought onset but different recovery ability from drought from fig 4 for example gwsd has identified a drought event with duration of january to june 2003 but wsd identified the drought with duration of february to may 2003 however swed has not identified any drought events until january 2009 and indicates that yrb are in drought state of six years except november and december 2009 during january 2009 to december 2014 the continuously falling swedi in fig 3 b which also resembles the pattern of swed in fig 3 a means the study area may be highly influenced by global warming which causes swea less other water components storage deficit detect different onset duration and numbers of drought events in yrb during january 2003 to december 2014 which is in agreement with fig 3 a these findings answer the question in section 4 1 with a fact that different components contribute distinctly to identify drought events over yrb 4 3 comparisons of wwsd with wsd generally wwsd performs almost similarly with wsd in identification of drought onset with some exceptions when we weight these components by ccr for example the drought starts from august 2003 and ends in july 2004 based on wwsd but starts in october 2003 based on wsd at the same time wwsd has different sensitivity to drought events compared with wsd fig 4 shows that wsd has monitored one drought event from may to september in 2009 but wwsd doesn t detect this all these differences attribute to consideration of weight of different tws components because some water components storage are expected to play a role in alleviating the severity of drought events over yrb while others may not we will further discuss this case in section 4 6 4 4 comparisons of drought indices we compare wwsdi with commonly used drought indices including scpdsi spi and spei which is showed in fig 5 we smooth all indices by robust locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and scale scpdsi by adding one to original scpdsi in order to better compare with wwsdi that means the same value from different index indicates same drought condition we also calculate correlation matrix of these drought indices showed in tab 2 fig 5 shows that the behavior observed for the wwsdi and its response to the climatic abnormalities agree well with the behaviors and responses of other drought indices with similar peaks and troughs for instance all of the drought indices exhibit the largest troughs in summer 2006 and spring 2011 however the drought of the early 2003 is identified by wsdi and wwsdi not by scpdsi spi and spei although wwsdi performs pretty similarly with wsdi there is definitely difference as discussed in section 4 3 furthermore it is noted that all these indices are correlated well at a pearson 95 confidence interval specifically the lowest correlation coefficient of 0 55 was determined between spi and scpdsi wwsdi are correlated with spi and spei with correlation coefficient of 0 74 and 0 68 respectively the correlation coefficient between wwsdi and wsdi is 0 99 which is consistent with fig 5 however the reason for almost perfect correlation between wwsdi and wsdi will be discussed in section 4 6 4 5 analysis of drought in yrb using wwsd we have compared wwsd with wsd and other commonly used drought indices the high correlation coefficient between wwsdi and other indices demonstrates the effectiveness behind wwsd thus we use wwsd to characterize yrb drought events during january 2003 to december 2014 summarized in table 3 here we use duration magnitude severity and intensity to characterize yrb drought events the magnitude is calculated as accumulated wwsd and intensity is estimated by the ratio of magnitude to its duration zargar et al 2011 different from previous studies in yrb sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 we detect more drought events than their findings the longest drought was from august 2003 to july 2004 lasting 12 months the severest drought was from july 2006 to february 2007 with drought intensity of 1 34 the second and third severe drought event is in 2003 and 2011 which is consistent with previous studies sun et al 2018 using wsd have found eight droughts and generally detected longer duration than this paper especially in 2005 drought that is not identified in our study while the drought duration from wwsd is less than one year we attribute this differences firstly to the time period of grace data secondly consideration of weight of different tws component may play roles in alleviating the drought magnitude resulting in shorter drought events in this paper but more time periods of recovery 4 6 discussion 4 6 1 uncertainty of estimation of tws components grace sh products have some uncertainties although rl06 sh is improved in post processing these uncertainties generally originate from grace measurement error models to deduct other gravity signal except tws and leakage error introduced both by filtering required to suppress noise and by the limited range of sh coefficients available chen et al 2009 as mentioned in section 2 the leakage error is not critical in yrb for de alias model error the largest is from glacial isostatic adjustment or gia the slow viscous mantle flow causes global changes in the shape and the earth s gravitational field during the present day ivins et al 2013 although the gia model is improved during past few years we don t use any gia model to account for this error owing to unavailable of perfect gia model which means the error from gia model is still so larger that using gia model may introduce other error to our results furthermore we believe the conclusion that different tws components play various roles in drought index will not be interrupted by not considering gia as for grace measurement error previous studies have developed different methods to account for this error wahr et al 2006 estimated measurement error by removing a constant and an annual cycle from sh coefficients but this methods may overestimate those error owing to mistaking all non annual signal for errors chen et al 2009 estimated grace noise by calculating root mean square rms variability over oceans with same latitude as study regions in which true mass variability grace signal is probably near zero believing residuals over the ocean could approximately represent those error different from these method we use the differences between the csr and jpl sh solutions for the same month to estimate the error and standard deviation is 3 mm ewt the other uncertainty is using hydrological model to separate water components from tws derived from grace the wghm model validation is carried out before using the smsa swea and cwsa by comparing these components with the output of gldas however as we discussed in section 4 1 the gwsa estimated from wghm model has larger uncertainty than other components we compared groundwater from wghm and derived from grace by eq 1 and the result is showed in fig 6 it is showed that wghm has lower amplitude in gws than grace and has no significant variability during drought periods the difference displayed in fig 6 demonstrates the limitation of wghm to simulate deep soil water and other tws components however gwsa from eq 1 is overestimated in this paper in that not only we neglect cwsa but also wghm underestimates some component such as swsa for wghm don t simulate all the surface water bodies over yrb thus other methods to separate these individual water components anomalies such as using satellite altimetry observed water levels to estimate swsa may improve our study 4 6 2 assessment of wwsd we have demonstrated that different tws components play different roles in twsa and try to use this difference to construct a more reasonable drought index viz wwsdi to characterize the drought events in yrb by using the ccr of single component however ccr may not account well for the difference between different components and need to study further to explore more information and relationship among these compartments the high correlation coefficient between wwsdi and wsdi doesn t mean wwsdi is equivalent to wsdi for drought analysis over yrb first of all the time series is only 12 years and longer data may improve our results secondly drought is stochastic natural phenomenon where different water component exchanges and penetrates mutually thus the weight from ccr may not be the most appropriate way it is natural for us to think that the swsa and swea may respond quickly than gwsa when drought appears which means they could have larger weight rather than being derived from ccr for instance we will find vastly different drought events if we assign higher weight value to swea thus more reasonable weights such as using weights varying with time or co variance of water components are needed to study further in order to better represent differences in response to droughts among water components which involves a deep study of the mechanism and process of drought events further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this study but is studied in our future work 5 conclusion we have developed an alternative method viz wwsd based on wsd to characterize drought events in yrb firstly we combine tws estimation from grace and wghm to separate individual water components the results show in yrb gws explains for 56 of tws variability and sws comes to the third after swe but cws has smallest contribution to tws variability which means different water components contribute distinctly to tws change analysis of water components in yrb was rare until this paper then we calculate precipitation time series from gpm product and find that it is well correlated with twsa obtained from grace later we demonstrate different water component does play different roles in response to yrb drought events by calculating wcsd and wcsdi we use the ccr of single component as their weight to construct an alternative drought index wwsdi and compare with commonly used drought index scpdsi spi and spei the result indicates scpdsi spi and spei are correlated well with wwsdi with correlation coefficients of 0 58 0 74 and 0 68 respectively which means wwsdi is an effective way to detect drought events over yrb finally we use wwsdi to monitor and character drought events in yrb during 2003 to 2014 same as previous studies we find yrb experienced two extreme drought in 2006 and 2011 with drought magnitude of 10 72 cm ewt and 8 15 cm ewt respectively different findings based on wwsd than previous papers is that more recovery time period are identified which is manifested by the fact no drought event lasting over one year is detected we attribute this to alleviation from different components because equally treating these components may overestimate the severity duration of one drought event in yrb although the potential of grace to monitor large or global scale drought has been explored well this paper

5057,the ability of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to monitor large scale drought events has been explored well during past few years we develop an alternative method viz weighted water storage deficit wwsd to characterize drought events over yangtze river basin yrb based on water storage deficit wsd method by combining grace rl06 sphere harmonic sh coefficient data and watergap global hydrology model wghm data we use component contribution ratio ccr of single terrestrial water compartment as weight to compute wwsd comparing with other commonly employed drought indices and precipitation data from global precipitation measurement gpm the results show that precipitation is the major trigger of water storage variation over yrb which both have significant seasonal change our findings also indicate different terrestrial water component contributes distinctly to terrestrial water storage tws variability and responds differently to drought features in yrb according to water component storage deficit wcsd eleven drought events are identified in yrb based on wwsd with 2003 2006 and 2011 experiencing the severest drought with drought intensity of 1 22 cm 1 34 cm and 1 02 cm respectively our study suggests that it is more realistic and reasonable to treat water components unequally to construct drought index derived from grace keywords water storage deficit weighted water storage deficit drought index grace 1 introduction it is well known that water resource plays an important role in sustaining the development of society and economy especially when it comes to the issues regarding water scarcity and security a recent study by forootan et al 2019 revealed that there is an increase in magnitude extent and length of hydrological droughts in most of the global basins such as mississippi euphrates terrestrial total water storage tws a key component in the earth s water energy and biogeochemical cycles güntner et al 2007 is composed of water on vegetation surfaces in the biomass in the unsaturated soil or rock zone as groundwater snow and ice and as surface water in rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands schmidt et al 2006 thus it is necessary to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal variation in tws traditional methods including in situ observation remotely sensed data and land surface model lsm were successfully applied to monitor tws change however these techniques have their intrinsic limitations in situ observation s spatial resolution is limited and sometimes it takes much cost to maintain these equipment which are used to collect data continuously chen et al 2006a b remotely sensed data have been used extensively to monitor surface and near surface components of the water cycle but have difficulty in attaining information of deep rooted water swenson et al 2008a b while tws estimates from lsms is still disturbed by uncertainty in water budgets and absence in some fundamental components chen et al 2016 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace launched in march 2002 is a dedicated dual satellite mission to map the global gravity field with unprecedented accuracy tapley et al 2004 as we all know that time variable gravity tvg is produced by mass redistribution in earth system on time scales from months to decades mass redistribution mainly occurs in the fluid envelopes oceans atmosphere ice caps continental reservoirs and is related to climate variability ramillien et al 2005 thus grace has the potential to provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring tws change some pre launch studies by wahr et al 1998 and rodell and famiglietti 1999 who constructed basic theory and equations for inferring surface mass variation demonstrated that tws can be inferred from grace tvg data in the form of expanded sphere harmonic sh coefficients which has launched a new era in studying a series of hydrology problems using standard sh products that are released by different organizations to estimate tws change is simple to implement although the higher sh degrees and orders with finite range are expected to be noisier and magnified by longitudinal stripes due to the orbit geometry of the grace mission davis et al 2008 the commonly used method to alleviate this situation is gaussian averaging filter wahr et al 1998 which is also called isotropic filter because the filter weight is only dependent on sh degrees han et al 2005a b reported accuracy estimates in grace monthly sh have distinct degree and order dependent patterns and developed a non isotropic filter han filter to enhance grace signals with significantly higher resolution in latitude and the same resolution in longitude as compared to the conventional gaussian smoother then swenson and wahr 2006 found this stripes effect is also due to the correlation in the spectral domain of the even and odd order sh thus constructed a decorrelation filter to remove the effect of the correlated errors over past couple of years many authors have designed other different filter methods to weaken the stripes or correlation to varying degree such as dynamic filter seo et al 2006 wiener optimal filter sasgen et al 2006 rms and fm filter chen et al 2006a b empirical orthogonal function filter wouters and schrama 2007 decorrelation filter based on a wavelet decomposition rangelova et al 2007 statistical filter davis et al 2008 fan filter zhang et al 2009 ddk filter kusche et al 2009 and so on however any filter techniques mentioned above to reduce high degree and order sh noise will attenuate signal amplitudes and bias estimates of mass change consequently it is necessary to find a method to restore true hydrological signal there are generally four approaches to reduce the bias and leakage effects long et al 2015 a scaling factor landerer and swenson 2012 b additive correction approach c multiplicative correction approach longuevergne et al 2010 and d data assimilation khaki et al 2018a b the differences and similarities in these methods and how to implement can be found in long et al 2015 with development of these filter technique and improved grace sh product released by center for space research csr jet propulsion laboratory jpl geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz et al using grace to estimate tws change in various locations has been applied like africa anyah et al 2018 yangtze river basin sun et al 2017 laplata basin pereira and pacino 2012 illinois swenson et al 2006 amazon chen et al 2009 although grace has the ability to monitor global or local scale tws change one may resort to other skills to estimate tws components because tvg on land are largely due to corresponding changes in vertically integrated tws which means we can not isolate one component from the others without ancillary data wahr et al 2004 most studies relied on hydrological models like global land data assimilation system gldas lenk 2013 watergap hydrological model wghm zhang et al 2015 long et al 2017 climate prediction center cpc feng et al 2013 or in situ measurement swenson et al 2006 or water balance budget rodell et al 2004 to estimate groundwater evapotranspiration surface water papa et al 2008 even biomass and to validate the accuracy of tws variation from grace meanwhile under demand of higher spatial and temporal resolution than sh product whose spatial resolution is approximately 300 km and temporal is one month han et al 2005a b introduced an alternative method to directly estimate the tws regionally by using grace satellite to satellite tracking and accelerometer data then many other authors jacob et al 2012 schrama et al 2014 have explored the potential of this method to estimate tws variation and called it mascon mass concentration whose spatial and temporal resolution is always improved than sh these mascon products are also released by different organizations and freely downloaded although the tvg is a product of the earth s mass distribution these data provided by grace can be used to study ice sheet mass change velicogna and wahr 2005 sea level change chambers 2006 oceanic mass variation guo et al 2010 improvement of hydrological model through data assimilation and deformation of solid earth davis et al 2004 besides monitoring tws change the unique potential of grace tvg measurements in monitoring extreme climate variability like severe drought and flooding events has also been demonstrated drought is a stochastic natural phenomenon and is known to cause extensive damage to reduce the damage from drought it is crucial to characterize droughts there are many methods to characterize droughts but drought index a quantitative measure that characterize drought levels by assimilating data from one or several variables indicators such as precipitation and evapotranspiration into a single numerical value provides a comprehensive picture for drought analysis and decision making zargar et al 2011 palmer drought severity index pdsi aiguo et al 2004 standard precipitation index spi and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for example are commonly used drought indices different tws components were considered as indicators to analyse the onset severity and duration of droughts like surface water storage keyantash and dracup 2004 groundwater castle et al 2014 and soil moisture abelen et al 2015 while other authors applied the sum of tws components derived from grace to characterize droughts yirdaw et al 2008 employed total storage deficit index tsdi obtained from grace to investigate 2002 2003 canadian prairie drought chen et al 2009 constructed an non seasonal tws change time series after deducting annual and semiannual sinusoids by unweighted least squares and found a significant tws deficit accompanying the 2005 amazon drought on the order of 14 cm of equivalent water thickness in the central amazon while drought s severity from gldas and ladworld land surface model was underestimated thomas et al 2014 calculated the magnitude of the deviation of regional monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies from the time series monthly climatology where negative deviations represent storage deficits and designed a water storage deficit index wsdi to analyse the peak magnitude duration and total severity of droughts in amazon zambezi united states texas respectively table 1 lists the major drought indices superscript a and b indicate the indicators that this index absorbs looking into the table 1 and the studies we read we conclude that these indices derived from grace was either developed to consider the sum of tws components as a whole or single component few of studies consider the roles of water storage components to calculate drought index which means different components are expected to contribute distinctly to tws variability huang et al 2019 thus to drought index in this paper we develop a weighted water storage deficit index wwsdi derived from wsdi but consider the contribution of individual tws components in order to obtain more reasonable droughts characterization by taking yangtze river basin as a case study the yangtze river basin yrb is the longest river in asia with 1 8 million km 2 watershed area originating from the tanggula range in western china and traversing 11 provinces and cities from west to east the yrb is located in subtropical and temperate climate zones with a mean annual air temperature evaporation and precipitation of 14 c 922 mm and 1100 mm respectively sun et al 2018 the yrb has undergone several extreme drought events in the past few years due to climate variability and human activities long et al 2015 applied scale factors from different lsms or ghms to tws anomalies and found two extreme drought periods in 2006 summer and 2011 spring respectively zhang et al 2015 also characterized these two droughts by constructing a normalized grace based tws anomaly examining the connection with el niño southern oscillation enso using artificial neural network approach to extend the grace tws observations 2003 12 to a longer tws time series 1979 2012 zhang et al 2016 concluded yrb experienced 29 times hydrological drought during 1979 2012 sun et al 2018 analyzed the onset severity recovery time and peak magnitude of eight drought over yrb events from 2003 to 2015 by wsdi thus we take yrb as case study and compare the results with these studies fig 1 shows the location of yrb we estimate tws components in the yrb and also compare wwsdi with wsdi and commonly used drought indices including spi spei and self calibrated pdsi scpdsi which is improved based on pdsi to verify its effectiveness this paper is organized as follows datasets are described in section 2 the rationality to develop wwsdi and method to calculate wwsdi are presented in section 3 while section 4 analyses the results along with discussion and section 5 arrives at conclusions 2 datasets 2 1 grace data we estimate tws anomaly twsa from grace using rl06 sh data determined from csr jpl csr sh jpl sh from 2003 1 to 2014 12 including 133 approximately monthly gravity solutions in the form of sh truncated at 60 1 1 anomaly fields are obtained by deducting multiple years time mean baseline c 20 degree 2 and order 0 coefficients are replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging cheng and ries 2017 due to this value determined from grace has a lager uncertainty than from slr the degree 1 coefficients are estimated from method developed by swenson et al 2008a b rl06 data represents the total gravity variability due to land surface hydrology cryospheric changes episodic earthquake processes glacial isostatic adjustment gia and corrections to the background models for atmospheric and oceanic processes although most effects are removed during postprocessing and negligible at time scales from days to years gia is generally separated based on the method from geruo et al 2013 then decorrelation filter swenson and wahr 2006 and gussian filter wahr et al 1998 are applied to reduce north south stripe noise and increased error in high degree and order sh with the annoying effect that attenuates some true hydrological signal and results in leakage error we choose scaling factor to restore lost signal different scaling factors not only impact the signal restoration for the seasonal amplitudes but also disturb the detection of drought events however according to long et al 2015 the leakage in and leakage out errors are offset for the entire yangtze river basin therefore signal restoration may not be critical for the entire basin thus we set scaling factor of 1 consistent with long et al 2015 missing month data are filled using linear interpolation using the mean values determined in the months before and after a missing month we also compare sh solutions with monthly csr and jpl mascon grid solutions csr m jpl m in order to verify our results details about these products can be referred to save et al 2016 2 2 precipitation precipitation is an important indicator to study yrb drought and obtained from global precipitation measurement gpm data products huffman et al 2019 the gpm initiated by nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa as a global successor to trmm is an international network of satellites that provide the next generation global observations of rain and snow the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation relevant satellite passive microwave pmw sensors the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg is the unified u s algorithm that provides the multi satellite precipitation product for the u s gpm team we use gpm imerg final precipitation data whose spatial and temporal resolution is 0 1 0 1 and 1 month respectively spanning from 2004 1 to 2014 12 table 2 2 3 commonly employed drought indices in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of wwsd in characterizing drought event over yrb we compare it with three drought indices including scpdsi spi and spei the spi mckee et al 1993 is calculated from the historical precipitation record at a weather station where precipitation accumulation over a period of time is compared to that same period of time throughout the historical record at that location the spi for any precipitation accumulation value represents the probability that the location would have received at least the observed amount of precipitation over the time period to estimate spi we utilize precipitation data from section 2 2 following the method developed by mckee et al 1993 the primary strength of the spi is that its data can be compared between different climate regions however different from spi which depicts drought only based on precipitation data spei considers potential evapotranspiration combined with precipitation we get spei data from the global spei database speibase which offers long time robust information about drought conditions at the global scale with a 0 5 spatial resolution and a monthly time resolution beguería et al 2010 the two drought indices described above can be computed over different time scales in this paper the 6 month scale was used according to sun et al 2018 scpdsi whose time scale is fixed is another commonly used meteorological drought index by using surface air temperature and a physical water balance model based on pdsi precipitation and soil parameter plus other surface meteorological forcing data for the self calibrating pdsi penman monteith sc pdsi pm case are the major indicators of scpdsi van der schrier et al 2013 it is a standardized index that generally spans 10 dry to 10 wet taking into account the impact of global warming and previous statement and effective in determining long term drought are scpdsi s leading edges this dataset consists of monthly scpdsi over global land areas on a 2 5 grid with spatial coverage from 180 w to 180e and 60s to 77 5 n temporal range from 1850 01 01 to 2014 12 31 2 4 hydrological model the grace tws data is composed of surface water storage sws soil moisture storage sms groundwater storage gws snow water equivalent swe and plant canopy water storage cws to separate these components we use the watergap global hydrology model wghm simulations döll et al 2003 the newest model version watergap 2 2d that simulates both sws and gws not modeled by gldas with global scale except antarctica at 0 5 resolution the key strength of wghm is the impact of climate variability on water availability is taken into account the available time span from january 2000 to december 2016 3 methods 3 1 estimation of components from section 2 4 twsa is defined as follows 1 twsa g w s a s m s a s w e a s w s a where twsa from grace and smsa swea swsa and cwsa it is negligible for the reason described in section 4 is sms swe sws and cws anomaly obtained from wghm gwsa is hard to estimate accurately due to complex soil feature and exchange among other components furthermore in order to close eq 1 we estimate gwsa by deducting twsa from other components from wghm all these components are subject to the same process like grace rl06 data such as truncated to 60 and orders filtered by gussian filter but not decorrelation filter 3 2 weighted water storage deficit index wwsd is inspired by wsd developed by thomas et al 2014 wsd is defined as the deviation of monthly twsa from the time series monthly climatology where negative deviations represent storage deficits as follows 2 ws d i j t w s a i j tws a j 3 wsdi wsd μ σ where tws a i j is the twsa time series from grace for the jth month in ith year tws a j is monthly climatology from january 2003 to december 2014 for example tws a 1 denotes the mean of all january twsa drought events are detected by negative wsd lasting for three or more consecutive months according to thomas et al 2014 to compare with other drought indices wsdi is normalized by wsd mean μ and standard deviation σ the drought intensity can be indicated from wsdi time series although drought index derived from tws rather single component is more reasonable and sensitive to drought events the key reason for designing wwsdi to characterize yrb drought events is that we believe and demonstrate in section 4 that different tws components contribute distinctly to tws change and thus have different response to drought features in order to incorporate these difference to drought index we weight these components by their components contribution ratio ccr huang et al 2019 as follows 4 cc r s ma d s tv where ma d s 1 n t n s t s t v s storages ma d s the subscript s denotes single tws component after obtaining weight we separately calculate swsd swed smsd and gwsd like wsd cwsd is neglected due to its magnitude then wwsd is obtained by summing these water components deficit after multiplied by their individual weight as follows 5 wwsd ω 1 g w s d ω 2 s w s d ω 3 s m s d ω 4 s w e d where ω i i 1 2 3 4 is the weight derived from eq 4 then we compute wwsdi by standardizing wwsd like eq 3 note that weighting these water components storage deficit by ccr may not be the most appropriate way as discussed in section 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 precipitation and terrestrial water components storage precipitation is an important indicator of monitoring drought events from fig 2 a precipitation has an obvious seasonal variability which is consistent with other studies over yrb sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 usually precipitation over yrb comes to peaks in summer and troughs in spring with amplitude about 170 mm and 20 mm respectively fig 2 a also displays twsa derived from five different products including csr m jpl m csr sh jpl sh and wghm with the improvements of grace tvg the gap between sh solutions and mascon solutions is increasingly small with root mean square erorr of 1 26 cm that is also demonstrated by similar peaks in twsa time series with peak value about 7 cm equivalent water thickness ewt and trough value about 6 cm ewt twsa inferred from grace and precipitation reach the peaks and troughs almost simultaneously that indicates precipitation is major input for tws change in yrb twsa obtained from wghm however has lower amplitudes than from grace despite being constantly improved the model s ability in reproducing observed largescale water storage changes is limited due to uncertainties in climate input e g empirical model parameters climate forcing and water use data furthermore incomplete realism of process representations such as complex anthropogenic effects and only one layer of soil moisture water constitute another source of uncertainties eicker et al 2014 fig 2 b shows individual components anomaly in yrb derived from wghm except gwsa from eq 1 obviously gws change plays major role in tws change over yrb which is consistent with the conclusions from jiang et al 2016 but cwsa has the smallest amplitude thus we neglect this component in the following discussion then swea have little larger amplitude than swsa while smsa are second lowest we calculate ccr of these components with gwsa 0 56 swea 0 19 swsa 0 15 and smsa 0 1 fig 2 b also shows that all water components storage are in agreement with twsa in terms of reaching peaks and troughs with swea having an apparent declining trend of 0 18 cm per month from amplitude phase and trend of these components we believe that different components contribute distinctly to tws variability thus it is natural for us to ask whether these differences among water components also respond distinctly to drought feature over yrb we answer this question in following section 4 2 terrestrial water components deficit to further demonstrate the rationality behind wwsd we firstly calculate terrestrial water components storage deficit wcsd including swsd smsd gwsd swed and terrestrial water components storage deficit index wcsdi including surface water storage deficit index swsdi soil moisture storage deficit index smsdi groundwater storage deficit index gwsdi and snow water equivalent deficit index swedi by imitating eqs 2 and 3 from fig 3 a showing wsd and wcsd wsd are correlated well with gwsd but divergent from other three water component deficit for example swed has a declining trend from 2003 1 to 2014 12 but until 2009 1 it is still in a positive surplus stage however smsd and swsd has stable deficit which floats around zero these differences among wcsd demonstrates that different tws components do play different roles in response to drought events in yrb theoretically every wcsd can be used as an indicator of drought in yrb thus we also use these wcsd to identify yrb drought events based on lasting three or more negative deficit during 2003 1 to 2014 12 showed in fig 4 apparently the onset and duration of drought events vary with adoption of different wcsd consistent with fig 3 a the wsd and gwsd almost have the same sensitivity to drought onset but different recovery ability from drought from fig 4 for example gwsd has identified a drought event with duration of january to june 2003 but wsd identified the drought with duration of february to may 2003 however swed has not identified any drought events until january 2009 and indicates that yrb are in drought state of six years except november and december 2009 during january 2009 to december 2014 the continuously falling swedi in fig 3 b which also resembles the pattern of swed in fig 3 a means the study area may be highly influenced by global warming which causes swea less other water components storage deficit detect different onset duration and numbers of drought events in yrb during january 2003 to december 2014 which is in agreement with fig 3 a these findings answer the question in section 4 1 with a fact that different components contribute distinctly to identify drought events over yrb 4 3 comparisons of wwsd with wsd generally wwsd performs almost similarly with wsd in identification of drought onset with some exceptions when we weight these components by ccr for example the drought starts from august 2003 and ends in july 2004 based on wwsd but starts in october 2003 based on wsd at the same time wwsd has different sensitivity to drought events compared with wsd fig 4 shows that wsd has monitored one drought event from may to september in 2009 but wwsd doesn t detect this all these differences attribute to consideration of weight of different tws components because some water components storage are expected to play a role in alleviating the severity of drought events over yrb while others may not we will further discuss this case in section 4 6 4 4 comparisons of drought indices we compare wwsdi with commonly used drought indices including scpdsi spi and spei which is showed in fig 5 we smooth all indices by robust locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and scale scpdsi by adding one to original scpdsi in order to better compare with wwsdi that means the same value from different index indicates same drought condition we also calculate correlation matrix of these drought indices showed in tab 2 fig 5 shows that the behavior observed for the wwsdi and its response to the climatic abnormalities agree well with the behaviors and responses of other drought indices with similar peaks and troughs for instance all of the drought indices exhibit the largest troughs in summer 2006 and spring 2011 however the drought of the early 2003 is identified by wsdi and wwsdi not by scpdsi spi and spei although wwsdi performs pretty similarly with wsdi there is definitely difference as discussed in section 4 3 furthermore it is noted that all these indices are correlated well at a pearson 95 confidence interval specifically the lowest correlation coefficient of 0 55 was determined between spi and scpdsi wwsdi are correlated with spi and spei with correlation coefficient of 0 74 and 0 68 respectively the correlation coefficient between wwsdi and wsdi is 0 99 which is consistent with fig 5 however the reason for almost perfect correlation between wwsdi and wsdi will be discussed in section 4 6 4 5 analysis of drought in yrb using wwsd we have compared wwsd with wsd and other commonly used drought indices the high correlation coefficient between wwsdi and other indices demonstrates the effectiveness behind wwsd thus we use wwsd to characterize yrb drought events during january 2003 to december 2014 summarized in table 3 here we use duration magnitude severity and intensity to characterize yrb drought events the magnitude is calculated as accumulated wwsd and intensity is estimated by the ratio of magnitude to its duration zargar et al 2011 different from previous studies in yrb sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 we detect more drought events than their findings the longest drought was from august 2003 to july 2004 lasting 12 months the severest drought was from july 2006 to february 2007 with drought intensity of 1 34 the second and third severe drought event is in 2003 and 2011 which is consistent with previous studies sun et al 2018 using wsd have found eight droughts and generally detected longer duration than this paper especially in 2005 drought that is not identified in our study while the drought duration from wwsd is less than one year we attribute this differences firstly to the time period of grace data secondly consideration of weight of different tws component may play roles in alleviating the drought magnitude resulting in shorter drought events in this paper but more time periods of recovery 4 6 discussion 4 6 1 uncertainty of estimation of tws components grace sh products have some uncertainties although rl06 sh is improved in post processing these uncertainties generally originate from grace measurement error models to deduct other gravity signal except tws and leakage error introduced both by filtering required to suppress noise and by the limited range of sh coefficients available chen et al 2009 as mentioned in section 2 the leakage error is not critical in yrb for de alias model error the largest is from glacial isostatic adjustment or gia the slow viscous mantle flow causes global changes in the shape and the earth s gravitational field during the present day ivins et al 2013 although the gia model is improved during past few years we don t use any gia model to account for this error owing to unavailable of perfect gia model which means the error from gia model is still so larger that using gia model may introduce other error to our results furthermore we believe the conclusion that different tws components play various roles in drought index will not be interrupted by not considering gia as for grace measurement error previous studies have developed different methods to account for this error wahr et al 2006 estimated measurement error by removing a constant and an annual cycle from sh coefficients but this methods may overestimate those error owing to mistaking all non annual signal for errors chen et al 2009 estimated grace noise by calculating root mean square rms variability over oceans with same latitude as study regions in which true mass variability grace signal is probably near zero believing residuals over the ocean could approximately represent those error different from these method we use the differences between the csr and jpl sh solutions for the same month to estimate the error and standard deviation is 3 mm ewt the other uncertainty is using hydrological model to separate water components from tws derived from grace the wghm model validation is carried out before using the smsa swea and cwsa by comparing these components with the output of gldas however as we discussed in section 4 1 the gwsa estimated from wghm model has larger uncertainty than other components we compared groundwater from wghm and derived from grace by eq 1 and the result is showed in fig 6 it is showed that wghm has lower amplitude in gws than grace and has no significant variability during drought periods the difference displayed in fig 6 demonstrates the limitation of wghm to simulate deep soil water and other tws components however gwsa from eq 1 is overestimated in this paper in that not only we neglect cwsa but also wghm underestimates some component such as swsa for wghm don t simulate all the surface water bodies over yrb thus other methods to separate these individual water components anomalies such as using satellite altimetry observed water levels to estimate swsa may improve our study 4 6 2 assessment of wwsd we have demonstrated that different tws components play different roles in twsa and try to use this difference to construct a more reasonable drought index viz wwsdi to characterize the drought events in yrb by using the ccr of single component however ccr may not account well for the difference between different components and need to study further to explore more information and relationship among these compartments the high correlation coefficient between wwsdi and wsdi doesn t mean wwsdi is equivalent to wsdi for drought analysis over yrb first of all the time series is only 12 years and longer data may improve our results secondly drought is stochastic natural phenomenon where different water component exchanges and penetrates mutually thus the weight from ccr may not be the most appropriate way it is natural for us to think that the swsa and swea may respond quickly than gwsa when drought appears which means they could have larger weight rather than being derived from ccr for instance we will find vastly different drought events if we assign higher weight value to swea thus more reasonable weights such as using weights varying with time or co variance of water components are needed to study further in order to better represent differences in response to droughts among water components which involves a deep study of the mechanism and process of drought events further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this study but is studied in our future work 5 conclusion we have developed an alternative method viz wwsd based on wsd to characterize drought events in yrb firstly we combine tws estimation from grace and wghm to separate individual water components the results show in yrb gws explains for 56 of tws variability and sws comes to the third after swe but cws has smallest contribution to tws variability which means different water components contribute distinctly to tws change analysis of water components in yrb was rare until this paper then we calculate precipitation time series from gpm product and find that it is well correlated with twsa obtained from grace later we demonstrate different water component does play different roles in response to yrb drought events by calculating wcsd and wcsdi we use the ccr of single component as their weight to construct an alternative drought index wwsdi and compare with commonly used drought index scpdsi spi and spei the result indicates scpdsi spi and spei are correlated well with wwsdi with correlation coefficients of 0 58 0 74 and 0 68 respectively which means wwsdi is an effective way to detect drought events over yrb finally we use wwsdi to monitor and character drought events in yrb during 2003 to 2014 same as previous studies we find yrb experienced two extreme drought in 2006 and 2011 with drought magnitude of 10 72 cm ewt and 8 15 cm ewt respectively different findings based on wwsd than previous papers is that more recovery time period are identified which is manifested by the fact no drought event lasting over one year is detected we attribute this to alleviation from different components because equally treating these components may overestimate the severity duration of one drought event in yrb although the potential of grace to monitor large or global scale drought has been explored well this paper

5058,in multi agent decision making agents decisions are coherently interdependent and the objectives of agents are possibly inconsistent in this type of decision making agents need to reason and act strategically therefore game theory can be used to study the strategic interactions among decision makers this paper presents a new hierarchical decision making methodology which uses the advantages of both game theory i e stackelberg leadership model and evidential reasoning er er as a multi attribute decision making method considers both qualitative and quantitative attributes and incorporates existing uncertainties in evaluating alternatives the backward induction method and monte carlo theory are used to solve the deterministic and stochastic forms of the proposed leader follower game the methodology is applied to choose the best restoration scenario for urmia lake which is the biggest saltwater lake in the middle east in the past decade the lake s surface area has dramatically decreased due to climate change and an anthropogenic drought in this paper 19 lake restoration scenarios have been evaluated and a scenario which is corresponding to a 40 reduction in agricultural water consumption and water release from nezam abad dam is found to be the equilibrium solution for both types of the game keywords water resources evidential reasoning game theory leader follower multi level decision making lake urmia 1 introduction in the past decades group and multi agent decision making techniques have been vastly applied in different areas the reason behind their high application is their ability to consider various decision makers dms with different powers behaviors and utilities these methods have been very applicable to water resources problems since they usually contain different decision makers with conflicting utilities in 1994 a multi attribute decision making madm method called er was developed by yang and singh 1994 based on dempster shafer theory dempster 1967 shafer 1976 this method can consider some types of uncertainties such as the absence of data incomplete description of an attribute and random nature of an attribute in the decision making process in this method instead of using the ordinary decision matrix like most of the madm techniques a new extended matrix is applied and attributes are assessed in a distributed manner by belief structures moreover the dempster shafer theory is used to aggregate belief structures in the past decade several researchers have improved the er based madm by considering interval quantitative attribute values and interval belief degrees wang et al 2006 mohammadi and makui 2017 group decision making based on reaching consensus liu et al 2015 group decision making based on both er and topsis mohammadi and makui 2017 interval evidential reasoning ier which is capable of handling interval uncertainties like interval weights and interval belief degrees zhang et al 2017 and reliability factor based decision making process zhou et al 2018 these methods have been used in various fields such as engineering design reliability and safety risk assessment business management project management and supply chain management in water and environmental resources planning and management many pieces of research have used er in their studies abed elmdoust and kerachian 2012 and abed elmdoust and kerachian 2016 adopted er approach for integrated solid waste management abed elmdoust and kerachian 2014 used er and other mcdm methods to quantify the relative weights of water users in a water transfer project from the karoon river basin to the rafsanjan plain in iran aghaarabi et al 2014 applied fuzzy er and rule based approaches to the evaluation of water quality in distribution networks estalaki et al 2016 evaluated various water supply management policies of the chitgar lake located on the northwest of tehran by applying er and fuzzy social choice approaches in this study different stakeholders with distinct utility functions are considered to make the results more reliable in comparison to other mcdm methods akhoundi and nazif 2018 used er to assess the sustainability of wastewater reuse alternatives by considering different economic technological environmental and social criteria jahanshahi and kerachian 2019 proposed a new er based sustainability index si for identifying the best basin wide water allocation policy to evaluate the si it was applied to the gorganrud qaresou basin located in northern iran in addition to mcdm the game theory has been successfully utilized to address the real world decision making problems by using mathematical and economic tools game theory is used to understand the existing interactions among the players of a game and usually results in an equilibrium solution which anticipates the most probable actions that are adopted by the players when the game is played madani 2010 reviewed the application of game theory in water resources management kucukmehmetoglu 2012 proposed an approach integrating game theory and pareto frontier concepts for allocating the transboundary water resources and it was used in the euphrates and tigris river basin model poorsepahy samian et al 2012 suggested a game theoretic methodology for water and discharge permit allocation to agricultural zones in shared rivers kahil et al 2016 developed a cooperative game theoretic approach for analyzing water management policies under water scarcity and drought conditions in this process different stakeholders and their strategic behaviors were involved zanjanian et al 2018 used a game theoretic framework to study the actions of stakeholders involved in the conflict rising from water allocation in the ilham dam this study aimed to determine the most influential third party in that conflict chhipi shrestha et al 2019 proposed a multi criteria multi decision maker framework integrating game theory and multi criteria decision analysis for selecting the best water reuse application one of the advantages of game theory over other decision making approaches is its capability to model dynamic decision making processes dynamic games in which the players choose their actions at different levels and decision making does not happen simultaneously stackelberg leadership model leader follower game is a prominent model in dynamic game theory in which the leader is trying to take his her best action by evaluating the best responses of followers multi level optimization methods based on the backward induction approach are used to solve these kinds of games in continuous spaces different approaches have been developed for solving these games regarding the number of decision making levels the number of followers or leaders in each level and their relation state i e cooperative partial cooperative non cooperative lu et al 2006 studied bi level multi follower decision making problems and presented formulations of nine possible states in terms of sharing decision variables constraints and objective functions between players safari et al 2014 applied a two level leader follower model to maximize the net benefit of players in a water allocation problem in their study a water resource management company was assumed as the leader and agricultural domestic and industrial water users were presumed as followers each of them had an exclusive objective function and some constraints han et al 2015 developed a tri level multi follower decision making structure the goal of their study was to find nash equilibrium in horizontal structures and stackelberg equilibrium in a vertical structure lu et al 2016 prepared a survey on multi level decision making studies and categorized them based on the type of applied optimization algorithm and study fields and consequently investigated their pros and cons ramos et al 2016 used a multi leader follower approach with the goal of designing and optimization of industrial water networks in eco industrial parks the leader in that study is eco industrial park authority with the objective function of minimizing the water consumption and the followers are enterprises that want to minimize their total annual costs chen et al 2017 developed a leader follower interactive method for regional water resources management considering multiple water demands and eco environmental constraints in many decision making situations neither the traditional mcdm techniques nor the game theory concept cannot be used alone to handle the decision making problem properly this is generally driven by the limitations and characteristics of each of these methods however utilizing the advantages of these two concepts would provide reasonable solutions to problems that cannot be solved entirely with one of these concepts for example madani and lund 2011 analyzed a one level static decision making problem as a strategic game and solved it based on stability definitions the current paper proposes a new dynamic group madm methodology by integrating the stackelberg game and the er approach stackelberg game is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the decision making process in hierarchical sequential games in the game theory the payoff is the value associated with a possible outcome of a game an optimal strategy is one that provides the best payoff for a player in a game in this paper a madm method called er is applied to aggregate the assessments of different dms on various criteria to determine the utilities for each level of decision making utilities are the values that the er method uses to rank the alternatives the utilities could be easily used as payoffs in the game theory concept the advantages of the methodology are as follows 1 considering dm s real positions and the sequence of their decisions vertical and horizontal decision making structures by using the stackelberg dynamic game to find the equilibrium solution of the game 2 using an er based group madm method capable of incorporating different kinds of uncertainties in estimating the payoffs of each strategy in each level of dms 3 considering different quantitative and qualitative criteria in a unified framework based on the belief structures 4 the flexibility of the proposed method for applying to problems with several decision making levels and various dms in each of them 5 incorporating the relative power of the same level dms and the distinct weights of their different evaluation criteria in the decision making analysis in the first part of the methodology section an er based leader follower game with complete information is developed in which in each level decision variables are discrete actions taken by all dms at that level a strategy is a combination of actions taken by dm s at each level the same level dms assess the strategies by applying a group er based madm method and cumulative payoffs are determined then the best strategy is selected by using the extended form of the leader follower game and backward induction method in the second part a monte carlo based game theoric approach is used for incorporating the existing uncertainties in the weights of followers and their attributes from the leader s perspective the rest of this paper is structured as follows in the methodology section a flowchart of the proposed er based methodology for solving the leader follower games is presented and the main components of the methodology are described then the study area i e lake urmia in iran and its specific characteristics are explained in detail in the results and discussion section the results of the application of the methodology for finding the best restoration scenario of the lake urmia are presented and discussed the main findings of the paper limitations of the methodology and some suggestions for generalizing the suggested approach in future researches are discussed in the conclusion section 2 methodology this section of the paper consists of two main parts 1 er based leader follower game with complete information 2 er based leader follower game with incomplete information in the first part an approach based on er and leader follower game is developed that is capable of handling a hierarchal decision making process by considering different types of uncertainty that will be discussed step by step based on the flowchart shown in fig 1 the second part deals with games with incomplete information and a procedure based on the monte carlo approach is suggested to solve this type of game in this section all relations and equations are illustrated for a bi level game in which there is one level for leaders and followers however the suggested procedure can be easily applied to multi level games it should be noted that dm and player are two interchangeable words in game theory and mcdm which means a person who takes action or makes a decision 2 1 er based leader follower game with complete information 2 1 1 identifying the game in this step key players of the game and their statuses are identified the statuses of players include their type and the order of actions being taken then a vertical decision making structure is formed in which there are different levels of decision making and at each level there are players whose types of actions are the same and they take action by implementing group decision making in that exclusive level the first level players are called leaders and the others are called followers who are consequently numbered based on their statuses i e a group of followers who take action after the first level of followers are called followers of level 2 the total number of decision making levels is represented by z a vector containing chosen actions of each level of players is called strategy sets of all strategies s are the distinct combinations of possible actions taken by group players of all levels for a two level game a group of leaders and a group of followers the set s is defined as follows 1 s a 1 b 1 a 1 b 2 a j b k a m b n 1 a m b n where a j b k the strategy in which leaders take action aj and followers take action bk nl number of leaders nf number of followers m number of leaders actions n number of followers actions a j the j th action of leaders and b k the k th action of followers 2 1 2 collecting basic data and information in this step the aim is to determine the characteristics of players evaluation attributes and strategies the desirability of strategies to each vertical level of players i e the group of players in each level that cooperate to take their action is also evaluated the desirability of a strategy in the game theory concept is called payoff in this paper the er approach is utilized for estimating the players payoff prior to implementing the er approach steps 2 1 to 2 6 presented in fig 1 should be taken these steps are clarified as below 2 1 2 1 determining the weights of players in the ith level in this step the relative weights of the players the i th level w i w 1 i w 2 i w r i w np i i are estimated where np i is the total number of players in that level in a bi level model np i nl and nf for i 1 and i 2 respectively the weights must satisfy the following constraints 2 0 w r i 1 r 1 n p i 3 r 1 np i w r i 1 2 1 2 2 defining evaluation attributes qualitative or quantitative and determining their weights for each player in the ith level in this step for each player the most proper attributes are determined by which strategies are assessed the weight of each attribute which means the importance of that specific attribute in estimating payoff for each player is also determined the determined set is denoted by w r i w r 1 i w r 2 i w r t i w r l i i in which l i is the number of the attributes that the i th level players evaluate the strategies with and r can be any value between 1 and np i the attributes can be qualitative or quantitative the quantitative attribute is an attribute that has a specific value for each strategy but in qualitative attributes there is no considered value and it is based on judgment the total number of qualitative and quantitative attributes for level i is denoted by n l i and n q i respectively n l i n q i l i in some cases like the example of section 4 one attribute may consist of some sub attributes the same trend could be applied to every single sub attribute in these cases the weights of those sub attributes which form an attribute should be determined too the weights of attributes for each player in all levels should satisfy the following constraints 4 0 w r t i 1 5 t 1 l i w r t i 1 2 1 2 3 defining the evaluation grade and assigned utilities for the ith level players as mentioned before in the er approach each attribute of an alternative is evaluated in a distributed manner based on a belief structure the belief structures are determined by assessing the belief degrees of each attribute of an alternative evaluation grades and utilities are respectively denoted by h and u 6 h i h 1 h u h k i 7 u i u 1 u u u k i u u should satisfy the following constraint 8 f o r u 1 k i 1 0 u u u u 1 1 where k i is the number of evaluation grades of players in level i 2 1 2 4 determining the values of each quantitative attribute designated to each evaluation grade by ith level players in the case of a quantitative attribute each player in a level should assign an equivalent value of that attribute to each evaluation grade which is referred to as quantitative value in this paper for example in a water allocation problem the government as a player might consider 0 6 0 8 and 0 9 respectively as evaluation grades of bad average and good value for the ratio of supply to demand for the agricultural sector these values differ among players because of their different points of view in this sub step these values for all players and quantitative attributes should be determined that is represented by qv n p i n q i k i i this matrix should be obtained for each level 2 1 2 5 finding the values of each quantitative attribute of the ith level players for all strategies in this step all strategies are evaluated and the values of quantitative subjective attributes of each decision making level i are estimated the matrix which represents these values is denoted as s n q i n s i in which ns is the number of strategies 2 1 2 6 determining the belief degrees assigned to each quantitative or qualitative attribute by the ith level players in this sub step the belief degrees are determined and the belief matrix is formed which is denoted by bd n p i n s l i k i i to perform this for qualitative attributes degrees of belief are estimated considering the players points of view for example in the water allocation problem player 1 assesses the social impact of water allocation scenarios as a qualitative attribute for a water allocation scenario with high adverse impacts on local communities belief degrees could be assigned as follows bad 0 8 average 0 1 good 0 1 for quantitative attributes the estimation of belief degrees is based on qv n p i n q i k i i and s n q i n s i that is explained in fig 2 in this process first of all the values of quantitative attributes are compared to the intervals of the evaluation grades of that attribute corresponding to each decision maker then after it is found that in which range the value locates the belief degrees bd r s t u i are calculated based on the distances of attributes value and the two evaluation grades values at the start and end of the interval when two belief matrices of bd n p i n s n q i k i i and bd n p i n s n l i k i i for quantitative and qualitative attributes are determined they are easily combined based on their third dimension number of attributes to reach the total belief degrees of all attributes bd n p i n s l i k i i 2 1 3 aggregating the belief degrees using the er approach in this step the estimated belief degrees in the previous step are aggregated in cases when there is more than one player on a level group decision making is needed in this paper a group madm method based on er is applied which uses the er analytical algorithm for aggregating the assessments of attributes and also decision makers furthermore in cases where sub attributes exist er is firstly used to aggregate the belief degrees of sub attributes and reach a specific assessment on the higher level attribute by assuming that there is no sub attribute and there are various players in a level this stage contains two sub steps as follows 2 1 3 1 aggregating the belief degrees assigned to different attributes or sub attributes of strategies by the ith level players in this sub step the er analytical algorithm developed by wang et al 2006 is used to aggregate each player s belief degrees on different attributes for each strategy therefore all the belief degrees of one player are aggregated and an overall assessment of that player for each strategy is obtained this process is done through the following three stages 1 calculating the basic probability masses m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 based on the relative weights of attributes and the belief degrees assigned to them bd r s t u i by using the following equations 9 m r s u t i w r t i bd r s t u i 10 m r s h t i 1 u 1 k i m r s u t i 11 m r t i 1 1 w r t i 12 m r s h t i 2 w r t i 1 u 1 k i bd r s t u i where t 1 2 l i u 1 2 k i s 1 2 n s r 1 2 n p i 2 combining the basic probability masses to reach an aggregated basic probability mass by using the following relations 13 k r s i u 1 k i t 1 l i m r s u t i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 k i 1 t 1 l i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 1 14 m r s u i k r s i t 1 l i m r s u t i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 t 1 l i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 15 m r t i 1 k r s i t 1 l i m r t i 1 16 m r t i 2 k r s i t 1 l i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 t 1 l i m r t i 1 3 normalizing the results of the previous stage to reach the combined belief degrees on each strategy bd r s u i by using the following relations 17 bd r s u i m r s u i 1 m r t i 1 18 bd r s h i m r t i 2 1 m r t i 1 where bd r s u i is the belief degrees assigned to evaluation grade u by player r in i th level and for sth strategy and bd r s h i is the unassigned belief degree of it this value is nonzero when there is an incomplete assessment in the belief degrees of qualitative attributes 2 1 3 2 aggregating the belief degrees of players in level i assigned to each strategy in this step the analytical er algorithm is used to aggregate the overall assessments of same level players the results of the section 2 1 3 1 for each strategy which results in overall group assessment of those players i th level players in the form of a belief structure to perform this task the relations 9 18 are used with some changes including 1 the weights of attributes w r i are replaced with the weights of players w i 2 belief degrees of different attributes are replaced with belief degrees of different players in that specific level bd r s u i 3 the number of attributes l i is replaced with the number of players np i in eqs 9 16 in other words the assessments of different decision makers are considered as different attributes in this approach the results of this section would be bd s u i and bd s h i which are the matrices of the overall belief degrees and unassigned belief degree of all the i th level players for each strategy correspondingly 2 1 4 calculating the aggregated payoffs of the level i players in this step the aim is to determine the total group payoff of players based on the overall belief degrees bd s u using the following equation when bd s h i is zero complete assessment 19 payoff s i u 1 k i u u i bd s u i in cases when there is an incomplete assessment or bd s h i has a nonzero value this unassigned belief degree is assigned to the first and the last evaluation grade to find the minimum and maximum payoff eqs 20 and 21 the average of these values are considered as the payoff in the game these payoffs are estimated as follows 20 payoff s m i n i u 1 k i u u i bd s u i u 1 i bd s h i 21 payoff s m a x i u 1 k i u u i bd s u i u k i i bd s h i 2 1 5 finding the equilibrium strategy by using the results of section 2 1 4 the payoff of strategies the extensive form of the game is completed in this step the backward induction method is applied to solve the game and to find the subgame perfect equilibrium solution this method is based on breaking the game to some subgames and addressing them in a particular order that is discussed in detail in fig 3 for a bi level game in this figure for the better representation the calculated payoffs of leaders and followers eqs 18 21 are displayed with αjk and βjk which are equivalent to payoff s 1 and payoff s 2 respectively where s is the number of the strategy in which leaders take action j and followers action k a subgame is a subset of any game which includes an initial node decision node and all its successor nodes for every initial node the previous history of the taken actions until that node should be known the length of a decision node is equal to the longest history of that node e g in a bi level game the length of the decision nodes of followers and leaders are equal to 1 and 0 respectively fig 3 indicates how the backward induction method is used to find the equilibrium in the suggested er based leader follower game the basis of backward induction is built on a comparison of possible payoffs from choosing available actions and replacing the different actions of each decision making level from level z to 1 with their best responses the best response is an action that the same level players choose in each decision making node and leads to the most desirable strategy with the highest possible payoff in this method it is assumed that all of the players are rational a rational player chooses the action which leads to a strategy that has the highest payoff so in each decision making node a comparison has been made by players to find the most desirable action the relations and equations of finding the best responses are represented in fig 3 for a bi level game in the first step the subgames of the game should be determined in a bi level game there are two types of subgames level one subgames with the history of one and level two subgames with a history of zero level one subgames are the subgames that should be solved first in the second and third steps level one subgames are solved and the best responses are replaced in the fourth step the level two subgame should be addressed in this step the leaders choose their best action based on a comparison of payoffs if there are z levels of players this process should start from the last level or decision nodes with the length of z 1 then each subgame is solved and the actions of players are replaced with their best responses until the process reaches to subgames with the length of zero or the leaders level sometimes the same level players might be indifferent between choosing two or more actions because of their equal in these situations it is assumed that the probabilities of taking those actions are equal 2 2 er based leader follower game with incomplete information in this section the games with incomplete information are discussed in these games at least one player does not know the other player s payoff completely in this study it is assumed that the source of incompleteness is the leaders lack of information about the weights of followers and that of attributes in other words because the leaders are not confident about the weights of followers they cannot estimate their precise payoffs for choosing each action this situation happens a lot in real world decision making problems as a result the leaders are not sure about the best responses of followers meaning that they would have trouble taking their best action these kinds of situations happen a lot in real decision making problems when a player is not sure about the other players characteristics and cannot make his her decision accurately in this part a procedure based on the monte carlo theory is proposed to handle those situations in a bi level er based leader follower game which is discussed step by step as follows 2 2 1 estimating the interval weights of followers in this step leaders evaluate the weight of followers as interval values 22 w l w 1 l w i l w nf l 23 w u w 1 u w i u w nf u w l set of the lower bounds of weights of followers w u set of the upper bounds of weights of followers w i l the lower bound of weight of i th follower w i u the upper bound of weight of i th follower 2 2 2 finding the possible sets of the followers weights in this step x sets of weights of followers are produced moreover the following constraints should be satisfied for each set 24 i 1 nf w i 1 25 w i l w i w i u these sets of possible weights are produced based on an increment value which is assigned by the user in order to search for weights in the defined weight interval it is assumed that each weight interval is uniformly distributed and the probability of each chosen weight equals to 1 x in which x is the number of possible weights according to the interval length and the increment value for example if the lower and upper limits of one decision maker or attribute are respectively 0 1 and 0 15 with the increment value of 0 01 the proposed algorithm considers 0 1 0 11 0 12 0 13 0 14 and 0 15 as the possible values attributed to weights 2 2 3 estimating a set of possible weights for attributes in this step at first leaders evaluate the attributes weight assigned by each of the followers in the interval form then the possible sets of attributes weights for each of the followers are determined that must satisfy the following constraints 26 r 1 l 2 w r i 1 27 w l r i w r i w u r i where l 2 total number of level 2 or followers evaluation attributes w r i the possible weight of r th attribute for the i th followers w l r i the lowest weight of r th attribute for the i th follower estimated by leaders w u r i the highest weight of r th attribute for the i th follower estimated by leaders y1 y2 ynf sets of possible weights of attributes corresponding to each follower are estimated in this section 2 2 4 calculating the payoffs of possible games different sets of weights lead to various games and payoffs the previous step resulted in x sets of weights for followers and y 1 y 2 ynf sets of attributes weights for the followers 1 to nf therefore there are ng x i 1 nf y i different combinations of weights and their respective games in this stage first the inputs in the steps 2 1 2 1 and 2 1 2 2 weights of followers and their attributes will be updated by each set of weights then the steps 2 1 3 2 to 2 1 4 should be taken and the payoff for each strategy in each set of weights will be estimated 2 2 5 reducing the computational cost in the game theory the value of payoff of a strategy is not significant by itself but its relative value in comparison with payoffs of other strategies is substantial therefore in this step in order to soften the computational cost and to prevent solving all ng games step 2 1 5 which has not been taken yet the payoffs are ranked in ascending order the ranks could be used as payoffs and the total number of games ng decreases to ng which is the total number of different rankings 2 2 6 solving the level one games using the backward induction method for each of the ng types of games the backward induction method step 2 1 5 is applied to determine the best responses of the followers when these best responses are found the best responses of all ng games are easily identified 2 2 7 decision making by leader s in the proposed incomplete game in this section a methodology is proposed in which the leaders can choose their best action by maximizing their expected payoffs firstly by analyzing the best responses in all ng games the probability of taking each action by followers in response to each of the leader s actions are determined then the expected payoff of the leader from each action is estimated considering the probability of each action of followers in response to the action of the leader finally the leader decides to take any action that has the most expected payoff the following calculations should be done for j 1 m and k 1 n m and n are respectively the total number of the leader s and follower s actions 28 p k j tn k j tg 29 payoff l e a d e r s j expected k 1 n p k j payoff l e a d e r s j k where p k j is the probability of the situation in which leader s takes action j and followers best response to it is action k tn k j is the total number of games in which followers best response to action j of leader s is action k payoff l e a d e r s j expected is the expected payoff of leader s when he takes action j payoff l e a d e r s j k is the payoff of leader s when he takes action j and followers respond to it with action k 3 case study in this paper lake urmia is selected as the study area to show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology this lake is located between the provinces of east azerbaijan and west azerbaijan in iran the geographic coordination is equal to 37 06 15 and 38 15 15 north and 45 00 13 and 45 55 20 east fig 4 someday it was the largest lake in the middle east and the largest salt lake in the world but its area has been decreased calamitously due to building dams on the feeding rivers irregular water exploitation for agriculture expansion from both groundwater and streams and decreasing precipitation during the past years as a result desiccation has occurred in large areas of the lakes bed the surface area of the lake has decreased from 6000 km2 in 1997 to 700 km2 in 2013 and once more has risen to 2000 3000 km2 in 2019 because of heavy rainfalls in 2019 in fig 5 the fluctuations of lake urmia surface area are represented this disaster which many call it the most severe human made desertification of the world has brought some terrible consequences that are not limited to the lake itself but also to the whole ecosystem around it the reduction of the lake area has many effects such as the demolition of the food chain e g decreasing the artemia number due to the high salinity of the lake increasing the risk of health problems such as asthma since the desertification allows the dust go far distances quickly by wind in july 2013 because of the continuing desertification urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc started to work on defining the urmia lake restoration program ulrp by order of iran s president ulrnc 2014 the committee is responsible for making proper decisions and implementing the most effective projects to alleviate the situation lots of projects have been defined with different budgets and effectiveness that in many cases have been failed or reached a lower outcome than it was assumed at the beginning the main goal of the ulrp is to reach the estimated ecological elevation of water in lake urmia which is equal to 1274 1 m above the sea this value is approximately 3 m higher than the current elevation two main reasons for these failures are 1 not allocating the budget in a suitable way 2 lack of cooperation between different stakeholders in the next section the proposed methodology is used to assess some restoration scenarios which were suggested by various studies in a study by the regional council of urmia lake basin management rculb 2014 these scenarios have been simulated for ten years and the features of the lake such as the average depth of water the average surface area under each scenario have been estimated these scenarios are called areal restoration scenarios of the lake as they mainly focus on increasing the area of the lake the report of rculb 2014 provides more information about these scenarios the main characteristics of the lake under each scenario in addition to other features are used as the attributes by which the lake is evaluated in the following section the er based leader follower game is used to determine which scenario is more appropriate to be selected regarding the hierarchical structure of the decision making and the decision makers utilities 4 results and discussion this section consists of two main sections 4 1 and 4 2 that represent the results of applying the proposed methodology is explained in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively 4 1 game with complete information game identification in this study the procedure of choosing the best plan to restore lake urmia is considered as a game the real process of this selection is somehow a leader follower game in which the government gov suggests a restoration plan to the plan and budget organization pbo of iran they could accept and allocate the budget to the recommended plan or reject it in this process the department of environment doe plays the role of confirming or rejecting their scenarios by considering the environmental impacts therefore the existing hierarchical decision making system is similar to a bi level leader follower game in which the gov is the leader and the pbo and doe are followers pbo and doe are in level two the level of followers and they can take two actions 1 accept the proposed scenario and allocate fund 2 reject if they reject a plan the status quo of the lake remains gov as a leader has 19 actions which are different lake restoration scenarios table 1 each of which contains hydraulic and hydrologic scenarios the hydrologic scenarios include the projects which have been defined by ulrnc for dealing with the drying up of lake urmia the hydraulic scenarios mainly suggest dividing the lake into two different areas the supporters of these projects believe that the southern part of the lake cannot be recovered as it contains vast areas with high salinity and considerable evaporation rate these scenarios which are the actions of gov are displayed by using a coding system comprising two or three parts the first and second parts are the indicators of hydrologic and hydraulic scenarios in the cases which a third part is displayed it describes the dike s elevation of the hydraulic projects e g the second scenario s1 o3 1275 means this scenario contains hydrologic scenario s1 and hydraulic scenario o3 in which the elevation of the dike is equal to 1275 m above the sea level the hydrologic scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 contain different projects that lead to an increase in the inflow to the lake table 2 describes these scenarios in which it is specified whether the mentioned scenario contains or does not contain each of the hydrological projects for the projects that have been started in the past and they are under implementation now costs have been estimated considering their progress percentage and total cost all the hydraulic scenarios except o1 suggest exclusive patterns for dividing the lake into two smaller lakes and table 3 describes these scenarios in detail it should be mentioned that in the mentioned study two other hydraulic scenarios o4 and o3nt are modeled in these two scenarios not only the lake is divided into two sections but also water from one side of the dike would be pumped into the other side and preserve just one smaller lake those two scenarios are not considered in this paper due to the financial infeasib1ility of pumping an enormous volume of water and their adverse environmental impacts the path on which the dike would be built based on scenarios o2 and o3 is represented in fig 6 in this section at first the 19 restoration plans and their characteristics are explained furthermore by combining the actions of the followers and the leader the strategies are formed according to table 4 determining the weights of the ith level players for the first level since there is just one player gov the weight of that player would be equal to one for the second level the level of followers weights of pbo and doe are respectively considered to be 0 6 and 0 4 these values are estimated based on the opinions of five experts defining the evaluation attributes qualitative or quantitative and their weights assigned them by each player attributes sub attributes type of attributes and their weights assigned by each player are presented in table 5 and discussed in detail in the following 1 average coverage of ecological regions this attribute has been calculated by rculbm based on the average amount of ecologically significant areas which are covered by water in each strategy during a 10 year simulation period these areas have been determined by ulrnc 2014 in lake urmia comprehensive management plan these areas go into three clusters of high moderate and low sensitive ecological regions fig 7 and the value of this attribute is determined by averaging the percentages of the coverage of these three ecological regions with the weights of 0 6 0 3 and 0 3 respectively 2 average coverage of dust pollution source areas this attribute has been estimated by rculbm based on how the dust pollution source areas are covered by water in each strategy the value of this attribute is equal to the average coverage of these areas during a 10 year simulation period these areas are determined by the remote sensing research center rsrc of sharif university of technology 2014 fig 7 represents the location of these areas 3 the average area of the lake with the elevation more than 1274 1 m km2 the value of this attribute for each scenario is equal to the average of areas covered with water and an elevation more than 1274 1 m during a 10 year simulation period this area has been estimated by rculbm 4 average coverage of northern part of the lake km2 the lake is divided into two separate regions northern and southern by the shahid kalantari causeway with a 1400 m opening these parts are represented in fig 6 the water surface area coverage of these two areas is reported independently because they have different importance the coverage of the northern areas of the lake has a higher weight due to its significant importance in terms of ecotourism this value of this attribute is assumed to be its average value during the 10 year simulation period rculbm this value has been estimated by rculbm 5 average coverage of the southern parts of the lake km2 6 consistency with the ecosystem this qualitative attribute is evaluated for each scenario considering the adverse impacts on the ecosystem of lake urmia 7 profitability this qualitative attribute is evaluated for each scenario based on the average of the volume of water during a 10 year simulation period and the required budget for implementing that scenario the estimated cost of each scenario is represented in table 6 defining the evaluation grades and the assigned utilities in this example it is assumed that all the players in both levels have 5 k 1 and k 2 evaluation grades which are defined as follows h h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 and u 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 1 where h1 very poor h2 poor h3 average h4 good h5 very good determining the values of each quantitative attribute designated to each evaluation grade by the player of the ith level in this case study the first two attributes contain quantitative sub attributes therefore an aggregation is needed the estimated values of the quantitative sub attributes are represented in table 7 in the assignment of these values doe gov and pbo have had different points of view for each evaluation grade for example for the a1 attribute and the h1 evaluation grade gov pbo and doe have respectively assigned the values of 20 15 and 25 which means that in the case of average coverage of ecological regions doe is stricter than gov and pbo which is reasonable considering their organizational characteristics finding the value of each quantitative attribute for all strategies in rculbm s study a matlab based physical model has been developed by which scenarios have been evaluated the obtained results for 38 strategies are represented in table 8 the strategies with even numbers s1 s3 s37 are represented in one row because since in all of them the suggested scenario by gov is rejected by pbo and doe and the current condition continues determining the belief degrees assigned to each attribute by the ith level players at first all scenarios are evaluated based on qualitative attributes a3 and a4 the assigned belief degrees to these attributes are represented in tables 9 and 10 from the point of view of gov and pbo and doe respectively then for all independent quantitative attributes which has no sub attributes the belief degrees are formed for each player as an example for the gov a1 attribute and the first five strategies are presented in table 11 aggregating of the belief degrees assigned to different attributes in this step the aggregation operator is applied to both sub attributes and attributes consequently it results in the belief degrees by which the gov pbo and doe evaluate the strategies the results of this section are represented in table 12 aggregating of belief degrees of players in level i assigned to each strategy in this step the aggregation operator is applied to levels with more than one player i e level 2 and the belief degrees of same level players are aggregated the result is a single belief degree for both doe and pbo for each strategy the results are represented in table 13 payoff calculation in this section eqs 19 21 are used to estimate the gained payoff form the obtained belief degrees of the previous step which is represented in table 14 for both levels it should be mentioned that in decision making levels with more than one player this is an er based aggregated payoff of all players in this case the represented payoff of followers is for both doe and pbo using backward induction method to solve the game in this step the hierarchical game is completed and the equilibrium strategy is determined by solving the level one subgames replacing the actions with the best responses and consequently solving level two subgames as it is difficult to display the full game only the first ten actions of the gov and the reactions of followers of the leader follower game is represented in fig 8 the equilibrium strategy is strategy number 9 in which the gov suggests s2 o1 restoration scenario and the pbo and doe accept it and allocate the requested financial resources 4 2 game with incomplete information it is assumed that the gov does not know the weights of pbo and doe and that of their attributes entirely but they can estimate it in an interval form the weights of pbo and doe are estimated as 0 5 0 65 and 0 35 0 5 respectively in addition the estimated weights of attributes are represented in table 15 the increment value of 0 05 is used both for the weights of followers and their attributes that lead to 1254 different combinations of weights or in other words 1254 games sections 2 2 1 2 2 3 the er approach is used to calculate the group payoff of players for all games section 2 2 4 these payoffs are ranked in an ascending format which leads to 243 separately rank orders or types of games section 2 2 5 this approach significantly reduces the computational cost for each of these 243 types of games the backward induction method section 2 2 6 is implemented to find the best responses and the probability of the actions being taken by the followers finally the expected payoffs are calculated and the equilibrium solution is determined section 2 2 7 which are represented in fig 9 it should be mentioned that the incomplete game also provides the scenario s2 o1 as the best action of leaders and the response of followers to the selected action is 100 accept 0 reject which means that in all 243 types of games the followers accept the s2 o1 action chosen by the leader the scenario s2 o1 is selected as an equilibrium strategy in both complete and incomplete games but the accept has the probability equal to 100 in the incomplete game meaning that this scenario can completely satisfy the leader as well as followers the response of followers to that action is not sensitive to the considered intervals of weights and the expected payoff in the incomplete game is equal to that of the complete one 5 summary and conclusions in this paper a new methodology has been presented for modeling the hierarchical decision making problems as extensive games and solving them by using the leader follower game and er approach the suggested method is provided with the capability of dealing with numerous players at each level different levels of decision making and various kinds of uncertainty the application of this method has been tested on lake urmia restoration scenario selection which is a multi level and multi player decision making problem with a considered amount of complexity the process mentioned above was used and the equilibrium strategy as a result was the strategy of number 9 which means gov suggests the scenario s2 o1 and consequently the doe and pbo accept and allocate the needed budget to it scenario s2 o1 does not alter the major hydraulic characteristics of the lake since it only contains hydrological projects which are a 40 reduction in agricultural sector water demand and water release from nezam abad dam this result indicates the reliability of the modeled game and the proposed methodology because of the following reasons 1 not containing any hydraulic projects with unknown effects 2 not containing highly priced projects like inter basin water transfer 3 concentrating on demand management which has a high performance and it is assumed as one of the most effective solutions for water deficiency 4 releasing water from the nezam abad dam increases the inflow of the zarrinerud river to the lake that has a very significant effect on the volume of water that the lake contains ulrnc has concentrated on agricultural demand management projects such as reducing the water loss in the conveyance networks and changing the crop pattern to low water consuming crops which are economically beneficial like medicinal plants the reasons which contributed to reaching this reasonable strategy are 1 the ability of the method to consider different levels of decision makers using the stackelberg game which provides more efficiency in comparison with conventional group mcdm methods 2 the ability of the model to separately consider any attribute that seems essential to each decision maker with no limitation in terms of being qualitative or quantitative in the second section of the methodology section a new monte carlo based approach was applied which facilitates the process of action selection of the leader in the extensive games when the leader who has incomplete information it was applied to lake urmia and resulted in s2 o1 selection by the leader and 100 of games accept 0 of games reject by followers it should be noted that the primary goal of this study was to propose a new decision making methodology with the aforementioned capabilities and then apply it to one of the most threatened lakes of iran lake urmia which needs national and international attention to survive in future studies social and stakeholder analysis for a better understanding of the behaviors of stakeholders their interactions and weights could be proper topics to be considered in addition in this paper it is also assumed that the agents players are rational and each agent wants to increase his payoff however perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for decision making in future works the proposed methodology should be extended to consider agents with bounded rationality moreover the proposed methodology is suitable for the hierarchical decision making processes in which the actions of players are limited extending the current methodology to consider both continuous and discrete actions could be a proper topic for future researches credit authorship contribution statement

5058,in multi agent decision making agents decisions are coherently interdependent and the objectives of agents are possibly inconsistent in this type of decision making agents need to reason and act strategically therefore game theory can be used to study the strategic interactions among decision makers this paper presents a new hierarchical decision making methodology which uses the advantages of both game theory i e stackelberg leadership model and evidential reasoning er er as a multi attribute decision making method considers both qualitative and quantitative attributes and incorporates existing uncertainties in evaluating alternatives the backward induction method and monte carlo theory are used to solve the deterministic and stochastic forms of the proposed leader follower game the methodology is applied to choose the best restoration scenario for urmia lake which is the biggest saltwater lake in the middle east in the past decade the lake s surface area has dramatically decreased due to climate change and an anthropogenic drought in this paper 19 lake restoration scenarios have been evaluated and a scenario which is corresponding to a 40 reduction in agricultural water consumption and water release from nezam abad dam is found to be the equilibrium solution for both types of the game keywords water resources evidential reasoning game theory leader follower multi level decision making lake urmia 1 introduction in the past decades group and multi agent decision making techniques have been vastly applied in different areas the reason behind their high application is their ability to consider various decision makers dms with different powers behaviors and utilities these methods have been very applicable to water resources problems since they usually contain different decision makers with conflicting utilities in 1994 a multi attribute decision making madm method called er was developed by yang and singh 1994 based on dempster shafer theory dempster 1967 shafer 1976 this method can consider some types of uncertainties such as the absence of data incomplete description of an attribute and random nature of an attribute in the decision making process in this method instead of using the ordinary decision matrix like most of the madm techniques a new extended matrix is applied and attributes are assessed in a distributed manner by belief structures moreover the dempster shafer theory is used to aggregate belief structures in the past decade several researchers have improved the er based madm by considering interval quantitative attribute values and interval belief degrees wang et al 2006 mohammadi and makui 2017 group decision making based on reaching consensus liu et al 2015 group decision making based on both er and topsis mohammadi and makui 2017 interval evidential reasoning ier which is capable of handling interval uncertainties like interval weights and interval belief degrees zhang et al 2017 and reliability factor based decision making process zhou et al 2018 these methods have been used in various fields such as engineering design reliability and safety risk assessment business management project management and supply chain management in water and environmental resources planning and management many pieces of research have used er in their studies abed elmdoust and kerachian 2012 and abed elmdoust and kerachian 2016 adopted er approach for integrated solid waste management abed elmdoust and kerachian 2014 used er and other mcdm methods to quantify the relative weights of water users in a water transfer project from the karoon river basin to the rafsanjan plain in iran aghaarabi et al 2014 applied fuzzy er and rule based approaches to the evaluation of water quality in distribution networks estalaki et al 2016 evaluated various water supply management policies of the chitgar lake located on the northwest of tehran by applying er and fuzzy social choice approaches in this study different stakeholders with distinct utility functions are considered to make the results more reliable in comparison to other mcdm methods akhoundi and nazif 2018 used er to assess the sustainability of wastewater reuse alternatives by considering different economic technological environmental and social criteria jahanshahi and kerachian 2019 proposed a new er based sustainability index si for identifying the best basin wide water allocation policy to evaluate the si it was applied to the gorganrud qaresou basin located in northern iran in addition to mcdm the game theory has been successfully utilized to address the real world decision making problems by using mathematical and economic tools game theory is used to understand the existing interactions among the players of a game and usually results in an equilibrium solution which anticipates the most probable actions that are adopted by the players when the game is played madani 2010 reviewed the application of game theory in water resources management kucukmehmetoglu 2012 proposed an approach integrating game theory and pareto frontier concepts for allocating the transboundary water resources and it was used in the euphrates and tigris river basin model poorsepahy samian et al 2012 suggested a game theoretic methodology for water and discharge permit allocation to agricultural zones in shared rivers kahil et al 2016 developed a cooperative game theoretic approach for analyzing water management policies under water scarcity and drought conditions in this process different stakeholders and their strategic behaviors were involved zanjanian et al 2018 used a game theoretic framework to study the actions of stakeholders involved in the conflict rising from water allocation in the ilham dam this study aimed to determine the most influential third party in that conflict chhipi shrestha et al 2019 proposed a multi criteria multi decision maker framework integrating game theory and multi criteria decision analysis for selecting the best water reuse application one of the advantages of game theory over other decision making approaches is its capability to model dynamic decision making processes dynamic games in which the players choose their actions at different levels and decision making does not happen simultaneously stackelberg leadership model leader follower game is a prominent model in dynamic game theory in which the leader is trying to take his her best action by evaluating the best responses of followers multi level optimization methods based on the backward induction approach are used to solve these kinds of games in continuous spaces different approaches have been developed for solving these games regarding the number of decision making levels the number of followers or leaders in each level and their relation state i e cooperative partial cooperative non cooperative lu et al 2006 studied bi level multi follower decision making problems and presented formulations of nine possible states in terms of sharing decision variables constraints and objective functions between players safari et al 2014 applied a two level leader follower model to maximize the net benefit of players in a water allocation problem in their study a water resource management company was assumed as the leader and agricultural domestic and industrial water users were presumed as followers each of them had an exclusive objective function and some constraints han et al 2015 developed a tri level multi follower decision making structure the goal of their study was to find nash equilibrium in horizontal structures and stackelberg equilibrium in a vertical structure lu et al 2016 prepared a survey on multi level decision making studies and categorized them based on the type of applied optimization algorithm and study fields and consequently investigated their pros and cons ramos et al 2016 used a multi leader follower approach with the goal of designing and optimization of industrial water networks in eco industrial parks the leader in that study is eco industrial park authority with the objective function of minimizing the water consumption and the followers are enterprises that want to minimize their total annual costs chen et al 2017 developed a leader follower interactive method for regional water resources management considering multiple water demands and eco environmental constraints in many decision making situations neither the traditional mcdm techniques nor the game theory concept cannot be used alone to handle the decision making problem properly this is generally driven by the limitations and characteristics of each of these methods however utilizing the advantages of these two concepts would provide reasonable solutions to problems that cannot be solved entirely with one of these concepts for example madani and lund 2011 analyzed a one level static decision making problem as a strategic game and solved it based on stability definitions the current paper proposes a new dynamic group madm methodology by integrating the stackelberg game and the er approach stackelberg game is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the decision making process in hierarchical sequential games in the game theory the payoff is the value associated with a possible outcome of a game an optimal strategy is one that provides the best payoff for a player in a game in this paper a madm method called er is applied to aggregate the assessments of different dms on various criteria to determine the utilities for each level of decision making utilities are the values that the er method uses to rank the alternatives the utilities could be easily used as payoffs in the game theory concept the advantages of the methodology are as follows 1 considering dm s real positions and the sequence of their decisions vertical and horizontal decision making structures by using the stackelberg dynamic game to find the equilibrium solution of the game 2 using an er based group madm method capable of incorporating different kinds of uncertainties in estimating the payoffs of each strategy in each level of dms 3 considering different quantitative and qualitative criteria in a unified framework based on the belief structures 4 the flexibility of the proposed method for applying to problems with several decision making levels and various dms in each of them 5 incorporating the relative power of the same level dms and the distinct weights of their different evaluation criteria in the decision making analysis in the first part of the methodology section an er based leader follower game with complete information is developed in which in each level decision variables are discrete actions taken by all dms at that level a strategy is a combination of actions taken by dm s at each level the same level dms assess the strategies by applying a group er based madm method and cumulative payoffs are determined then the best strategy is selected by using the extended form of the leader follower game and backward induction method in the second part a monte carlo based game theoric approach is used for incorporating the existing uncertainties in the weights of followers and their attributes from the leader s perspective the rest of this paper is structured as follows in the methodology section a flowchart of the proposed er based methodology for solving the leader follower games is presented and the main components of the methodology are described then the study area i e lake urmia in iran and its specific characteristics are explained in detail in the results and discussion section the results of the application of the methodology for finding the best restoration scenario of the lake urmia are presented and discussed the main findings of the paper limitations of the methodology and some suggestions for generalizing the suggested approach in future researches are discussed in the conclusion section 2 methodology this section of the paper consists of two main parts 1 er based leader follower game with complete information 2 er based leader follower game with incomplete information in the first part an approach based on er and leader follower game is developed that is capable of handling a hierarchal decision making process by considering different types of uncertainty that will be discussed step by step based on the flowchart shown in fig 1 the second part deals with games with incomplete information and a procedure based on the monte carlo approach is suggested to solve this type of game in this section all relations and equations are illustrated for a bi level game in which there is one level for leaders and followers however the suggested procedure can be easily applied to multi level games it should be noted that dm and player are two interchangeable words in game theory and mcdm which means a person who takes action or makes a decision 2 1 er based leader follower game with complete information 2 1 1 identifying the game in this step key players of the game and their statuses are identified the statuses of players include their type and the order of actions being taken then a vertical decision making structure is formed in which there are different levels of decision making and at each level there are players whose types of actions are the same and they take action by implementing group decision making in that exclusive level the first level players are called leaders and the others are called followers who are consequently numbered based on their statuses i e a group of followers who take action after the first level of followers are called followers of level 2 the total number of decision making levels is represented by z a vector containing chosen actions of each level of players is called strategy sets of all strategies s are the distinct combinations of possible actions taken by group players of all levels for a two level game a group of leaders and a group of followers the set s is defined as follows 1 s a 1 b 1 a 1 b 2 a j b k a m b n 1 a m b n where a j b k the strategy in which leaders take action aj and followers take action bk nl number of leaders nf number of followers m number of leaders actions n number of followers actions a j the j th action of leaders and b k the k th action of followers 2 1 2 collecting basic data and information in this step the aim is to determine the characteristics of players evaluation attributes and strategies the desirability of strategies to each vertical level of players i e the group of players in each level that cooperate to take their action is also evaluated the desirability of a strategy in the game theory concept is called payoff in this paper the er approach is utilized for estimating the players payoff prior to implementing the er approach steps 2 1 to 2 6 presented in fig 1 should be taken these steps are clarified as below 2 1 2 1 determining the weights of players in the ith level in this step the relative weights of the players the i th level w i w 1 i w 2 i w r i w np i i are estimated where np i is the total number of players in that level in a bi level model np i nl and nf for i 1 and i 2 respectively the weights must satisfy the following constraints 2 0 w r i 1 r 1 n p i 3 r 1 np i w r i 1 2 1 2 2 defining evaluation attributes qualitative or quantitative and determining their weights for each player in the ith level in this step for each player the most proper attributes are determined by which strategies are assessed the weight of each attribute which means the importance of that specific attribute in estimating payoff for each player is also determined the determined set is denoted by w r i w r 1 i w r 2 i w r t i w r l i i in which l i is the number of the attributes that the i th level players evaluate the strategies with and r can be any value between 1 and np i the attributes can be qualitative or quantitative the quantitative attribute is an attribute that has a specific value for each strategy but in qualitative attributes there is no considered value and it is based on judgment the total number of qualitative and quantitative attributes for level i is denoted by n l i and n q i respectively n l i n q i l i in some cases like the example of section 4 one attribute may consist of some sub attributes the same trend could be applied to every single sub attribute in these cases the weights of those sub attributes which form an attribute should be determined too the weights of attributes for each player in all levels should satisfy the following constraints 4 0 w r t i 1 5 t 1 l i w r t i 1 2 1 2 3 defining the evaluation grade and assigned utilities for the ith level players as mentioned before in the er approach each attribute of an alternative is evaluated in a distributed manner based on a belief structure the belief structures are determined by assessing the belief degrees of each attribute of an alternative evaluation grades and utilities are respectively denoted by h and u 6 h i h 1 h u h k i 7 u i u 1 u u u k i u u should satisfy the following constraint 8 f o r u 1 k i 1 0 u u u u 1 1 where k i is the number of evaluation grades of players in level i 2 1 2 4 determining the values of each quantitative attribute designated to each evaluation grade by ith level players in the case of a quantitative attribute each player in a level should assign an equivalent value of that attribute to each evaluation grade which is referred to as quantitative value in this paper for example in a water allocation problem the government as a player might consider 0 6 0 8 and 0 9 respectively as evaluation grades of bad average and good value for the ratio of supply to demand for the agricultural sector these values differ among players because of their different points of view in this sub step these values for all players and quantitative attributes should be determined that is represented by qv n p i n q i k i i this matrix should be obtained for each level 2 1 2 5 finding the values of each quantitative attribute of the ith level players for all strategies in this step all strategies are evaluated and the values of quantitative subjective attributes of each decision making level i are estimated the matrix which represents these values is denoted as s n q i n s i in which ns is the number of strategies 2 1 2 6 determining the belief degrees assigned to each quantitative or qualitative attribute by the ith level players in this sub step the belief degrees are determined and the belief matrix is formed which is denoted by bd n p i n s l i k i i to perform this for qualitative attributes degrees of belief are estimated considering the players points of view for example in the water allocation problem player 1 assesses the social impact of water allocation scenarios as a qualitative attribute for a water allocation scenario with high adverse impacts on local communities belief degrees could be assigned as follows bad 0 8 average 0 1 good 0 1 for quantitative attributes the estimation of belief degrees is based on qv n p i n q i k i i and s n q i n s i that is explained in fig 2 in this process first of all the values of quantitative attributes are compared to the intervals of the evaluation grades of that attribute corresponding to each decision maker then after it is found that in which range the value locates the belief degrees bd r s t u i are calculated based on the distances of attributes value and the two evaluation grades values at the start and end of the interval when two belief matrices of bd n p i n s n q i k i i and bd n p i n s n l i k i i for quantitative and qualitative attributes are determined they are easily combined based on their third dimension number of attributes to reach the total belief degrees of all attributes bd n p i n s l i k i i 2 1 3 aggregating the belief degrees using the er approach in this step the estimated belief degrees in the previous step are aggregated in cases when there is more than one player on a level group decision making is needed in this paper a group madm method based on er is applied which uses the er analytical algorithm for aggregating the assessments of attributes and also decision makers furthermore in cases where sub attributes exist er is firstly used to aggregate the belief degrees of sub attributes and reach a specific assessment on the higher level attribute by assuming that there is no sub attribute and there are various players in a level this stage contains two sub steps as follows 2 1 3 1 aggregating the belief degrees assigned to different attributes or sub attributes of strategies by the ith level players in this sub step the er analytical algorithm developed by wang et al 2006 is used to aggregate each player s belief degrees on different attributes for each strategy therefore all the belief degrees of one player are aggregated and an overall assessment of that player for each strategy is obtained this process is done through the following three stages 1 calculating the basic probability masses m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 based on the relative weights of attributes and the belief degrees assigned to them bd r s t u i by using the following equations 9 m r s u t i w r t i bd r s t u i 10 m r s h t i 1 u 1 k i m r s u t i 11 m r t i 1 1 w r t i 12 m r s h t i 2 w r t i 1 u 1 k i bd r s t u i where t 1 2 l i u 1 2 k i s 1 2 n s r 1 2 n p i 2 combining the basic probability masses to reach an aggregated basic probability mass by using the following relations 13 k r s i u 1 k i t 1 l i m r s u t i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 k i 1 t 1 l i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 1 14 m r s u i k r s i t 1 l i m r s u t i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 t 1 l i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 15 m r t i 1 k r s i t 1 l i m r t i 1 16 m r t i 2 k r s i t 1 l i m r t i 1 m r s h t i 2 t 1 l i m r t i 1 3 normalizing the results of the previous stage to reach the combined belief degrees on each strategy bd r s u i by using the following relations 17 bd r s u i m r s u i 1 m r t i 1 18 bd r s h i m r t i 2 1 m r t i 1 where bd r s u i is the belief degrees assigned to evaluation grade u by player r in i th level and for sth strategy and bd r s h i is the unassigned belief degree of it this value is nonzero when there is an incomplete assessment in the belief degrees of qualitative attributes 2 1 3 2 aggregating the belief degrees of players in level i assigned to each strategy in this step the analytical er algorithm is used to aggregate the overall assessments of same level players the results of the section 2 1 3 1 for each strategy which results in overall group assessment of those players i th level players in the form of a belief structure to perform this task the relations 9 18 are used with some changes including 1 the weights of attributes w r i are replaced with the weights of players w i 2 belief degrees of different attributes are replaced with belief degrees of different players in that specific level bd r s u i 3 the number of attributes l i is replaced with the number of players np i in eqs 9 16 in other words the assessments of different decision makers are considered as different attributes in this approach the results of this section would be bd s u i and bd s h i which are the matrices of the overall belief degrees and unassigned belief degree of all the i th level players for each strategy correspondingly 2 1 4 calculating the aggregated payoffs of the level i players in this step the aim is to determine the total group payoff of players based on the overall belief degrees bd s u using the following equation when bd s h i is zero complete assessment 19 payoff s i u 1 k i u u i bd s u i in cases when there is an incomplete assessment or bd s h i has a nonzero value this unassigned belief degree is assigned to the first and the last evaluation grade to find the minimum and maximum payoff eqs 20 and 21 the average of these values are considered as the payoff in the game these payoffs are estimated as follows 20 payoff s m i n i u 1 k i u u i bd s u i u 1 i bd s h i 21 payoff s m a x i u 1 k i u u i bd s u i u k i i bd s h i 2 1 5 finding the equilibrium strategy by using the results of section 2 1 4 the payoff of strategies the extensive form of the game is completed in this step the backward induction method is applied to solve the game and to find the subgame perfect equilibrium solution this method is based on breaking the game to some subgames and addressing them in a particular order that is discussed in detail in fig 3 for a bi level game in this figure for the better representation the calculated payoffs of leaders and followers eqs 18 21 are displayed with αjk and βjk which are equivalent to payoff s 1 and payoff s 2 respectively where s is the number of the strategy in which leaders take action j and followers action k a subgame is a subset of any game which includes an initial node decision node and all its successor nodes for every initial node the previous history of the taken actions until that node should be known the length of a decision node is equal to the longest history of that node e g in a bi level game the length of the decision nodes of followers and leaders are equal to 1 and 0 respectively fig 3 indicates how the backward induction method is used to find the equilibrium in the suggested er based leader follower game the basis of backward induction is built on a comparison of possible payoffs from choosing available actions and replacing the different actions of each decision making level from level z to 1 with their best responses the best response is an action that the same level players choose in each decision making node and leads to the most desirable strategy with the highest possible payoff in this method it is assumed that all of the players are rational a rational player chooses the action which leads to a strategy that has the highest payoff so in each decision making node a comparison has been made by players to find the most desirable action the relations and equations of finding the best responses are represented in fig 3 for a bi level game in the first step the subgames of the game should be determined in a bi level game there are two types of subgames level one subgames with the history of one and level two subgames with a history of zero level one subgames are the subgames that should be solved first in the second and third steps level one subgames are solved and the best responses are replaced in the fourth step the level two subgame should be addressed in this step the leaders choose their best action based on a comparison of payoffs if there are z levels of players this process should start from the last level or decision nodes with the length of z 1 then each subgame is solved and the actions of players are replaced with their best responses until the process reaches to subgames with the length of zero or the leaders level sometimes the same level players might be indifferent between choosing two or more actions because of their equal in these situations it is assumed that the probabilities of taking those actions are equal 2 2 er based leader follower game with incomplete information in this section the games with incomplete information are discussed in these games at least one player does not know the other player s payoff completely in this study it is assumed that the source of incompleteness is the leaders lack of information about the weights of followers and that of attributes in other words because the leaders are not confident about the weights of followers they cannot estimate their precise payoffs for choosing each action this situation happens a lot in real world decision making problems as a result the leaders are not sure about the best responses of followers meaning that they would have trouble taking their best action these kinds of situations happen a lot in real decision making problems when a player is not sure about the other players characteristics and cannot make his her decision accurately in this part a procedure based on the monte carlo theory is proposed to handle those situations in a bi level er based leader follower game which is discussed step by step as follows 2 2 1 estimating the interval weights of followers in this step leaders evaluate the weight of followers as interval values 22 w l w 1 l w i l w nf l 23 w u w 1 u w i u w nf u w l set of the lower bounds of weights of followers w u set of the upper bounds of weights of followers w i l the lower bound of weight of i th follower w i u the upper bound of weight of i th follower 2 2 2 finding the possible sets of the followers weights in this step x sets of weights of followers are produced moreover the following constraints should be satisfied for each set 24 i 1 nf w i 1 25 w i l w i w i u these sets of possible weights are produced based on an increment value which is assigned by the user in order to search for weights in the defined weight interval it is assumed that each weight interval is uniformly distributed and the probability of each chosen weight equals to 1 x in which x is the number of possible weights according to the interval length and the increment value for example if the lower and upper limits of one decision maker or attribute are respectively 0 1 and 0 15 with the increment value of 0 01 the proposed algorithm considers 0 1 0 11 0 12 0 13 0 14 and 0 15 as the possible values attributed to weights 2 2 3 estimating a set of possible weights for attributes in this step at first leaders evaluate the attributes weight assigned by each of the followers in the interval form then the possible sets of attributes weights for each of the followers are determined that must satisfy the following constraints 26 r 1 l 2 w r i 1 27 w l r i w r i w u r i where l 2 total number of level 2 or followers evaluation attributes w r i the possible weight of r th attribute for the i th followers w l r i the lowest weight of r th attribute for the i th follower estimated by leaders w u r i the highest weight of r th attribute for the i th follower estimated by leaders y1 y2 ynf sets of possible weights of attributes corresponding to each follower are estimated in this section 2 2 4 calculating the payoffs of possible games different sets of weights lead to various games and payoffs the previous step resulted in x sets of weights for followers and y 1 y 2 ynf sets of attributes weights for the followers 1 to nf therefore there are ng x i 1 nf y i different combinations of weights and their respective games in this stage first the inputs in the steps 2 1 2 1 and 2 1 2 2 weights of followers and their attributes will be updated by each set of weights then the steps 2 1 3 2 to 2 1 4 should be taken and the payoff for each strategy in each set of weights will be estimated 2 2 5 reducing the computational cost in the game theory the value of payoff of a strategy is not significant by itself but its relative value in comparison with payoffs of other strategies is substantial therefore in this step in order to soften the computational cost and to prevent solving all ng games step 2 1 5 which has not been taken yet the payoffs are ranked in ascending order the ranks could be used as payoffs and the total number of games ng decreases to ng which is the total number of different rankings 2 2 6 solving the level one games using the backward induction method for each of the ng types of games the backward induction method step 2 1 5 is applied to determine the best responses of the followers when these best responses are found the best responses of all ng games are easily identified 2 2 7 decision making by leader s in the proposed incomplete game in this section a methodology is proposed in which the leaders can choose their best action by maximizing their expected payoffs firstly by analyzing the best responses in all ng games the probability of taking each action by followers in response to each of the leader s actions are determined then the expected payoff of the leader from each action is estimated considering the probability of each action of followers in response to the action of the leader finally the leader

study area to show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology this lake is located between the provinces of east azerbaijan and west azerbaijan in iran the geographic coordination is equal to 37 06 15 and 38 15 15 north and 45 00 13 and 45 55 20 east fig 4 someday it was the largest lake in the middle east and the largest salt lake in the world but its area has been decreased calamitously due to building dams on the feeding rivers irregular water exploitation for agriculture expansion from both groundwater and streams and decreasing precipitation during the past years as a result desiccation has occurred in large areas of the lakes bed the surface area of the lake has decreased from 6000 km2 in 1997 to 700 km2 in 2013 and once more has risen to 2000 3000 km2 in 2019 because of heavy rainfalls in 2019 in fig 5 the fluctuations of lake urmia surface area are represented this disaster which many call it the most severe human made desertification of the world has brought some terrible consequences that are not limited to the lake itself but also to the whole ecosystem around it the reduction of the lake area has many effects such as the demolition of the food chain e g decreasing the artemia number due to the high salinity of the lake increasing the risk of health problems such as asthma since the desertification allows the dust go far distances quickly by wind in july 2013 because of the continuing desertification urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc started to work on defining the urmia lake restoration program ulrp by order of iran s president ulrnc 2014 the committee is responsible for making proper decisions and implementing the most effective projects to alleviate the situation lots of projects have been defined with different budgets and effectiveness that in many cases have been failed or reached a lower outcome than it was assumed at the beginning the main goal of the ulrp is to reach the estimated ecological elevation of water in lake urmia which is equal to 1274 1 m above the sea this value is approximately 3 m higher than the current elevation two main reasons for these failures are 1 not allocating the budget in a suitable way 2 lack of cooperation between different stakeholders in the next section the proposed methodology is used to assess some restoration scenarios which were suggested by various studies in a study by the regional council of urmia lake basin management rculb 2014 these scenarios have been simulated for ten years and the features of the lake such as the average depth of water the average surface area under each scenario have been estimated these scenarios are called areal restoration scenarios of the lake as they mainly focus on increasing the area of the lake the report of rculb 2014 provides more information about these scenarios the main characteristics of the lake under each scenario in addition to other features are used as the attributes by which the lake is evaluated in the following section the er based leader follower game is used to determine which scenario is more appropriate to be selected regarding the hierarchical structure of the decision making and the decision makers utilities 4 results and discussion this section consists of two main sections 4 1 and 4 2 that represent the results of applying the proposed methodology is explained in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively 4 1 game with complete information game identification in this study the procedure of choosing the best plan to restore lake urmia is considered as a game the real process of this selection is somehow a leader follower game in which the government gov suggests a restoration plan to the plan and budget organization pbo of iran they could accept and allocate the budget to the recommended plan or reject it in this process the department of environment doe plays the role of confirming or rejecting their scenarios by considering the environmental impacts therefore the existing hierarchical decision making system is similar to a bi level leader follower game in which the gov is the leader and the pbo and doe are followers pbo and doe are in level two the level of followers and they can take two actions 1 accept the proposed scenario and allocate fund 2 reject if they reject a plan the status quo of the lake remains gov as a leader has 19 actions which are different lake restoration scenarios table 1 each of which contains hydraulic and hydrologic scenarios the hydrologic scenarios include the projects which have been defined by ulrnc for dealing with the drying up of lake urmia the hydraulic scenarios mainly suggest dividing the lake into two different areas the supporters of these projects believe that the southern part of the lake cannot be recovered as it contains vast areas with high salinity and considerable evaporation rate these scenarios which are the actions of gov are displayed by using a coding system comprising two or three parts the first and second parts are the indicators of hydrologic and hydraulic scenarios in the cases which a third part is displayed it describes the dike s elevation of the hydraulic projects e g the second scenario s1 o3 1275 means this scenario contains hydrologic scenario s1 and hydraulic scenario o3 in which the elevation of the dike is equal to 1275 m above the sea level the hydrologic scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 contain different projects that lead to an increase in the inflow to the lake table 2 describes these scenarios in which it is specified whether the mentioned scenario contains or does not contain each of the hydrological projects for the projects that have been started in the past and they are under implementation now costs have been estimated considering their progress percentage and total cost all the hydraulic scenarios except o1 suggest exclusive patterns for dividing the lake into two smaller lakes and table 3 describes these scenarios in detail it should be mentioned that in the mentioned study two other hydraulic scenarios o4 and o3nt are modeled in these two scenarios not only the lake is divided into two sections but also water from one side of the dike would be pumped into the other side and preserve just one smaller lake those two scenarios are not considered in this paper due to the financial infeasib1ility of pumping an enormous volume of water and their adverse environmental impacts the path on which the dike would be built based on scenarios o2 and o3 is represented in fig 6 in this section at first the 19 restoration plans and their characteristics are explained furthermore by combining the actions of the followers and the leader the strategies are formed according to table 4 determining the weights of the ith level players for the first level since there is just one player gov the weight of that player would be equal to one for the second level the level of followers weights of pbo and doe are respectively considered to be 0 6 and 0 4 these values are estimated based on the opinions of five experts defining the evaluation attributes qualitative or quantitative and their weights assigned them by each player attributes sub attributes type of attributes and their weights assigned by each player are presented in table 5 and discussed in detail in the following 1 average coverage of ecological regions this attribute has been calculated by rculbm based on the average amount of ecologically significant areas which are covered by water in each strategy during a 10 year simulation period these areas have been determined by ulrnc 2014 in lake urmia comprehensive management plan these areas go into three clusters of high moderate and low sensitive ecological regions fig 7 and the value of this attribute is determined by averaging the percentages of the coverage of these three ecological regions with the weights of 0 6 0 3 and 0 3 respectively 2 average coverage of dust pollution source areas this attribute has been estimated by rculbm based on how the dust pollution source areas are covered by water in each strategy the value of this attribute is equal to the average coverage of these areas during a 10 year simulation period these areas are determined by the remote sensing research center rsrc of sharif university of technology 2014 fig 7 represents the location of these areas 3 the average area of the lake with the elevation more than 1274 1 m km2 the value of this attribute for each scenario is equal to the average of areas covered with water and an elevation more than 1274 1 m during a 10 year simulation period this area has been estimated by rculbm 4 average coverage of northern part of the lake km2 the lake is divided into two separate regions northern and southern by the shahid kalantari causeway with a 1400 m opening these parts are represented in fig 6 the water surface area coverage of these two areas is reported independently because they have different importance the coverage of the northern areas of the lake has a higher weight due to its significant importance in terms of ecotourism this value of this attribute is assumed to be its average value during the 10 year simulation period rculbm this value has been estimated by rculbm 5 average coverage of the southern parts of the lake km2 6 consistency with the ecosystem this qualitative attribute is evaluated for each scenario considering the adverse impacts on the ecosystem of lake urmia 7 profitability this qualitative attribute is evaluated for each scenario based on the average of the volume of water during a 10 year simulation period and the required budget for implementing that scenario the estimated cost of each scenario is represented in table 6 defining the evaluation grades and the assigned utilities in this example it is assumed that all the players in both levels have 5 k 1 and k 2 evaluation grades which are defined as follows h h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 and u 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 1 where h1 very poor h2 poor h3 average h4 good h5 very good determining the values of each quantitative attribute designated to each evaluation grade by the player of the ith level in this case study the first two attributes contain quantitative sub attributes therefore an aggregation is needed the estimated values of the quantitative sub attributes are represented in table 7 in the assignment of these values doe gov and pbo have had different points of view for each evaluation grade for example for the a1 attribute and the h1 evaluation grade gov pbo and doe have respectively assigned the values of 20 15 and 25 which means that in the case of average coverage of ecological regions doe is stricter than gov and pbo which is reasonable considering their organizational characteristics finding the value of each quantitative attribute for all strategies in rculbm s study a matlab based physical model has been developed by which scenarios have been evaluated the obtained results for 38 strategies are represented in table 8 the strategies with even numbers s1 s3 s37 are represented in one row because since in all of them the suggested scenario by gov is rejected by pbo and doe and the current condition continues determining the belief degrees assigned to each attribute by the ith level players at first all scenarios are evaluated based on qualitative attributes a3 and a4 the assigned belief degrees to these attributes are represented in tables 9 and 10 from the point of view of gov and pbo and doe respectively then for all independent quantitative attributes which has no sub attributes the belief degrees are formed for each player as an example for the gov a1 attribute and the first five strategies are presented in table 11 aggregating of the belief degrees assigned to different attributes in this step the aggregation operator is applied to both sub attributes and attributes consequently it results in the belief degrees by which the gov pbo and doe evaluate the strategies the results of this section are represented in table 12 aggregating of belief degrees of players in level i assigned to each strategy in this step the aggregation operator is applied to levels with more than one player i e level 2 and the belief degrees of same level players are aggregated the result is a single belief degree for both doe and pbo for each strategy the results are represented in table 13 payoff calculation in this section eqs 19 21 are used to estimate the gained payoff form the obtained belief degrees of the previous step which is represented in table 14 for both levels it should be mentioned that in decision making levels with more than one player this is an er based aggregated payoff of all players in this case the represented payoff of followers is for both doe and pbo using backward induction method to solve the game in this step the hierarchical game is completed and the equilibrium strategy is determined by solving the level one subgames replacing the actions with the best responses and consequently solving level two subgames as it is difficult to display the full game only the first ten actions of the gov and the reactions of followers of the leader follower game is represented in fig 8 the equilibrium strategy is strategy number 9 in which the gov suggests s2 o1 restoration scenario and the pbo and doe accept it and allocate the requested financial resources 4 2 game with incomplete information it is assumed that the gov does not know the weights of pbo and doe and that of their attributes entirely but they can estimate it in an interval form the weights of pbo and doe are estimated as 0 5 0 65 and 0 35 0 5 respectively in addition the estimated weights of attributes are represented in table 15 the increment value of 0 05 is used both for the weights of followers and their attributes that lead to 1254 different combinations of weights or in other words 1254 games sections 2 2 1 2 2 3 the er approach is used to calculate the group payoff of players for all games section 2 2 4 these payoffs are ranked in an ascending format which leads to 243 separately rank orders or types of games section 2 2 5 this approach significantly reduces the computational cost for each of these 243 types of games the backward induction method section 2 2 6 is implemented to find the best responses and the probability of the actions being taken by the followers finally the expected payoffs are calculated and the equilibrium solution is determined section 2 2 7 which are represented in fig 9 it should be mentioned that the incomplete game also provides the scenario s2 o1 as the best action of leaders and the response of followers to the selected action is 100 accept 0 reject which means that in all 243 types of games the followers accept the s2 o1 action chosen by the leader the scenario s2 o1 is selected as an equilibrium strategy in both complete and incomplete games but the accept has the probability equal to 100 in the incomplete game meaning that this scenario can completely satisfy the leader as well as followers the response of followers to that action is not sensitive to the considered intervals of weights and the expected payoff in the incomplete game is equal to that of the complete one 5 summary and conclusions in this paper a new methodology has been presented for modeling the hierarchical decision making problems as extensive games and solving them by using the leader follower game and er approach the suggested method is provided with the capability of dealing with numerous players at each level different levels of decision making and various kinds of uncertainty the application of this method has been tested on lake urmia restoration scenario selection which is a multi level and multi player decision making problem with a considered amount of complexity the process mentioned above was used and the equilibrium strategy as a result was the strategy of number 9 which means gov suggests the scenario s2 o1 and consequently the doe and pbo accept and allocate the needed budget to it scenario s2 o1 does not alter the major hydraulic characteristics of the lake since it only contains hydrological projects which are a 40 reduction in agricultural sector water demand and water release from nezam abad dam this result indicates the reliability of the modeled game and the proposed methodology because of the following reasons 1 not containing any hydraulic projects with unknown effects 2 not containing highly priced projects like inter basin water transfer 3 concentrating on demand management which has a high performance and it is assumed as one of the most effective solutions for water deficiency 4 releasing water from the nezam abad dam increases the inflow of the zarrinerud river to the lake that has a very significant effect on the volume of water that the lake contains ulrnc has concentrated on agricultural demand management projects such as reducing the water loss in the conveyance networks and changing the crop pattern to low water consuming crops which are economically beneficial like medicinal plants the reasons which contributed to reaching this reasonable strategy are 1 the ability of the method to consider different levels of decision makers using the stackelberg game which provides more efficiency in comparison with conventional group mcdm methods 2 the ability of the model to separately consider any attribute that seems essential to each decision maker with no limitation in terms of being qualitative or quantitative in the second section of the methodology section a new monte carlo based approach was applied which facilitates the process of action selection of the leader in the extensive games when the leader who has incomplete information it was applied to lake urmia and resulted in s2 o1 selection by the leader and 100 of games accept 0 of games reject by followers it should be noted that the primary goal of this study was to propose a new decision making methodology with the aforementioned capabilities and then apply it to one of the most threatened lakes of iran lake urmia which needs national and international attention to survive in future studies social and stakeholder analysis for a better understanding of the behaviors of stakeholders their interactions and weights could be proper topics to be considered in addition in this paper it is also assumed that the agents players are rational and each agent wants to increase his payoff however perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for decision making in future works the proposed methodology should be extended to consider agents with bounded rationality moreover the proposed methodology is suitable for the hierarchical decision making processes in which the actions of players are limited extending the current methodology to consider both continuous and discrete actions could be a proper topic for future researches credit authorship contribution statement

5059,karst springs are the exclusive source of water during dry months for many mediterranean regions the impact of climate change on the hydrology of mediterranean karst springs has not received proper attention in the scientific literature specifically the effect of climate change on the drought characteristics of karst springs has not been studied here the response to climate change of three mediterranean karst springs with different retention times is examined focusing on the frequency duration and intensity of their drought events the karst swat model is used to quantify the karst springs flow a set of representative climate change scenarios are used to assess the climate change impact on the springs and surface flow for the period 2019 2098 a non parametric drought index is modified to estimate the future meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics in comparison to the reference period the most adverse effects of climate change on the three karst springs are expected to prevail after 2059 depending on the spring the mean annual karst flow decreases from 14 2 to 25 1 the mean number of drought events ranges from a decrease of 8 1 to an increase of 77 5 the duration of drought events increases from 36 8 to 533 and the mean monthly water deficit increases from 27 3 to 83 6 when comparing the period 2059 2098 to the reference period 1979 2018 as the water retention time of the spring increases the duration and intensity of the droughts are likely to increase more significantly after 2059 multi year droughts are forecast for all springs under all scenarios both low and high flows will increase with the former occupying even wet months the results of this study can be used as a guide for local and regional authorities and water management organizations to adapt their practices for the mitigation of the impact of climate change on the water resources of mediterranean karst springs keywords drought index karst springs mediterranean region karst swat climate change semi arid climate 1 introduction karst regions describe landscapes containing caves and extensive groundwater systems developed on soluble rocks limestone marble and gypsum karst terrains have distinctive hydrology which stems from a combination of high rock solubility and well developed fractured porosity usual geomorphic features in these areas are sinking streams caves enclosed depressions and large springs karst landscapes occupy approximately 20 of the planet s dry ice free land and offer the partial or entire drinking supply of about one fourth of the global population ford and williams 2007 the mediterranean basin has been characterized as the cradle of karst studies since ancient times ford and williams 2007 pfeiffer 1963 identified five eras in the development of concepts about karst groundwaters in the area beginning from 600 to 400 bc it is estimated that at least 15 of the surface of the mediterranean catchment area as defined in nikolaidis et al 2014 and bakalowicz 2015 is covered by carbonate outcrops and that karst aquifers supply at least 25 of domestic water supply without taking industry agricultural and tourism withdrawals under consideration bakalowicz 2015 margat 1998 seventy five percent of the total mediterranean agricultural land is irrigated and it accounts for more than 60 of the total water abstractions e g spain 64 greece 88 portugal 80 wriedt et al 2009 the mediterranean region is identified as a prominent climate change hotspot based on the future mean precipitation and surface air temperature change diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 giorgi 2006 future droughts are expected to greatly influence the mediterranean region dubrovský et al 2014 according to literature droughts can be categorized as meteorological hydrological and agricultural wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological droughts refer to decrease in precipitation hydrological droughts to deficit in surface water and agricultural droughts to drop in soil moisture orlowsky and seneviratne 2012 found enhanced dryness meteorological drought on the annual time scale in the mediterranean using the cmip3 models lu et al 2019 recently found statistically significant annual drying over the mediterranean region agricultural drought with stronger drying as the strength of forcing increases using the cmip5 models large scale hydrological drought studies do not take under consideration the effects of nonlinearity in smaller scales which is a result of specific hydrological systems as in the case of karst aquifers therefore many catchments do not have a tight hydrological budget and a rainfall runoff response e g hartmann et al 2014a hartmann et al 2014b an extensive bibliography of climate change assessment studies on several mediterranean regions exists these studies however focus on non karstic regions and the climate change impact research for karst watersheds mediterranean or other is limited for example hartmann et al 2012 used a multi model approach to assess future water availability at a large eastern mediterranean karst spring in palestinian authority and suggested that in the remote future 2068 2098 when variability of climate change decreases a decrease of water availability of 15 to 30 is forecast smiatek et al 2013 used four dynamically downscaled and highly resolved spatially climate change datasets and predicted a decrease in discharge intensity in the range of 9 to 30 for the figeh karst spring in syria during the middle and end of the century another example is the study of nerantzaki et al 2019 who used a combination of models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to estimate the future hydrological budget of karst dominated crete and found an average decrease of 16 5 for spring flow after 2060 finally fiorillo 2009 fiorillo and guadagno 2012 and de vita et al 2012 studied the karst system in the campania region southern italy and proposed methodologies aiming to forecast droughts and the variability of groundwater flow this gap in literature needs to be filled considering that water needs in the arid and semi arid regions of the mediterranean are exclusively covered by karst springs and groundwater resources during the summer months when there is no surface runoff several questions arise for mediterranean karst watersheds such as whether climate change scenarios predictions suggest satisfactory available water supplies and how these water amounts are going to be distributed over the future years under hydrological droughts it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of karst springs estimate the present and future response for these regions and plan water resources management accordingly the first step for reliable predictions of both surface and karst flow is the robust hydrological modeling of the watershed of interest the soil and water assessment tool swat has been extensively used for the simulation of surface runoff for a variety of watersheds krysanova and white 2015 francesconi et al 2016 ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 the swat model has been modified to account for the karst springs flow by adding a karst flow assessment tool and the karst swat model nikolaidis et al 2013 was developed for watersheds dominated by karst sinkholes and spring flow this karst component has been developed over the past 15 years using high frequency data and geomorphologic analysis of the koiliaris rb moraetis et al 2010 nikolaidis et al 2013 it has been implemented for the karst watershed of koiliaris located in chania crete for the hydrological and geochemical modeling of the composite surface and karst flow nikolaidis et al 2013 as well as for the simulation of sediment transport through the karst springs nerantzaki et al 2015 it was then scaled up for the hydrological modeling of the whole island of crete malagò et al 2016 proving the capability of the model to simulate the flow of the cretan karst system nerantzaki et al 2019 used it for the assessment of the effect of climate change on the hydrological budget of crete and nerantzaki et al 2020 used it for the estimation of the projected average available water quantity and its uncertainties in the koiliaris river basin the karst swat model has shown good performance in simulating the karst flow originating from the characteristic mediterranean formations of crete and was therefore selected to simulate the karst flow in this study in an attempt to assess the future variability of the mediterranean karst springs flow along with the effect of drought on their water reserve we focus on three mediterranean karst springs located in chania crete i e stilos agia and meskla springs with different hydrological responses we aim to 1 estimate the impact of climate change on the future water availability 2 compare the frequency duration and intensity of meteorological and hydrological drought events in future periods with the ones of the reference period 1979 2018 and 3 examine the frequency of extreme flows high and low in the reference and future periods the efficiency of a meteorological index a tool to define the frequency and severity of meteorological drought events to describe hydrological droughts of springs is also examined the swat and karst swat models are used to simulate both the surface and the karst runoff with emphasis on the latter a combination of eleven climate change scenarios are used to drive the hydrological models the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 is employed on the time series of both precipitation and karst flow for the determination of the frequency duration and intensity of meteorological and hydrological droughts of the reference period respectively the drought indicator of sdat is modified to facilitate the comparison between future and reference drought characteristics future distributions of low flows are compared to the reference period and the mean excess function mef nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 is used for the analysis of the upper distribution tails of rainfall and flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the broad karst system of the lefka ori mountain range located in the prefecture of chania in western crete greece defines the regional hydrology fig 1 the system is discharged in major karst springs on the north and submarine springs of lower capacity on the south the karst geological formation is characterized by a high infiltration and the groundwater route enriches the underground reservoirs the watersheds under study include three major karst springs which are the main contributors of water for the region of chania i e the stilos koiliaris river basin agia and meskla springs keritis river basin stilos and agia provide 40 of the total discharges in the northern part nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 the catchments under study are the koiliaris river basin and the keritis river basin fig 1 the main geologic formations in the region are plattenkalk limestones trypali units phyllites quartzites marls and marly limestones and alluvial deposits fig 1 as far as stratigraphy from the lower to the upper nappes is concerned the plattenkalk limestones are the deepest rocks geologic age from upper triassic to upper eocene followed by the trypali nappe which is highly karstified late triassic early jurassic on the top of the trypali nappe there are western crete phyllites quartzites paleozoic finally there are neogene deposits at the lower elevations of the basin marls and marly limestones middle to upper miocene and post alpine sediments alluvial deposits of the last 12 thousand years found near the river corridor papanikolaou and vassilakis 2010 the koiliaris river basin koiliaris rb is a critical zone observatory guo and lin 2016 information on the critical zone network are available at https www czen org the watershed is about 130 km2 and includes two episodic streams keramianos and anavreti and the karst spring of stilos which provides permanent flows throughout the year the spring of stilos is a system of springs sharing the same karst system the stilos spring combined with the intermittent flow of keramianos and anavreti form the koiliaris river stilos is fed from the karst regions inside the basin but also from an area located outside of the watershed fig 1 moraetis et al 2010 nikolaidis et al 2013 the karst which extends outside the watershed has highly karstified epikarst while the rest of the study region has finite infiltration favouring surface runoff yu et al 2019 used a coupled surface subsurface model to simulate the hydrology of the koiliaris rb and accurately assess the flooding status of the area based on their results when the rain intensity exceeds the infiltration rate of the karst faults of high hydraulic conductivity cause abrupt flooding when precipitation is distributed over many days the karst displays more effective infiltration on the contrary the more intense events lower the infiltration capacity and increase abrupt floods the hydrological response of the basin is fast and during extreme events 70 of the precipitation becomes surface runoff creating significant floods lilli et al 2020a b the conceptualization of a two reservoir well mixed karst system in the area has been confirmed by the geomorphologic and tidal analysis conducted in lilli et al 2020b this conceptualization is natural since the karst system of lefka ori consists of two different geotectonic units a the plattenkalk limestones and b the limestones of trypali the plattenkalk limestones is the base rock on which the trypali nappe lies the latter being highly karstified the trypali limestones hence have a very fast discharge while the plattenkalk limestones have a slower one the stilos spring displays a relatively fast response with a retention time equal to 15 days and a slower response with a retention time of 100 days the retention time of each spring has been computed in nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 based on the observed karst flow recession curve and the maillet model as described in bonacci 1993 the recession coefficients are initially calculated and the inverse of these coefficients represent the hydraulic residence time of the discharged water for each reservoir ford and williams 2007 have provided a detailed review of the application of recession curves to karst aquifers based on experiments conducted by the institute of geological and metallurgical research unpublished study tracer experiments in geologic settings such as these of stilos karst and agia karst in order to delineate the karst area and define the retention times are not effective as there is high degree of dilution due to the large volume of the discharge water and the permanent volume nikolaidis et al 2013 the average annual karst discharge of the spring is about 120 million cubic meters per year hm3 yr based on the drought resistance indicator for karst aquifers drika orehova 2004 which categorizes karst aquifers into four classes of drought resistance from weak to high the stilos spring belongs to the class of moderate drought resistance drika equal to 0 44 altitudes in the watershed range from 0 to 2120 m above mean sea level a m s l rangeland covers 58 of the total area while cultivated areas forests urban areas and aquatic areas account for 29 4 8 5 2 8 and 0 6 respectively the keritis river basin comprises two river basins the therissos river basin 60 km2 and the keritis river basin 210 km2 the main river of the therissos rb is the intermittent kladissos river the keritis river basin includes the springs of agia and meskla which together with the intermittent surface runoff form the keritis river the impermeable formation of phyllites quartzites in the watershed efficiently concentrates the precipitation and forms the intermittent runoff as in the case of stilos agia consists of a set of springs which share the same karst system the springs of agia and meskla are fed by karst regions within the watershed the underground system of the watershed is more complex as the underground reservoir of meskla connects with the one of agia and transfers part of the stored water the meskla spring has a relatively fast response with retention time of 50 days and a slow response of 833 days 2 28 years the agia spring has a fast response of 5 days and a significant slow response of 2500 days 6 84 years the retention times of keritis rb have also been estimated in nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 using the karst flow recession curve as in the case of stilos the mean annual flow of the agia spring is 69 hm3 yr and the mean annual flow of the meskla spring is 30 hm3 yr based on the drought resistance indicator for karst aquifers drika orehova 2004 the meskla spring belongs to the class of good drought resistance drika equal to 0 55 and the agia spring has high drought resistance drika equal to 0 85 altitudes in the basin range from 0 to 2100 m above mean sea level a m s l rangeland covers 45 of the total area while cultivated areas olives forests and urban areas account for 23 6 17 7 11 3 and 2 1 respectively precipitation data in the area are available from seven stations i e psichro samonas kalives askifou mouri alikianos and agrokipio fig 1 psichro and samonas also measure minimum and maximum temperature meteorological data are available for the period 1973 2018 on a daily time step monthly spring flow data are available for the agia spring for the period 1978 1985 and for the meskla spring for the period 1978 2005 the mean annual water needs covered by the spring of agia are about 26 7 hm3 yr and the mean annual water needs covered by the spring of meskla are about 5 hm3 yr decentralized administration of crete 2018 water is withdrawn from the agia spring by stakeholders i e water companies and agricultural organizations upgradient from the spring using a network of wells decentralized administration of crete 2018 during summer months when withdrawals are intensified the spring has limited to no outflow due to pumping the spring though can still meet the water needs of the area therefore since the comparison between water demand and availability of spring outflow based on the model is not feasible on monthly and daily scales especially during the summer months the water demand is provided here on annual scale and is later in the manuscript compared to the total annual spring water outflow to evaluate whether the spring will be able to cover water demand in the future there are also two hydrometric stations measuring daily surface runoff along the keramianos river 2013 2017 and one hydrometric station at the koiliaris river basin exit measuring the combination of surface and karst flow daily flow for the period 2004 2018 finally the hydrometric station at the keritis river basin exit measures the total flow both springs and surface runoff of the keritis river daily time step 2014 2015 2 2 climate change scenarios a sub set of representative simulations is selected from the high resolution 12 5 km regional climate model rcm ensemble the euro cordex jacob et al 2014 eur 11 for a range of potential future climate scenarios the rcms downscale the general circulation models gcms conducted within the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and three representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2007 the three rcps are the favorable rcp2 6 peaking radiative forcing within the 21st century at 3 0 w m2 and declining afterwards the intermediate rcp4 5 stabilization of radiative forcing after the 21st century at 4 5 w m2 and the adverse rcp8 5 rising radiative forcing crossing 8 5 w m2 at the end of 21st century based on three criteria i e range of gcms variety in model genealogy and range of climate change signals five eur 11 models were selected the methodology of mendlik and gobiet 2016 in combination with these criteria led to the selection of a set of models which were also used in nerantzaki et al 2019 for the assessment of the climate change impact on the hydrological budget of crete island the selected rcms are presented in table s1 of the supplementary material section the simulated rcm rainfall and temperature data for each rcp have been adjusted for biases against the thirty year period 1981 2010 the quantile mapping methodology multi segment statistical bias correction msbc was used grillakis et al 2013 from the eleven rcms of the ensemble we depict some of the results focusing on the mpi esm lr r1 csc remo hereafter remo the specific model is selected as it incorporates the highest rcp2 6 and the lowest rcp8 5 rainfall projection means among the eleven models and is thus considered as representative of the ensemble rainfall range in addition compared to the rest of the models remo shows the most satisfactory scores when tested against the observed droughts of the reference period sub section 3 1 the projected period 2019 2098 is also divided into two non overlapping segments i e the intervals 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 for the assessment of climate change projections by using this segmentation we acquire three periods of equal duration with a satisfactory sample size of 40 years so that we can perform comparative analysis in regards to the reference period 1979 2018 2 3 the karst swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a widely used deterministic river basin or watershed scale distributed hydrological model which runs on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2009 swat is used for the assessment of the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater as well as the prediction of the impacts of land use land management practices and climate change on the hydrological and geochemical cycle of the watershed gassman et al 2007 the watershed is partitioned into sub basins defined by the tributaries the sub basins are further divided into hydrologic response units hrus which are areas containing the same unique combination of soil type land use and slope value within the watershed the land use types for the koiliaris and keritis rbs are obtained by the corine land use 2000 version 20 büttner et al 2004 the soil categories are determined using the european soil database v2 raster library 1kmx1km and the slopes are derived from a digital elevation model with 25 m pixel size bashfield and keim 2011 acquired from pan european elevation data at 1 arc second eu dem 2013 after the swat model simulates the surface hydrological processes snow accumulation and melt surface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration to shallow groundwater the water of the karst hrus which enters the root zone is directed to the deep aquifer this is achieved by calibrating the swat model to allow the water from the root zone to recharge the deep aquifer the parameter deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp is set equal to 1 for the karst hrus thus the deep aquifer recharge da rchg is generated the deep aquifer recharge is aggregated on a daily time step and comprises the input to the two reservoir karst model see nikolaidis et al 2013 for the full description the swat and karst swat combination has already been used in the koiliaris rb and in the current study it is also applied to the keritis rb the equations used in the karst swat setup for the three springs are presented in the supplementary material section eqs s1 to s13 2 4 methods used for the analysis of the results 2 4 1 hydrological models calibration and goodness of fit the calibration of the karst flow of the stilos spring is accomplished indirectly since there is no gauging station recording solely spring flow data for stilos instead we initially calibrate the surface flow at the keramianos river at the gorge exit fig 1 and then alter the swat parameters for the rest of the sub basins in a similar manner in order to acquire an estimate of the surface flow finally we adjust the four parameters of the karst swat based on the retention times of nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 aiming to generate the best possible calibration of the total flow karst flow plus surface flow at the basin exit the calibration procedure followed for the keritis river basin is different the available monthly data of the agia and meksla flow are utilized for the calibration of the karst flow for each spring the swat parameters for the surface flow in the keritis rb are then adjusted to attain a satisfactory calibration for the total flow at the keritis basin exit every calibration stage for both basins is tested using the statistical indices proposed by moriasi et al 2007 for watershed simulations specifically we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr the streamflow model simulation is judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 2 4 2 drought indices the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 is used for deriving nonparametric standardized drought indices for rainfall to quantify the level of agreement between the climate change models and the rainfall observations the index is applied on the time series of both the observed rainfall and the climate change scenarios rainfall over the reference period used for downscaling 1981 2010 in this framework instead of the gamma or any other parametric distribution function the marginal probability of precipitation and flow is derived using the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the sample size i denotes the increasing rank of non zero precipitation data and p x i is the corresponding empirical probability the outputs of eq 1 can be transformed into a standardized drought index sdi as in 2 si ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function and p is probability derived from eq 1 we employ the index for an accumulation period of 6 months which is commonly used for reduced streamflow and reservoir storage according to mckee et al 1993 three severity classes are defined for index values lower than 1 the drought is characterized as moderate for values lower than 1 5 the drought is severe and for values lower than 2 the drought is extreme a six month period with an sdi value below these thresholds is considered as a 6 month drought when n consecutive values lower than the above mentioned thresholds exist the drought duration d is considered to be equal to 6 n 1 months intensity is defined as the average monthly departure from the climatological mean during the drought event ukkola et al 2018 and is expressed as 3 i x m x m d m i j where x is the monthly value x the corresponding monthly mean i is the drought start month and j the end month the duration and intensity can be calculated separately for each drought event and severity class initially we use the sdat and the relative difference rd to quantify the level of agreement between the rainfall of the climate change models and the observed rainfall in terms of drought frequency duration and intensity for the 1981 2010 period according to ukkola et al 2018 the relative difference is defined as 4 r d x model x obs x obs 100 where x model is the mean value mean frequency mean duration and mean monthly intensity for an individual climate change model and x obs is the corresponding mean value for the observations during the period 1981 2010 the level of agreement is high for r d 10 medium for 10 r d 20 and low for r d 20 the next step is to examine the droughts over the whole period of 1979 2098 and compare the drought characteristics i e frequency intensity and duration of the future sub periods 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 with the ones of the reference period 1979 2018 in this study we modify the drought index in a way which facilitates this comparison previous assessments of drought indices examine each drought event of the time series based on the climatological mean of the whole time series however it is more substantial to investigate the relevant change of the future droughts in relation to the reference period alone to achieve this in the version proposed here a the 6 month moving average of rainfall or karst flow of the reference period 1979 2018 is subtracted from the 6 month moving average of the mean monthly rainfall or karst flow of the reference period b the time series of these differences is standardized using eq 2 c every successive 6 month average value in the reference and the future periods is associated with a standard score or z score based on the normal distribution we acquired in step b we then apply the modified index on the rainfall and karst flow for each climate change scenario over the 1979 2098 period essentially the difference between the index proposed here and other indices is that the z scores are not based on the entire time series under study but they are estimated based on the reference period time series 2 4 3 analysis of low and high flows we consider the 10th percentile lowest 10 of ranked values of the daily karst flows distribution of each one of the three springs during the reference period as low flows we examine a the low flows probability of occurrence in each month during the reference and future periods according to selected climate change scenarios remo under rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 b the way the 10th percentile changes in the future periods and c whether the springs dry up in the future for the high surface and karst flows as well as rainfall we perform an analysis on the upper part of the distributions of these variables the upper part of a distribution or the right tail describes the magnitude and frequency of extreme events heavy tailed distributions sub exponential characterize distributions with tails heavier than the exponential tail this means that they present many outliers and frequent extreme events light tailed distributions are those with similar exponential or thinner tails hyper exponential than the exponential distribution and they have less frequent extreme events for the analysis of high flows and rainfall we use the mean excess function nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 on the upper 10 of the flows and rainfall distributions the mean excess function is a method for tail identification which discriminates between sub exponential distributions and light tailed or exponential distributions for a random variable x with distribution function f x the mean excess function mef is 5 e x p e x x p x x p 1 f x x p x p x x p f x x d x x p 0 where x p f x 1 p is the lower threshold value for probability p f x 1 p is the quantile function and f x 1 f x is the probability of exceedance a property of e x p is that it is constant for distributions with exponential tails memoryless property of the exponential distribution therefore if the empirical value of e x p vs x p has a slope equal to zero the graph indicates an exponential tail if the plot slope is greater than zero the graph suggests sub exponential tails as the mef tends to infinity for such tails nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 constructed the 90 confidence interval ci of mef slopes resulting from the exponential tail fig s1 supplementary material this graph facilitates the classification of tails based on their mef slope value and the sample size specifically slope values higher than the ci limits signify sub exponential tails slope values inside the ci limits indicate exponential tails and values lower than the ci limits suggest hyper exponential tails the mef function is applied on the time series of interest i e rainfall karst and surface flow of the periods 1979 2018 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 separately for the rcm remo to investigate the progress of their distribution tails in the future under different rcps 3 results 3 1 evaluation of hydrological and climate change models the fit between observed and modeled values is presented in fig 2 the goodness of fit of the agia spring flow fig 2a based on the monthly observed values is characterized by unsatisfactory nse and rsr indices 0 32 and 0 82 respectively but is also characterized by a satisfactory pbias index 0 5 and the model manages to capture the mean monthly flow of the agia spring modeled monthly flow equal to 2 22 m3 s and observed monthly flow equal to 2 21 m3 s generally the calibration succeeds in portraying the spring trend and periodicity but the nse and rsr are unsatisfactory due to the limited observational data since only 84 observations were available also reported in mccuen et al 2006 the meskla modeled karst flow compared to the observed flow fig 2b has very good performance with nse equal to 0 84 pbias equal to 5 0 and rsr equal to 0 40 when the meskla flow is combined with the agia flow and the surface flow adjusted in the swat model the model performance is very good for the daily total flow at the keritis rb exit fig 2c nse 0 80 pbias 4 9 rsr 0 44 the performance of the model for the total flow at the koiliaris rb is also good fig 2d with very good pbias 0 2 and good nse 0 67 and rsr 0 57 we should note that for the case of the koiliaris rb the peak flows are overestimated by the model fig 2d this overestimation occurs due to the authors choice to focus on the good simulation of low flows since this is mainly a drought analysis study indeed the low flows are described well by the model see fig s2 supplementary material and corresponding performance indices of low flows the high flows peak flows over 20 m3 s are a result of 3 4 flash floods during each year and are generated by surface runoff moraetis et al 2010 the drought analysis is implemented on a monthly scale and these flow peaks are responsible for only about 6 on average of the total mean monthly flow contribution of about 10 on annual level therefore the authors judged that the overestimation has low effect on the drought analysis which is the main focus of the manuscript we analyze the drought events of the downscaled rainfall time series of psichro against the ones of the observed time series using the sdat all rainfall stations were examined using the sdat for the reference period and the results of the index did not vary significantly supplementary material table s2 fig 3 shows the agreement relative difference rd between the observed rainfall time series and the downscaled rainfall time series see section 2 2 in terms of mean frequency duration and monthly intensity of droughts the downscaled time series agree well with the observations for the mean duration for all drought intensities and scenarios for the mean frequency for most scenarios and for the mean monthly intensity for the extreme droughts the remo scenario is chosen to demonstrate the results of the high and low flow analysis since it is run under all rcps 2 6 4 5 8 5 and displays more satisfactory scores compared to the only other scenario which also runs under the three rcps i e rca specifically the remo performs better or equally well compared to the rca scenario based on the relative difference defined in section 2 4 2 in terms of mean frequency duration and intensity under all drought intensity categories 3 2 impact of climate change on the annual and monthly rainfall and flow the graphical depiction of the monthly rainfall karst and surface flow quartiles of the two basins for the reference period 1979 2018 is presented in the box plots of fig 4 the mean annual rainfall values of each watershed are estimated as the area weighted average of rainfall which falls over each sub basin since each sub basin receives rainfall input from the rainfall station which is closest to it the precipitation of koiliaris rb has higher values compared to keritis rb as a great percentage of its area lies over higher altitudes and the extended karst area is also taken into account the stilos spring has higher flows during winter months compared to the agia spring but presents high monthly variability the monthly variability of the agia spring however is low as a result of its high retention time the meskla spring demonstrates lower variability compared to stilos spring but the spring s flow is very close to zero during dry months the mean annual values of rainfall karst and surface flow for both basins for the reference period 1979 2018 and for the two future periods 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 under the eleven scenarios are presented in table 1 the percentages of change relative to the reference period values are also presented in table 1 as far as the period 2019 2058 is concerned the eleven scenarios suggest a mean increase in rainfall equal to 2 4 in koiliaris and 3 6 in keritis rb respectively this increase induces a greater mean increase in surface flow for the koiliaris river basin 16 9 and an even greater increase in the surface flow of the keritis river basin 28 1 in addition it is noteworthy that the mean increase in rainfall does not signify increase in karst flow on the contrary the karst flow decreases especially for the case of stilos spring 9 9 the meskla spring and agia spring flows are not expected to change significantly during the 2019 2058 period decrease of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively the greater increase in surface flow compared to the increase in rainfall can be explained by the frequency and intensity of daily rainfall in the future periods the distribution of rainfall changes in the future having higher probabilities of high daily rainfall and lower probabilities of low daily rainfall section 3 4 fig 9 and tables 5 and s3 the high intensity rainfall favors the formation of surface flow at the expense of karst flow since the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate into the groundwater this also explains the decrease in karst flow these results are in agreement with the findings of yu et al 2019 after 2059 the mean annual rainfall decreases for both basins 9 0 and 6 5 and induces a significant decrease in the mean annual karst flow of stilos spring 25 1 and an important but milder decrease in the mean annual karst flows of meskla and agia springs 18 7 and 14 2 respectively the decrease is more prominent for stilos spring compared to the meskla and agia springs which respond better to adverse climate change due to their higher retention times hence their more efficient water storage furthermore the rainfall decrease in the keritis rb is milder compared to the one in koiliaris rb which partially explains the difference between the relative change of stilos and meskla springs the mean annual surface flow is relatively stable for the koilaris rb 0 4 and a relative increase is forecast for the mean annual surface flow of the keritis rb 8 0 again due to the increase of extreme daily rainfall see section 3 4 the mean annual karst flow values for the three springs during the reference and future period 1979 2098 along with the 90 confidence interval ci of the eleven scenarios under study during the future period 2019 2098 are presented in fig 5 although the 90 ci is wide the descending trend of the mean is evident for the three springs after 2059 the mean annual flow of the agia spring fig 5a is equal to the min of the reference period about 34 hm3 yr however the spring is expected to be able to cover the current water needs even for the worst case scenario min annual value equal to 30 1 hm3 yr and mean annual water needs equal to 26 7 hm3 yr the same stands for the meskla spring fig 5b for which the mean annual water needs are 5 hm3 yr the stilos spring fig 5c is the most vulnerable spring with the most adverse relative decrease as a result of the lower water retention time as it is evident from the mean annual forecasts of the above mentioned variables climate change has an adverse impact on karst water resources after 2059 in order to depict the distribution of monthly karst flow for the three karst springs based on all eleven scenarios the box plots of the monthly quartiles taking into account the monthly karst flow values of all the scenarios for the period 2059 2098 are depicted in fig 6 the monthly water volume from the agia spring never falls under 1 9 hm3 mo while the minimum monthly volumes of the meskla spring and the stilos spring are 0 0947 hm3 mo and 0 0201 hm3 mo respectively it is notable that the meskla and stilos springs are expected to approach monthly values close to zero for all months including the wettest months during the reference period fig 4 this happens only for the dry months especially for the case of the stilos spring 3 3 impact of climate change on the meteorological and hydrological drought frequency intensity and duration we apply the modified drought index on the rainfall and karst flow of the three springs under study we choose the psichro station for the analysis of the meteorological drought since it is the only station which is used as input for both basins fig 7 depicts the mean number of drought events for a rainfall and b stilos spring flow which occur during the reference period 1979 2018 and the two future periods 2019 2058 2059 2098 under the i rcp2 6 ii rcp4 5 and iii rcp8 5 scenarios and fig 8 is the same figure for the case of a meskla spring flow and b agia spring flow the first deduction from fig 7 is that even for the favorable scenario rcp2 6 the meteorological drought index indicates more adverse conditions drought wise specifically for the frequency of severe and extreme droughts the increased number of future meteorological droughts compared to the reference period droughts is obvious for scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the frequency of the hydrological droughts of stilos spring appear to mainly follow the trend of the frequency of the meteorological droughts during the reference period the frequency of stilos hydrological droughts is lower than the meteorological droughts however during the future periods the number of occurring hydrological droughts is as high as the meteorological droughts or even higher even though the spring of meskla fig 8a has the same number of drought events with the stilos spring during the reference period the increase of the meskla drought events in the future is milder the frequency of the hydrological drought events of the agia spring is low compared to the other two springs in addition in many cases the trend of the hydrological drought index of agia does not conform to the trend of the meteorological drought we should note that the cases where the extreme events outnumber the severe to extreme events or the moderate to extreme events for the same period occur when a drought has a very long duration and breaks into multiple droughts when the index takes lower values see for example fig s3 supplementary material table 2 presents the duration of the drought events characterized as moderate to extreme i e the duration of events for which the modified meteorological or hydrological drought index is equal to or lower than 1 the values are in the form of ranges since more than one rcm has been studied for each rcp the index suggests that the meteorological droughts are expected to have a maximum duration of 15 months in the future the maximum duration of a future hydrological drought is 97 months for the stilos spring 54 months for the meskla spring and 480 months for the agia spring flow under rcp8 5 during the period 2059 2098 the duration of the drought event is the highest for the spring with the highest retention time and can last for as long as 40 years the whole period under study for the case of agia it is important to note that for all springs multi year droughts are forecast in the future under most scenarios even for the favorable rcp2 6 while the longest hydrological drought lasts 14 12 and 21 months for stilos meskla and agia respectively the combination of the high frequency and duration of drought events in the future for the stilos spring suggests that it is the most vulnerable spring to the adverse climate change impact the meskla spring which has similar drought duration and frequency during the reference period responds slightly better to climate change essentially we cannot compare the response of the stilos spring to drought with the response of the meksla spring based on the retention time the two springs have systems which are different in both complexity the reservoir of meskla provides water to the agia reservoir below and magnitude the stilos mean annual discharge is 4 times higher than the meskla mean annual discharge the agia spring demonstrates very long periods of drought in the future the frequency of the agia drought events is lower after 2059 compared to the reference period fig 8b because essentially the whole period of 2059 2098 tends to become a single drought period for this spring under the rcp8 5 this increase in drought duration can be justified by the existence of many short meteorological droughts during the future period these individual meteorological droughts which occur successively accumulate over the long water retention time of agia and are expressed as a long drought period by the spring fig s3 supplementary material depicts the 6 month modified drought index applied on the time series of rainfall psichro and the karst flow of agia under an adverse scenario remo under the rcp8 5 for the period 1979 2098 the figure shows the effect of the meteorological droughts on the hydrological droughts of agia after september 2073 there are many extreme meteorological droughts which cause a single extreme hydrological drought lasting until 2098 the trend of the 6 month meteorological drought index does not comply with the trend of the 6 month hydrological drought index for agia the trend of the 82 month moving average of the monthly rainfall time series though follows the trend of the hydrological drought index and explains the long drought periods of agia the reason behind the choice of the 82 month moving average is that 82 months or 6 84 years equal the water retention time of agia for the quantification of the water deficit or intensity of drought during each drought event we compare the total water volume during the drought event to the mean of the total water volume during the corresponding months of the reference period as in equation 3 table 3 we calculate both the mean total water deficit during all drought events of each sub period and the mean monthly water deficit based on all drought events of each sub period when comparing the mean monthly deficit of each spring with the mean monthly flow of each spring for the 2059 2098 period the deficit constitutes 47 9 of the mean monthly flow of the stilos spring 53 1 of the mean monthly flow of the meskla spring and 18 1 of the mean monthly flow of the agia spring these percentages for the reference period are 28 3 for stilos 30 8 for meskla and 8 5 for agia the spring with the highest retention time and the lowest variability has the lowest deficit relative to the monthly mean flow but in the future the relative deficit increases to a greater extend for agia then for meskla and lastly for stilos finally we compare the mean frequency duration and intensity of the drought events for each of the springs during the reference period with those of the two future periods 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 based on all the climate change scenarios the results are shown in table 4 it is evident that climate change will have an adverse impact on the frequency duration and intensity of drought events overall the meteorological drought index is far more conservative than the hydrological drought index for all three springs between the stilos and meskla spring the former is expected to have more frequent and longer drought events but the latter is forecast to have higher drought intensities compared to its mean monthly flow the frequency of drought events is relatively stable for the agia spring but the intensity and duration of the spring s drought events present a dramatic increase in the future the correlation between the 6 month modified drought index applied 1 on the rainfall of psichro and 2 the karst flows of i stilos ii meskla and iii agia is also examined in order to test the efficacy of the meteorological index to depict the hydrological droughts the coefficient of determination r2 between the meteorological and hydrological index is on average based on the 11 scenarios 0 54 for the stilos flow 0 48 for the meskla flow and 0 18 for the agia flow a coefficient of determination of at least 0 5 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 as it is evident the 6 month meteorological index cannot provide a satisfactory representation for the hydrological droughts of a karst spring with high retention time and its performance is mediocre even for the springs with lower retention times fiorillo and guadagno 2010 found that the best correlation between the standard precipitation index spi and the discharges of the karst springs they studied located in italy occurs for a time scale of 9 or 12 months therefore we also apply the modified drought index for a time scale of 9 and 12 months on the monthly rainfall and karst flows time series the average r2 between the meteorological and hydrological 9 month index based on the 11 scenarios is 0 64 0 66 and 0 23 for the flows of stilos meskla and agia respectively the corresponding r2 values are 0 72 0 74 and 0 35 when the index is applied with the 12 month time scale the correlation between the meteorological and hydrological index for karst flow is improved with the increase in the time scale and the meteorological index can satisfactorily describe the trend of the hydrological droughts of stilos and meskla for a time scale of 9 and 12 months but cannot reproduce the drought conditions of the agia spring even for large time scales a meteorological drought index of 82 months the number of months is equal to the retention time of the spring would provide a satisfactory correlation with the hydrological index of agia fig s3 3 4 impact of climate change on the flow extremes the flow value which corresponds to the 10th percentile of the daily karst flow for stilos and meskla is 0 278 m3 s and 0 132 m3 s respectively for the 40 year reference period 1979 2018 according to table 5 based on all three rcps of the rcm remo the percentage of daily flow values which are lower than the reference period s 10th percentile threshold increases for all scenarios in the future for stilos and meskla ranging from 12 7 to 31 9 for stilos and 10 5 to 37 9 for meskla for the case of the agia spring the percentage of daily flow values lower than the reference period s 10th percentile threshold increases under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 ranging from 25 7 to 71 7 but decreases under the rcp2 6 ranging from 1 7 to 7 1 on average based on the three rcps the low flows of stilos increase by 61 3 during the period 2019 2058 and 126 5 during the period 2059 2098 the low flows of meskla increase by 62 0 and 129 6 respectively and the low flows of agia increase by 61 8 and 73 4 the highest percentage of relative change corresponds to the period 2059 2098 of the rcp8 5 scenario and the lowest corresponds to the rcp2 6 scenario even for the favorable scenario rcp2 6 though the number of low flows increases in the future for both future periods and for stilos and meskla springs the distribution of the frequency of low flows is presented in fig 9 this figure reveals that all three scenarios suggest a shift of the low flows towards wetter months especially after 2059 the stilos spring low flows of the reference period take place from july to november with the majority of the low flows happening during october during the 2019 2058 period the majority of low flows still occurs during october except for the rcp4 5 with the peak during september but there are also low flows during june and december and more low flows during the july november period after 2059 under the rcp8 5 september is the month with the most of the low flows and there are low flows throughout the year under the rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 low flows take place from may to december most of the low flows of the meskla spring occur during october and there are low flows from july to january during the reference period during the period 2019 2058 low flows exist from june to january rcp8 5 and from may to january for the other rcps after 2059 during the two future periods low flows are present throughout the year for all scenarios also it is noteworthy that for the rcp8 5 and the 2059 2098 period the meskla flows are equal to zero i e the spring is completely dry for 10 7 of the days in this 40 year period and zero flows occur throughout the year the low flows of agia occur from june to january during the reference period the peak of agia low flows occurs during october for the reference and future periods the forecast low flows for agia present high variability based on the scenario the favorable rcp2 6 scenario predicts decreased frequency in low flows whereas scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 predict great increase in low flows which are expected to take place throughout the year the mean excess function is applied on the time series of rainfall surface flow of koiliaris and keritis rbs and the karst flows of stilos meskla and agia under the scenario remo and the rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 future periods as well as the reference period the distributions of rainfall and both surface flows have generally heavy tails table s3 according to fig s1 of the supplementary material the tails are sub exponential whereas the distributions of karst flows have light tails hyper exponential during the future periods the rainfall distribution tail becomes heavier under the rcp2 6 both future periods and the rcp8 5 period 2059 2098 while the rainfall tail is relatively the same for the rcp4 5 scenario the surface flows display even heavier tails compared to the rainfall tails the surface flow distribution tails in the future are always heavier than the ones of the reference period and the keritis rb surface flow distribution tail is always heavier than the one of koiliaris rb this explains the more intense increase in the surface flow of keritis compared to the surface flow of koiliaris due to climate change the hyper exponential tails of the karst flows of stilos and agia are still hyper exponential during the future the distribution tail of the stilos spring becomes heavier as time progresses but the distribution tail of the agia spring is relatively stable with time the tail of the meskla karst flow distribution converts to exponential and even sub exponential for the case rcp8 5 and the period 20598 2098 indicating more frequent high flows for the meskla spring 4 discussion and conclusions the study focuses on three mediterranean karst springs with different hydrologic responses and specifically different karst systems and water retention times the results in this study mainly focus on the low flows of the three karst springs but also deal with the upper tails of the distributions of rainfall and flow as they facilitate the interpretation of the results the study suggests that more intense changes in flow are observed after 2059 when a mild decrease in the mean annual rainfall based on the eleven scenarios under study leads to a substantial decrease in the mean annual karst flow specifically the stilos spring flow is expected to decrease significantly after 2059 25 1 on average based on the eleven scenarios and the decrease is considerable but less intense for the karst flow of meskla 18 7 and agia 14 2 springs a high retention time of the spring secures more efficient water storage and slower response to climate change the projected changes for the karst springs flow in this study are in accordance with the studies of hartmann et al 2012 and smiatek et al 2013 who performed climate change impact analyses for mediterranean karst springs the mean annual surface flow demonstrates a slight increase after 2059 0 4 for koiliaris and 8 0 for keritis rb due to the increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall high intensity rainfall favors the generation of surface runoff at the expense of karst flow since rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate a statement also supported by yu et al 2019 for the koiliaris rb the agia spring which is the main source of water supply and irrigation for the city of chania is forecast to have lower flows after 2059 but the spring will be able to cover the current annual water needs of the area even for the worst case scenario although marginally these water needs will definitely increase in the future and the local authorities have already started discussing and proposing actions to obtain larger amounts of water from the spring decentralized administration of crete 2018 in light of these new data and the estimation of the future water resources in this study the water management actions for the area should be cautiously designed the effect of the springs retention time is also evident in the analysis of present and future droughts the frequency of future drought events is higher in karst springs with lower water retention time i e stilos and lower in karst springs with higher retention time i e agia conversely the duration of individual drought events is higher for karst springs with high retention time also the correlation between the meteorological and hydrological drought index decreases as the spring s retention time increases all the above mentioned results indicate that the droughts of a spring with flashy discharge are more in accordance with the patterns of meteorological droughts compared to a spring with higher storage capacity in addition a long hydrological drought of a mediterranean karst spring with high retention time is a result of many individual meteorological drought events situated close to each other in time for a long period rather than one long meteorological drought nerantzaki et al 2020 have reported that after 2059 the variability of karst flow due to the climate change scenario is significant 23 5 expressed as coefficient of variation even with this high uncertainty scores the most adverse impacts on the hydrological karst droughts are expected to take place after 2059 independently of the climate change scenario realized the stilos spring is the most vulnerable spring under the impact of climate change with an increase of 77 5 in frequency 45 in duration and 27 3 in the mean monthly intensity of drought events the meskla spring is projected to have an increase of 35 9 in frequency 36 8 in duration and 38 6 in mean monthly intensity of droughts finally the drought frequency of the agia spring decreases 8 1 after 2059 as the duration of drought events increases remarkably 533 and the mean monthly drought intensity increases 83 6 the mean deficit to mean monthly flow ratio increases for all springs especially for the agia spring for which it doubles in addition for all springs multi year droughts are forecast after 2059 under all scenarios the analysis of the extreme low and high flows of the springs and surface flow demonstrates that there will be an increase in the variability of flow values with increasing high and low flows in frequency and intensity a statement also supported by asadieh and krakauer 2017 for the mediterranean region the increasing frequency of meteorological droughts leads to increasing low flows during the whole year and especially during the dry months deteriorating an already challenging situation specifically for both stilos meskla and agia springs the low flows will increase 126 5 129 5 and 73 4 after 2059 based on the three remo scenarios the future distributions of high rainfall extremes do not facilitate the water storage of the springs as abrupt extreme events lower the infiltration capacity and increase abrupt floods yu et al 2019 erosion and crop disaster papalexiou and montanari 2019 in this study there was an overestimation of the peaks in the modeled koiliaris flows mainly because the study focused on providing the most acceptable calibration for the low flows which define droughts more accurate approaches for the estimation of the koiliaris high flows and their impacts in the area have been made in the recent publication of lilli et al 2020a b zhang et al 2015 propose the swat sc which calibrates model parameters and simulates hydrological process for the dry and wet periods separately and combines the optimal simulation results of these two periods for the whole runoff series this approach could provide the highest indices scores for both high and low flows these results provide an illustration of the conditions which are expected to prevail for mediterranean karst springs in the future the drought status is anticipated to deteriorate especially after 2059 regardless of the scenario realized for all springs and the results of this study can be used as a guide for local and regional authorities and water management organizations to adapt their practices for the prevention of the negative repercussions of karst spring droughts a 40 year period is offered for adaptation measures to be prepared and planned for the improved management of the springs water resources without running the risk of their drying up credit authorship

5059,karst springs are the exclusive source of water during dry months for many mediterranean regions the impact of climate change on the hydrology of mediterranean karst springs has not received proper attention in the scientific literature specifically the effect of climate change on the drought characteristics of karst springs has not been studied here the response to climate change of three mediterranean karst springs with different retention times is examined focusing on the frequency duration and intensity of their drought events the karst swat model is used to quantify the karst springs flow a set of representative climate change scenarios are used to assess the climate change impact on the springs and surface flow for the period 2019 2098 a non parametric drought index is modified to estimate the future meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics in comparison to the reference period the most adverse effects of climate change on the three karst springs are expected to prevail after 2059 depending on the spring the mean annual karst flow decreases from 14 2 to 25 1 the mean number of drought events ranges from a decrease of 8 1 to an increase of 77 5 the duration of drought events increases from 36 8 to 533 and the mean monthly water deficit increases from 27 3 to 83 6 when comparing the period 2059 2098 to the reference period 1979 2018 as the water retention time of the spring increases the duration and intensity of the droughts are likely to increase more significantly after 2059 multi year droughts are forecast for all springs under all scenarios both low and high flows will increase with the former occupying even wet months the results of this study can be used as a guide for local and regional authorities and water management organizations to adapt their practices for the mitigation of the impact of climate change on the water resources of mediterranean karst springs keywords drought index karst springs mediterranean region karst swat climate change semi arid climate 1 introduction karst regions describe landscapes containing caves and extensive groundwater systems developed on soluble rocks limestone marble and gypsum karst terrains have distinctive hydrology which stems from a combination of high rock solubility and well developed fractured porosity usual geomorphic features in these areas are sinking streams caves enclosed depressions and large springs karst landscapes occupy approximately 20 of the planet s dry ice free land and offer the partial or entire drinking supply of about one fourth of the global population ford and williams 2007 the mediterranean basin has been characterized as the cradle of karst studies since ancient times ford and williams 2007 pfeiffer 1963 identified five eras in the development of concepts about karst groundwaters in the area beginning from 600 to 400 bc it is estimated that at least 15 of the surface of the mediterranean catchment area as defined in nikolaidis et al 2014 and bakalowicz 2015 is covered by carbonate outcrops and that karst aquifers supply at least 25 of domestic water supply without taking industry agricultural and tourism withdrawals under consideration bakalowicz 2015 margat 1998 seventy five percent of the total mediterranean agricultural land is irrigated and it accounts for more than 60 of the total water abstractions e g spain 64 greece 88 portugal 80 wriedt et al 2009 the mediterranean region is identified as a prominent climate change hotspot based on the future mean precipitation and surface air temperature change diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 giorgi 2006 future droughts are expected to greatly influence the mediterranean region dubrovský et al 2014 according to literature droughts can be categorized as meteorological hydrological and agricultural wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological droughts refer to decrease in precipitation hydrological droughts to deficit in surface water and agricultural droughts to drop in soil moisture orlowsky and seneviratne 2012 found enhanced dryness meteorological drought on the annual time scale in the mediterranean using the cmip3 models lu et al 2019 recently found statistically significant annual drying over the mediterranean region agricultural drought with stronger drying as the strength of forcing increases using the cmip5 models large scale hydrological drought studies do not take under consideration the effects of nonlinearity in smaller scales which is a result of specific hydrological systems as in the case of karst aquifers therefore many catchments do not have a tight hydrological budget and a rainfall runoff response e g hartmann et al 2014a hartmann et al 2014b an extensive bibliography of climate change assessment studies on several mediterranean regions exists these studies however focus on non karstic regions and the climate change impact research for karst watersheds mediterranean or other is limited for example hartmann et al 2012 used a multi model approach to assess future water availability at a large eastern mediterranean karst spring in palestinian authority and suggested that in the remote future 2068 2098 when variability of climate change decreases a decrease of water availability of 15 to 30 is forecast smiatek et al 2013 used four dynamically downscaled and highly resolved spatially climate change datasets and predicted a decrease in discharge intensity in the range of 9 to 30 for the figeh karst spring in syria during the middle and end of the century another example is the study of nerantzaki et al 2019 who used a combination of models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to estimate the future hydrological budget of karst dominated crete and found an average decrease of 16 5 for spring flow after 2060 finally fiorillo 2009 fiorillo and guadagno 2012 and de vita et al 2012 studied the karst system in the campania region southern italy and proposed methodologies aiming to forecast droughts and the variability of groundwater flow this gap in literature needs to be filled considering that water needs in the arid and semi arid regions of the mediterranean are exclusively covered by karst springs and groundwater resources during the summer months when there is no surface runoff several questions arise for mediterranean karst watersheds such as whether climate change scenarios predictions suggest satisfactory available water supplies and how these water amounts are going to be distributed over the future years under hydrological droughts it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of karst springs estimate the present and future response for these regions and plan water resources management accordingly the first step for reliable predictions of both surface and karst flow is the robust hydrological modeling of the watershed of interest the soil and water assessment tool swat has been extensively used for the simulation of surface runoff for a variety of watersheds krysanova and white 2015 francesconi et al 2016 ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 the swat model has been modified to account for the karst springs flow by adding a karst flow assessment tool and the karst swat model nikolaidis et al 2013 was developed for watersheds dominated by karst sinkholes and spring flow this karst component has been developed over the past 15 years using high frequency data and geomorphologic analysis of the koiliaris rb moraetis et al 2010 nikolaidis et al 2013 it has been implemented for the karst watershed of koiliaris located in chania crete for the hydrological and geochemical modeling of the composite surface and karst flow nikolaidis et al 2013 as well as for the simulation of sediment transport through the karst springs nerantzaki et al 2015 it was then scaled up for the hydrological modeling of the whole island of crete malagò et al 2016 proving the capability of the model to simulate the flow of the cretan karst system nerantzaki et al 2019 used it for the assessment of the effect of climate change on the hydrological budget of crete and nerantzaki et al 2020 used it for the estimation of the projected average available water quantity and its uncertainties in the koiliaris river basin the karst swat model has shown good performance in simulating the karst flow originating from the characteristic mediterranean formations of crete and was therefore selected to simulate the karst flow in this study in an attempt to assess the future variability of the mediterranean karst springs flow along with the effect of drought on their water reserve we focus on three mediterranean karst springs located in chania crete i e stilos agia and meskla springs with different hydrological responses we aim to 1 estimate the impact of climate change on the future water availability 2 compare the frequency duration and intensity of meteorological and hydrological drought events in future periods with the ones of the reference period 1979 2018 and 3 examine the frequency of extreme flows high and low in the reference and future periods the efficiency of a meteorological index a tool to define the frequency and severity of meteorological drought events to describe hydrological droughts of springs is also examined the swat and karst swat models are used to simulate both the surface and the karst runoff with emphasis on the latter a combination of eleven climate change scenarios are used to drive the hydrological models the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 is employed on the time series of both precipitation and karst flow for the determination of the frequency duration and intensity of meteorological and hydrological droughts of the reference period respectively the drought indicator of sdat is modified to facilitate the comparison between future and reference drought characteristics future distributions of low flows are compared to the reference period and the mean excess function mef nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 is used for the analysis of the upper distribution tails of rainfall and flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the broad karst system of the lefka ori mountain range located in the prefecture of chania in western crete greece defines the regional hydrology fig 1 the system is discharged in major karst springs on the north and submarine springs of lower capacity on the south the karst geological formation is characterized by a high infiltration and the groundwater route enriches the underground reservoirs the watersheds under study include three major karst springs which are the main contributors of water for the region of chania i e the stilos koiliaris river basin agia and meskla springs keritis river basin stilos and agia provide 40 of the total discharges in the northern part nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 the catchments under study are the koiliaris river basin and the keritis river basin fig 1 the main geologic formations in the region are plattenkalk limestones trypali units phyllites quartzites marls and marly limestones and alluvial deposits fig 1 as far as stratigraphy from the lower to the upper nappes is concerned the plattenkalk limestones are the deepest rocks geologic age from upper triassic to upper eocene followed by the trypali nappe which is highly karstified late triassic early jurassic on the top of the trypali nappe there are western crete phyllites quartzites paleozoic finally there are neogene deposits at the lower elevations of the basin marls and marly limestones middle to upper miocene and post alpine sediments alluvial deposits of the last 12 thousand years found near the river corridor papanikolaou and vassilakis 2010 the koiliaris river basin koiliaris rb is a critical zone observatory guo and lin 2016 information on the critical zone network are available at https www czen org the watershed is about 130 km2 and includes two episodic streams keramianos and anavreti and the karst spring of stilos which provides permanent flows throughout the year the spring of stilos is a system of springs sharing the same karst system the stilos spring combined with the intermittent flow of keramianos and anavreti form the koiliaris river stilos is fed from the karst regions inside the basin but also from an area located outside of the watershed fig 1 moraetis et al 2010 nikolaidis et al 2013 the karst which extends outside the watershed has highly karstified epikarst while the rest of the study region has finite infiltration favouring surface runoff yu et al 2019 used a coupled surface subsurface model to simulate the hydrology of the koiliaris rb and accurately assess the flooding status of the area based on their results when the rain intensity exceeds the infiltration rate of the karst faults of high hydraulic conductivity cause abrupt flooding when precipitation is distributed over many days the karst displays more effective infiltration on the contrary the more intense events lower the infiltration capacity and increase abrupt floods the hydrological response of the basin is fast and during extreme events 70 of the precipitation becomes surface runoff creating significant floods lilli et al 2020a b the conceptualization of a two reservoir well mixed karst system in the area has been confirmed by the geomorphologic and tidal analysis conducted in lilli et al 2020b this conceptualization is natural since the karst system of lefka ori consists of two different geotectonic units a the plattenkalk limestones and b the limestones of trypali the plattenkalk limestones is the base rock on which the trypali nappe lies the latter being highly karstified the trypali limestones hence have a very fast discharge while the plattenkalk limestones have a slower one the stilos spring displays a relatively fast response with a retention time equal to 15 days and a slower response with a retention time of 100 days the retention time of each spring has been computed in nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 based on the observed karst flow recession curve and the maillet model as described in bonacci 1993 the recession coefficients are initially calculated and the inverse of these coefficients represent the hydraulic residence time of the discharged water for each reservoir ford and williams 2007 have provided a detailed review of the application of recession curves to karst aquifers based on experiments conducted by the institute of geological and metallurgical research unpublished study tracer experiments in geologic settings such as these of stilos karst and agia karst in order to delineate the karst area and define the retention times are not effective as there is high degree of dilution due to the large volume of the discharge water and the permanent volume nikolaidis et al 2013 the average annual karst discharge of the spring is about 120 million cubic meters per year hm3 yr based on the drought resistance indicator for karst aquifers drika orehova 2004 which categorizes karst aquifers into four classes of drought resistance from weak to high the stilos spring belongs to the class of moderate drought resistance drika equal to 0 44 altitudes in the watershed range from 0 to 2120 m above mean sea level a m s l rangeland covers 58 of the total area while cultivated areas forests urban areas and aquatic areas account for 29 4 8 5 2 8 and 0 6 respectively the keritis river basin comprises two river basins the therissos river basin 60 km2 and the keritis river basin 210 km2 the main river of the therissos rb is the intermittent kladissos river the keritis river basin includes the springs of agia and meskla which together with the intermittent surface runoff form the keritis river the impermeable formation of phyllites quartzites in the watershed efficiently concentrates the precipitation and forms the intermittent runoff as in the case of stilos agia consists of a set of springs which share the same karst system the springs of agia and meskla are fed by karst regions within the watershed the underground system of the watershed is more complex as the underground reservoir of meskla connects with the one of agia and transfers part of the stored water the meskla spring has a relatively fast response with retention time of 50 days and a slow response of 833 days 2 28 years the agia spring has a fast response of 5 days and a significant slow response of 2500 days 6 84 years the retention times of keritis rb have also been estimated in nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 using the karst flow recession curve as in the case of stilos the mean annual flow of the agia spring is 69 hm3 yr and the mean annual flow of the meskla spring is 30 hm3 yr based on the drought resistance indicator for karst aquifers drika orehova 2004 the meskla spring belongs to the class of good drought resistance drika equal to 0 55 and the agia spring has high drought resistance drika equal to 0 85 altitudes in the basin range from 0 to 2100 m above mean sea level a m s l rangeland covers 45 of the total area while cultivated areas olives forests and urban areas account for 23 6 17 7 11 3 and 2 1 respectively precipitation data in the area are available from seven stations i e psichro samonas kalives askifou mouri alikianos and agrokipio fig 1 psichro and samonas also measure minimum and maximum temperature meteorological data are available for the period 1973 2018 on a daily time step monthly spring flow data are available for the agia spring for the period 1978 1985 and for the meskla spring for the period 1978 2005 the mean annual water needs covered by the spring of agia are about 26 7 hm3 yr and the mean annual water needs covered by the spring of meskla are about 5 hm3 yr decentralized administration of crete 2018 water is withdrawn from the agia spring by stakeholders i e water companies and agricultural organizations upgradient from the spring using a network of wells decentralized administration of crete 2018 during summer months when withdrawals are intensified the spring has limited to no outflow due to pumping the spring though can still meet the water needs of the area therefore since the comparison between water demand and availability of spring outflow based on the model is not feasible on monthly and daily scales especially during the summer months the water demand is provided here on annual scale and is later in the manuscript compared to the total annual spring water outflow to evaluate whether the spring will be able to cover water demand in the future there are also two hydrometric stations measuring daily surface runoff along the keramianos river 2013 2017 and one hydrometric station at the koiliaris river basin exit measuring the combination of surface and karst flow daily flow for the period 2004 2018 finally the hydrometric station at the keritis river basin exit measures the total flow both springs and surface runoff of the keritis river daily time step 2014 2015 2 2 climate change scenarios a sub set of representative simulations is selected from the high resolution 12 5 km regional climate model rcm ensemble the euro cordex jacob et al 2014 eur 11 for a range of potential future climate scenarios the rcms downscale the general circulation models gcms conducted within the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and three representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2007 the three rcps are the favorable rcp2 6 peaking radiative forcing within the 21st century at 3 0 w m2 and declining afterwards the intermediate rcp4 5 stabilization of radiative forcing after the 21st century at 4 5 w m2 and the adverse rcp8 5 rising radiative forcing crossing 8 5 w m2 at the end of 21st century based on three criteria i e range of gcms variety in model genealogy and range of climate change signals five eur 11 models were selected the methodology of mendlik and gobiet 2016 in combination with these criteria led to the selection of a set of models which were also used in nerantzaki et al 2019 for the assessment of the climate change impact on the hydrological budget of crete island the selected rcms are presented in table s1 of the supplementary material section the simulated rcm rainfall and temperature data for each rcp have been adjusted for biases against the thirty year period 1981 2010 the quantile mapping methodology multi segment statistical bias correction msbc was used grillakis et al 2013 from the eleven rcms of the ensemble we depict some of the results focusing on the mpi esm lr r1 csc remo hereafter remo the specific model is selected as it incorporates the highest rcp2 6 and the lowest rcp8 5 rainfall projection means among the eleven models and is thus considered as representative of the ensemble rainfall range in addition compared to the rest of the models remo shows the most satisfactory scores when tested against the observed droughts of the reference period sub section 3 1 the projected period 2019 2098 is also divided into two non overlapping segments i e the intervals 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 for the assessment of climate change projections by using this segmentation we acquire three periods of equal duration with a satisfactory sample size of 40 years so that we can perform comparative analysis in regards to the reference period 1979 2018 2 3 the karst swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a widely used deterministic river basin or watershed scale distributed hydrological model which runs on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2009 swat is used for the assessment of the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater as well as the prediction of the impacts of land use land management practices and climate change on the hydrological and geochemical cycle of the watershed gassman et al 2007 the watershed is partitioned into sub basins defined by the tributaries the sub basins are further divided into hydrologic response units hrus which are areas containing the same unique combination of soil type land use and slope value within the watershed the land use types for the koiliaris and keritis rbs are obtained by the corine land use 2000 version 20 büttner et al 2004 the soil categories are determined using the european soil database v2 raster library 1kmx1km and the slopes are derived from a digital elevation model with 25 m pixel size bashfield and keim 2011 acquired from pan european elevation data at 1 arc second eu dem 2013 after the swat model simulates the surface hydrological processes snow accumulation and melt surface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration to shallow groundwater the water of the karst hrus which enters the root zone is directed to the deep aquifer this is achieved by calibrating the swat model to allow the water from the root zone to recharge the deep aquifer the parameter deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp is set equal to 1 for the karst hrus thus the deep aquifer recharge da rchg is generated the deep aquifer recharge is aggregated on a daily time step and comprises the input to the two reservoir karst model see nikolaidis et al 2013 for the full description the swat and karst swat combination has already been used in the koiliaris rb and in the current study it is also applied to the keritis rb the equations used in the karst swat setup for the three springs are presented in the supplementary material section eqs s1 to s13 2 4 methods used for the analysis of the results 2 4 1 hydrological models calibration and goodness of fit the calibration of the karst flow of the stilos spring is accomplished indirectly since there is no gauging station recording solely spring flow data for stilos instead we initially calibrate the surface flow at the keramianos river at the gorge exit fig 1 and then alter the swat parameters for the rest of the sub basins in a similar manner in order to acquire an estimate of the surface flow finally we adjust the four parameters of the karst swat based on the retention times of nikolaidis and karatzas 2010 aiming to generate the best possible calibration of the total flow karst flow plus surface flow at the basin exit the calibration procedure followed for the keritis river basin is different the available monthly data of the agia and meksla flow are utilized for the calibration of the karst flow for each spring the swat parameters for the surface flow in the keritis rb are then adjusted to attain a satisfactory calibration for the total flow at the keritis basin exit every calibration stage for both basins is tested using the statistical indices proposed by moriasi et al 2007 for watershed simulations specifically we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr the streamflow model simulation is judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 2 4 2 drought indices the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 is used for deriving nonparametric standardized drought indices for rainfall to quantify the level of agreement between the climate change models and the rainfall observations the index is applied on the time series of both the observed rainfall and the climate change scenarios rainfall over the reference period used for downscaling 1981 2010 in this framework instead of the gamma or any other parametric distribution function the marginal probability of precipitation and flow is derived using the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the sample size i denotes the increasing rank of non zero precipitation data and p x i is the corresponding empirical probability the outputs of eq 1 can be transformed into a standardized drought index sdi as in 2 si ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function and p is probability derived from eq 1 we employ the index for an accumulation period of 6 months which is commonly used for reduced streamflow and reservoir storage according to mckee et al 1993 three severity classes are defined for index values lower than 1 the drought is characterized as moderate for values lower than 1 5 the drought is severe and for values lower than 2 the drought is extreme a six month period with an sdi value below these thresholds is considered as a 6 month drought when n consecutive values lower than the above mentioned thresholds exist the drought duration d is considered to be equal to 6 n 1 months intensity is defined as the average monthly departure from the climatological mean during the drought event ukkola et al 2018 and is expressed as 3 i x m x m d m i j where x is the monthly value x the corresponding monthly mean i is the drought start month and j the end month the duration and intensity can be calculated separately for each drought event and severity class initially we use the sdat and the relative difference rd to quantify the level of agreement between the rainfall of the climate change models and the observed rainfall in terms of drought frequency duration and intensity for the 1981 2010 period according to ukkola et al 2018 the relative difference is defined as 4 r d x model x obs x obs 100 where x model is the mean value mean frequency mean duration and mean monthly intensity for an individual climate change model and x obs is the corresponding mean value for the observations during the period 1981 2010 the level of agreement is high for r d 10 medium for 10 r d 20 and low for r d 20 the next step is to examine the droughts over the whole period of 1979 2098 and compare the drought characteristics i e frequency intensity and duration of the future sub periods 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 with the ones of the reference period 1979 2018 in this study we modify the drought index in a way which facilitates this comparison previous assessments of drought indices examine each drought event of the time series based on the climatological mean of the whole time series however it is more substantial to investigate the relevant change of the future droughts in relation to the reference period alone to achieve this in the version proposed here a the 6 month moving average of rainfall or karst flow of the reference period 1979 2018 is subtracted from the 6 month moving average of the mean monthly rainfall or karst flow of the reference period b the time series of these differences is standardized using eq 2 c every successive 6 month average value in the reference and the future periods is associated with a standard score or z score based on the normal distribution we acquired in step b we then apply the modified index on the rainfall and karst flow for each climate change scenario over the 1979 2098 period essentially the difference between the index proposed here and other indices is that the z scores are not based on the entire time series under study but they are estimated based on the reference period time series 2 4 3 analysis of low and high flows we consider the 10th percentile lowest 10 of ranked values of the daily karst flows distribution of each one of the three springs during the reference period as low flows we examine a the low flows probability of occurrence in each month during the reference and future periods according to selected climate change scenarios remo under rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 b the way the 10th percentile changes in the future periods and c whether the springs dry up in the future for the high surface and karst flows as well as rainfall we perform an analysis on the upper part of the distributions of these variables the upper part of a distribution or the right tail describes the magnitude and frequency of extreme events heavy tailed distributions sub exponential characterize distributions with tails heavier than the exponential tail this means that they present many outliers and frequent extreme events light tailed distributions are those with similar exponential or thinner tails hyper exponential than the exponential distribution and they have less frequent extreme events for the analysis of high flows and rainfall we use the mean excess function nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 on the upper 10 of the flows and rainfall distributions the mean excess function is a method for tail identification which discriminates between sub exponential distributions and light tailed or exponential distributions for a random variable x with distribution function f x the mean excess function mef is 5 e x p e x x p x x p 1 f x x p x p x x p f x x d x x p 0 where x p f x 1 p is the lower threshold value for probability p f x 1 p is the quantile function and f x 1 f x is the probability of exceedance a property of e x p is that it is constant for distributions with exponential tails memoryless property of the exponential distribution therefore if the empirical value of e x p vs x p has a slope equal to zero the graph indicates an exponential tail if the plot slope is greater than zero the graph suggests sub exponential tails as the mef tends to infinity for such tails nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 constructed the 90 confidence interval ci of mef slopes resulting from the exponential tail fig s1 supplementary material this graph facilitates the classification of tails based on their mef slope value and the sample size specifically slope values higher than the ci limits signify sub exponential tails slope values inside the ci limits indicate exponential tails and values lower than the ci limits suggest hyper exponential tails the mef function is applied on the time series of interest i e rainfall karst and surface flow of the periods 1979 2018 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 separately for the rcm remo to investigate the progress of their distribution tails in the future under different rcps 3 results 3 1 evaluation of hydrological and climate change models the fit between observed and modeled values is presented in fig 2 the goodness of fit of the agia spring flow fig 2a based on the monthly observed values is characterized by unsatisfactory nse and rsr indices 0 32 and 0 82 respectively but is also characterized by a satisfactory pbias index 0 5 and the model manages to capture the mean monthly flow of the agia spring modeled monthly flow equal to 2 22 m3 s and observed monthly flow equal to 2 21 m3 s generally the calibration succeeds in portraying the spring trend and periodicity but the nse and rsr are unsatisfactory due to the limited observational data since only 84 observations were available also reported in mccuen et al 2006 the meskla modeled karst flow compared to the observed flow fig 2b has very good performance with nse equal to 0 84 pbias equal to 5 0 and rsr equal to 0 40 when the meskla flow is combined with the agia flow and the surface flow adjusted in the swat model the model performance is very good for the daily total flow at the keritis rb exit fig 2c nse 0 80 pbias 4 9 rsr 0 44 the performance of the model for the total flow at the koiliaris rb is also good fig 2d with very good pbias 0 2 and good nse 0 67 and rsr 0 57 we should note that for the case of the koiliaris rb the peak flows are overestimated by the model fig 2d this overestimation occurs due to the authors choice to focus on the good simulation of low flows since this is mainly a drought analysis study indeed the low flows are described well by the model see fig s2 supplementary material and corresponding performance indices of low flows the high flows peak flows over 20 m3 s are a result of 3 4 flash floods during each year and are generated by surface runoff moraetis et al 2010 the drought analysis is implemented on a monthly scale and these flow peaks are responsible for only about 6 on average of the total mean monthly flow contribution of about 10 on annual level therefore the authors judged that the overestimation has low effect on the drought analysis which is the main focus of the manuscript we analyze the drought events of the downscaled rainfall time series of psichro against the ones of the observed time series using the sdat all rainfall stations were examined using the sdat for the reference period and the results of the index did not vary significantly supplementary material table s2 fig 3 shows the agreement relative difference rd between the observed rainfall time series and the downscaled rainfall time series see section 2 2 in terms of mean frequency duration and monthly intensity of droughts the downscaled time series agree well with the observations for the mean duration for all drought intensities and scenarios for the mean frequency for most scenarios and for the mean monthly intensity for the extreme droughts the remo scenario is chosen to demonstrate the results of the high and low flow analysis since it is run under all rcps 2 6 4 5 8 5 and displays more satisfactory scores compared to the only other scenario which also runs under the three rcps i e rca specifically the remo performs better or equally well compared to the rca scenario based on the relative difference defined in section 2 4 2 in terms of mean frequency duration and intensity under all drought intensity categories 3 2 impact of climate change on the annual and monthly rainfall and flow the graphical depiction of the monthly rainfall karst and surface flow quartiles of the two basins for the reference period 1979 2018 is presented in the box plots of fig 4 the mean annual rainfall values of each watershed are estimated as the area weighted average of rainfall which falls over each sub basin since each sub basin receives rainfall input from the rainfall station which is closest to it the precipitation of koiliaris rb has higher values compared to keritis rb as a great percentage of its area lies over higher altitudes and the extended karst area is also taken into account the stilos spring has higher flows during winter months compared to the agia spring but presents high monthly variability the monthly variability of the agia spring however is low as a result of its high retention time the meskla spring demonstrates lower variability compared to stilos spring but the spring s flow is very close to zero during dry months the mean annual values of rainfall karst and surface flow for both basins for the reference period 1979 2018 and for the two future periods 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 under the eleven scenarios are presented in table 1 the percentages of change relative to the reference period values are also presented in table 1 as far as the period 2019 2058 is concerned the eleven scenarios suggest a mean increase in rainfall equal to 2 4 in koiliaris and 3 6 in keritis rb respectively this increase induces a greater mean increase in surface flow for the koiliaris river basin 16 9 and an even greater increase in the surface flow of the keritis river basin 28 1 in addition it is noteworthy that the mean increase in rainfall does not signify increase in karst flow on the contrary the karst flow decreases especially for the case of stilos spring 9 9 the meskla spring and agia spring flows are not expected to change significantly during the 2019 2058 period decrease of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively the greater increase in surface flow compared to the increase in rainfall can be explained by the frequency and intensity of daily rainfall in the future periods the distribution of rainfall changes in the future having higher probabilities of high daily rainfall and lower probabilities of low daily rainfall section 3 4 fig 9 and tables 5 and s3 the high intensity rainfall favors the formation of surface flow at the expense of karst flow since the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate into the groundwater this also explains the decrease in karst flow these results are in agreement with the findings of yu et al 2019 after 2059 the mean annual rainfall decreases for both basins 9 0 and 6 5 and induces a significant decrease in the mean annual karst flow of stilos spring 25 1 and an important but milder decrease in the mean annual karst flows of meskla and agia springs 18 7 and 14 2 respectively the decrease is more prominent for stilos spring compared to the meskla and agia springs which respond better to adverse climate change due to their higher retention times hence their more efficient water storage furthermore the rainfall decrease in the keritis rb is milder compared to the one in koiliaris rb which partially explains the difference between the relative change of stilos and meskla springs the mean annual surface flow is relatively stable for the koilaris rb 0 4 and a relative increase is forecast for the mean annual surface flow of the keritis rb 8 0 again due to the increase of extreme daily rainfall see section 3 4 the mean annual karst flow values for the three springs during the reference and future period 1979 2098 along with the 90 confidence interval ci of the eleven scenarios under study during the future period 2019 2098 are presented in fig 5 although the 90 ci is wide the descending trend of the mean is evident for the three springs after 2059 the mean annual flow of the agia spring fig 5a is equal to the min of the reference period about 34 hm3 yr however the spring is expected to be able to cover the current water needs even for the worst case scenario min annual value equal to 30 1 hm3 yr and mean annual water needs equal to 26 7 hm3 yr the same stands for the meskla spring fig 5b for which the mean annual water needs are 5 hm3 yr the stilos spring fig 5c is the most vulnerable spring with the most adverse relative decrease as a result of the lower water retention time as it is evident from the mean annual forecasts of the above mentioned variables climate change has an adverse impact on karst water resources after 2059 in order to depict the distribution of monthly karst flow for the three karst springs based on all eleven scenarios the box plots of the monthly quartiles taking into account the monthly karst flow values of all the scenarios for the period 2059 2098 are depicted in fig 6 the monthly water volume from the agia spring never falls under 1 9 hm3 mo while the minimum monthly volumes of the meskla spring and the stilos spring are 0 0947 hm3 mo and 0 0201 hm3 mo respectively it is notable that the meskla and stilos springs are expected to approach monthly values close to zero for all months including the wettest months during the reference period fig 4 this happens only for the dry months especially for the case of the stilos spring 3 3 impact of climate change on the meteorological and hydrological drought frequency intensity and duration we apply the modified drought index on the rainfall and karst flow of the three springs under study we choose the psichro station for the analysis of the meteorological drought since it is the only station which is used as input for both basins fig 7 depicts the mean number of drought events for a rainfall and b stilos spring flow which occur during the reference period 1979 2018 and the two future periods 2019 2058 2059 2098 under the i rcp2 6 ii rcp4 5 and iii rcp8 5 scenarios and fig 8 is the same figure for the case of a meskla spring flow and b agia spring flow the first deduction from fig 7 is that even for the favorable scenario rcp2 6 the meteorological drought index indicates more adverse conditions drought wise specifically for the frequency of severe and extreme droughts the increased number of future meteorological droughts compared to the reference period droughts is obvious for scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the frequency of the hydrological droughts of stilos spring appear to mainly follow the trend of the frequency of the meteorological droughts during the reference period the frequency of stilos hydrological droughts is lower than the meteorological droughts however during the future periods the number of occurring hydrological droughts is as high as the meteorological droughts or even higher even though the spring of meskla fig 8a has the same number of drought events with the stilos spring during the reference period the increase of the meskla drought events in the future is milder the frequency of the hydrological drought events of the agia spring is low compared to the other two springs in addition in many cases the trend of the hydrological drought index of agia does not conform to the trend of the meteorological drought we should note that the cases where the extreme events outnumber the severe to extreme events or the moderate to extreme events for the same period occur when a drought has a very long duration and breaks into multiple droughts when the index takes lower values see for example fig s3 supplementary material table 2 presents the duration of the drought events characterized as moderate to extreme i e the duration of events for which the modified meteorological or hydrological drought index is equal to or lower than 1 the values are in the form of ranges since more than one rcm has been studied for each rcp the index suggests that the meteorological droughts are expected to have a maximum duration of 15 months in the future the maximum duration of a future hydrological drought is 97 months for the stilos spring 54 months for the meskla spring and 480 months for the agia spring flow under rcp8 5 during the period 2059 2098 the duration of the drought event is the highest for the spring with the highest retention time and can last for as long as 40 years the whole period under study for the case of agia it is important to note that for all springs multi year droughts are forecast in the future under most scenarios even for the favorable rcp2 6 while the longest hydrological drought lasts 14 12 and 21 months for stilos meskla and agia respectively the combination of the high frequency and duration of drought events in the future for the stilos spring suggests that it is the most vulnerable spring to the adverse climate change impact the meskla spring which has similar drought duration and frequency during the reference period responds slightly better to climate change essentially we cannot compare the response of the stilos spring to drought with the response of the meksla spring based on the retention time the two springs have systems which are different in both complexity the reservoir of meskla provides water to the agia reservoir below and magnitude the stilos mean annual discharge is 4 times higher than the meskla mean annual discharge the agia spring demonstrates very long periods of drought in the future the frequency of the agia drought events is lower after 2059 compared to the reference period fig 8b because essentially the whole period of 2059 2098 tends to become a single drought period for this spring under the rcp8 5 this increase in drought duration can be justified by the existence of many short meteorological droughts during the future period these individual meteorological droughts which occur successively accumulate over the long water retention time of agia and are expressed as a long drought period by the spring fig s3 supplementary material depicts the 6 month modified drought index applied on the time series of rainfall psichro and the karst flow of agia under an adverse scenario remo under the rcp8 5 for the period 1979 2098 the figure shows the effect of the meteorological droughts on the hydrological droughts of agia after september 2073 there are many extreme meteorological droughts which cause a single extreme hydrological drought lasting until 2098 the trend of the 6 month meteorological drought index does not comply with the trend of the 6 month hydrological drought index for agia the trend of the 82 month moving average of the monthly rainfall time series though follows the trend of the hydrological drought index and explains the long drought periods of agia the reason behind the choice of the 82 month moving average is that 82 months or 6 84 years equal the water retention time of agia for the quantification of the water deficit or intensity of drought during each drought event we compare the total water volume during the drought event to the mean of the total water volume during the corresponding months of the reference period as in equation 3 table 3 we calculate both the mean total water deficit during all drought events of each sub period and the mean monthly water deficit based on all drought events of each sub period when comparing the mean monthly deficit of each spring with the mean monthly flow of each spring for the 2059 2098 period the deficit constitutes 47 9 of the mean monthly flow of the stilos spring 53 1 of the mean monthly flow of the meskla spring and 18 1 of the mean monthly flow of the agia spring these percentages for the reference period are 28 3 for stilos 30 8 for meskla and 8 5 for agia the spring with the highest retention time and the lowest variability has the lowest deficit relative to the monthly mean flow but in the future the relative deficit increases to a greater extend for agia then for meskla and lastly for stilos finally we compare the mean frequency duration and intensity of the drought events for each of the springs during the reference period with those of the two future periods 2019 2058 and 2059 2098 based on all the climate change scenarios the results are shown in table 4 it is evident that climate change will have an adverse impact on the frequency duration and intensity of drought events overall the meteorological drought index is far more conservative than the hydrological drought index for all three springs between the stilos and meskla spring the former is expected to have more frequent and longer drought events but the latter is forecast to have higher drought intensities compared to its mean monthly flow the frequency of drought events is relatively stable for the agia spring but the intensity and duration of the spring s drought events present a dramatic increase in the future the correlation between the 6 month modified drought index applied 1 on the rainfall of psichro and 2 the karst flows of i stilos ii meskla and iii agia is also examined in order to test the efficacy of the meteorological index to depict the hydrological droughts the coefficient of determination r2 between the meteorological and hydrological index is on average based on the 11 scenarios 0 54 for the stilos flow 0 48 for the meskla flow and 0 18 for the agia flow a coefficient of determination of at least 0 5 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 as it is evident the 6 month meteorological index cannot provide a satisfactory representation for the hydrological droughts of a karst spring with high retention time and its performance is mediocre even for the springs with lower retention times fiorillo and guadagno 2010 found that the best correlation between the standard precipitation index spi and the discharges of the karst springs they studied located in italy occurs for a time scale of 9 or 12 months therefore we also apply the modified drought index for a time scale of 9 and 12 months on the monthly rainfall and karst flows time series the average r2 between the meteorological and hydrological 9 month index based on the 11 scenarios is 0 64 0 66 and 0 23 for the flows of stilos meskla and agia respectively the corresponding r2 values are 0 72 0 74 and 0 35 when the index is applied with the 12 month time scale the correlation between the meteorological and hydrological index for karst flow is improved with the increase in the time scale and the meteorological index can satisfactorily describe the trend of the hydrological droughts of stilos and meskla for a time scale of 9 and 12 months but cannot reproduce the drought conditions of the agia spring even for large time scales a meteorological drought index of 82 months the number of months is equal to the retention time of the spring would provide a satisfactory correlation with the hydrological index of agia fig s3 3 4 impact of climate change on the flow extremes the flow value which corresponds to the 10th percentile of the daily karst flow for stilos and meskla is 0 278 m3 s and 0 132 m3 s respectively for the 40 year reference period 1979 2018 according to table 5 based on all three rcps of the rcm remo the percentage of daily flow values which are lower than the reference period s 10th percentile threshold increases for all scenarios in the future for stilos and meskla ranging from 12 7 to 31 9 for stilos and 10 5 to 37 9 for meskla for the case of the agia spring the percentage of daily flow values lower than the reference period s 10th percentile threshold increases under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 ranging from 25 7 to 71 7 but decreases under the rcp2 6 ranging from 1 7 to 7 1 on average based on the three rcps the low flows of stilos increase by 61 3 during the period 2019 2058 and 126 5 during the period 2059 2098 the low flows of meskla increase by 62 0 and 129 6 respectively and the low flows of agia increase by 61 8 and 73 4 the highest percentage of relative change corresponds to the period 2059 2098 of the rcp8 5 scenario and the lowest corresponds to the rcp2 6 scenario even for the favorable scenario rcp2 6 though the number of low flows increases in the future for both future periods and for stilos and meskla springs the distribution of the frequency of low flows is presented in fig 9 this figure reveals that all three scenarios suggest a shift of the low flows towards wetter months especially after 2059 the stilos spring low flows of the reference period take place from july to november with the majority of the low flows happening during october during the 2019 2058 period the majority of low flows still occurs during october except for the rcp4 5 with the peak during september but there are also low flows during june and december and more low flows during the july november period after 2059 under the rcp8 5 september is the month with the most of the low flows and there are low flows throughout the year under the rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 low flows take place from may to december most of the low flows of the meskla spring occur during october and there are low flows from july to january during the reference period during the period 2019 2058 low flows exist from june to january rcp8 5 and from may to january for the other rcps after 2059 during the two future periods low flows are present throughout the year for all scenarios also it is noteworthy that for the rcp8 5 and the 2059 2098 period the meskla flows are equal to zero i e the spring is completely dry for 10 7 of the days in this 40 year period and zero flows occur throughout the year the low flows of agia occur from june to january during the reference period the peak of agia low flows occurs during october for the reference and future periods the forecast low flows for agia present high variability based on the scenario the favorable rcp2 6 scenario predicts decreased frequency in low flows whereas scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 predict great increase in low flows which are expected to take place throughout the year the mean excess function is applied on the time series of rainfall surface flow of koiliaris and keritis rbs and the karst flows of stilos meskla and agia under the scenario remo and the rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 future periods as well as the reference period the distributions of rainfall and both surface flows have generally heavy tails table s3 according to fig s1 of the supplementary material the tails are sub exponential whereas the distributions of karst flows have light tails hyper exponential during the future periods the rainfall distribution tail becomes heavier under the rcp2 6 both future periods and the rcp8 5 period 2059 2098 while the rainfall tail is relatively the same for the rcp4 5 scenario the surface flows display even heavier tails compared to the rainfall tails the surface flow distribution tails in the future are always heavier than the ones of the reference period and the keritis rb surface flow distribution tail is always heavier than the one of koiliaris rb this explains the more intense increase in the surface flow of keritis compared to the surface flow of koiliaris due to climate change the hyper exponential tails of the karst flows of stilos and agia are still hyper exponential during the future the distribution tail of the stilos spring becomes heavier as time progresses but the distribution tail of the agia spring is relatively stable with time the tail of the meskla karst flow distribution converts to exponential and even sub exponential for the case rcp8 5 and the period 20598 2098 indicating more frequent high flows for the meskla spring 4 discussion and conclusions the study focuses on three mediterranean karst springs with different hydrologic responses and specifically different karst systems and water retention times the results in this study mainly focus on the low flows of the three karst springs but also deal with the upper tails of the distributions of rainfall and flow as they facilitate the interpretation of the results the study suggests that more intense changes in flow are observed after 2059 when a mild decrease in the mean annual rainfall based on the eleven scenarios under study leads to a substantial decrease in the mean annual karst flow specifically the stilos spring flow is expected to decrease significantly after 2059 25 1 on average based on the eleven scenarios and the decrease is considerable but less intense for the karst flow of meskla 18 7 and agia 14 2 springs a high retention time of the spring secures more efficient water storage and slower response to climate change the projected changes for the karst springs flow in this study are in accordance with the studies of hartmann et al 2012 and smiatek et al 2013 who performed climate change impact analyses for mediterranean karst springs the mean annual surface flow demonstrates a slight increase after 2059 0 4 for koiliaris and 8 0 for keritis rb due to the increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall high intensity rainfall favors the generation of surface runoff at the expense of karst flow since rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate a statement also supported by yu et al 2019 for the koiliaris rb the agia spring which is the main source of water supply and irrigation for the city of chania is forecast to have lower flows after 2059 but the spring will be able to cover the current annual water needs of the area even for the worst case scenario although marginally these water needs will definitely increase in the future and the local authorities have already started discussing and proposing actions to obtain larger amounts of water from the spring decentralized administration of crete 2018 in light of these new data and the estimation of the future water resources in this study the water management actions for the area should be cautiously designed the effect of the springs retention time is also evident in the analysis of present and future droughts the frequency of future drought events is higher in karst springs with lower water retention time i e stilos and lower in karst springs with higher retention time i e agia conversely the duration of individual drought events is higher for karst springs with high retention time also the correlation between the meteorological and hydrological drought index decreases as the spring s retention time increases all the above mentioned results indicate that the droughts of a spring with flashy discharge are more in accordance with the patterns of meteorological droughts compared to a spring with higher storage capacity in addition a long hydrological drought of a mediterranean karst spring with high retention time is a result of many individual meteorological drought events situated close to each other in time for a long period rather than one long meteorological drought nerantzaki et al 2020 have reported that after 2059 the variability of karst flow due to the climate change scenario is significant 23 5 expressed as coefficient of variation even with this high uncertainty scores the most adverse impacts on the hydrological karst droughts are expected to take place after 2059 independently of the climate change scenario realized the stilos spring is the most vulnerable spring under the impact of climate change with an increase of 77 5 in frequency 45 in duration and 27 3 in the mean monthly intensity of drought events the meskla spring is projected to have an increase of 35 9 in frequency 36 8 in duration and 38 6 in mean monthly intensity of droughts finally the drought frequency of the agia spring decreases 8 1 after 2059 as the duration of drought events increases remarkably 533 and the mean monthly drought intensity increases 83 6 the mean deficit to mean monthly flow ratio increases for all springs especially for the agia spring for which it doubles in addition for all springs multi year droughts are forecast after 2059 under all scenarios the analysis of the extreme low and high flows of the springs and surface flow demonstrates that there will be an increase in the variability of flow values with increasing high and low flows in frequency and intensity a statement also supported by asadieh and krakauer 2017 for the mediterranean region the increasing frequency of meteorological droughts leads to increasing low flows during the whole year and especially during the dry months deteriorating an already challenging situation specifically for both stilos meskla and agia springs the low flows will increase 126 5 129 5 and 73 4 after 2059 based on the three remo scenarios the future distributions of high rainfall extremes do not facilitate the water storage of the springs as abrupt extreme events lower the infiltration capacity and increase abrupt floods yu et al 2019 erosion and crop disaster papalexiou and montanari 2019 in this study there was an overestimation of the peaks in the modeled koiliaris flows mainly because the study focused on providing the most acceptable calibration for the low flows which define droughts more accurate approaches for the estimation of the koiliaris high flows and their impacts in the area have been made in the recent publication of lilli et al 2020a b zhang et al 2015 propose the swat sc which calibrates model parameters and simulates hydrological process for the dry and wet periods separately and combines the optimal simulation results of these two periods for the whole runoff series this approach could provide the highest indices scores for both high and low flows these results provide an illustration of the conditions which are expected to prevail for mediterranean karst springs in the future the drought status is anticipated to deteriorate especially after 2059 regardless of the scenario realized for all springs and the results of this study can be used as a guide for local and regional authorities and water management organizations to adapt their practices for the prevention of the negative repercussions of karst spring droughts a 40 year period is offered for adaptation measures to be prepared and planned for the improved management of the springs water resources without running the risk of their drying up credit authorship
