17785,the environmental impact of uranium released during nuclear power production and related mining activity is an issue of great concern innovative environmental friendly water remediation strategies like those based on u biomineralization through phosphatase activity are desirable here we report the great u biomineralization potential of stenotrophomonas sp br8 cect 9810 over a wide range of physicochemical and biological conditions br8 cells exhibited high phosphatase activity which mediated the release of orthophosphate in the presence of glycerol 2 phosphate around ph 6 3 mobile uranyl ions were bioprecipitated as needle like fibrils at the cell surface and in the extracellular space as observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy stem extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs and x ray diffraction xrd analyses showed the local structure of biogenic u precipitates to be similar to that of meta autunite in addition to the active u phosphate biomineralization process the cells interact with this radionuclide through passive biosorption removing up to 373 mg of u per g of bacterial dry biomass the high u biomineralization capacity of the studied strain was also observed under different conditions of ph temperature etc results presented in this work will help to design efficient u bioremediation strategies for real polluted waters

nuclear power production radioactive wastes generated during these operations including spent nuclear fuel may lead to the release of u to adjacent soils and groundwater gavrilescu et al 2009 provoking deleterious side effects that are a major environmental concern both the mobility and the solubility of released u in nature are known to be governed by its oxidation state and chemical speciation which in turn are controlled by biotic and abiotic processes suzuki and banfield 1999 main primary u oxidation states are u iv stable as uraninite uo2 in anaerobic conditions and u vi dominating in oxidizing conditions as the extremely soluble and stable linear uranyl ion uo2 2 langmuir 1978 the solid mineral uraninite is very sensitive to dissolved o2 exposition which oxidizes this compound to more mobile u vi forms like uranyl ion in addition the chemical speciation of u vi in natural systems is highly dependent on ph under acidic conditions u vi is likely to be adsorbed by mineral surfaces complexed by organic matter or precipitated forming insoluble phosphate minerals as autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 kolhe et al 2018 however alkaline conditions may favor the formation of soluble uranyl compounds such as carbonate complexes hsi and langmuir 1985 waite et al 1994 potentially mobile in aqueous systems in this sense it is well known that toxicity of uranium depends mainly on its oxidation state u vi u iv being the most systemic toxicants those compounds showing highest solubility mainly u vi forms like uranyl complexes in the case of low solubility compounds mainly u iv species as uraninite uo2 they present low environmental and human health toxicity the us environmental protection agency and the world health organization have set the maximum uranium concentration level in drinking water at 30 μg l classifying this radionuclide as a human carcinogen group a application of sustainable management programs including well designed operated and remediated mining operations is deemed necessary to minimize u linked environmental impacts the inherent complexity of subsurface environments due to changing redox conditions and diverse biogeochemical processes occurring underground makes it essential to search for innovative remediation approaches standard pump and treat and excavation and removal remediation approaches are costly and inefficient in extensive areas co contaminated with radionuclides and heavy metals among alternative strategies those based on microbial processes promoting u precipitation are considered environmentally friendly cost effective and highly efficient acharya 2015 and are therefore gaining attention in recent years previous evaluation of the effects and consequences of these microbe u interactions comes to confirm the capacity of indigenous bacteria to mediate u immobilization and thereby reduce its toxicity suggesting applicability for bioremediation purposes reviewed in kolhe et al 2018 and merroun and selenska pobell 2008 in this context the two microbial processes most investigated thus far are the enzymatically catalyzed reductive precipitation of u vi to u iv and the bioprecipitation of u vi with ligands such as inorganic phosphates first proposed by lovley et al 1991 the strategies based on u vi enzymatic reduction performed by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria have been successfully applied on several occasions under laboratory conditions lovley and phillips 1992 lovley 2001 xie et al 2018 as well as at field scale in oak ridge site usa where u concentration was up to 10 60 mg l wu et al 2006 2007 this approach entails some limitations however including the poor stability of bio reduced u in the presence of oxidizing agents like o2 or compounds such as nitrates or bicarbonates along with fe or mn species wan et al 2005 2008 wu et al 2010 spycher et al 2011 watson et al 2013 the high solubility of resulting uraninite nanoparticles as well as other u iv bearing colloids has also been reported bargar et al 2008 wang et al 2013 schindler et al 2017 neill et al 2018 overall recent research interests have switched to a second approach based on u biomineralization by aerobic or facultative bacteria exhibiting phosphatase p ase enzymatic activity phosphohydrolases ec 3 1 3 also known as phosphatases are broadly categorized as acid or alkaline phosphatases based on the ph required for their optimum activity they are either released outside the plasma membrane or embedded as membrane components since free orthophosphate is rarely found in certain environments the main role of phosphatases is supporting microbial nutrition by releasing assimilable orthophosphates from organic sources which should be amended in case they are not naturally present these inorganic phosphates may also act as ligands in the presence of cations such as uranyl ion uo2 2 inducing the bioprecipitation of u vi as a protective strategy for bacteria this mechanism is the basis of promising research efforts aiming at u precipitation by applying members of various genera like citrobacter pseudomonas bacillus pelosinus sphingomonas or rahnella over a wide ph range and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions beazley et al 2011 merroun et al 2011 newsome et al 2015 bader et al 2017 shen et al 2018 kong et al 2020 the formation of low solubility u containing minerals like h3o 2 uo2 2 po4 2 6h2o yong and macaskie 1995 nh4 uo2 po4 3h2o wall and krumholz 2006 and ca uo2 2 po4 2 xh2o mehta et al 2013 krawczyk bärsch et al 2018 stable across a wide range of redox and ph conditions makes this remediation alternative even more attractive the current work emerges as the result of a multi criteria screening process where a significant number of bacterial isolates recovered from rarely studied uranium mill tailing porewaters were thoroughly analyzed at different levels results partially published in sánchez castro et al 2017a after the screening pipeline applied which included molecular analyses 16s rdna taxonomic identification physiological tests metals metalloid tolerance and microscopic observations scanning transmission electron microscopy with high angle annular dark field stem haadf energy dispersive x ray edx element distribution maps the bacterial strain br8 was found to be the most promising candidate a series of assays were conducted to explore the p ase based u immobilization in the presence of br8 and an organophosphate compound characterization of the chemical nature and localization of the u precipitates formed during biomineralization were also addressed through microscopic techniques such as stem haadf and spectroscopic measurements through extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy and x ray diffraction xrd moreover a thorough experimental design was developed to evaluate the influence of several parameters time temperature ph and biomass concentration on the performance of the br8 mediated u removal process these results are expected to provide key information for understanding the u biogeochemical cycle in subsurface environment as well as to determine the optimal conditions for the future application of this innovative strategy under oxidizing conditions in real polluted waters by immobilizing br8 bacterial cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain isolation and molecular identification the bacterial strain used in this work stenotrophomonas sp br8 cect 9810 16s rrna accession number hg798865 was previously isolated from u mill tailing porewaters and identified by 16s rdna phylogeny as described by sánchez castro et al 2017a physicochemical characterization of this water sample is published in sánchez castro et al 2017a 2 2 determination of metals minimum inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth filtered sterilized stock solutions 0 1 m of uo2 no3 2 6h2o cr no3 3 9h2o pb no3 2 lan3o9 6h2o cd no3 2 4h2o ni no3 2 6h2o znso4 7h2o na2moo4 2h2o voso4 eu2o3 and cu no3 2 3h2o were prepared by dissolving appropriate quantities of these metal salts in 0 1 m naclo4 in the case of ag and se 1 m stock solutions of agno3 and na2seo3 were prepared by dissolving the appropriate quantity in distilled water to evaluate the tolerance of strain br8 to these metals the minimum inhibitory concentration mic method was applied as previously described sánchez castro et al 2017a this standard method is used to determine the tolerance level of a bacterium in the presence of heavy metals or other constraining agents 2 3 uranium immobilization assay the ability of br8 cells to immobilize u was studied by monitoring the removal of dissolved u vi as a function of u concentration in an incubation medium containing an organic phosphate source glycerol 2 phosphate g2p for this purpose mops buffered 20 mm distilled water was added to acid washed glass erlenmeyer flasks br8 cells were grown in lb broth rich nutrient medium scharlau chemie sa barcelona spain at 28 c and 160 rpm for 20 24 h subsequently mid exponential growth phase cells were washed twice with 0 9 nacl solution and inoculated when applicable to a final concentration of 0 5 mg dry br8 biomass per ml of medium equivalent optical density at 600 nm od600 0 5 four u vi concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm provided as uranyl nitrate and or 5 mm g2p sigma aldrich as the sole organic phosphates source were tested initial ph was 6 3 in all cases and potential changes were determined by measuring the ph at the end of each assay flasks including no uranium heat killed bacterial cells and no bacteria were assayed as controls for the heat killed cell control the recovered br8 biomass was exposed to 80 c pre incubation for 1h incubation of all samples was conducted at 28 c for 48 h and under continuous shaking 165 rpm once incubations were completed aliquots from all replicate liquid samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatants and solid pellets were analyzed separately by using different techniques described below solid phase precipitates recovered were washed twice with 0 9 nacl to remove the interfering elements of the incubating solution 2 4 quantification of phosphatase enzymatic activity determination of the activity of p ase enzyme ec 3 1 3 was based on the procedure of german et al 2011 using the substrate 4 mub methylumbelliferone phosphate mub standards 0 16 μm 0 625 μm 1 25 μm and 2 5 μm dissolved in na perchlorate buffer ph 5 and cell suspensions were used to calculate the emission and quench coefficients for each sample using an automatic fluorometer nanoquant equipment tecan mannedorf switzerland enzyme activity was calculated following german et al 2011 p ase activity was expressed as μmoles of inorganic phosphates released per hour and gram of substrate 2 5 determination of inorganic phosphates released in order to calculate the inorganic phosphates concentration in solution after the incubation period the ammonium molybdate method murphy and riley 1962 based on colorimetric measurements was employed this technique is based on the reaction of orthophosphate ions with ammonium molybdate in acidic solution forming phosphomolybdic acid this compound produces an intensely blue complex upon reduction with ascorbic acid antimony potassium tartrate is added to increase the rate of reduction 2 6 quantification of uranium removal the final concentration of u vi remaining in solution was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms with a nexion 300d perkinelmer system after hno3 acidification using multi element standard solutions for calibration the concentration of u removed from solution by the cells was calculated as the difference between the initial and final u concentrations 2 7 cellular localization of uranium precipitates stem haadf and hrtem edx analysis cells exposed to uranium for 48 h were harvested by centrifugation washed twice with 0 9 nacl and na cacodylate buffer ph 7 2 fixed with glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer 4 and stained with osmium tetraoxide 1 1 h in the same buffer before being dehydrated through graded alcohol followed by propylene oxide treatment and finally were embedded in epoxy resin ultrathin sections 0 1 μm of the samples obtained using an ultra microtome were loaded in a carbon coated copper grid and analyzed by stem haadf conducted using a fei titan g2 80 300 the tem specimen holders were cleaned by plasma prior to stem analysis to minimize contamination the high resolution stem is equipped with a haadf detector and edx energy dispersive x ray detector thus providing elemental information via the analysis of x ray emissions caused by a high energy electron beam 2 8 characterization of uranium solid phase precipitated by the cells in order to characterize the uranium solid phases precipitated during assays exafs spectroscopy and xrd were applied 2 8 1 extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy exafs analyses were performed in the soleil synchrotron paris france this facility is a medium energy third generation synchrotron optimized for the production of vacuum ultraviolet vuv and soft x ray light and operated with electrons at energy of 2 75 gev in particular the measurements were performed on the mars beamline which is dedicated to the study of radioactive samples sitaud et al 2012 the beamline was built on a 1 71 t bending magnet port of the soleil storage ring and operates in the hard x ray regime from 3 5 to 35 kev with a critical energy of 8 6 kev exafs samples were prepared as previously described in merroun et al 2005 after incubation cells were harvested and washed with 0 1 m naclo4 ph 7 briefly the pellets were dried in an oven at 30 c for 24 h and subsequently powdered data were collected in fluorescence mode using a 13 element ge detector eg g ortec usa and processed using the athena code ravel and newville 2005 feff is an automated program for ab initio multiple scattering calculations of exafs x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and various other spectra for clusters of atoms background removal was performed by means of a pre edge linear function atomic absorption was simulated with a square spline function the theoretical phase and amplitude functions used in data analysis were calculated with feff8 ankudinov et al 1998 using the crystal structure of meta autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 6h2o makarov and ivanov 1960 as a model all fits were performed with the artemis code ravel and newville 2005 they included the four legged multiple scattering ms path of the uranyl group u oax u oax the coordination number n of this ms path was linked to n of the single scattering ss path u oax the radial distance r and debye waller factor σ2 of the ms path were respectively linked at twice the r and σ2 of the ss path u oax hudson et al 1996 during the fitting procedure n of the u oax ss path was held constant at two the amplitude reduction factor s02 was held constant at 1 0 for the feff8 calculation and exafs fits the shift in threshold energy δe0 was varied as a global parameter in the fits 2 8 2 x ray diffraction for xrd analyses u treated cells of br8 were dried in an oven at 70 c for 6 h the dried pellet was scraped and crushed into a fine powder that was analyzed using a x pert pro panalytical b v equipped with cu kα radiation ni filter 45 kv voltage 40 ma intensity exploration range of 3 60 2θ and goniometer speed of 0 05 2θ s 1 previously samples were thoroughly homogenized and crushed with an agate mortar and pestle patterns obtained were analyzed with xpowder software 2 9 effect of physicochemical and biological parameters in u biomineralization additional assays modifying certain experimental parameters were performed to ascertain the most favorable conditions for p ase activity and subsequent u removal time dependent experiments considered different sampling points 0 10 min 30 min 1 h 3 h 7 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h in order to study the kinetics of the u immobilization process the effects of different physicochemical and biological parameters including temperature 15 c and 37 c ph 5 and 8 and biomass concentration 0 25 and 1 mg dry br8 biomass per ml were investigated to determine optimal u removal conditions with the exception of the tested parameter and u concentration 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm in ph tests and 0 5 mm for the rest the experimental conditions were maintained as stated above 5 mm g2p ph 6 3 incubation at 28 c 48 h 165 rpm 2 10 statistical analysis and thermodynamic modeling data in this manuscript are presented as averages and standard deviations for three replicates per experimental condition tested all statistical analyses were carried out using microsoft officeexcel 2010 aqueous u speciation under gc1 or gc2 was determined using visual minteq version 3 1 http vminteq lwr kth se download vanengelen et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 br8 bacterial strain identification and heavy metal tolerance studies based on 16s rrna gene analysis the bacterial strain br8 was found to be affiliated to the genus stenotrophomonas fig s 1 members of this genus are known to play an essential role in elements biogeochemical cycles in nature as is the case for sulfur ikemoto et al 1980 banerjee and yesmin 2002 or nitrogen park et al 2005 presenting also high biotechnological potential as bioremediation agents reviewed in ryan et al 2009 ruiz fresneda et al 2018 2019 however few stenotrophomonas strains s maltophilia jg 2 s maltophilia p 8 1 and p 8 3c and stenotrophomonas sp u18 have been distinguished for their u immobilization ability merroun and selenska pobell 2008 nazina et al 2010 islam and sar 2016 the mic of different metals for the growth of this strain was also determined for assessing tolerance of br8 to these inorganic contaminants table 1 although this method is standardly used wiegand et al 2008 sánchez castro et al 2017a li et al 2019 it should be noted that a minimum part of the metal assayed might be un bioavailable due to abiotic interactions with medium components silver appears to be the most toxic since no growth was detected for all tested concentrations the minimum being 0 25 mm selenium on the other hand was found to be the least toxic in this case the mic was not reached since growth was observed at the maximum concentration tested 100 mm the formation of red color precipitates in the bacterial colonies revealed the reduction of se iv and formation of elemental selenium a phylogenetically similar bacterial strain s bentonitica bii r7 sánchez castro et al 2017b has recently been shown to induce the reduction of se iv to se 0 forming low solubility trigonal se nanostructures ruiz fresneda et al 2018 which could explain the high tolerance of stenotrophomonas strains to this element likewise in the case of u mic was not determined since the maximum concentration tested 4 mm did not limit the cell growth no further concentrations were tested since heavy metals levels reported for real polluted scenarios were much lower than the concentrations assayed in the present study the maximum tolerated u concentration for the above mentioned strain bii r7 was 6 mm lópez fernández et al 2014 such high levels of tolerance to heavy metals e g u and antibiotics in members of this genus have been underlined in other studies reviewed in page et al 2008 ryan et al 2009 nazina et al 2010 islam and sar 2011 2016 it may be that a cluster of genes is involved in antibiotic and heavy metal resistance typically from gram positive bacteria as found for s maltophilia d457r alonso et al 2000 3 2 bacterial immobilization of uranium the u removal capacity of the strain br8 was determined by means of icp ms in the presence of br8 cells and g2p 5 mm u removal rates around 90 maximum of 94 7 were observed for all u concentrations tested 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm at 48 h ph 6 3 28 c 165 rpm fig 1 although no variation was detected in ph level during the incubation abiotic controls showed u immobilization values between 10 and 30 except at the lowest u concentration 0 01 mm where abiotic precipitation accounted for 60 of the total u removal fig 1 heat killed biomass controls exhibited 11 and 54 u removal in the presence of 1 mm and 0 1 mm u respectively fig 1 although for 0 1 mm the removal rate was much higher with inactive cells than with no cells in the case of 1 mm u no significant differences were observed for the two treatments these results suggest that the cells of this strain interact with u through active e g biomineralization and passive e g biosorption mediated processes as was confirmed by u kinetics studies see results below the combination of different interaction mechanisms for u immobilization seems reasonable when a bacterial consortium is occurring but numerous studies confirmed also this ability for single microbial strains song et al 2019 regarding u immobilization efficiency a limited number of studies have reported removal rates similar to those presented here in the presence of such high u concentrations and g2p e g 95 removal for 0 5 mm initial u concentration when considering lower initial u concentrations bacterial strains like rahnella sp y9602 leifsonia sp j5 or serratia sp ot ii 7 all isolated from u rich environments also showed u immobilization rates over 90 under different incubation conditions beazley et al 2007 chandwadkar et al 2018 ding et al 2018 moreover three xanthomonadales isolates stenotrophomonas maltophilia p 8 1 and p 8 3c and rhodanobacter sp a2 61 likewise recovered from mining or waste disposal sites showed much lower immobilization rates nazina et al 2010 sousa et al 2013 regarding the u removal capacity of stenotrophomonas sp br8 expressed by dry biomass weight it was observed that 1 g of this bacterium was able to immobilize 373 mg of u after 48 h at 28 c from a solution containing u 0 5 mm and g2p 5 mm at ph 6 3 although most of previous studies report lower or similar values e g bacillus cereus 12 2 at ph 5 448 mg u g dry biomass zhang et al 2018 paenibacillus sp jg tb8 under anoxic conditions 138 mg u g dry biomass reitz et al 2014 or b thuringiensis strains 400 mg u g dry biomass pan et al 2015 extreme loading capacity was observed in the engineered bacterial strain deinococcus radiodurans phok at 10 mm u 10700 mg u g dry biomass kulkarni et al 2013 3 3 phosphatase activity and inorganic phosphate release stenotrophomonas species are known to express p ase activity sánchez castro et al 2017b weber et al 2018 therefore the role of this enzyme in the removal of u by its precipitation as u phosphates was investigated for other bacterial strains kulkarni et al 2016 chandwadkar et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 shukla et al 2019 the p ase activity of br8 strain cells exposed to different u concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm for 48 h in presence of g2p was assessed results showed that the enzymatic activity depends upon u concentration being twice as high at 0 1 and 0 5 mm u concentration than at 1 mm u fig 2 although the presence of u may enhance microbial p ase activity as a protective strategy against the u toxicity certain concentrations of this metal seem to hinder this defense mechanism as previously reported for uranyl ion macaskie et al 2000 and other heavy metal ions such as vo4 3 hg2 and mg2 swarup et al 1982 tabaldi et al 2007 xu et al 2018 in addition low p ase activity was exhibited by heat killed cells u untreated cells and low u concentration 0 01 mm treated cells fig 2 this br8 inherent enzymatic activity is responsible for releasing orthophosphates by using g2p which may precipitate u vi as uranyl phosphate minerals it should be noted that other organic phosphate sources than g2p like sodium glycerophosphate have been demonstrated to play the same role in presence of bacterial phosphatase activity tu et al 2019 the amount of the orthophosphate detected after incubation increased as the u concentration decreased fig s 2 abiotic and killed cells controls showed very low values of released orthophosphate a finding supported by the p ase activity results shown above fig 2 3 4 stem haadf analysis the stem haadf edx technique was used to determine the cellular location of u precipitated by the bacterium br8 and to elucidate the key mechanism through which this strain copes with the radionuclide s toxicity micrographs of ultrathin sections of 0 1 and 1 mm u treated cells of stenotrophomonas sp br8 48 h ph 6 3 5 mm g2p are presented in fig 3 needle like u precipitates were localized at the cell surface and in the extracellular space no intracellular u accumulation was observed suggesting the ability of this strain to overcome u toxicity by avoiding its uptake the precipitation of u around the cell surface is probably due to the localization of p ase enzymes at this level and consequently to the potential abundance of phosphate groups kulkarni et al 2016 chandwadkar et al 2018 potentiometric titration of the cells of a similar strain s bentonitica bii r7 revealed a high amount of phosphate groups at the cell surface 10 78 0 31 10 4 mol g higher than those of other bacterial strains ruiz fresneda submitted to environmental science and technology in general microbes inhabiting u contaminated environments accumulate biogenic metal minerals in the extracellular space as a defensive mechanism a similar strategy was observed for stenotrophomonas sp u18 when incubated for 1h in a solution containing u islam and sar 2016 intracellular u containing accumulates have been observed in the closely related bacterial strain s maltophilia jg 2 isolated from u mining wastes merroun and selenska pobell 2008 edx spectra and elemental mapping analysis indicated that the electron dense accumulations observed extracellularly and on the cell surface are composed mainly of u and p fig 3 these observations confirm the high p ase activity of this bacterial strain and its key role in the formation of u phosphate minerals which are considered to be very stable for long periods over a wide range of ph and to not re oxidize and re mobilize easily as is the case for u reduction byproducts lloyd et al 2002 senko et al 2002 beazley et al 2011 3 5 exafs analysis the liii edge exafs spectra of the u complexes formed by br8 cells at 0 1 and 1 mm metal concentration and that of inorganic uranyl phosphate m autunite used as a standard compound for comparison along with their fourier transforms ft are presented in fig 4 the exafs spectra of the two experimental samples highly resemble each other and the m autunite spectrum indicating that the local coordination of u vi within the two samples consists of u phosphates the ft of the exafs spectra of the two u bacterial samples show 5 significant peaks fig 4 quantitative fit results table 2 distances are phase shift corrected showed that u vi has two oax at a distance of 1 78 å and 4 oeq at 2 29 0 02 å the second peak of the fts r δ 1 8 å was related to the backscattering contribution of the equatorial oxygen atoms the ms path of the axial oxygen atoms as well as the ss and ms of the phosphate atoms can be seen in the fts in the region between r δ 2 8 and 3 4 å respectively the u oeq bond distance in the two samples is within the range of previously reported values for the oxygen atom of the phosphate bound to uranyl merroun et al 2003 2011 nedelkova et al 2007 the fourth ft peak which appears at r δ 3 å radial distance r 3 61 å is a result of back scattering from phosphorus atoms this distance is typical for a monodentate coordination of u vi by phosphate a fifth peak at bond distance of 5 20 5 22 0 02 å was fitted to a u u the exafs spectra of the u treated bacterial cell samples at 2 u concentrations are similar to that of m autunite with regard to the u oeq u p and u u distances suggesting that an inorganic m autunite like uranyl phosphate phase was precipitated by the br8 cells in these two samples these results are in agreement with those obtained on the high p ase activity of the br8 strain leading to the release of inorganic phosphate needed for u precipitation as u phosphate phases with a local coordination similar to that of m autunite 3 6 uranium immobilization performance by br8 cells influencing factors 3 6 1 time kinetics of the uranium immobilization process the uranium removal capacity of the strain br8 monitored at different incubation times is presented in fig 5 the results indicate increased u removal rate of 16 2 20 7 and 50 after 5 30 and 180 min respectively stabilizing at 98 after 20 h abiotic controls showed a background u precipitation of 3 4 at 10 min reaching values around 10 15 after 24 h fig 5 orthophosphates in solution are first detected at a significant concentration at 24 h fig s 3 once the u vi precipitation percentage had reached its maximum fig 5 as suggested above these findings support the implication of active and passive mechanisms in aerobic u immobilization metabolically independent mechanisms likely based on u sorption onto the cell surface of the bacterium are first to be detected in this time course experiment previous reports describe similarly fast actinides sequestration interpreting them as passive events gerber et al 2016 shukla et al 2017 a large number of bacterial functional groups at the cell surface e g carboxyl hydroxyl amino and phosphoryl are known to effectively provide binding sites for metals and other toxic elements fein et al 2005 ojeda et al 2008 merroun et al 2011 moll et al 2014 reitz et al 2015 phosphate groups have been found to be particularly abundant at the cell surface level in the br8 closely related bacterial strain s bentonitica bii r7 in comparison to other bacteria ruiz fresneda submitted to environmental science and technology in terms of biomineralization active mechanisms the lack of orthophosphates in excess in the incubation medium before 24 h suggests that the process kinetics at this u concentration are governed by the rate of release of enzymatic inorganic phosphates while soluble u vi is available in the system free orthophosphates bound rapidly to it making its detection impossible subsequent sampling times 48 and 72 h show a linear increase of orthophosphates in the medium fig s 3 indicating a continuous orthophosphates release via p ase activity no cell control treatments evidenced an abiotic removal process most likely produced by spontaneous chemical conversion of g2p into orthophosphates which may interact with the solved u fraction this background abiotic u removal approx 10 15 was repeatedly obtained in our work 3 6 2 biomass concentration the effect of biomass concentration 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg ml dry biomass in the u immobilization process was investigated to determine the optimal br8 cell concentration for removing u in solution in the presence of g2p the uranium precipitation ability of this strain was not affected by this biological parameter removal rates at the studied biomass concentrations 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg ml dry weight did not differ significantly fig s 4a even at the lowest concentration 0 25 mg ml dry weight u removal 94 8 remained at the same level as in previous assays fig s 4a however the measured concentrations of orthophosphates released in the medium varied clearly depending on the biomass concentration fig s 4b these changes in the amount of inorganic phosphates released are not proportional to the biomass concentration indicating a nonlinear relationship considering these results limitation of the u biomineralization process is imposed by br8 enzymatic activity and not by the g2p concentration which is clearly in excess in our experiments since the minimum biomass concentration tested in this case 0 25 mg ml dry weight resulted in maximum u removal values further optimization experiments are needed to determine the minimum biomass applicable for satisfactory u removal rates 3 6 3 ph the effect of ph in the u biomineralization mediated by br8 cells was also investigated in order to determine whether this process is suitable for bioremediation of acidic or alkaline u contaminated waters for this purpose slightly acidic ph 5 and alkaline ph 8 conditions were investigated similar u removal rates 93 99 fig s 5a as those observed in previous experiments at circumneutral ph 92 95 fig 1 were obtained for acidic and alkaline ph conditions regardless of the u concentrations assayed 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm u fig s 5a the chemical speciation of u in the studied systems tables s 1 showed that at ph 5 u largely formed positively charged uranium hydroxide complexes e g uo2 3 oh 5 uo2 2 uo2oh uo2 2 oh 2 2 while at ph 8 the negatively charged uranyl hydroxide uo2 3 oh 7 occurred also in a significant proportion 14 6 18 5 depending on u initial concentration tables s 1 thus the passive initial phase of u biosorption is expectable to be more pronounced under slightly acidic ph where the positively charged hydroxide complexes are more represented rather than under ph 8 concerning active mechanisms the release of orthophosphates by br8 cells was higher at alkaline ph where an excess of orthophosphates in solution was detected for all u concentrations at 48 h fig s 5b under acidic conditions the inorganic phosphate concentration in solution decreased significantly at all u concentrations yet it should be noted that even under these conditions the cells released sufficient orthophosphates to precipitate most of the u in solution 94 6 for 1 mm initial u concentration the measurements of p ase activity gave values of 40 μmol per h and g at both alkaline and acidic phs for all three u concentrations tested except in the case of ph 5 and 0 5 mm u where this activity showed a maximum value of 60 62 μmol per h and g since previous experiments at circumneutral ph showed higher p ase activity fig 2 in accordance with previous investigations macaskie et al 1994 kulkarni et al 2016 we hypothesize that at these ph conditions both types of phosphatases may act with a summative effect the unexpected high p ase activity associated with low levels of orthophosphates released seen at ph 5 and 0 5 mm u would indicate a reduction in the efficiency of br8 enzymatic activity similar contradictory results were recently reported by chandwadkar et al 2018 who observed slower u precipitation kinetics at ph 5 but a higher p ase activity when compared to the same test at ph 7 and 9 several studies with enterobacteria demonstrate that a high p ase activity is not enough to confer metal immobilization properties macaskie et al 1994 jeong and macaskie 1995 serratia bacterial cells were found to be damaged and lysed at ph 5 allowing solved uranyl to penetrate and precipitate within the cytoplasm chandwadkar et al 2018 likely affecting the sensitive p ase activity macaskie et al 2000 on the other hand at alkaline ph 8 the presence of carbonates may hinder uranyl phosphate precipitation because of the formation of highly soluble uranyl carbonate complexes nilgiriwala et al 2008 kulkarni et al 2016 at any rate no intracellular u precipitates are normally found under these alkaline conditions maintaining cell viability intact kulkarni et al 2016 since u removal values at ph 8 resulted slightly higher than those obtained under circumneutral and acidic conditions figs s 5a and 1 microscopic stem observations were made to investigate the interaction mechanisms involved in this case microscopy images fig s 6 reveal the presence of flake shaped accumulates located extracellularly and at the cell surface level larger than those found previously under circumneutral conditions fig 3 similarly to those analyzed before at ph 6 3 edx spectra and elemental mapping analysis indicated that the precipitates formed are composed mainly of u and p fig s 6 through xrd analysis structures resembling rb uo2 po4 h2o 3 and autunite cau po4 2 were identified in the precipitates resulting under alkaline and acidic conditions respectively fig s 7 3 6 4 temperature regarding the temperature effect in the bio immobilization process at 48 h maximum removal efficiencies 90 were observed at 28 c and 37 c fig s 8a orthophosphate concentrations measured at 48 h fig s 8b suggest higher enzymatic activity at 37 c at 15 c br8 u precipitation ability decreased approximately 20 fig s 8a for most mesophiles metabolic capacity in general and p ase enzymatic activity in particular are known to be reduced when temperature drops under 20 º 25 c gonzález et al 1994 lee et al 2015 behera et al 2017 as pointed out in the previous section the u removal mechanism reported in this work is highly dependent upon the metabolic capacity of br8 cells which is clearly higher at moderate temperatures 28 º 37 c than at lower ones such as 15 c 4 conclusions this study describes a highly efficient process for soluble u vi immobilization mediated by a bacterial strain from the genus stenotrophomonas br8 in presence of g2p as organophosphate source at different ph values 5 7 and 8 although u removal from aqueous solutions mediated by certain bacterial strains in presence of an organophosphate compound has already been reported macaskie et al 1992 1994 beazley et al 2007 2009 martinez et al 2007 merroun et al 2011 the present work demonstrates the ability of the strain br8 for tolerating and immobilizing aerobically high u concentrations in a short period of time under changing environmental conditions the biogenic u phosphate phases precipitated by this strain presented a local coordination similar to that of autunite groups characterized by their high long term stability in summary these results have direct implications for understanding bacterial u tolerance mechanisms and the impact of the strain stenotrophomonas sp br8 on mobility and biogeochemical u cycling in nature they also demonstrate the potential of this bacterial strain for u bioremediation as a result of a complex process combining passive and active mechanisms including fast biosorption to the cell surfaces and a subsequent p ase enzyme mediated biomineralization phase e g chandwadkar et al 2018 moreover since phosphatases are also activated under anaerobic conditions rossolini et al 1998 the u biomineralization presented here may be an alternative to bioreduction in the presence of g2p when the presence of oxygen is limited despite these promising data presented further research is needed on the performance of this process when applied to real u polluted mining waters through column experiments for the design of appropriate application procedures credit author statement iván

17785,the environmental impact of uranium released during nuclear power production and related mining activity is an issue of great concern innovative environmental friendly water remediation strategies like those based on u biomineralization through phosphatase activity are desirable here we report the great u biomineralization potential of stenotrophomonas sp br8 cect 9810 over a wide range of physicochemical and biological conditions br8 cells exhibited high phosphatase activity which mediated the release of orthophosphate in the presence of glycerol 2 phosphate around ph 6 3 mobile uranyl ions were bioprecipitated as needle like fibrils at the cell surface and in the extracellular space as observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy stem extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs and x ray diffraction xrd analyses showed the local structure of biogenic u precipitates to be similar to that of meta autunite in addition to the active u phosphate biomineralization process the cells interact with this radionuclide through passive biosorption removing up to 373 mg of u per g of bacterial dry biomass the high u biomineralization capacity of the studied strain was also observed under different conditions of ph temperature etc results presented in this work will help to design efficient u bioremediation strategies for real polluted waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords porewaters bioremediation biomineralization uranium exafs bacteria abbreviations u uranium stem haadf scanning transmission electron microscopy with high angle annular dark field exafs extended x ray absorption fine structure xrd x ray diffraction g2p glycerol 2 phosphate p ase phosphatase 1 introduction uranium u is intensively exploited and widely used for nuclear power production radioactive wastes generated during these operations including spent nuclear fuel may lead to the release of u to adjacent soils and groundwater gavrilescu et al 2009 provoking deleterious side effects that are a major environmental concern both the mobility and the solubility of released u in nature are known to be governed by its oxidation state and chemical speciation which in turn are controlled by biotic and abiotic processes suzuki and banfield 1999 main primary u oxidation states are u iv stable as uraninite uo2 in anaerobic conditions and u vi dominating in oxidizing conditions as the extremely soluble and stable linear uranyl ion uo2 2 langmuir 1978 the solid mineral uraninite is very sensitive to dissolved o2 exposition which oxidizes this compound to more mobile u vi forms like uranyl ion in addition the chemical speciation of u vi in natural systems is highly dependent on ph under acidic conditions u vi is likely to be adsorbed by mineral surfaces complexed by organic matter or precipitated forming insoluble phosphate minerals as autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 kolhe et al 2018 however alkaline conditions may favor the formation of soluble uranyl compounds such as carbonate complexes hsi and langmuir 1985 waite et al 1994 potentially mobile in aqueous systems in this sense it is well known that toxicity of uranium depends mainly on its oxidation state u vi u iv being the most systemic toxicants those compounds showing highest solubility mainly u vi forms like uranyl complexes in the case of low solubility compounds mainly u iv species as uraninite uo2 they present low environmental and human health toxicity the us environmental protection agency and the world health organization have set the maximum uranium concentration level in drinking water at 30 μg l classifying this radionuclide as a human carcinogen group a application of sustainable management programs including well designed operated and remediated mining operations is deemed necessary to minimize u linked environmental impacts the inherent complexity of subsurface environments due to changing redox conditions and diverse biogeochemical processes occurring underground makes it essential to search for innovative remediation approaches standard pump and treat and excavation and removal remediation approaches are costly and inefficient in extensive areas co contaminated with radionuclides and heavy metals among alternative strategies those based on microbial processes promoting u precipitation are considered environmentally friendly cost effective and highly efficient acharya 2015 and are therefore gaining attention in recent years previous evaluation of the effects and consequences of these microbe u interactions comes to confirm the capacity of indigenous bacteria to mediate u immobilization and thereby reduce its toxicity suggesting applicability for bioremediation purposes reviewed in kolhe et al 2018 and merroun and selenska pobell 2008 in this context the two microbial processes most investigated thus far are the enzymatically catalyzed reductive precipitation of u vi to u iv and the bioprecipitation of u vi with ligands such as inorganic phosphates first proposed by lovley et al 1991 the strategies based on u vi enzymatic reduction performed by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria have been successfully applied on several occasions under laboratory conditions lovley and phillips 1992 lovley 2001 xie et al 2018 as well as at field scale in oak ridge site usa where u concentration was up to 10 60 mg l wu et al 2006 2007 this approach entails some limitations however including the poor stability of bio reduced u in the presence of oxidizing agents like o2 or compounds such as nitrates or bicarbonates along with fe or mn species wan et al 2005 2008 wu et al 2010 spycher et al 2011 watson et al 2013 the high solubility of resulting uraninite nanoparticles as well as other u iv bearing colloids has also been reported bargar et al 2008 wang et al 2013 schindler et al 2017 neill et al 2018 overall recent research interests have switched to a second approach based on u biomineralization by aerobic or facultative bacteria exhibiting phosphatase p ase enzymatic activity phosphohydrolases ec 3 1 3 also known as phosphatases are broadly categorized as acid or alkaline phosphatases based on the ph required for their optimum activity they are either released outside the plasma membrane or embedded as membrane components since free orthophosphate is rarely found in certain environments the main role of phosphatases is supporting microbial nutrition by releasing assimilable orthophosphates from organic sources which should be amended in case they are not naturally present these inorganic phosphates may also act as ligands in the presence of cations such as uranyl ion uo2 2 inducing the bioprecipitation of u vi as a protective strategy for bacteria this mechanism is the basis of promising research efforts aiming at u precipitation by applying members of various genera like citrobacter pseudomonas bacillus pelosinus sphingomonas or rahnella over a wide ph range and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions beazley et al 2011 merroun et al 2011 newsome et al 2015 bader et al 2017 shen et al 2018 kong et al 2020 the formation of low solubility u containing minerals like h3o 2 uo2 2 po4 2 6h2o yong and macaskie 1995 nh4 uo2 po4 3h2o wall and krumholz 2006 and ca uo2 2 po4 2 xh2o mehta et al 2013 krawczyk bärsch et al 2018 stable across a wide range of redox and ph conditions makes this remediation alternative even more attractive the current work emerges as the result of a multi criteria screening process where a significant number of bacterial isolates recovered from rarely studied uranium mill tailing porewaters were thoroughly analyzed at different levels results partially published in sánchez castro et al 2017a after the screening pipeline applied which included molecular analyses 16s rdna taxonomic identification physiological tests metals metalloid tolerance and microscopic observations scanning transmission electron microscopy with high angle annular dark field stem haadf energy dispersive x ray edx element distribution maps the bacterial strain br8 was found to be the most promising candidate a series of assays were conducted to explore the p ase based u immobilization in the presence of br8 and an organophosphate compound characterization of the chemical nature and localization of the u precipitates formed during biomineralization were also addressed through microscopic techniques such as stem haadf and spectroscopic measurements through extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy and x ray diffraction xrd moreover a thorough experimental design was developed to evaluate the influence of several parameters time temperature ph and biomass concentration on the performance of the br8 mediated u removal process these results are expected to provide key information for understanding the u biogeochemical cycle in subsurface environment as well as to determine the optimal conditions for the future application of this innovative strategy under oxidizing conditions in real polluted waters by immobilizing br8 bacterial cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain isolation and molecular identification the bacterial strain used in this work stenotrophomonas sp br8 cect 9810 16s rrna accession number hg798865 was previously isolated from u mill tailing porewaters and identified by 16s rdna phylogeny as described by sánchez castro et al 2017a physicochemical characterization of this water sample is published in sánchez castro et al 2017a 2 2 determination of metals minimum inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth filtered sterilized stock solutions 0 1 m of uo2 no3 2 6h2o cr no3 3 9h2o pb no3 2 lan3o9 6h2o cd no3 2 4h2o ni no3 2 6h2o znso4 7h2o na2moo4 2h2o voso4 eu2o3 and cu no3 2 3h2o were prepared by dissolving appropriate quantities of these metal salts in 0 1 m naclo4 in the case of ag and se 1 m stock solutions of agno3 and na2seo3 were prepared by dissolving the appropriate quantity in distilled water to evaluate the tolerance of strain br8 to these metals the minimum inhibitory concentration mic method was applied as previously described sánchez castro et al 2017a this standard method is used to determine the tolerance level of a bacterium in the presence of heavy metals or other constraining agents 2 3 uranium immobilization assay the ability of br8 cells to immobilize u was studied by monitoring the removal of dissolved u vi as a function of u concentration in an incubation medium containing an organic phosphate source glycerol 2 phosphate g2p for this purpose mops buffered 20 mm distilled water was added to acid washed glass erlenmeyer flasks br8 cells were grown in lb broth rich nutrient medium scharlau chemie sa barcelona spain at 28 c and 160 rpm for 20 24 h subsequently mid exponential growth phase cells were washed twice with 0 9 nacl solution and inoculated when applicable to a final concentration of 0 5 mg dry br8 biomass per ml of medium equivalent optical density at 600 nm od600 0 5 four u vi concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm provided as uranyl nitrate and or 5 mm g2p sigma aldrich as the sole organic phosphates source were tested initial ph was 6 3 in all cases and potential changes were determined by measuring the ph at the end of each assay flasks including no uranium heat killed bacterial cells and no bacteria were assayed as controls for the heat killed cell control the recovered br8 biomass was exposed to 80 c pre incubation for 1h incubation of all samples was conducted at 28 c for 48 h and under continuous shaking 165 rpm once incubations were completed aliquots from all replicate liquid samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatants and solid pellets were analyzed separately by using different techniques described below solid phase precipitates recovered were washed twice with 0 9 nacl to remove the interfering elements of the incubating solution 2 4 quantification of phosphatase enzymatic activity determination of the activity of p ase enzyme ec 3 1 3 was based on the procedure of german et al 2011 using the substrate 4 mub methylumbelliferone phosphate mub standards 0 16 μm 0 625 μm 1 25 μm and 2 5 μm dissolved in na perchlorate buffer ph 5 and cell suspensions were used to calculate the emission and quench coefficients for each sample using an automatic fluorometer nanoquant equipment tecan mannedorf switzerland enzyme activity was calculated following german et al 2011 p ase activity was expressed as μmoles of inorganic phosphates released per hour and gram of substrate 2 5 determination of inorganic phosphates released in order to calculate the inorganic phosphates concentration in solution after the incubation period the ammonium molybdate method murphy and riley 1962 based on colorimetric measurements was employed this technique is based on the reaction of orthophosphate ions with ammonium molybdate in acidic solution forming phosphomolybdic acid this compound produces an intensely blue complex upon reduction with ascorbic acid antimony potassium tartrate is added to increase the rate of reduction 2 6 quantification of uranium removal the final concentration of u vi remaining in solution was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms with a nexion 300d perkinelmer system after hno3 acidification using multi element standard solutions for calibration the concentration of u removed from solution by the cells was calculated as the difference between the initial and final u concentrations 2 7 cellular localization of uranium precipitates stem haadf and hrtem edx analysis cells exposed to uranium for 48 h were harvested by centrifugation washed twice with 0 9 nacl and na cacodylate buffer ph 7 2 fixed with glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer 4 and stained with osmium tetraoxide 1 1 h in the same buffer before being dehydrated through graded alcohol followed by propylene oxide treatment and finally were embedded in epoxy resin ultrathin sections 0 1 μm of the samples obtained using an ultra microtome were loaded in a carbon coated copper grid and analyzed by stem haadf conducted using a fei titan g2 80 300 the tem specimen holders were cleaned by plasma prior to stem analysis to minimize contamination the high resolution stem is equipped with a haadf detector and edx energy dispersive x ray detector thus providing elemental information via the analysis of x ray emissions caused by a high energy electron beam 2 8 characterization of uranium solid phase precipitated by the cells in order to characterize the uranium solid phases precipitated during assays exafs spectroscopy and xrd were applied 2 8 1 extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy exafs analyses were performed in the soleil synchrotron paris france this facility is a medium energy third generation synchrotron optimized for the production of vacuum ultraviolet vuv and soft x ray light and operated with electrons at energy of 2 75 gev in particular the measurements were performed on the mars beamline which is dedicated to the study of radioactive samples sitaud et al 2012 the beamline was built on a 1 71 t bending magnet port of the soleil storage ring and operates in the hard x ray regime from 3 5 to 35 kev with a critical energy of 8 6 kev exafs samples were prepared as previously described in merroun et al 2005 after incubation cells were harvested and washed with 0 1 m naclo4 ph 7 briefly the pellets were dried in an oven at 30 c for 24 h and subsequently powdered data were collected in fluorescence mode using a 13 element ge detector eg g ortec usa and processed using the athena code ravel and newville 2005 feff is an automated program for ab initio multiple scattering calculations of exafs x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and various other spectra for clusters of atoms background removal was performed by means of a pre edge linear function atomic absorption was simulated with a square spline function the theoretical phase and amplitude functions used in data analysis were calculated with feff8 ankudinov et al 1998 using the crystal structure of meta autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 6h2o makarov and ivanov 1960 as a model all fits were performed with the artemis code ravel and newville 2005 they included the four legged multiple scattering ms path of the uranyl group u oax u oax the coordination number n of this ms path was linked to n of the single scattering ss path u oax the radial distance r and debye waller factor σ2 of the ms path were respectively linked at twice the r and σ2 of the ss path u oax hudson et al 1996 during the fitting procedure n of the u oax ss path was held constant at two the amplitude reduction factor s02 was held constant at 1 0 for the feff8 calculation and exafs fits the shift in threshold energy δe0 was varied as a global parameter in the fits 2 8 2 x ray diffraction for xrd analyses u treated cells of br8 were dried in an oven at 70 c for 6 h the dried pellet was scraped and crushed into a fine powder that was analyzed using a x pert pro panalytical b v equipped with cu kα radiation ni filter 45 kv voltage 40 ma intensity exploration range of 3 60 2θ and goniometer speed of 0 05 2θ s 1 previously samples were thoroughly homogenized and crushed with an agate mortar and pestle patterns obtained were analyzed with xpowder software 2 9 effect of physicochemical and biological parameters in u biomineralization additional assays modifying certain experimental parameters were performed to ascertain the most favorable conditions for p ase activity and subsequent u removal time dependent experiments considered different sampling points 0 10 min 30 min 1 h 3 h 7 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h in order to study the kinetics of the u immobilization process the effects of different physicochemical and biological parameters including temperature 15 c and 37 c ph 5 and 8 and biomass concentration 0 25 and 1 mg dry br8 biomass per ml were investigated to determine optimal u removal conditions with the exception of the tested parameter and u concentration 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm in ph tests and 0 5 mm for the rest the experimental conditions were maintained as stated above 5 mm g2p ph 6 3 incubation at 28 c 48 h 165 rpm 2 10 statistical analysis and thermodynamic modeling data in this manuscript are presented as averages and standard deviations for three replicates per experimental condition tested all statistical analyses were carried out using microsoft officeexcel 2010 aqueous u speciation under gc1 or gc2 was determined using visual minteq version 3 1 http vminteq lwr kth se download vanengelen et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 br8 bacterial strain identification and heavy metal tolerance studies based on 16s rrna gene analysis the bacterial strain br8 was found to be affiliated to the genus stenotrophomonas fig s 1 members of this genus are known to play an essential role in elements biogeochemical cycles in nature as is the case for sulfur ikemoto et al 1980 banerjee and yesmin 2002 or nitrogen park et al 2005 presenting also high biotechnological potential as bioremediation agents reviewed in ryan et al 2009 ruiz fresneda et al 2018 2019 however few stenotrophomonas strains s maltophilia jg 2 s maltophilia p 8 1 and p 8 3c and stenotrophomonas sp u18 have been distinguished for their u immobilization ability merroun and selenska pobell 2008 nazina et al 2010 islam and sar 2016 the mic of different metals for the growth of this strain was also determined for assessing tolerance of br8 to these inorganic contaminants table 1 although this method is standardly used wiegand et al 2008 sánchez castro et al 2017a li et al 2019 it should be noted that a minimum part of the metal assayed might be un bioavailable due to abiotic interactions with medium components silver appears to be the most toxic since no growth was detected for all tested concentrations the minimum being 0 25 mm selenium on the other hand was found to be the least toxic in this case the mic was not reached since growth was observed at the maximum concentration tested 100 mm the formation of red color precipitates in the bacterial colonies revealed the reduction of se iv and formation of elemental selenium a phylogenetically similar bacterial strain s bentonitica bii r7 sánchez castro et al 2017b has recently been shown to induce the reduction of se iv to se 0 forming low solubility trigonal se nanostructures ruiz fresneda et al 2018 which could explain the high tolerance of stenotrophomonas strains to this element likewise in the case of u mic was not determined since the maximum concentration tested 4 mm did not limit the cell growth no further concentrations were tested since heavy metals levels reported for real polluted scenarios were much lower than the concentrations assayed in the present study the maximum tolerated u concentration for the above mentioned strain bii r7 was 6 mm lópez fernández et al 2014 such high levels of tolerance to heavy metals e g u and antibiotics in members of this genus have been underlined in other studies reviewed in page et al 2008 ryan et al 2009 nazina et al 2010 islam and sar 2011 2016 it may be that a cluster of genes is involved in antibiotic and heavy metal resistance typically from gram positive bacteria as found for s maltophilia d457r alonso et al 2000 3 2 bacterial immobilization of uranium the u removal capacity of the strain br8 was determined by means of icp ms in the presence of br8 cells and g2p 5 mm u removal rates around 90 maximum of 94 7 were observed for all u concentrations tested 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm at 48 h ph 6 3 28 c 165 rpm fig 1 although no variation was detected in ph level during the incubation abiotic controls showed u immobilization values between 10 and 30 except at the lowest u concentration 0 01 mm where abiotic precipitation accounted for 60 of the total u removal fig 1 heat killed biomass controls exhibited 11 and 54 u removal in the presence of 1 mm and 0 1 mm u respectively fig 1 although for 0 1 mm the removal rate was much higher with inactive cells than with no cells in the case of 1 mm u no significant differences were observed for the two treatments these results suggest that the cells of this strain interact with u through active e g biomineralization and passive e g biosorption mediated processes as was confirmed by u kinetics studies see results below the combination of different interaction mechanisms for u immobilization seems reasonable when a bacterial consortium is occurring but numerous studies confirmed also this ability for single microbial strains song et al 2019 regarding u immobilization efficiency a limited number of studies have reported removal rates similar to those presented here in the presence of such high u concentrations and g2p e g 95 removal for 0 5 mm initial u concentration when considering lower initial u concentrations bacterial strains like rahnella sp y9602 leifsonia sp j5 or serratia sp ot ii 7 all isolated from u rich environments also showed u immobilization rates over 90 under different incubation conditions beazley et al 2007 chandwadkar et al 2018 ding et al 2018 moreover three xanthomonadales isolates stenotrophomonas maltophilia p 8 1 and p 8 3c and rhodanobacter sp a2 61 likewise recovered from mining or waste disposal sites showed much lower immobilization rates nazina et al 2010 sousa et al 2013 regarding the u removal capacity of stenotrophomonas sp br8 expressed by dry biomass weight it was observed that 1 g of this bacterium was able to immobilize 373 mg of u after 48 h at 28 c from a solution containing u 0 5 mm and g2p 5 mm at ph 6 3 although most of previous studies report lower or similar values e g bacillus cereus 12 2 at ph 5 448 mg u g dry biomass zhang et al 2018 paenibacillus sp jg tb8 under anoxic conditions 138 mg u g dry biomass reitz et al 2014 or b thuringiensis strains 400 mg u g dry biomass pan et al 2015 extreme loading capacity was observed in the engineered bacterial strain deinococcus radiodurans phok at 10 mm u 10700 mg u g dry biomass kulkarni et al 2013 3 3 phosphatase activity and inorganic phosphate release stenotrophomonas species are known to express p ase activity sánchez castro et al 2017b weber et al 2018 therefore the role of this enzyme in the removal of u by its precipitation as u phosphates was investigated for other bacterial strains kulkarni et al 2016 chandwadkar et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 shukla et al 2019 the p ase activity of br8 strain cells exposed to different u concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm for 48 h in presence of g2p was assessed results showed that the enzymatic activity depends upon u concentration being twice as high at 0 1 and 0 5 mm u concentration than at 1 mm u fig 2 although the presence of u may enhance microbial p ase activity as a protective strategy against the u toxicity certain concentrations of this metal seem to hinder this defense mechanism as previously reported for uranyl ion macaskie et al 2000 and other heavy metal ions such as vo4 3 hg2 and mg2 swarup et al 1982 tabaldi et al 2007 xu et al 2018 in addition low p ase activity was exhibited by heat killed cells u untreated cells and low u concentration 0 01 mm treated cells fig 2 this br8 inherent enzymatic activity is responsible for releasing orthophosphates by using g2p which may precipitate u vi as uranyl phosphate minerals it should be noted that other organic phosphate sources than g2p like sodium glycerophosphate have been demonstrated to play the same role in presence of bacterial phosphatase activity tu et al 2019 the amount of the orthophosphate detected after incubation increased as the u concentration decreased fig s 2 abiotic and killed cells controls showed very low values of released orthophosphate a finding supported by the p ase activity results shown above fig 2 3 4 stem haadf analysis the stem haadf edx technique was used to determine the cellular location of u precipitated by the bacterium br8 and to elucidate the key mechanism through which this strain copes with the radionuclide s toxicity micrographs of ultrathin sections of 0 1 and 1 mm u treated cells of stenotrophomonas sp br8 48 h ph 6 3 5 mm g2p are presented in fig 3 needle like u precipitates were localized at the cell surface and in the extracellular space no intracellular u accumulation was observed suggesting the ability of this strain to overcome u toxicity by avoiding its uptake the precipitation of u around the cell surface is probably due to the localization of p ase enzymes at this level and consequently to the potential abundance of phosphate groups kulkarni et al 2016 chandwadkar et al 2018 potentiometric titration of the cells of a similar strain s bentonitica bii r7 revealed a high amount of phosphate groups at the cell surface 10 78 0 31 10 4 mol g higher than those of other bacterial strains ruiz fresneda submitted to environmental science and technology in general microbes inhabiting u contaminated environments accumulate biogenic metal minerals in the extracellular space as a defensive mechanism a similar strategy was observed for stenotrophomonas sp u18 when incubated for 1h in a solution containing u islam and sar 2016 intracellular u containing accumulates have been observed in the closely related bacterial strain s maltophilia jg 2 isolated from u mining wastes merroun and selenska pobell 2008 edx spectra and elemental mapping analysis indicated that the electron dense accumulations observed extracellularly and on the cell surface are composed mainly of u and p fig 3 these observations confirm the high p ase activity of this bacterial strain and its key role in the formation of u phosphate minerals which are considered to be very stable for long periods over a wide range of ph and to not re oxidize and re mobilize easily as is the case for u reduction byproducts lloyd et al 2002 senko et al 2002 beazley et al 2011 3 5 exafs analysis the liii edge exafs spectra of the u complexes formed by br8 cells at 0 1 and 1 mm metal concentration and that of inorganic uranyl phosphate m autunite used as a standard compound for comparison along with their fourier transforms ft are presented in fig 4 the exafs spectra of the two experimental samples highly resemble each other and the m autunite spectrum indicating that the local coordination of u vi within the two samples consists of u phosphates the ft of the exafs spectra of the two u bacterial samples show 5 significant peaks fig 4 quantitative fit results table 2 distances are phase shift corrected showed that u vi has two oax at a distance of 1 78 å and 4 oeq at 2 29 0 02 å the second peak of the fts r δ 1 8 å was related to the backscattering contribution of the equatorial oxygen atoms the ms path of the axial oxygen atoms as well as the ss and ms of the phosphate atoms can be seen in the fts in the region between r δ 2 8 and 3 4 å respectively the u oeq bond distance in the two samples is within the range of previously reported values for the oxygen atom of the phosphate bound to uranyl merroun et al 2003 2011 nedelkova et al 2007 the fourth ft peak which appears at r δ 3 å radial distance r 3 61 å is a result of back scattering from phosphorus atoms this distance is typical for a monodentate coordination of u vi by phosphate a fifth peak at bond distance of 5 20 5 22 0 02 å was fitted to a u u the exafs spectra of the u treated bacterial cell samples at 2 u concentrations are similar to that of m autunite with regard to the u oeq u p and u u distances suggesting that an inorganic m autunite like uranyl phosphate phase was precipitated by the br8 cells in these two samples these results are in agreement with those obtained on the high p ase activity of the br8 strain leading to the release of inorganic phosphate needed for u precipitation as u phosphate phases with a local coordination similar to that of m autunite 3 6 uranium immobilization performance by br8 cells influencing factors 3 6 1 time kinetics of the uranium immobilization process the uranium removal capacity of the strain br8 monitored at different incubation times is presented in fig 5 the results indicate increased u removal rate of 16 2 20 7 and 50 after 5 30 and 180 min respectively stabilizing at 98 after 20 h abiotic controls showed a background u precipitation of 3 4 at 10 min reaching values around 10 15 after 24 h fig 5 orthophosphates in solution are first detected at a significant concentration at 24 h fig s 3 once the u vi precipitation percentage had reached its maximum fig 5 as suggested above these findings support the implication of active and passive mechanisms in aerobic u immobilization metabolically independent mechanisms likely based on u sorption onto the cell surface of the bacterium are first to be detected in this time course experiment previous reports describe similarly fast actinides sequestration interpreting them as passive events gerber et al 2016 shukla et al 2017 a large number of bacterial functional groups at the cell surface e g carboxyl hydroxyl amino and phosphoryl are known to effectively provide binding sites for metals and other toxic elements fein et al 2005 ojeda et al 2008 merroun et al 2011 moll et al 2014 reitz et al 2015 phosphate groups have been found to be particularly abundant at the cell surface level in the br8 closely related bacterial strain s bentonitica bii r7 in comparison to other bacteria ruiz fresneda submitted to environmental science and technology in terms of biomineralization active mechanisms the lack of orthophosphates in excess in the incubation medium before 24 h suggests that the process kinetics at this u concentration are governed by the rate of release of enzymatic inorganic phosphates while soluble u vi is available in the system free orthophosphates bound rapidly to it making its detection impossible subsequent sampling times 48 and 72 h show a linear increase of orthophosphates in the medium fig s 3 indicating a continuous orthophosphates release via p ase activity no cell control treatments evidenced an abiotic removal process most likely produced by spontaneous chemical conversion of g2p into orthophosphates which may interact with the solved u fraction this background abiotic u removal approx 10 15 was repeatedly obtained in our work 3 6 2 biomass concentration the effect of biomass concentration 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg ml dry biomass in the u immobilization process was investigated to determine the optimal br8 cell concentration for removing u in solution in the presence of g2p the uranium precipitation ability of this strain was not affected by this biological parameter removal rates at the studied biomass concentrations 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg ml dry weight did not differ significantly fig s 4a even at the lowest concentration 0 25 mg ml dry weight u removal 94 8 remained at the same level as in previous assays fig s 4a however the measured concentrations of orthophosphates released in the medium varied clearly depending on the biomass concentration fig s 4b these changes in the amount of inorganic phosphates released are not proportional to the biomass concentration indicating a nonlinear relationship considering these results limitation of the u biomineralization process is imposed by br8 enzymatic activity and not by the g2p concentration which is clearly in excess in our experiments since the minimum biomass concentration tested in this case 0 25 mg ml dry weight resulted in maximum u removal values further optimization experiments are needed to determine the minimum biomass applicable for satisfactory u removal rates 3 6 3 ph the effect of ph in the u biomineralization mediated by br8 cells was also investigated in order to determine whether this process is suitable for bioremediation of acidic or alkaline u contaminated waters for this purpose slightly acidic ph 5 and alkaline ph 8 conditions were investigated similar u removal rates 93 99 fig s 5a as those observed in previous experiments at circumneutral ph 92 95 fig 1 were obtained for acidic and alkaline ph conditions regardless of the u concentrations assayed 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm u fig s 5a the chemical speciation of u in the studied systems tables s 1 showed that at ph 5 u largely formed positively charged uranium hydroxide complexes e g uo2 3 oh 5 uo2 2 uo2oh uo2 2 oh 2 2 while at ph 8 the negatively charged uranyl hydroxide uo2 3 oh 7 occurred also in a significant proportion 14 6 18 5 depending on u initial concentration tables s 1 thus the passive initial phase of u biosorption is expectable to be more pronounced under slightly acidic ph where the positively charged hydroxide complexes are more represented rather than under ph 8 concerning active mechanisms the release of orthophosphates by br8 cells was higher at alkaline ph where an excess of orthophosphates in solution was detected for all u concentrations at 48 h fig s 5b under acidic conditions the inorganic phosphate concentration in solution decreased significantly at all u concentrations yet it should be noted that even under these conditions the cells released sufficient orthophosphates to precipitate most of the u in solution 94 6 for 1 mm initial u concentration the measurements of p ase activity gave values of 40 μmol per h and g at both alkaline and acidic phs for all three u concentrations tested except in the case of ph 5 and 0 5 mm u where this activity showed a maximum value of 60 62 μmol per h and g since previous experiments at circumneutral ph showed higher p ase activity fig 2 in accordance with previous investigations macaskie et al 1994 kulkarni et al 2016 we hypothesize that at these ph conditions both types of phosphatases may act with a summative effect the unexpected high p ase activity associated with low levels of orthophosphates released seen at ph 5 and 0 5 mm u would indicate a reduction in the efficiency of br8 enzymatic activity similar contradictory results were recently reported by chandwadkar et al 2018 who observed slower u precipitation kinetics at ph 5 but a higher p ase activity when compared to the same test at ph 7 and 9 several studies with enterobacteria demonstrate that a high p ase activity is not enough to confer metal immobilization properties macaskie et al 1994 jeong and macaskie 1995 serratia bacterial cells were found to be damaged and lysed at ph 5 allowing solved uranyl to penetrate and precipitate within the cytoplasm chandwadkar et al 2018 likely affecting the sensitive p ase activity macaskie et al 2000 on the other hand at alkaline ph 8 the presence of carbonates may hinder uranyl phosphate precipitation because of the formation of highly soluble uranyl carbonate complexes nilgiriwala et al 2008 kulkarni et al 2016 at any rate no intracellular u precipitates are normally found under these alkaline conditions maintaining cell viability intact kulkarni et al 2016 since u removal values at ph 8 resulted slightly higher than those obtained under circumneutral and acidic conditions figs s 5a and 1 microscopic stem observations were made to investigate the interaction mechanisms involved in this case microscopy images fig s 6 reveal the presence of flake shaped accumulates located extracellularly and at the cell surface level larger than those found previously under circumneutral conditions fig 3 similarly to those analyzed before at ph 6 3 edx spectra and elemental mapping analysis indicated that the precipitates formed are composed mainly of u and p fig s 6 through xrd analysis structures resembling rb uo2 po4 h2o 3 and autunite cau po4 2 were identified in the precipitates resulting under alkaline and acidic conditions respectively fig s 7 3 6 4 temperature regarding the temperature effect in the bio immobilization process at 48 h maximum removal efficiencies 90 were observed at 28 c and 37 c fig s 8a orthophosphate concentrations measured at 48 h fig s 8b suggest higher enzymatic activity at 37 c at 15 c br8 u precipitation ability decreased approximately 20 fig s 8a for most mesophiles metabolic capacity in general and p ase enzymatic activity in particular are known to be reduced when temperature drops under 20 º 25 c gonzález et al 1994 lee et al 2015 behera et al 2017 as pointed out in the previous section the u removal mechanism reported in this work is highly dependent upon the metabolic capacity of br8 cells which is clearly higher at moderate temperatures 28 º 37 c than at lower ones such as 15 c 4 conclusions this study describes a highly efficient process for soluble u vi immobilization mediated by a bacterial strain from the genus stenotrophomonas br8 in presence of g2p as organophosphate source at different ph values 5 7 and 8 although u removal from aqueous solutions mediated by certain bacterial strains in presence of an organophosphate compound has already been reported macaskie et al 1992 1994 beazley et al 2007 2009 martinez et al 2007 merroun et al 2011 the present work demonstrates the ability of the strain br8 for tolerating and immobilizing aerobically high u concentrations in a short period of time under changing environmental conditions the biogenic u phosphate phases precipitated by this strain presented a local coordination similar to that of autunite groups characterized by their high long term stability in summary these results have direct implications for understanding bacterial u tolerance mechanisms and the impact of the strain stenotrophomonas sp br8 on mobility and biogeochemical u cycling in nature they also demonstrate the potential of this bacterial strain for u bioremediation as a result of a complex process combining passive and active mechanisms including fast biosorption to the cell surfaces and a subsequent p ase enzyme mediated biomineralization phase e g chandwadkar et al 2018 moreover since phosphatases are also activated under anaerobic conditions rossolini et al 1998 the u biomineralization presented here may be an alternative to bioreduction in the presence of g2p when the presence of oxygen is limited despite these promising data presented further research is needed on the performance of this process when applied to real u polluted mining waters through column experiments for the design of appropriate application procedures credit author statement iván

17786,the increasing use of gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas for magnetic resonance imaging is leading to widespread contamination of freshwater and drinking water systems contrary to previous assumptions that gbcas are stable throughout the water cycle they can degrade the stability of gbcas depends largely on their organic ligands but also on the physicochemical conditions there is specific concern regarding uv end of pipe water treatments which may degrade gbcas degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects this is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater gbcas concentrations in aquatic systems often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium are determined using a variety of calculation methods where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty the current covid 19 crisis will in the short term drastically decrease the input of gbcas to freshwater systems temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities collecting urine from all patients following mri examinations could be a way forward to halt the generally increasing concentrations of gd in drinking water systems and recover this technologically critical element graphical abstract image 1 keywords anthropogenic gadolinium gadolinium based contrast agents gadolinium anomaly drinking water micropollutants covid 19 1 magnetic resonance imaging and the increasing use of gadolinium based contrast agents magnetic resonance imaging mri is a versatile radiological tool for generating detailed images that can be used to assist in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases affecting the brain spinal cord heart blood vessels bones and joints it can also be used to check the health of organs such as e g breasts kidneys ovaries the liver the pancreas and the prostate in contrast to x rays and computerized tomography ct scans mri does not employ cell damaging ionizing radiation but the relaxation time of hydrogen nuclei excited by a strong external magnetic field to image organs and physiological processes in the body gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas are administered in mri to increase the contrast of these images and allow radiologists to more accurately identify neoplastic inflammatory and functional abnormalities bellin 2006 gbcas are strong chelate complexes in which the trivalent gadolinium ion gd3 is chelated by polyaminocarboxylic acid to avoid the toxic effects of free gadolinium gd because the ionic radius of gd is close to that of calcium ca 107 8 pm for gd3 and 114 pm for ca2 gd inhibits physiological processes that rely on ca bellin and van der molen 2008 two general types of gbca have been used to date linear open chain chelates and macrocyclic chelates both of which can exist in either ionic or non ionic forms fig s1 the ligands of clinically approved gbcas are all octadentate with all donor atoms coordinated gbcas shorten the longitudinal t1 and transverse t2 and t2 relaxation time constants of adjacent hydrogen nuclei in mri and thereby enhance contrast bellin and van der molen 2008 caravan et al 1999 gd is specifically well suited for the desired signal enhancement due to its strong magnetic moment and the presence of an additional water molecule in the inner sphere which completes the nine fold coordination of gd within gbca complexes burai et al 1997 chan and wong 2007 micskei et al 1993 because of its versatility availability and importance in modern diagnostics the use of mri and consequently also of gbcas is constantly increasing organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 gbcas are administered in 33 50 of all mri examinations either intravenously or by intra articular injection idée et al 2008 thomsen 2017 due to their small size around 500 da they are rapidly cleared from the intravascular space into the interstitial space and their biodistribution is therefore non specific bellin and van der molen 2008 gbcas are eliminated unmetabolized mostly by passive glomerular filtration in the kidney the residence time of a gbca within the body depends on the type of complex administered and the renal function of the patient the plasma elimination half lives of gbcas range from 1 5 h for healthy individuals up to 34 h for patients with reduced renal function idée et al 2008 joffe et al 1998 gbcas are generally considered to be safe and adverse effects are rarely observed kanda et al 2016 however in 2006 first links were established between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf and gbcas grobner 2006 marckmann 2006 concerns have since increased especially as gd deposits have been reported in brains bone skin and other tissues following gbca administration even in healthy patients kanda et al 2016 le fur and caravan 2019 montagne et al 2016 nehra et al 2018 xia et al 2010 the european medicines agency ema therefore released a warning and suspended the use within the eu of certain linear gbcas table 1 that are considered to present the highest risk of inducing nsf european medicines agency 2017 this has been legislated in all eu member states the us food and drug administration fda has issued an update of their medication guides in relation to the use of gbcas requiring a new class warning especially for patients with kidney dysfunction food and drug administration 2018 2017 other regulatory bodies in australia japan and canada have also released revised precautionary advices le fur and caravan 2019 the use of gbcas is not recommended for patients with renal failure since gbca s use was first approved in 1988 more than 460 million doses have been administered worldwide up to 2018 gibby et al 2019 in 2016 almost 200 000 mri scans using gbcas were conducted per day within the eu and the us combined organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 in germany the country with the highest mri use per capita fig 1 more than 32 000 mri scans are carried out per day resulting in an estimated annual emission of 4 tons of gadolinium assuming 50 of all mris use gbcas with 1 1 g gd per mri scan the corresponding figure for the whole of the eu is 19 tons 21 tons for the us and 0 3 tons for switzerland data from 2016 vriens et al 2017 calculated a total river borne discharge of 0 78 tons of gd from the concentrations of the four major rivers leaving switzerland with a sewage treatment plant stp contribution of around 83 for the same year compared to the late 1990s the gd emission in germany has doubled over the last 20 years bau and dulski 1996 kümmerer and helmers 2000 increasing concentrations of gd which can be attributed to the use of gbcas have been found in rivers groundwater and estuaries around the world hatje et al 2016 lerat hardy et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 in the vicinity of stp outlets gd concentrations are substantially higher than the geogenic background in general about a few nanograms per liter with up to 86 μg per liter parant et al 2018 at present the global spread of the sars cov 2 coronavirus and the covid 19 disease lead to a temporal decrease in gbcas use the paralysis in economic production and socialization leaves strong signals in the environment callaway et al 2020 in addition to the closure of factories and businesses a major concern for all countries has been the drastic effect on their health systems hospitals around the world have been preparing for this unprecedented situation for weeks and ramped up the number of medical intensive care units micus therefore non essential medical consultations examinations and surgeries including the use of mri have been postponed in order to free up hospital capacities and personnel medical facilities are currently performing about 80 fewer mri examinations and a significant reduction of gbca emissions is to be expected this will result in a temporal reduction of gd concentrations in freshwater systems fig 2 measuring and analyzing this transient gd signal could improve our understanding of environmental systems and provide a better database for the risk assessment of waterworks regarding inputs of xenobiotics or pathogens in future gbca concentrations in aquatic environments are likely to continue to rise due to the constantly increasing use of mri even though actual increasing gbca concentrations are still low this could become of concern in settings where drinking water is produced from raw water resources with a high proportion of recycled wastewater in this paper we review on the stabilities of gbcas their behavior in freshwater systems and the importance of the method to differentiate between naturally occurring and anthropogenic gd we conclude our review by suggestions how to reduce gbcas emissions 2 stability of gadolinium based contrast agents determined by their organic ligands it is not yet fully clear whether gbcas themselves their transformation products or the release of free gd are causing adverse health effects these remain fundamental topics for a better risk assessment le fur and caravan 2019 every substitution of gd3 from gbca complexes by other metal ions known as transmetallation can also increase the toxicity of gbcas by releasing toxic gd3 iron fe3 zinc zn2 and copper cu2 in particular are in focus to be possible substituents because of their similar or higher thermodynamic stability and in vivo concentrations le fur and caravan 2019 semelka et al 2019 swaminathan 2016 the degree of transmetallation of gbcas in humans has been assessed from zinc enhancement in urine following gbca administration which yielded evidence of possible reactions with other trace metals rogowska et al 2018 the inner sphere coordination of a single water molecule within the gd complex could be a critical aspect because it is potentially substituted by other preferably negatively charged ligands burai et al 1997 whether this reduces the stability of gbcas remains unclear and would be an important subject for future research gd complexes are susceptible to dissociation and in vivo dissociation can be favored by any interaction with biological competitors for the original gbca ligands such as the adenosine triphosphate atp present in human serum bazzicalupi et al 2012 port et al 2008 the same principle also applies in freshwater systems where other competitive ligands exist the kinetic thermodynamic or conditional stabilities of gbcas are measures that are often used to compare different species of gbcas regarding their possible transformation but their use is inconsistent and questionable the thermodynamic stability of gd complexes in solution is described as an equilibrium between gd ions gd their ligands l and the complexed form gdl for all gbcas the number of involved ligands is one which simplifies the equation to equation 1 g d l g d l and the thermodynamic stability constant ktherm is defined as equation 2 k t h e r m g d l g d l the kinetic stability depends on the activation energy ea and gd complexes are kinetically stable inert if ea is high enough to prevent the formation of any other complexes the inertness or stability of metal complexes is operationally defined beyer and angulo cornejo 2012 regard metal complexes to be inert if the exchange of ions takes longer than a minute at 25 c because the ea cannot include any possibly present catalyst which potentially lower reaction barriers morcos 2007 used the dissociation half life at ph 1 0 to assess and quantify the kinetic stability of gbcas the half lives vary from a few seconds to more than one month table 1 it may be convenient to compare kinetic stabilities with biological half lives but neither is able to indicate whether or not gbcas are transformed within the human body not to quantify the extent of such processes the dissociation half life depends on both ph and temperature for example the dissociation half life of the macrocyclic gd dota at ph 1 is 26 4 h at 37 c but 338 h at 25 c idée et al 2009 and the dota ligand has a dissociation half life of 85 days at ph 2 and more than 200 days at ph 5 wang et al 1992 idée et al 2009 used a comparative subdivision of the kinetic inertness into low medium or high to compare different gbcas but cannot resolve the question of gbca transformation within the human body the toxicological need for a measure that applies at the physiological ph of 7 4 has been tackled using the concept of conditional stability expressed as kcond it can be measured in vivo and considers the protonation constants of the ligand these constants can vary slightly depending on the methods used i e potentiometric measurement or competition experiments idée et al 2009 frenzel et al 2008 confirmed kcond as an good indicator for the in vivo stability of gbcas based on the release kinetics in human serum at physiological temperature and ph prybylski et al 2017 came to a different conclusion remodeling the data from frenzel et al 2008 using the dissociation rate and the balancing aspect of the association between gd and the gbca ligand they found that gbcas were less stable in humans than previously indicated by kcond the stability constants in table 1 show that macrocyclic gbcas are more stable than linear gbcas and that the linear ionic gcbas are more stable than linear non ionic gbcas the weakness in all stability concepts however is the assumption of equilibrium conditions since environmentally relevant conditions are likely to be more complex and not always in equilibrium prybylski et al 2017 the inversely proportional relationship between the release of gd from gbcas and their stability is generally accepted but the extent to which gbcas can be transformed within the human body and the exact processes involved still remains unresolved 3 the concentration of gadolinium based contrast agents is increasing in freshwater environments following their excretion via urine after the mri gbcas enter the sewage system and are released into surface waters as they are not removed by conventional sewage treatment plants anomalous occurrences of gd in rivers were first reported in 1996 bau and dulski 1996 since then gbcas have been found in the effluents from hospitals sewage water treatment plants as well as other surface waters birka et al 2013 künnemeyer et al 2009 lindner et al 2013 increased gd concentrations have even been reported in rural areas where there are no mri facilities in the catchments of the local sewage treatment plants brünjes et al 2016 rabiet et al 2009 this is due to the large number of patients who receive mri scans as outpatients and are then sent home elevated gd concentrations have been found in drinking water and are of increasing concern to waterworks as well as to the general public kulaksiz and bau 2011a lindner et al 2015 morteani et al 2006 richardson and kimura 2016 schmidt et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 gadolinium originating from gbcas is one of a series of emerging contaminants released from sewage systems which makes it a suitable indicator for other sewage water borne xenobiotics reoyo prats et al 2018 in general most studies in freshwater systems pool gbcas under the term anthropogenic gd gdanth which does not imply the transformation of gbcas we hereafter refer to gdanth when we do not distinguish between gbcas and their transformation products anthropogenic gd has been globally detected mainly in densely populated areas with highly developed health systems in europe bau and dulski 1996 dia et al 2000 elbaz poulichet et al 2002 knappe et al 2005 möller et al 2003 2000 petelet giraud et al 2009 in north america barber et al 2006 bau et al 2006 hatje et al 2016 verplanck et al 2005 in oceania lawrence et al 2009 lawrence and bariel 2010 lawrence and kamber 2006 in south america de campos and enzweiler 2016 merschel and bau 2015 africa atinkpahoun et al 2020 and in asia nozaki et al 2000 ogata and terakado 2006 song et al 2017 due to the widespread contamination of freshwater environments with gdanth a variety of hydrogeological investigations have used it as an ideal tracer in different hydrochemical settings assuming that all types of gbcas do not undergo degradation once released from stps barber et al 2006 bichler et al 2016 klaver et al 2014 möller et al 2011 2000 petelet giraud et al 2009 depending on the operating mode of an stp the effluent gd concentration may show a temporal variation daily to weekly because most mri scans are carried out during the daytime from monday to friday telgmann et al 2012 this transient signal can propagate into the groundwater and can be used to calculate groundwater transit times brünjes et al 2016 holzbecher et al 2005 assumed an environmental half life of 130 days for gd dtpa from modelling breakthrough curves of column experiments based on these findings massmann et al 2008 used this half life to calculate groundwater residence times from the attenuation of the gdanth signal in the aquifer predictions based on this approach depend on the precise quantification of the hydrodynamic dispersion and dilution which can be susceptible to large errors further the degradation of the ligand dtpa and its inorganic complexes is in general thought to be photochemical hinck et al 1997 means et al 1980 metsärinne et al 2004 gd dtpa appeared relatively inert for example in column experiments carried out over a 70 day period under a range of redox conditions dulski et al 2011 menahem et al 2016 in the presence of other metal ions especially fe3 zn2 cu2 other heavy lanthanides or yttrium y3 transmetallation can be slow due to the low concentrations involved but it cannot be neglected over long time scales möller et al 2011 möller and dulski 2010 a modeling study by schijf and christy 2018 has shown that elevated concentrations of calcium and magnesium can destabilize gd dtpa in seawater 4 determination of anthropogenic gadolinium and differentiation from naturally occurring gadolinium gadolinium is also naturally occurring in the environment as a result of the dissolution of minerals it is one of the elements in the lanthanide series these elements are frequently referred to as the rare earth elements ree a term that usually also includes the elements scandium sc and yttrium y except for two elements all lanthanides exist only in a trivalent oxidation state cerium ce can exist as both ce3 and ce4 and europium eu as both eu2 and eu3 which affects their solubility and melting temperature due to their different redox behavior these two elements are decoupled from the coherent chemical behavior of the rest of the lanthanides goldstein and jacobsen 1988 möller et al 2002 the abundance of lanthanides follows the oddo harkins rule elements with even atomic numbers are naturally more abundant than those with odd atomic numbers this leads to a typical zig zag shape on logarithmic plots of concentration versus atomic number to avoid this zig zag shape lanthanide concentrations are usually normalized against a geological reference which allows anthropogenically induced anomalies to be detected as has been demonstrated for gd lanthanum la and samarium sm in aqueous samples kulaksiz and bau 2013 2011b for water samples reference compositions such as those of the post archean australian shale paas composite mclennan 1989 the north american shale composite nasc gromet et al 1984 the upper continental crust ucc taylor and mclennan 1985 or rarely the mud of queensland muq kamber et al 2005 compositions have been used for normalization the choice of geological reference has been a matter of debate the use of a newly defined european shale eus reference has been recommended recently for european water samples to increase acceptance by national regulatory authorities bau et al 2018 averaging data from paas nasc and eus the same authors have also suggested a world shale wsh bau et al 2018 global scale investigations could benefit from worldwide use of the wsh reference however for investigations of local element enrichment phenomena site specific geological reference compositions may be more appropriate as they better represent the natural background at present inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms is the technique most commonly used to measure lanthanides to increase the analytical sensitivity and ensure precise measurements of low lanthanide concentrations in aqueous solutions with complex matrices liquid chromatography lc can be directly coupled to icp ms systems for matrix removal and lanthanide preconcentration brünjes et al 2016 hathorne et al 2012 lagerström et al 2013 offline or online preconcentration methods often use ion exchange resins with iminodiacetate functional groups for the enrichment of lanthanides pyrzynska et al 2016 a crucial step before any preconcentration by ion exchange resins is the degradation of the gbcas e g by uv and h2o2 due to their chemical properties gbcas are not retained unless the chelate complexes are degraded and the gd ions are released more specialized lc systems are equipped with hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic size exclusion chromatography sec or reversed phase chromatography rpc columns which can be coupled with ms systems to enable the direct measurement of specific gbcas species and transformation products birka et al 2016 clases et al 2018b künnemeyer et al 2009 telgmann et al 2012 the location of gd precipitated in brains other human tissue or other species has commonly been determined by laser ablation coupled with icp ms clases et al 2018a 2018b fingerhut et al 2018 lingott et al 2016 in many investigations total gd gdtotal is measured because the anthropogenic component gdanth cannot be measured directly the geogenic gd gd background needs to be subtracted equation 3 the advantage of this approach is that it has a significant lower limit of detection than methods that measure individual species of gbcas equation 3 gd anth gd total gd there is no standard methodology on how to quantify gd in an aqueous sample which brought up a variety of different approaches all calculations to determine gdanth are based on either interpolations or extrapolations of gd from the shale normalized lanthanides lnsn by means of linear logarithmic geometric equations or third order polynomial fit table 2 slight differences apart from the mathematical methods consist in the assumption of the specific behavior of gd compared to the other lanthanides while bau and dulski 1996 and kulaksiz and bau 2011a assume that gd behaves as a light lanthanide in freshwater systems and preferably use the light lanthanides praseodymium pr neodymium nd sm and terbium tb within their equations hissler et al 2015 and ogata and terakado 2006 include the heavier lanthanide dysprosium dy the approach from möller et al 2002 is the only one with no implicit assumption about the behavior of gd compared to that of lighter middle or heavier lanthanides and includes all lanthanides besides ce and eu due to their natural occurring anomalies lawrence et al 2009 most calculation methods are avoiding these elements with naturally occurring anomalies as an exception the method developed by kulaksiz and bau 2013 uses the redox sensitive element eu excluding slightly acidic colloid rich conditions and enrichments in the middle lanthanides the use of lanthanides with any anomalous concentrations however limits the applicability of the method in order to compare and evaluate the different approaches we used published data on lanthanides in freshwater systems under a variety of hydrochemical conditions we compared the gd anomaly defined as the ratio between the shale normalized measured gd concentration and the shale normalized geogenic background concentration gdsn gd sn and the concentrations obtained for gdanth using the different normalization and interpolation extrapolation approaches the results of our analysis clearly show that the geological reference used for normalization has only a minor effect up to 7 on the calculated gdanth concentration fig 3 b and c table s1 the comparison also elucidates that the smaller the gd anomaly the less important is the choice of geological reference nevertheless the different approaches resulted in a broad range of amplitudes for gd anomalies fig 3a gadolinium anomalies calculated for wiembach creek varied only within a range of 4 while those in samples from guériniec groundwater gw and the delaware river varied by up to 28 and 24 respectively any gd anomaly greater than 1 0 in theory implies that gdanth is present in the sample however this threshold is misleading for most of the samples selected from the published literature since the authors assumed that the samples contained no gdanth fig 3a to avoid overestimation of gdanth some investigators have used gd anomaly thresholds of 1 2 1 3 1 4 or 1 5 bau et al 2006 petelet giraud et al 2009 rabiet et al 2009 rozemeijer et al 2012 others adjusted the geogenic gd concentration by a factor of 1 1 1 15 or 1 2 lawrence 2010 lawrence et al 2009 möller et al 2003 respectively often this is justified by natural gd anomalies found in gdanth uncontaminated waters particularly in acid mine drainage environments and seawater de baar et al 1985 migaszewski and gałuszka 2015 however from the above cited studies which use corrections only lawrence 2010 is working with seawater conditions to avoid any bias we did not include a correction factor to our calculations in contrast to all other methods the calculations based on the two methods by kulaksiz and bau resulted in gd anomalies closest to 1 0 in agreement with the assumptions by the authors that no anthropogenic gd was present in the samples fig 3b table s1 the largest gd anomalies were obtained using the approaches from hissler et al 2015 ogata and terakado 2006 and möller et al 2002 with exceptions for the han and elbe rivers fig 3b and c comparing the methods gd anomaly differences are particularly high if concentrations of the higher lanthanides tb and dy are more abundant compared to the lighter lanthanides nd and sm fig 3a table s1 while the influence of tb and dy can be decisive using approaches from hissler et al 2015 or ogata and terakado 2006 the advantage of the third grade polynomial fit approach by möller et al 2002 is the larger number of elements included this reduces the influence of minor anomalies and element specific measurement errors on the interpolated geogenic gd 5 measures to halt the increase in gadolinium concentrations in freshwater environments once gbcas reach the aquatic environment they are diluted to ng l or to μg l levels which is at least an order of magnitude below the free gd toxicity level for humans merbach et al 2013 however the potential toxicity of gd needs to be considered together with that of the entire lanthanum series as they form a uniform group of elements blinova et al 2018 anthropogenically elevated concentrations of other lanthanides further increase the risks to aquatic ecosystems because aquatic organisms absorb lanthanides through their skin gills and digestive systems kulaksiz 2012 kulaksiz and bau 2013 lingott et al 2016 unaltered gbcas have been shown not to sorb to materials such as activated carbon contrary to the findings of elizalde gonzález et al 2017 but once acidified they release gd3 with a high sorption affinity to many adsorbers anastopoulos et al 2016 elizalde gonzález et al 2017 kovalova et al 2013 patra et al 2017 the sorption of gd3 onto activated carbon strongly depends on the ph of the solution pourret and houben 2018 the environmental mobility of gd3 is similar to that of the other lanthanides and mainly involves complexation with dissolved organic carbon doc under slightly acidic or neutral conditions pédrot et al 2010 this complexation is based on electrostatic interactions and multidentate bonding between positively charged gd3 and inorganic anions or negatively charged organic ligands byrne and kim 1990 davranche et al 2015 luo and byrne 2004 in contrast to natural lanthanides gbcas have so far not been reported in sewage sludge even though coagulation flocculation is reported to remove at least some of the linear gbcas lawrence et al 2010 neubert 2008 telgmann et al 2012 verplanck et al 2010 most of the commercially used coagulants are based on ferric or aluminum salts e g fecl3 and al2 so4 3 which are lewis acids and form acidic microenvironments lee et al 2014 under these conditions linear gbcas are destabilized resulting in rapid transmetallation rabiet et al 2014 the formation of fe oxide flocs further assists in the removal of gd3 from solution due to the high sorption affinity of lanthanides towards iron phases davranche et al 2008 2004 once gd3 is released from gbca complexes this sorption affinity could be utilized to recover gd from sewage water nassar et al 2015 stepka et al 2018 water suppliers and stps seek to eliminate gbcas lingott et al 2016 rogowska et al 2018 thomsen 2017 promising results have been achieved using advanced oxidation processes based on in situ formation of oh radicals by means of various chemical photochemical sonochemical or electrochemical reactions oturan and aaron 2014 while direct reactions between gbcas and ozone are insignificant the oh radicals they produce can result in degradation of gbcas cyris et al 2013 treatment with a combination of uv c irradiation and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 effectively degrades gbcas within 24 h bichler et al 2016 low energy 15 w irradiation with uv c over long periods of time 12 h has been shown to degrade all types of gbcas but these conditions cannot be met by most commercial water sanitation facilities brünjes et al 2017 birka et al 2016 reported a series of degradation products from the linear gd bopta complexes after applying uv irradiation while other complexes such as the macrocyclic gd dota and gd bt do3a and the linear gd dtpa showed no degradation even after 300 min because of this duration of exposure to uv the study does not simulate conditions found in natural environments stps or end of pipe treatments of drinking water purification birka et al 2016 thomsen 2017 so far there is no systematic study on the stability of gbcas regarding end of pipe uv treatments since the human uptake of potential harmful gbca transformation products is of special concern further studies are recommended to reduce gbcas contamination of drinking water a few starting points can be considered during drinking water production improved water purification using expensive reverse osmosis would be required as this is the only efficient way to fully remove gbcas lawrence et al 2010 reverse osmosis can be applied as drinking water treatment or as the last step of sewage water treatment to prevent gd emissions into the aquatic environment because of the high percentage of outpatients undergoing mri scans treating only hospital effluents would not prevent the increasing input of gbcas into freshwater water resources the simplest way to reduce the input of gd into the aquatic environment and its potential health risk would be to collect urine from patients for at least 24 h following the administration of gbcas this would require urine collection not only in hospitals but also at the patients homes urine collection bags can be made leak proof by including super absorbent polymers a trial in germany found that although medical staff were skeptical about integrating these bags into their existing routines there was a high level of acceptance by patients niederste hollenberg et al 2018 collecting urine would also allow to recover and recycle gd from gbcas and prevent the technologically critical element gd from being lost into aquatic environments cobelo garcía et al 2015 extraction procedures from polymer matrices would need to involve the degradation of gbcas but benefit from the high concentrations of the recycling target for example gbcas could be degraded by a combination of h2o2 and uv radiation and recovered by using a variety of existing green technology methods such as biosorption that are already used for lanthanides from wastewater pereao et al 2018 in contrast recovering diluted gd in sewage systems or after stps would be economically less attractive for recycling 6 conclusion due to their ability to significantly enhance the contrast of mri scans there is currently no viable alternative to gbcas for medical use mri will develop towards higher resolutions but the use of gd for mri contrast agents remains necessary in general gbcas are renally excreted with plasma elimination half lives of 1 5 34 h however there is increasing evidence that some of the gd may be retained in the human body but so far the exact processes and amounts remain unknown as conventional sewage water treatment cannot eliminate gbcas they contaminate freshwater systems which provide our drinking water resources gbca concentrations in drinking water the main pathway for unintentional human intake are still at the nanogram per liter levels but will further increase as soon as they enter the stomach their stability is reduced by the acidity of the gastrointestinal fluids unaltered gbcas are highly mobile and neither retained by activated carbon filters nor present in sewage sludge promising results to degrade and remove gbcas have been achieved using advanced oxidation processes macrocyclic gbcas are more stable against degradation than linear gbcas but besides reverse osmosis no other advanced water treatment technique is capable to fully eliminate gbcas uv radiation can alter gbcas and their transformation products may enhance the risk of adverse health effects if the treatment is utilized as an end of pipe solution the amount of gbca contamination in freshwater environments also referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium is determined using a variety of calculation methods in water bodies with low concentrations of gdanth compared to the geogenic background concentration the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty applying any corrections to account for natural gd anomalies should be based on site specific conditions rather than on gd anomalies from literature in our comparison the approach from möller et al 2002 is the most holistic using a larger number of elements which reduces the influence of minor anomalies and element specific measurement errors the assessment of gdanth in drinking water would benefit from a coordinated approach to determine gd anomalies and gdanth concentrations a recognized standard methodology would also be beneficial for the acceptance of gdanth as a sewage water indicator and quantitative tracer temporal changes of gbca emission patterns in rivers can be used to determine groundwater residence times and river aquifer interactions to improve our understanding of these complex subsurface aquatic systems even if gd emissions are temporarily reduced due to the covid 19 pandemic increasing emissions are expected in future if no measures are taken at present the technologically critical element gd is being lost into the aquatic environment for example 19 tons year in the eu and 21 tons year in the usa considering the total environmental burden of mining and extracting gd from ore and in the perspective of a circular economy the collection and recycling of gd from the urine of patients should be considered best practice in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17786,the increasing use of gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas for magnetic resonance imaging is leading to widespread contamination of freshwater and drinking water systems contrary to previous assumptions that gbcas are stable throughout the water cycle they can degrade the stability of gbcas depends largely on their organic ligands but also on the physicochemical conditions there is specific concern regarding uv end of pipe water treatments which may degrade gbcas degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects this is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater gbcas concentrations in aquatic systems often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium are determined using a variety of calculation methods where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty the current covid 19 crisis will in the short term drastically decrease the input of gbcas to freshwater systems temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities collecting urine from all patients following mri examinations could be a way forward to halt the generally increasing concentrations of gd in drinking water systems and recover this technologically critical element graphical abstract image 1 keywords anthropogenic gadolinium gadolinium based contrast agents gadolinium anomaly drinking water micropollutants covid 19 1 magnetic resonance imaging and the increasing use of gadolinium based contrast agents magnetic resonance imaging mri is a versatile radiological tool for generating detailed images that can be used to assist in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases affecting the brain spinal cord heart blood vessels bones and joints it can also be used to check the health of organs such as e g breasts kidneys ovaries the liver the pancreas and the prostate in contrast to x rays and computerized tomography ct scans mri does not employ cell damaging ionizing radiation but the relaxation time of hydrogen nuclei excited by a strong external magnetic field to image organs and physiological processes in the body gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas are administered in mri to increase the contrast of these images and allow radiologists to more accurately identify neoplastic inflammatory and functional abnormalities bellin 2006 gbcas are strong chelate complexes in which the trivalent gadolinium ion gd3 is chelated by polyaminocarboxylic acid to avoid the toxic effects of free gadolinium gd because the ionic radius of gd is close to that of calcium ca 107 8 pm for gd3 and 114 pm for ca2 gd inhibits physiological processes that rely on ca bellin and van der molen 2008 two general types of gbca have been used to date linear open chain chelates and macrocyclic chelates both of which can exist in either ionic or non ionic forms fig s1 the ligands of clinically approved gbcas are all octadentate with all donor atoms coordinated gbcas shorten the longitudinal t1 and transverse t2 and t2 relaxation time constants of adjacent hydrogen nuclei in mri and thereby enhance contrast bellin and van der molen 2008 caravan et al 1999 gd is specifically well suited for the desired signal enhancement due to its strong magnetic moment and the presence of an additional water molecule in the inner sphere which completes the nine fold coordination of gd within gbca complexes burai et al 1997 chan and wong 2007 micskei et al 1993 because of its versatility availability and importance in modern diagnostics the use of mri and consequently also of gbcas is constantly increasing organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 gbcas are administered in 33 50 of all mri examinations either intravenously or by intra articular injection idée et al 2008 thomsen 2017 due to their small size around 500 da they are rapidly cleared from the intravascular space into the interstitial space and their biodistribution is therefore non specific bellin and van der molen 2008 gbcas are eliminated unmetabolized mostly by passive glomerular filtration in the kidney the residence time of a gbca within the body depends on the type of complex administered and the renal function of the patient the plasma elimination half lives of gbcas range from 1 5 h for healthy individuals up to 34 h for patients with reduced renal function idée et al 2008 joffe et al 1998 gbcas are generally considered to be safe and adverse effects are rarely observed kanda et al 2016 however in 2006 first links were established between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf and gbcas grobner 2006 marckmann 2006 concerns have since increased especially as gd deposits have been reported in brains bone skin and other tissues following gbca administration even in healthy patients kanda et al 2016 le fur and caravan 2019 montagne et al 2016 nehra et al 2018 xia et al 2010 the european medicines agency ema therefore released a warning and suspended the use within the eu of certain linear gbcas table 1 that are considered to present the highest risk of inducing nsf european medicines agency 2017 this has been legislated in all eu member states the us food and drug administration fda has issued an update of their medication guides in relation to the use of gbcas requiring a new class warning especially for patients with kidney dysfunction food and drug administration 2018 2017 other regulatory bodies in australia japan and canada have also released revised precautionary advices le fur and caravan 2019 the use of gbcas is not recommended for patients with renal failure since gbca s use was first approved in 1988 more than 460 million doses have been administered worldwide up to 2018 gibby et al 2019 in 2016 almost 200 000 mri scans using gbcas were conducted per day within the eu and the us combined organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 in germany the country with the highest mri use per capita fig 1 more than 32 000 mri scans are carried out per day resulting in an estimated annual emission of 4 tons of gadolinium assuming 50 of all mris use gbcas with 1 1 g gd per mri scan the corresponding figure for the whole of the eu is 19 tons 21 tons for the us and 0 3 tons for switzerland data from 2016 vriens et al 2017 calculated a total river borne discharge of 0 78 tons of gd from the concentrations of the four major rivers leaving switzerland with a sewage treatment plant stp contribution of around 83 for the same year compared to the late 1990s the gd emission in germany has doubled over the last 20 years bau and dulski 1996 kümmerer and helmers 2000 increasing concentrations of gd which can be attributed to the use of gbcas have been found in rivers groundwater and estuaries around the world hatje et al 2016 lerat hardy et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 in the vicinity of stp outlets gd concentrations are substantially higher than the geogenic background in general about a few nanograms per liter with up to 86 μg per liter parant et al 2018 at present the global spread of the sars cov 2 coronavirus and the covid 19 disease lead to a temporal decrease in gbcas use the paralysis in economic production and socialization leaves strong signals in the environment callaway et al 2020 in addition to the closure of factories and businesses a major concern for all countries has been the drastic effect on their health systems hospitals around the world have been preparing for this unprecedented situation for weeks and ramped up the number of medical intensive care units micus therefore non essential medical consultations examinations and surgeries including the use of mri have been postponed in order to free up hospital capacities and personnel medical facilities are currently performing about 80 fewer mri examinations and a significant reduction of gbca emissions is to be expected this will result in a temporal reduction of gd concentrations in freshwater systems fig 2 measuring and analyzing this transient gd signal could improve our understanding of environmental systems and provide a better database for the risk assessment of waterworks regarding inputs of xenobiotics or pathogens in future gbca concentrations in aquatic environments are likely to continue to rise due to the constantly increasing use of mri even though actual increasing gbca concentrations are still low this could become of concern in settings where drinking water is produced from raw water resources with a high proportion of recycled wastewater in this paper we review on the stabilities of gbcas their behavior in freshwater systems and the importance of the method to differentiate between naturally occurring and anthropogenic gd we conclude our review by suggestions how to reduce gbcas emissions 2 stability of gadolinium based contrast agents determined by their organic ligands it is not yet fully clear whether gbcas themselves their transformation products or the release of free gd are causing adverse health effects these remain fundamental topics for a better risk assessment le fur and caravan 2019 every substitution of gd3 from gbca complexes by other metal ions known as transmetallation can also increase the toxicity of gbcas by releasing toxic gd3 iron fe3 zinc zn2 and copper cu2 in particular are in focus to be possible substituents because of their similar or higher thermodynamic stability and in vivo concentrations le fur and caravan 2019 semelka et al 2019 swaminathan 2016 the degree of transmetallation of gbcas in humans has been assessed from zinc enhancement in urine following gbca administration which yielded evidence of possible reactions with other trace metals rogowska et al 2018 the inner sphere coordination of a single water molecule within the gd complex could be a critical aspect because it is potentially substituted by other preferably negatively charged ligands burai et al 1997 whether this reduces the stability of gbcas remains unclear and would be an important subject for future research gd complexes are susceptible to dissociation and in vivo dissociation can be favored by any interaction with biological competitors for the original gbca ligands such as the adenosine triphosphate atp present in human serum bazzicalupi et al 2012 port et al 2008 the same principle also applies in freshwater systems where other competitive ligands exist the kinetic thermodynamic or conditional stabilities of gbcas are measures that are often used to compare different species of gbcas regarding their possible transformation but their use is inconsistent and questionable the thermodynamic stability of gd complexes in solution is described as an equilibrium between gd ions gd their ligands l and the complexed form gdl for all gbcas the number of involved ligands is one which simplifies the equation to equation 1 g d l g d l and the thermodynamic stability constant ktherm is defined as equation 2 k t h e r m g d l g d l the kinetic stability depends on the activation energy ea and gd complexes are kinetically stable inert if ea is high enough to prevent the formation of any other complexes the inertness or stability of metal complexes is operationally defined beyer and angulo cornejo 2012 regard metal complexes to be inert if the exchange of ions takes longer than a minute at 25 c because the ea cannot include any possibly present catalyst which potentially lower reaction barriers morcos 2007 used the dissociation half life at ph 1 0 to assess and quantify the kinetic stability of gbcas the half lives vary from a few seconds to more than one month table 1 it may be convenient to compare kinetic stabilities with biological half lives but neither is able to indicate whether or not gbcas are transformed within the human body not to quantify the extent of such processes the dissociation half life depends on both ph and temperature for example the dissociation half life of the macrocyclic gd dota at ph 1 is 26 4 h at 37 c but 338 h at 25 c idée et al 2009 and the dota ligand has a dissociation half life of 85 days at ph 2 and more than 200 days at ph 5 wang et al 1992 idée et al 2009 used a comparative subdivision of the kinetic inertness into low medium or high to compare different gbcas but cannot resolve the question of gbca transformation within the human body the toxicological need for a measure that applies at the physiological ph of 7 4 has been tackled using the concept of conditional stability expressed as kcond it can be measured in vivo and considers the protonation constants of the ligand these constants can vary slightly depending on the methods used i e potentiometric measurement or competition experiments idée et al 2009 frenzel et al 2008 confirmed kcond as an good indicator for the in vivo stability of gbcas based on the release kinetics in human serum at physiological temperature and ph prybylski et al 2017 came to a different conclusion remodeling the data from frenzel et al 2008 using the dissociation rate and the balancing aspect of the association between gd and the gbca ligand they found that gbcas were less stable in humans than previously indicated by kcond the stability constants in table 1 show that macrocyclic gbcas are more stable than linear gbcas and that the linear ionic gcbas are more stable than linear non ionic gbcas the weakness in all stability concepts however is the assumption of equilibrium conditions since environmentally relevant conditions are likely to be more complex and not always in equilibrium prybylski et al 2017 the inversely proportional relationship between the release of gd from gbcas and their stability is generally accepted but the extent to which gbcas can be transformed within the human body and the exact processes involved still remains unresolved 3 the concentration of gadolinium based contrast agents is increasing in freshwater environments following their excretion via urine after the mri gbcas enter the sewage system and are released into surface waters as they are not removed by conventional sewage treatment plants anomalous occurrences of gd in rivers were first reported in 1996 bau and dulski 1996 since then gbcas have been found in the effluents from hospitals sewage water treatment plants as well as other surface waters birka et al 2013 künnemeyer et al 2009 lindner et al 2013 increased gd concentrations have even been reported in rural areas where there are no mri facilities in the catchments of the local sewage treatment plants brünjes et al 2016 rabiet et al 2009 this is due to the large number of patients who receive mri scans as outpatients and are then sent home elevated gd concentrations have been found in drinking water and are of increasing concern to waterworks as well as to the general public kulaksiz and bau 2011a lindner et al 2015 morteani et al 2006 richardson and kimura 2016 schmidt et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 gadolinium originating from gbcas is one of a series of emerging contaminants released from sewage systems which makes it a suitable indicator for other sewage water borne xenobiotics reoyo prats et al 2018 in general most studies in freshwater systems pool gbcas under the term anthropogenic gd gdanth which does not imply the transformation of gbcas we hereafter refer to gdanth when we do not distinguish between gbcas and their transformation products anthropogenic gd has been globally detected mainly in densely populated areas with highly developed health systems in europe bau and dulski 1996 dia et al 2000 elbaz poulichet et al 2002 knappe et al 2005 möller et al 2003 2000 petelet giraud et al 2009 in north america barber et al 2006 bau et al 2006 hatje et al 2016 verplanck et al 2005 in oceania lawrence et al 2009 lawrence and bariel 2010 lawrence and kamber 2006 in south america de campos and enzweiler 2016 merschel and bau 2015 africa atinkpahoun et al 2020 and in asia nozaki et al 2000 ogata and terakado 2006 song et al 2017 due to the widespread contamination of freshwater environments with gdanth a variety of hydrogeological investigations have used it as an ideal tracer in different hydrochemical settings assuming that all types of gbcas do not undergo degradation once released from stps barber et al 2006 bichler et al 2016 klaver et al 2014 möller et al 2011 2000 petelet giraud et al 2009 depending on the operating mode of an stp the effluent gd concentration may show a temporal variation daily to weekly because most mri scans are carried out during the daytime from monday to friday telgmann et al 2012 this transient signal can propagate into the groundwater and can be used to calculate groundwater transit times brünjes et al 2016 holzbecher et al 2005 assumed an environmental half life of 130 days for gd dtpa from modelling breakthrough curves of column experiments based on these findings massmann et al 2008 used this half life to calculate groundwater residence times from the attenuation of the gdanth signal in the aquifer predictions based on this approach depend on the precise quantification of the hydrodynamic dispersion and dilution which can be susceptible to large errors further the degradation of the ligand dtpa and its inorganic complexes is in general thought to be photochemical hinck et al 1997 means et al 1980 metsärinne et al 2004 gd dtpa appeared relatively inert for example in column experiments carried out over a 70 day period under a range of redox conditions dulski et al 2011 menahem et al 2016 in the presence of other metal ions especially fe3 zn2 cu2 other heavy lanthanides or yttrium y3 transmetallation can be slow due to the low concentrations involved but it cannot be neglected over long time scales möller et al 2011 möller and dulski 2010 a modeling study by schijf and christy 2018 has shown that elevated concentrations of calcium and magnesium can destabilize gd dtpa in seawater 4 determination of anthropogenic gadolinium and differentiation from naturally occurring gadolinium gadolinium is also naturally occurring in the environment as a result of the dissolution of minerals it is one of the elements in the lanthanide series these elements are frequently referred to as the rare earth elements ree a term that usually also includes the elements scandium sc and yttrium y except for two elements all lanthanides exist only in a trivalent oxidation state cerium ce can exist as both ce3 and ce4 and europium eu as both eu2 and eu3 which affects their solubility and melting temperature due to their different redox behavior these two elements are decoupled from the coherent chemical behavior of the rest of the lanthanides goldstein and jacobsen 1988 möller et al 2002 the abundance of lanthanides follows the oddo harkins rule elements with even atomic numbers are naturally more abundant than those with odd atomic numbers this leads to a typical zig zag shape on logarithmic plots of concentration versus atomic number to avoid this zig zag shape lanthanide concentrations are usually normalized against a geological reference which allows anthropogenically induced anomalies to be detected as has been demonstrated for gd lanthanum la and samarium sm in aqueous samples kulaksiz and bau 2013 2011b for water samples reference compositions such as those of the post archean australian shale paas composite mclennan 1989 the north american shale composite nasc gromet et al 1984 the upper continental crust ucc taylor and mclennan 1985 or rarely the mud of queensland muq kamber et al 2005 compositions have been used for normalization the choice of geological reference has been a matter of debate the use of a newly defined european shale eus reference has been recommended recently for european water samples to increase acceptance by national regulatory authorities bau et al 2018 averaging data from paas nasc and eus the same authors have also suggested a world shale wsh bau et al 2018 global scale investigations could benefit from worldwide use of the wsh reference however for investigations of local element enrichment phenomena site specific geological reference compositions may be more appropriate as they better represent the natural background at present inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms is the technique most commonly used to measure lanthanides to increase the analytical sensitivity and ensure precise measurements of low lanthanide concentrations in aqueous solutions with complex matrices liquid chromatography lc can be directly coupled to icp ms systems for matrix removal and lanthanide preconcentration brünjes et al 2016 hathorne et al 2012 lagerström et al 2013 offline or online preconcentration methods often use ion exchange resins with iminodiacetate functional groups for the enrichment of lanthanides pyrzynska et al 2016 a crucial step before any preconcentration by ion exchange resins is the degradation of the gbcas e g by uv and h2o2 due to their chemical properties gbcas are not retained unless the chelate complexes are degraded and the gd ions are released more specialized lc systems are equipped with hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic size exclusion chromatography sec or reversed phase chromatography rpc columns which can be coupled with ms systems to enable the direct measurement of specific gbcas species and transformation products birka et al 2016 clases et al 2018b künnemeyer et al 2009 telgmann et al 2012 the location of gd precipitated in brains other human tissue or other species has commonly been determined by laser ablation coupled with icp ms clases et al 2018a 2018b fingerhut et al 2018 lingott et al 2016 in many investigations total gd gdtotal is measured because the anthropogenic component gdanth cannot be measured directly the geogenic gd gd background needs to be subtracted equation 3 the advantage of this approach is that it has a significant lower limit of detection than methods that measure individual species of gbcas equation 3 gd anth gd total gd there is no standard methodology on how to quantify gd in an aqueous sample which brought up a variety of different approaches all calculations to determine gdanth are based on either interpolations or extrapolations of gd from the shale normalized lanthanides lnsn by means of linear logarithmic geometric equations or third order polynomial fit table 2 slight differences apart from the mathematical methods consist in the assumption of the specific behavior of gd compared to the other lanthanides while bau and dulski 1996 and kulaksiz and bau 2011a assume that gd behaves as a light lanthanide in freshwater systems and preferably use the light lanthanides praseodymium pr neodymium nd sm and terbium tb within their equations hissler et al 2015 and ogata and terakado 2006 include the heavier lanthanide dysprosium dy the approach from möller et al 2002 is the only one with no implicit assumption about the behavior of gd compared to that of lighter middle or heavier lanthanides and includes all lanthanides besides ce and eu due to their natural occurring anomalies lawrence et al 2009 most calculation methods are avoiding these elements with naturally occurring anomalies as an exception the method developed by kulaksiz and bau 2013 uses the redox sensitive element eu excluding slightly acidic colloid rich conditions and enrichments in the middle lanthanides the use of lanthanides with any anomalous concentrations however limits the applicability of the method in order to compare and evaluate the different approaches we used published data on lanthanides in freshwater systems under a variety of hydrochemical conditions we compared the gd anomaly defined as the ratio between the shale normalized measured gd concentration and the shale normalized geogenic background concentration gdsn gd sn and the concentrations obtained for gdanth using the different normalization and interpolation extrapolation approaches the results of our analysis clearly show that the geological reference used for normalization has only a minor effect up to 7 on the calculated gdanth concentration fig 3 b and c table s1 the comparison also elucidates that the smaller the gd anomaly the less important is the choice of geological reference nevertheless the different approaches resulted in a broad range of amplitudes for gd anomalies fig 3a gadolinium anomalies calculated for wiembach creek varied only within a range of 4 while those in samples from guériniec groundwater gw and the delaware river varied by up to 28 and 24 respectively any gd anomaly greater than 1 0 in theory implies that gdanth is present in the sample however this threshold is misleading for most of the samples selected from the published literature since the authors assumed that the samples contained no gdanth fig 3a to avoid overestimation of gdanth some investigators have used gd anomaly thresholds of 1 2 1 3 1 4 or 1 5 bau et al 2006 petelet giraud et al 2009 rabiet et al 2009 rozemeijer et al 2012 others adjusted the geogenic gd concentration by a factor of 1 1 1 15 or 1 2 lawrence 2010 lawrence et al 2009 möller et al 2003 respectively often this is justified by natural gd anomalies found in gdanth uncontaminated waters particularly in acid mine drainage environments and seawater de baar et al 1985 migaszewski and gałuszka 2015 however from the above cited studies which use corrections only lawrence 2010 is working with seawater conditions to avoid any bias we did not include a correction factor to our calculations in contrast to all other methods the calculations based on the two methods by kulaksiz and bau resulted in gd anomalies closest to 1 0 in agreement with the assumptions by the authors that no anthropogenic gd was present in the samples fig 3b table s1 the largest gd anomalies were obtained using the approaches from hissler et al 2015 ogata and terakado 2006 and möller et al 2002 with exceptions for the han and elbe rivers fig 3b and c comparing the methods gd anomaly differences are particularly high if concentrations of the higher lanthanides tb and dy are more abundant compared to the lighter lanthanides nd and sm fig 3a table s1 while the influence of tb and dy can be decisive using approaches from hissler et al 2015 or ogata and terakado 2006 the advantage of the third grade polynomial fit approach by möller et al 2002 is the larger number of elements included this reduces the influence of minor anomalies and element specific measurement errors on the interpolated geogenic gd 5 measures to halt the increase in gadolinium concentrations in freshwater environments once gbcas reach the aquatic environment they are diluted to ng l or to μg l levels which is at least an order of magnitude below the free gd toxicity level for humans merbach et al 2013 however the potential toxicity of gd needs to be considered together with that of the entire lanthanum series as they form a uniform group of elements blinova et al 2018 anthropogenically elevated concentrations of other lanthanides further increase the risks to aquatic ecosystems because aquatic organisms absorb lanthanides through their skin gills and digestive systems kulaksiz 2012 kulaksiz and bau 2013 lingott et al 2016 unaltered gbcas have been shown not to sorb to materials such as activated carbon contrary to the findings of elizalde gonzález et al 2017 but once acidified they release gd3 with a high sorption affinity to many adsorbers anastopoulos et al 2016 elizalde gonzález et al 2017 kovalova et al 2013 patra et al 2017 the sorption of gd3 onto activated carbon strongly depends on the ph of the solution pourret and houben 2018 the environmental mobility of gd3 is similar to that of the other lanthanides and mainly involves complexation with dissolved organic carbon doc under slightly acidic or neutral conditions pédrot et al 2010 this complexation is based on electrostatic interactions and multidentate bonding between positively charged gd3 and inorganic anions or negatively charged organic ligands byrne and kim 1990 davranche et al 2015 luo and byrne 2004 in contrast to natural lanthanides gbcas have so far not been reported in sewage sludge even though coagulation flocculation is reported to remove at least some of the linear gbcas lawrence et al 2010 neubert 2008 telgmann et al 2012 verplanck et al 2010 most of the commercially used coagulants are based on ferric or aluminum salts e g fecl3 and al2 so4 3 which are lewis acids and form acidic microenvironments lee et al 2014 under these conditions linear gbcas are destabilized resulting in rapid transmetallation rabiet et al 2014 the formation of fe oxide flocs further assists in the removal of gd3 from solution due to the high sorption affinity of lanthanides towards iron phases davranche et al 2008 2004 once gd3 is released from gbca complexes this sorption affinity could be utilized to recover gd from sewage water nassar et al 2015 stepka et al 2018 water suppliers and stps seek to eliminate gbcas lingott et al 2016 rogowska et al 2018 thomsen 2017 promising results have been achieved using advanced oxidation processes based on in situ formation of oh radicals by means of various chemical photochemical sonochemical or electrochemical reactions oturan and aaron 2014 while direct reactions between gbcas and ozone are insignificant the oh radicals they produce can result in degradation of gbcas cyris et al 2013 treatment with a combination of uv c irradiation and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 effectively degrades gbcas within 24 h bichler et al 2016 low energy 15 w irradiation with uv c over long periods of time 12 h has been shown to degrade all types of gbcas but these conditions cannot be met by most commercial water sanitation facilities brünjes et al 2017 birka et al 2016 reported a series of degradation products from the linear gd bopta complexes after applying uv irradiation while other complexes such as the macrocyclic gd dota and gd bt do3a and the linear gd dtpa showed no degradation even after 300 min because of this duration of exposure to uv the study does not simulate conditions found in natural environments stps or end of pipe treatments of drinking water purification birka et al 2016 thomsen 2017 so far there is no systematic study on the stability of gbcas regarding end of pipe uv treatments since the human uptake of potential harmful gbca transformation products is of special concern further studies are recommended to reduce gbcas contamination of drinking water a few starting points can be considered during drinking water production improved water purification using expensive reverse osmosis would be required as this is the only efficient way to fully remove gbcas lawrence et al 2010 reverse osmosis can be applied as drinking water treatment or as the last step of sewage water treatment to prevent gd emissions into the aquatic environment because of the high percentage of outpatients undergoing mri scans treating only hospital effluents would not prevent the increasing input of gbcas into freshwater water resources the simplest way to reduce the input of gd into the aquatic environment and its potential health risk would be to collect urine from patients for at least 24 h following the administration of gbcas this would require urine collection not only in hospitals but also at the patients homes urine collection bags can be made leak proof by including super absorbent polymers a trial in germany found that although medical staff were skeptical about integrating these bags into their existing routines there was a high level of acceptance by patients niederste hollenberg et al 2018 collecting urine would also allow to recover and recycle gd from gbcas and prevent the technologically critical element gd from being lost into aquatic environments cobelo garcía et al 2015 extraction procedures from polymer matrices would need to involve the degradation of gbcas but benefit from the high concentrations of the recycling target for example gbcas could be degraded by a combination of h2o2 and uv radiation and recovered by using a variety of existing green technology methods such as biosorption that are already used for lanthanides from wastewater pereao et al 2018 in contrast recovering diluted gd in sewage systems or after stps would be economically less attractive for recycling 6 conclusion due to their ability to significantly enhance the contrast of mri scans there is currently no viable alternative to gbcas for medical use mri will develop towards higher resolutions but the use of gd for mri contrast agents remains necessary in general gbcas are renally excreted with plasma elimination half lives of 1 5 34 h however there is increasing evidence that some of the gd may be retained in the human body but so far the exact processes and amounts remain unknown as conventional sewage water treatment cannot eliminate gbcas they contaminate freshwater systems which provide our drinking water resources gbca concentrations in drinking water the main pathway for unintentional human intake are still at the nanogram per liter levels but will further increase as soon as they enter the stomach their stability is reduced by the acidity of the gastrointestinal fluids unaltered gbcas are highly mobile and neither retained by activated carbon filters nor present in sewage sludge promising results to degrade and remove gbcas have been achieved using advanced oxidation processes macrocyclic gbcas are more stable against degradation than linear gbcas but besides reverse osmosis no other advanced water treatment technique is capable to fully eliminate gbcas uv radiation can alter gbcas and their transformation products may enhance the risk of adverse health effects if the treatment is utilized as an end of pipe solution the amount of gbca contamination in freshwater environments also referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium is determined using a variety of calculation methods in water bodies with low concentrations of gdanth compared to the geogenic background concentration the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty applying any corrections to account for natural gd anomalies should be based on site specific conditions rather than on gd anomalies from literature in our comparison the approach from möller et al 2002 is the most holistic using a larger number of elements which reduces the influence of minor anomalies and element specific measurement errors the assessment of gdanth in drinking water would benefit from a coordinated approach to determine gd anomalies and gdanth concentrations a recognized standard methodology would also be beneficial for the acceptance of gdanth as a sewage water indicator and quantitative tracer temporal changes of gbca emission patterns in rivers can be used to determine groundwater residence times and river aquifer interactions to improve our understanding of these complex subsurface aquatic systems even if gd emissions are temporarily reduced due to the covid 19 pandemic increasing emissions are expected in future if no measures are taken at present the technologically critical element gd is being lost into the aquatic environment for example 19 tons year in the eu and 21 tons year in the usa considering the total environmental burden of mining and extracting gd from ore and in the perspective of a circular economy the collection and recycling of gd from the urine of patients should be considered best practice in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17787,since the early 2000s dual frequency ultrasound dfus has received much attention for synergistically enhanced elimination of organic pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms from water in the present review we have surveyed recent developments in acoustic physics to elucidate the mechanism of synergistic effect under exposure of aqueous media to dfus briefly the nonlinear dynamics of microbubbles upon dfus exposure produces additional frequencies such as harmonics subharmonics ultraharmonics and combination frequencies these increase the probability of bubbles collapse thereby enhancing cavitation and generating more reactive oxygen species ros for advanced oxidation processes aops further literature data on ros generation chemical degradation and microbial inactivation in aqueous media through dfus alone and dfus based aops involving oxidants or catalysts have been discussed in this regard optimal frequency combination sonoreactor type and transducer arrangement appear to be key parameters for achieving a high synergistic effect strengths and shortcomings of dfus to water treatment and disinfection have been identified and future research directions have been proposed though most studies were conducted on pure matrix free aqueous solutions these aops could be applicable for treating real waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords degradation disinfection dual frequency ultrasound inactivation synergistic effect water treatment 1 introduction over the last few decades low 100 khz and high frequency 100 khz ultrasound has been extensively used in advanced oxidation processes aops for water and wastewater treatment and disinfection this is due to the generation of h2o2 and reactive oxygen species ros such as ho and ho2 from the collapse of microbubbles at high local pressures and temperatures during acoustic cavitation in turn the produced ros efficiently oxidize organic pollutants and inactivate microorganisms there have been representative reviews on ultrasound based aops for eliminating organic pollutants ince et al 2001 ince 2018 adewuyi 2005a b joseph et al 2009 mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 pang et al 2011 rayaroth et al 2016 sathishkumar et al 2016 panda and manickam 2017 chu et al 2017 yap et al 2019 and pathogenic microorganisms matafonova and batoev 2019 zupanc et al 2019 in aqueous media however these reviews have focused on the application of a single frequency ultrasound and the combinations of different frequencies have not been addressed meanwhile investigations of dual frequency ultrasound dfus go back the early 2000s and the associated effects such as enhancement of cavitation and occurrence of synergism were reported though dfus has been applied in water treatment and disinfection for decades the mechanism of its action in aqueous media with resultant synergistic effects toward oxidation processes has not been revealed so far the objective of the present review is to elucidate the mechanism of synergistic effect under exposure of aqueous media to dfus by addressing a state of the art of acoustic physics and provide an overview of published research on the degradation of organic pollutants and inactivation of microorganisms by dfus in the absence and presence of oxidants catalysts hybrid aops strengths and shortcomings of dfus to water treatment and disinfection have been identified and future research directions have been proposed 2 synergistic effects under dual frequency ultrasonication 2 1 mechanism until recently there have been no published studies which clarified and summarized the advantages of dfus over the single frequency ultrasound for water treatment and disinfection purposes only in 2017 zhang et al published a fundamental theoretical study and described the gas bubble oscillations in liquids under dual frequency acoustic excitation the authors reviewed previous related research and answered the questions about the interaction of two acoustic waves in aqueous media it is known that the nonlinear dynamics of bubbles upon dfus exposure generates additional frequencies f i e harmonics nf n 2 3 4 subharmonics f 2 f 3 f 4 and ultraharmonics 2n 1 f 2 n 1 2 lauterborn 1976 alongside these additional frequencies zhang et al 2017 have demonstrated the generation of other frequencies so called combination frequencies under nonlinear interaction of two acoustic waves at different frequencies the combination frequencies represent an algebraic sum or a difference of all existing oscillations table 1 accordingly there is a number of frequencies with various intensities excited if ω 1 is one angular frequency of the dual frequency driving sound field and ω 2 is another angular frequency all generated frequencies can be presented as follows besides the bands corresponding to the main frequencies and the harmonics the power spectrum illustrates much more bands fig 1 furthermore the corresponding frequencies of these bands can be expressed by linear combination of the frequencies of the two component sound waves i e ω p nω 1 mω 2 n and m are two integers as shown in fig 1 the numerical data on frequencies and their intensities are in a good agreement with experimental results ma et al 2010 which confirm the validity of theoretical calculations it was also shown that harmonics umemura et al 1997 subharmonics jin et al 1998 ultraharmonics petošić et al 2009 and combination frequencies liu and hsieh 2009 contributed to the cavitation specifically nguyen et al 2017 used the most intensive second harmonic f 2 and the first ultraharmonic f 1 5 for measuring cavitation effects more recently ye et al 2019 have advanced a theoretical knowledge about enhancing cavitation effect upon dfus excitation it has been found that the oscillation of cavitation bubbles is more unstable and easier to collapse in dfus field than those in the single frequency mode a significant enhancement of cavitation effect was also numerically shown in case of three different frequency combinations 30 50 40 60 and 50 70 khz the authors conclude that dfus can destroy the stable oscillation and accelerate the collapse of the bubble in view of the above investigations we suggest that the mechanism of synergistic effect under dfus irradiation of aqueous media lies in the nonlinearity of bubbles dynamics which generate additional frequencies as a result harmonics subharmonics ultraharmonics and combination frequencies are added to two basic frequencies the additional oscillations excite a greater number of bubbles and their collapse resulting in more intense cavitation finally the enhanced cavitation leads to the elevated ros levels which in turn provide a synergistic effect in oxidation processes 2 2 ros generation generally a synergistic effect under dfus exposure can be evaluated through generation of sonoluminescence sl and ros primarily ho degradation of organic pollutants and inactivation of microorganisms quantitatively a synergistic effect is expressed through a synergistic coefficient index which is calculated as the ratio of the parameter measured under dfus to the algebraic sum of parameters measured under single frequencies the obtained value greater than 1 0 indicates a synergistic effect otherwise one can conclude about the antagonistic or additive effect concentration of ros is often referred to the sonochemical yield efficiency mason and peters 2002 wood et al 2017 ho production can be measured indirectly by ki fricke salicylic acid or terephthalate dosimetry sutkar and gogate 2009 there is a number of representative studies which demonstrated the synergistic effect of dfus in relation to ros generation table 2 a synergism was reported in terms of sonochemical yield sl and fluorescence intensity specifically the sonochemical yield of dfus was shown to be much higher than the algebraic sum of the yields produced separately by single frequency irradiations zhu et al 2000 feng et al 2002 tatake and pandit 2002 zhao et al 2002 ebrahiminia et al 2016 similarly dfus synergistically enhanced the cavitation via increased intensity of sl and luminol based sonochemoluminescence which is proportional to the number of collapses and ho exposure yasuda et al 2007 brotchie et al 2008a b a highest synergistic effect of sonochemiluminescence and h2o2 production was reported at frequencies of 28 970 khz lee and oh 2011 a synergistic enhancement of the cavitation by increasing sl intensity up to 30 fold was also reported without referring to ho generation under 20 355 1056 khz brotchie et al 2007 20 700 khz iernetti et al 1997 27 2 730 880 khz ciuti et al 2000 2003 and 20 355 khz dezhkunov 2003 kanthale et al 2008 irradiation nevertheless indirect ho detection by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 2 hydroxyterephthalate ion showed the synergistic coefficients 1 which indicate the enhanced ho generation by dfus yasuda et al 2007 barati et al 2007 ninomiya et al 2014 tabatabaei et al 2019 this confirms the additional cavitation activities during simultaneous application of two frequencies 2 3 sonoreactor types and transducer arrangements in dfus batch scale experiments following basic geometrical types of sonoreactors are commonly applied a rectangular parallelepiped a hexagonal prism and a cylinder these are space geometric figures of different volumes from hundreds of millilitres to several litres the most widely used sonoreactor represents a rectangular parallelepiped onto sides of which the flat transducers of high frequency emissions can be attached using this geometrical type both orthogonal on the adjacent sides and opposite on the opposite sides transducer arrangements can be easily designed specifically the orthogonally and oppositely positioned transducers emit ultrasound at a right angle and in parallel respectively the second type a hexagonal prism was first applied by gogate et al 2004 for triple frequency ultrasonication herein the transducers were positioned on the opposite parallel sides of a prism this sonoreactor was further modified by tiong et al 2017 however its potential has not been fully reached in this work due to the inefficient design placing six glass tubes into the hexagonal shaped reactor the third type a cylinder is primarily used for generating ultrasound by horn at the top and orthogonally on the sides or oppositely at the bottom positioned transducers regarding transducer arrangements there is a complex dependence of the synergistic effect on the orthogonal or opposite arrangement so far only two studies have compared the synergistic effect under both orthogonal and opposite dual irradiation zhao et al 2009 lee and oh 2011 specifically the synergistic effect at 28 28 khz in terms of ho generation and toc removal was more pronounced in the orthogonal system rather than in the opposite one zhao et al 2009 the orthogonal arrangement was also more beneficial at low frequencies of 28 28 khz and power of 100 and 150 w an irradiation side table 3 however the opposite system was more effective when involving high frequencies 28 970 584 584 khz at the same power levels a contrary result was observed at higher power of 200 w an irradiation side the synergistic coefficients at 584 970 khz were nearly equal in both orthogonal and opposite modes table 3 evidently the synergism also strongly depends on the acoustic power summarizing a complex relationship between the synergistic coefficients dfus efficiency and frequency power transducer arrangement needs more research 2 4 frequency dependence considering the synergistic effect of dfus as a function of frequency suzuki et al 2004 observed the synergistic effect below 100 khz more recently nguyen et al 2017 have comprehensively investigated the dependence of cavitation chemical and mechanical effect thresholds on ultrasonic frequency in the range of 22 4880 khz the cavitation threshold is defined as the minimum amplitude of sound pressure required to initiate acoustic cavitation as shown in fig 2 these thresholds are in direct proportion to the frequency this implies that the cavitation chemical and mechanical effect thresholds decreased with decreasing frequency in other words one low frequency tens of khz in the dfus application will be more beneficial as well as its harmonics subharmonics ultraharmonics and combination frequencies conclusions by nguyen et al 2017 support other data on the synergistic effect for h2o2 production which was observed in the presence of one low frequency 28 khz in the dual combination lee and oh 2011 earlier son et al 2010 demonstrated the benefits of low frequency in the dual combination comparing sonochemical reactions under single 35 72 170 300 500 and 1000 khz and dual 35 35 35 72 35 170 35 300 35 500 and 35 1000 khz with a base frequency of 35 khz frequency conditions it was found that the ultrasonic energy decreased with increasing frequency in the single mode whereas no significant changes of energy were observed in the dual mode this may be explained by the major contribution of low frequency 35 khz to cavitation results by son et al 2010 suggest that dfus is more effective if one frequency in a dual combination is low 100 khz their results are in agreement with other studies zhu et al 2000 feng et al 2002 zhao et al 2002 brotchie et al 2008a lee and oh 2011 ebrahiminia et al 2016 earlier ciuti et al 2000 also emphasized that adding a low frequency 27 2 khz to 730 khz field remarkably lowered the cavitation thresholds and increased the sl intensity variation of the second frequency of ultrasonic wave resulted in different synergy values table 3 shows that there was no clear relationship between the synergistic coefficients and frequency combination under different conditions however one can conclude that the highest synergy was achieved at 28 970 khz low high frequency this observation is consistent with results by hasanzadeh et al 2011 who used 28 khz 130 khz 1 mhz 3 mhz and their dual combinations to enhance acoustic cavitation by measuring the subharmonic amplitude of each frequency they found the increased cavitation yield in combinations which include 28 khz furthermore the combination of 28 khz 1 or 3 mhz exhibited a high synergistic effect and was more effective than other combinations higher cavitation yields were also obtained for irradiation at 28 khz combined with the frequencies in the low mhz range feng et al 2002 3 degradation of organic pollutants historically first studies on degradation of organic pollutants were conducted in the 1990s using a near field acoustical processor operating at 16 20 khz hua et al 1995 thoma et al 1997 professor a b pandit s group intensified the degradation studies using dual and triple frequency combinations in the range of 20 50 khz sivakumar and pandit 2001 sivakumar et al 2002 gogate et al 2003a 2003b 2004 gogate and pandit 2004 the authors reported the benefits of multiple frequency ultrasound toward degradation of formic acid and p nitrophenol though the total percentage removal was low table 4 however no synergism was observed for degradation of rhodamine b gogate et al 2004 tiong et al 2017 we suppose that it is primarily attributed to the inefficient design of sonoreactors applied сylinders one central gogate et al 2004 and six cylinders tiong et al 2017 with aqueous solution inside which are placed into the hexagonal prism significantly affect the transmission of sound waves as a result the emitted acoustic waves undergo reflection and scattering by such cylinders with a relatively big diameter 50 mm vs hexagon of 140 mm side additionally there are energy losses of acoustic waves at the interface water glass when treated in the cylinders made up of glass it appears that it is difficult to provide conditions for sufficient ros generation in this design therefore a pronounced synergism can be hardly achieved under multiple frequency ultrasonication later studies reported a clear synergistic effect of dfus at low frequencies specifically it was more enhanced in the orthogonal reactor as compared to the opposite one for degrading nitrobenzene zhao et al 2009 and methylene blue xiong et al 2012 furthermore zhao et al 2009 showed the improved toc removal as well as accelerated ho and h2o2 generation under 28 28 khz irradiation similar results were obtained by coupling orthogonal dfus and triple frequency ultrasound with ozonation which provided a synergistic effect between ozone and ultrasound zhao et al 2010 2014 it should be noted that the synergism between single and dual frequencies single aop and dual frequencies aop for example 20 40 khz combined with photocatalysis xiong et al 2012 2013 is considered regarding dfus at high frequencies 100 khz the number of related studies is rather limited table 4 when comparing the kinetic constants of pentachlorophenol degradation under 16 800 khz irradiation the most pronounced synergistic effect was evident between dfus and fenton like reagent cuso4 h2o2 shen et al 2004 in this study the synergism between single and dual frequencies followed the order single dual alone nearly additive effect single h2o2 dual h2o2 single cuso4 h2o2 dual cuso4 h2o2 furthermore wang et al 2006 reported the best combination of 20 530 khz for degrading the same compound pentachlorophenol by dfus in the absence of oxidants or catalysts combinations of low and high frequency have been also employed in recent studies table 4 results showed that dfus was favorable at eliminating both hydrophilic methylene blue and hydrophobic deet compounds in model aqueous solutions however a clear synergistic effect of dfus was observed for deet only eren and o shea 2019 the authors also reported that the addition of oxidants such as h2o2 hso5 or s2o8 2 did not significantly enhance the degradation of target pollutants ziylan yavas and ince 2018 have comprehensively evaluated the performance of single and dual frequencies in the range of 20 1130 khz under sequential and simultaneous schemes involving fe0 for the elimination of ibuprofen the obtained results allow the user to select the combination of frequencies and the operation mode depending on the assigned task degradation mineralization in terms of toc decay energy efficiency in terms of sonochemical yield y fig 3 demonstrates an inverse relationship between y and the fraction of toc decay in most cases the authors suggested r3 200 khz r4a 572 khz and seq2 40 200 khz scenarios to be the most viable options though the higher mineralization degrees were attained in simultaneous dual modes 40 572 and 40 1130 khz which are energy intensive processes considering the energy efficiency of dfus a calorimetric method is used in most studies to determine the energy efficiency of transducers earlier gogate et al 2001 reported a relatively low calorimetric energy efficiency of 25 40 khz 33 the energy efficiency can be also measured in terms of electric energy requirements of a sonochemical reaction son et al 2010 the authors consider electric energy consumption to be more adequate for determining the energy efficiency of dfus because the calorimetric energy depends on geometrical dimensions of sonoreactor as well as on ultrasonic frequency using ki dosimetry the observed synergistic effect in the dual mode was explained by double energy consumption therefore there was no significant synergism in terms of electric energy analysis thus a relatively high electric energy consumption appears to be main disadvantage of dfus method nonetheless dual frequency ultrasonication in the absence or presence of oxidants catalysts has emerged as an advanced method for intensifying water treatment it should be noted that all above dfus studies to improve the degradation efficiency were conducted in pure matrix free aqueous solutions so far only manickam et al 2014 showed the efficiency of dfus at 28 40 and 70 khz along with triple frequency combinations which provided the cod reduction of real effluents from palm oil mill furthermore adding h2o2 into the triple frequency system substantially improved the cod removal accordingly more research on real water matrices using dfus alone as well as combined with oxidants and catalysts hybrid aops is required 4 inactivation of microorganisms unlike organic degradation microbial inactivation by dfus in aqueous media has been scarcely studied and there are only a few reports of its application for water disinfection table 5 presumably this is due to the unexplored mechanisms of microorganism inactivation under exposure to dual or multiple frequency ultrasound so far only low frequencies 100 khz have been used for inactivating bacteria in aqueous media wu and mason 2017 compared the performance of batch and flow through opposite dfus reactors 16 20 khz for removing cyanobacteria and showed the promising results for further scaling up the recirculating process a flow through hybrid system coupling dfus with naclo has been recently employed in a pilot scale to improve the disinfection efficiency toward selected bacteria table 5 in their earlier study zou and wang 2017 reported the highest inactivation efficiency under hybrid treatments dfus naclo sequential at lower frequencies of 17 33 khz and dfus naclo simultaneous at higher frequencies of 70 100 khz however this finding can be hardly explained and has not been developed in their later study which was focused on the sequential scheme only zou and tang 2019 notably results showed that the log reduction under dfus 17 33 khz was higher than that obtained with the corresponding single frequencies furthermore when combined with chlorination dfus pre treatment increased the final log reduction by 2 times and the utilization efficiency of hypochlorite by 40 as compared to those achieved under chlorination only yet high frequencies 100 khz and in the megahertz range have not been used in published research on microbial inactivation in water by dfus nonetheless these have been applied in other frontier research field termed as sonodynamic therapy sdt generally sdt is based on the apoptosis of pathogenic cells by ros which are produced by activating sonosensitizers with frequencies over 20 khz up to 2 mhz including dfus rengeng et al 2017 tabatabaei et al 2019 historically sdt was explored as an anticancer treatment but later sact sonodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy has been pointed out as an antimicrobial strategy for other applications including water disinfection serpe and giuntini 2015 the authors surveyed previous studies on bacterial inactivation by single frequency sact and suggested this treatment to be a promising approach for wastewater disinfection with tio2 as sensitizer though dfus has not been employed in sact its efficiency has been proved in sdt using sdt toward cancer cells ninomiya et al 2014 demonstrated the synergistically enhanced ho generation by combined use of dfus at 0 5 1 mhz and tio2 nanoparticles thus achieving better injuring effect than in the case of single frequencies a similar effect was earlier shown by barati et al 2009 2010 and alamolhoda et al 2012 who combined 150 khz and 1 mhz to treat murine tumor since ultrasound is well transmitted through tissue cells 70 water content with a generation of intracellular ros jia et al 2018 the sact methods can be applicable for

17787,since the early 2000s dual frequency ultrasound dfus has received much attention for synergistically enhanced elimination of organic pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms from water in the present review we have surveyed recent developments in acoustic physics to elucidate the mechanism of synergistic effect under exposure of aqueous media to dfus briefly the nonlinear dynamics of microbubbles upon dfus exposure produces additional frequencies such as harmonics subharmonics ultraharmonics and combination frequencies these increase the probability of bubbles collapse thereby enhancing cavitation and generating more reactive oxygen species ros for advanced oxidation processes aops further literature data on ros generation chemical degradation and microbial inactivation in aqueous media through dfus alone and dfus based aops involving oxidants or catalysts have been discussed in this regard optimal frequency combination sonoreactor type and transducer arrangement appear to be key parameters for achieving a high synergistic effect strengths and shortcomings of dfus to water treatment and disinfection have been identified and future research directions have been proposed though most studies were conducted on pure matrix free aqueous solutions these aops could be applicable for treating real waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords degradation disinfection dual frequency ultrasound inactivation synergistic effect water treatment 1 introduction over the last few decades low 100 khz and high frequency 100 khz ultrasound has been extensively used in advanced oxidation processes aops for water and wastewater treatment and disinfection this is due to the generation of h2o2 and reactive oxygen species ros such as ho and ho2 from the collapse of microbubbles at high local pressures and temperatures during acoustic cavitation in turn the produced ros efficiently oxidize organic pollutants and inactivate microorganisms there have been representative reviews on ultrasound based aops for eliminating organic pollutants ince et al 2001 ince 2018 adewuyi 2005a b joseph et al 2009 mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 pang et al 2011 rayaroth et al 2016 sathishkumar et al 2016 panda and manickam 2017 chu et al 2017 yap et al 2019 and pathogenic microorganisms matafonova and batoev 2019 zupanc et al 2019 in aqueous media however these reviews have focused on the application of a single frequency ultrasound and the combinations of different frequencies have not been addressed meanwhile investigations of dual frequency ultrasound dfus go back the early 2000s and the associated effects such as enhancement of cavitation and occurrence of synergism were reported though dfus has been applied in water treatment and disinfection for decades the mechanism of its action in aqueous media with resultant synergistic effects toward oxidation processes has not been revealed so far the objective of the present review is to elucidate the mechanism of synergistic effect under exposure of aqueous media to dfus by addressing a state of the art of acoustic physics and provide an overview of published research on the degradation of organic pollutants and inactivation of microorganisms by dfus in the absence and presence of oxidants catalysts hybrid aops strengths and shortcomings of dfus to water treatment and disinfection have been identified and future research directions have been proposed 2 synergistic effects under dual frequency ultrasonication 2 1 mechanism until recently there have been no published studies which clarified and summarized the advantages of dfus over the single frequency ultrasound for water treatment and disinfection purposes only in 2017 zhang et al published a fundamental theoretical study and described the gas bubble oscillations in liquids under dual frequency acoustic excitation the authors reviewed previous related research and answered the questions about the interaction of two acoustic waves in aqueous media it is known that the nonlinear dynamics of bubbles upon dfus exposure generates additional frequencies f i e harmonics nf n 2 3 4 subharmonics f 2 f 3 f 4 and ultraharmonics 2n 1 f 2 n 1 2 lauterborn 1976 alongside these additional frequencies zhang et al 2017 have demonstrated the generation of other frequencies so called combination frequencies under nonlinear interaction of two acoustic waves at different frequencies the combination frequencies represent an algebraic sum or a difference of all existing oscillations table 1 accordingly there is a number of frequencies with various intensities excited if ω 1 is one angular frequency of the dual frequency driving sound field and ω 2 is another angular frequency all generated frequencies can be presented as follows besides the bands corresponding to the main frequencies and the harmonics the power spectrum illustrates much more bands fig 1 furthermore the corresponding frequencies of these bands can be expressed by linear combination of the frequencies of the two component sound waves i e ω p nω 1 mω 2 n and m are two integers as shown in fig 1 the numerical data on frequencies and their intensities are in a good agreement with experimental results ma et al 2010 which confirm the validity of theoretical calculations it was also shown that harmonics umemura et al 1997 subharmonics jin et al 1998 ultraharmonics petošić et al 2009 and combination frequencies liu and hsieh 2009 contributed to the cavitation specifically nguyen et al 2017 used the most intensive second harmonic f 2 and the first ultraharmonic f 1 5 for measuring cavitation effects more recently ye et al 2019 have advanced a theoretical knowledge about enhancing cavitation effect upon dfus excitation it has been found that the oscillation of cavitation bubbles is more unstable and easier to collapse in dfus field than those in the single frequency mode a significant enhancement of cavitation effect was also numerically shown in case of three different frequency combinations 30 50 40 60 and 50 70 khz the authors conclude that dfus can destroy the stable oscillation and accelerate the collapse of the bubble in view of the above investigations we suggest that the mechanism of synergistic effect under dfus irradiation of aqueous media lies in the nonlinearity of bubbles dynamics which generate additional frequencies as a result harmonics subharmonics ultraharmonics and combination frequencies are added to two basic frequencies the additional oscillations excite a greater number of bubbles and their collapse resulting in more intense cavitation finally the enhanced cavitation leads to the elevated ros levels which in turn provide a synergistic effect in oxidation processes 2 2 ros generation generally a synergistic effect under dfus exposure can be evaluated through generation of sonoluminescence sl and ros primarily ho degradation of organic pollutants and inactivation of microorganisms quantitatively a synergistic effect is expressed through a synergistic coefficient index which is calculated as the ratio of the parameter measured under dfus to the algebraic sum of parameters measured under single frequencies the obtained value greater than 1 0 indicates a synergistic effect otherwise one can conclude about the antagonistic or additive effect concentration of ros is often referred to the sonochemical yield efficiency mason and peters 2002 wood et al 2017 ho production can be measured indirectly by ki fricke salicylic acid or terephthalate dosimetry sutkar and gogate 2009 there is a number of representative studies which demonstrated the synergistic effect of dfus in relation to ros generation table 2 a synergism was reported in terms of sonochemical yield sl and fluorescence intensity specifically the sonochemical yield of dfus was shown to be much higher than the algebraic sum of the yields produced separately by single frequency irradiations zhu et al 2000 feng et al 2002 tatake and pandit 2002 zhao et al 2002 ebrahiminia et al 2016 similarly dfus synergistically enhanced the cavitation via increased intensity of sl and luminol based sonochemoluminescence which is proportional to the number of collapses and ho exposure yasuda et al 2007 brotchie et al 2008a b a highest synergistic effect of sonochemiluminescence and h2o2 production was reported at frequencies of 28 970 khz lee and oh 2011 a synergistic enhancement of the cavitation by increasing sl intensity up to 30 fold was also reported without referring to ho generation under 20 355 1056 khz brotchie et al 2007 20 700 khz iernetti et al 1997 27 2 730 880 khz ciuti et al 2000 2003 and 20 355 khz dezhkunov 2003 kanthale et al 2008 irradiation nevertheless indirect ho detection by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 2 hydroxyterephthalate ion showed the synergistic coefficients 1 which indicate the enhanced ho generation by dfus yasuda et al 2007 barati et al 2007 ninomiya et al 2014 tabatabaei et al 2019 this confirms the additional cavitation activities during simultaneous application of two frequencies 2 3 sonoreactor types and transducer arrangements in dfus batch scale experiments following basic geometrical types of sonoreactors are commonly applied a rectangular parallelepiped a hexagonal prism and a cylinder these are space geometric figures of different volumes from hundreds of millilitres to several litres the most widely used sonoreactor represents a rectangular parallelepiped onto sides of which the flat transducers of high frequency emissions can be attached using this geometrical type both orthogonal on the adjacent sides and opposite on the opposite sides transducer arrangements can be easily designed specifically the orthogonally and oppositely positioned transducers emit ultrasound at a right angle and in parallel respectively the second type a hexagonal prism was first applied by gogate et al 2004 for triple frequency ultrasonication herein the transducers were positioned on the opposite parallel sides of a prism this sonoreactor was further modified by tiong et al 2017 however its potential has not been fully reached in this work due to the inefficient design placing six glass tubes into the hexagonal shaped reactor the third type a cylinder is primarily used for generating ultrasound by horn at the top and orthogonally on the sides or oppositely at the bottom positioned transducers regarding transducer arrangements there is a complex dependence of the synergistic effect on the orthogonal or opposite arrangement so far only two studies have compared the synergistic effect under both orthogonal and opposite dual irradiation zhao et al 2009 lee and oh 2011 specifically the synergistic effect at 28 28 khz in terms of ho generation and toc removal was more pronounced in the orthogonal system rather than in the opposite one zhao et al 2009 the orthogonal arrangement was also more beneficial at low frequencies of 28 28 khz and power of 100 and 150 w an irradiation side table 3 however the opposite system was more effective when involving high frequencies 28 970 584 584 khz at the same power levels a contrary result was observed at higher power of 200 w an irradiation side the synergistic coefficients at 584 970 khz were nearly equal in both orthogonal and opposite modes table 3 evidently the synergism also strongly depends on the acoustic power summarizing a complex relationship between the synergistic coefficients dfus efficiency and frequency power transducer arrangement needs more research 2 4 frequency dependence considering the synergistic effect of dfus as a function of frequency suzuki et al 2004 observed the synergistic effect below 100 khz more recently nguyen et al 2017 have comprehensively investigated the dependence of cavitation chemical and mechanical effect thresholds on ultrasonic frequency in the range of 22 4880 khz the cavitation threshold is defined as the minimum amplitude of sound pressure required to initiate acoustic cavitation as shown in fig 2 these thresholds are in direct proportion to the frequency this implies that the cavitation chemical and mechanical effect thresholds decreased with decreasing frequency in other words one low frequency tens of khz in the dfus application will be more beneficial as well as its harmonics subharmonics ultraharmonics and combination frequencies conclusions by nguyen et al 2017 support other data on the synergistic effect for h2o2 production which was observed in the presence of one low frequency 28 khz in the dual combination lee and oh 2011 earlier son et al 2010 demonstrated the benefits of low frequency in the dual combination comparing sonochemical reactions under single 35 72 170 300 500 and 1000 khz and dual 35 35 35 72 35 170 35 300 35 500 and 35 1000 khz with a base frequency of 35 khz frequency conditions it was found that the ultrasonic energy decreased with increasing frequency in the single mode whereas no significant changes of energy were observed in the dual mode this may be explained by the major contribution of low frequency 35 khz to cavitation results by son et al 2010 suggest that dfus is more effective if one frequency in a dual combination is low 100 khz their results are in agreement with other studies zhu et al 2000 feng et al 2002 zhao et al 2002 brotchie et al 2008a lee and oh 2011 ebrahiminia et al 2016 earlier ciuti et al 2000 also emphasized that adding a low frequency 27 2 khz to 730 khz field remarkably lowered the cavitation thresholds and increased the sl intensity variation of the second frequency of ultrasonic wave resulted in different synergy values table 3 shows that there was no clear relationship between the synergistic coefficients and frequency combination under different conditions however one can conclude that the highest synergy was achieved at 28 970 khz low high frequency this observation is consistent with results by hasanzadeh et al 2011 who used 28 khz 130 khz 1 mhz 3 mhz and their dual combinations to enhance acoustic cavitation by measuring the subharmonic amplitude of each frequency they found the increased cavitation yield in combinations which include 28 khz furthermore the combination of 28 khz 1 or 3 mhz exhibited a high synergistic effect and was more effective than other combinations higher cavitation yields were also obtained for irradiation at 28 khz combined with the frequencies in the low mhz range feng et al 2002 3 degradation of organic pollutants historically first studies on degradation of organic pollutants were conducted in the 1990s using a near field acoustical processor operating at 16 20 khz hua et al 1995 thoma et al 1997 professor a b pandit s group intensified the degradation studies using dual and triple frequency combinations in the range of 20 50 khz sivakumar and pandit 2001 sivakumar et al 2002 gogate et al 2003a 2003b 2004 gogate and pandit 2004 the authors reported the benefits of multiple frequency ultrasound toward degradation of formic acid and p nitrophenol though the total percentage removal was low table 4 however no synergism was observed for degradation of rhodamine b gogate et al 2004 tiong et al 2017 we suppose that it is primarily attributed to the inefficient design of sonoreactors applied сylinders one central gogate et al 2004 and six cylinders tiong et al 2017 with aqueous solution inside which are placed into the hexagonal prism significantly affect the transmission of sound waves as a result the emitted acoustic waves undergo reflection and scattering by such cylinders with a relatively big diameter 50 mm vs hexagon of 140 mm side additionally there are energy losses of acoustic waves at the interface water glass when treated in the cylinders made up of glass it appears that it is difficult to provide conditions for sufficient ros generation in this design therefore a pronounced synergism can be hardly achieved under multiple frequency ultrasonication later studies reported a clear synergistic effect of dfus at low frequencies specifically it was more enhanced in the orthogonal reactor as compared to the opposite one for degrading nitrobenzene zhao et al 2009 and methylene blue xiong et al 2012 furthermore zhao et al 2009 showed the improved toc removal as well as accelerated ho and h2o2 generation under 28 28 khz irradiation similar results were obtained by coupling orthogonal dfus and triple frequency ultrasound with ozonation which provided a synergistic effect between ozone and ultrasound zhao et al 2010 2014 it should be noted that the synergism between single and dual frequencies single aop and dual frequencies aop for example 20 40 khz combined with photocatalysis xiong et al 2012 2013 is considered regarding dfus at high frequencies 100 khz the number of related studies is rather limited table 4 when comparing the kinetic constants of pentachlorophenol degradation under 16 800 khz irradiation the most pronounced synergistic effect was evident between dfus and fenton like reagent cuso4 h2o2 shen et al 2004 in this study the synergism between single and dual frequencies followed the order single dual alone nearly additive effect single h2o2 dual h2o2 single cuso4 h2o2 dual cuso4 h2o2 furthermore wang et al 2006 reported the best combination of 20 530 khz for degrading the same compound pentachlorophenol by dfus in the absence of oxidants or catalysts combinations of low and high frequency have been also employed in recent studies table 4 results showed that dfus was favorable at eliminating both hydrophilic methylene blue and hydrophobic deet compounds in model aqueous solutions however a clear synergistic effect of dfus was observed for deet only eren and o shea 2019 the authors also reported that the addition of oxidants such as h2o2 hso5 or s2o8 2 did not significantly enhance the degradation of target pollutants ziylan yavas and ince 2018 have comprehensively evaluated the performance of single and dual frequencies in the range of 20 1130 khz under sequential and simultaneous schemes involving fe0 for the elimination of ibuprofen the obtained results allow the user to select the combination of frequencies and the operation mode depending on the assigned task degradation mineralization in terms of toc decay energy efficiency in terms of sonochemical yield y fig 3 demonstrates an inverse relationship between y and the fraction of toc decay in most cases the authors suggested r3 200 khz r4a 572 khz and seq2 40 200 khz scenarios to be the most viable options though the higher mineralization degrees were attained in simultaneous dual modes 40 572 and 40 1130 khz which are energy intensive processes considering the energy efficiency of dfus a calorimetric method is used in most studies to determine the energy efficiency of transducers earlier gogate et al 2001 reported a relatively low calorimetric energy efficiency of 25 40 khz 33 the energy efficiency can be also measured in terms of electric energy requirements of a sonochemical reaction son et al 2010 the authors consider electric energy consumption to be more adequate for determining the energy efficiency of dfus because the calorimetric energy depends on geometrical dimensions of sonoreactor as well as on ultrasonic frequency using ki dosimetry the observed synergistic effect in the dual mode was explained by double energy consumption therefore there was no significant synergism in terms of electric energy analysis thus a relatively high electric energy consumption appears to be main disadvantage of dfus method nonetheless dual frequency ultrasonication in the absence or presence of oxidants catalysts has emerged as an advanced method for intensifying water treatment it should be noted that all above dfus studies to improve the degradation efficiency were conducted in pure matrix free aqueous solutions so far only manickam et al 2014 showed the efficiency of dfus at 28 40 and 70 khz along with triple frequency combinations which provided the cod reduction of real effluents from palm oil mill furthermore adding h2o2 into the triple frequency system substantially improved the cod removal accordingly more research on real water matrices using dfus alone as well as combined with oxidants and catalysts hybrid aops is required 4 inactivation of microorganisms unlike organic degradation microbial inactivation by dfus in aqueous media has been scarcely studied and there are only a few reports of its application for water disinfection table 5 presumably this is due to the unexplored mechanisms of microorganism inactivation under exposure to dual or multiple frequency ultrasound so far only low frequencies 100 khz have been used for inactivating bacteria in aqueous media wu and mason 2017 compared the performance of batch and flow through opposite dfus reactors 16 20 khz for removing cyanobacteria and showed the promising results for further scaling up the recirculating process a flow through hybrid system coupling dfus with naclo has been recently employed in a pilot scale to improve the disinfection efficiency toward selected bacteria table 5 in their earlier study zou and wang 2017 reported the highest inactivation efficiency under hybrid treatments dfus naclo sequential at lower frequencies of 17 33 khz and dfus naclo simultaneous at higher frequencies of 70 100 khz however this finding can be hardly explained and has not been developed in their later study which was focused on the sequential scheme only zou and tang 2019 notably results showed that the log reduction under dfus 17 33 khz was higher than that obtained with the corresponding single frequencies furthermore when combined with chlorination dfus pre treatment increased the final log reduction by 2 times and the utilization efficiency of hypochlorite by 40 as compared to those achieved under chlorination only yet high frequencies 100 khz and in the megahertz range have not been used in published research on microbial inactivation in water by dfus nonetheless these have been applied in other frontier research field termed as sonodynamic therapy sdt generally sdt is based on the apoptosis of pathogenic cells by ros which are produced by activating sonosensitizers with frequencies over 20 khz up to 2 mhz including dfus rengeng et al 2017 tabatabaei et al 2019 historically sdt was explored as an anticancer treatment but later sact sonodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy has been pointed out as an antimicrobial strategy for other applications including water disinfection serpe and giuntini 2015 the authors surveyed previous studies on bacterial inactivation by single frequency sact and suggested this treatment to be a promising approach for wastewater disinfection with tio2 as sensitizer though dfus has not been employed in sact its efficiency has been proved in sdt using sdt toward cancer cells ninomiya et al 2014 demonstrated the synergistically enhanced ho generation by combined use of dfus at 0 5 1 mhz and tio2 nanoparticles thus achieving better injuring effect than in the case of single frequencies a similar effect was earlier shown by barati et al 2009 2010 and alamolhoda et al 2012 who combined 150 khz and 1 mhz to treat murine tumor since ultrasound is well transmitted through tissue cells 70 water content with a generation of intracellular ros jia et al 2018 the sact methods can be applicable for inactivating microbial cells in aqueous media overall recent research on water disinfection by dfus based aops showed promising results this allows us to identify these processes as an emerging research field for water disinfection as well as for decontamination of surfaces mustapha et al 2019 alenyorege et al 2020 literature data on sdt also give evidence of using dfus with and without oxidants catalysts as alternative sact processes for water disinfection 5 future research based on the existing literature on organic degradation and microbial inactivation by dfus and the mechanism of its action in aqueous media the following research directions in water treatment and disinfection by dfus can be proposed 1 dfus employing at least one low frequency 100 khz appears to be an efficient combination for achieving a synergistic effect and represents an advantageous option in the sonochemical aops 2 a complex relationship between the synergistic effect and frequency power

17788,the recovery of phosphorus from secondary sources like sewage sludge is essential in a world suffering from resources depletion recent studies have demonstrated that phosphorus can be magnetically recovered as vivianite fe ii 3 po4 2 8h2o from the digested sludge ds of waste water treatment plants wwtp dosing iron to study the production of vivianite in digested sludge the quantity of fe dosed at the wwtp of nieuwveer the netherlands was increased from 0 83 to 1 53 kg fe kg p in the influent and the possible benefits for the functioning of the wwtp were evaluated higher fe dosing is not only relevant for p recovery but also for maximal recovery of organics from influent for e g biogas production the share of phosphorus present as vivianite in the ds increased from 20 to 50 after the increase in fe dosing making more phosphorus available for future magnetic recovery this increase was directly proportional to the increase of fe in ds suggesting that vivianite could be favored not only thermodynamically but also kinetically interestingly analyses suggest that several types of vivianite are formed in the wwtp and could differ in their purity oxidation state or crystallinity these differences could have an impact on the subsequent magnetic separation following the fe dosing increase p in the effluent and h2s in the biogas both decreased 1 28 to 0 42 ppm for p and 26 to 8 ppm for h2s no negative impact on the nitrogen removal biogas production cod removal or dewaterability was observed since quantification of vivianite in ds is complicated previous studies were reviewed and we proposed a more accurate mössbauer spectroscopy analysis and fitting for sludge samples this study is important from a p recovery point of view but also because iron addition can play a crucial role in future resource recovery wastewater facilities graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery waste water treatment plant wwtp magnetic recovery mössbauer spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd iron sulphide 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential nutrient for all living organisms and is a key element for global food production as it is widely used as fertilizer childers et al 2011 currently the raw material for its production is mined phosphate rock unfortunately the resources are scarce and concentrated in a few countries morocco holds 70 of the p rock which makes phosphorus a vulnerable resource cordell et al 2015 this situation creates the need to exploit secondary sources of phosphorus like manure or sewage sludge ohtake et al 2019 the phosphorus present in wastewater is normally removed at the waste water treatment plant wwtp the most popular p removal strategies are enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and chemical phosphorus removal cpr the first relies on phosphate accumulating organisms while the second involves iron dosing or more rarely aluminum dosing morse et al 1998 while phosphorus removal technologies are well established and widely applied phosphorus recovery remains a challenge wilfert et al 2015 currently the two main recovery routes are via struvite precipitation for wwtps using ebpr and after incineration for those using cpr however both methods have limitations the p recovery percentage is low for the former one cornel et al 2009 and infrastructure costs are high for the second desmidt et al 2015 recent studies indicate that the mineral vivianite fe ii 3 po4 3 8h2o is an important p sink in the digested sludge from cpr plants wilfert et al 2016 2018 our team has demonstrated that the magnetic extraction of vivianite from ds is possible at lab scale opening a possible new route for p recovery prot et al 2019 wilfert et al 2018 suggest that higher fe dosing could increase the conversion of the p in sludge into vivianite increasing the share of magnetically recoverable p besides its possible effect on vivianite production increased fe dosing is in line with current trends in wastewater treatment northern european countries such as the uk and germany have fixed low limits for p in wwtp effluent 0 15 0 3 ppm that may decrease even further in the future european sustainable phosphorus platform 2019 such low p levels can only be achieved by cpr usually by using fe salts suresh kumar et al 2019 moreover fe addition to the primary settler or the a stage of a wwtp enhances the production of primary sludge thus giving higher biogas yield after digestion li et al 2005 it appears that the use of fe in wastewater treatment fits in a future of net energy producing plants to verify the hypothesis of wilfert et al a controlled fe dosing increase was realized to investigate the actual effect of the fe dosing on vivianite production to achieve this the fe dosing was doubled at the nieuwveer wwtp the netherlands and the results are presented in this article special attention is given to the impact of the higher fe dosing on the integral parameters of the wwtp e g p level in effluent biogas production and n removal to ensure that vivianite production is not achieved to the detriment of the wwtp s primary objectives and in the scope of future wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtp and fe dosing the study took place at the ab plant in nieuwveer the netherlands influent 69 77m3 day in 2018 there a feso4 solution is dosed in the aerated a stage for p and cod removal the solid retention times srts are 0 72 day for the a stage 13 days for the b stage and 20 days for the anaerobic digester this wwtp receives external sludge from other wwtps at irregular intervals the external sludges are mixed with the a and b sludges before being thickened and fed to the digester the external sludge accounts for 30 of the total sludge volume to study the influence of the fe dosing increase the quantity of feso4 dosed in the a stage was doubled for 4 months the dosing can be broken down into 3 phases as shown in fig 1 the phase ii

the mixed a stage b stage and external sludge ms before digestion and the digested sludge appendix a the sludge line was sampled twice in phase i before the start of the fe dosing as a reference and once in phase iii eight other samples were taken at regular intervals for 4 months after which time a steady state should be reached in all the units appendix a samples were poured to the brim into air tight polyethylene bottles and stored in a 4 c fridge after 4 h of transportation at nieuwveer 1 2 ml of each sample was immediately filtered 0 45 μm filter and fixed with 0 05 ml of 0 5m hcl to prevent fe oxidation these samples were analyzed with the ferrozine method for fe speciation and icp oes for elemental composition sludge samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 3750 rpm the cake was dried at 25 c in a fume hood for 48h for total solid ts measurement and later ground and digested for elemental composition and sem edx a part of the cake of the ds was dried in a glove box under anaerobic and light free conditions to prevent vivianite oxidation for xrd x ray diffraction and mössbauer spectroscopy analysis the drying of the sludge was done at room temperature to avoid the decomposition of vivianite 2 3 analyses 2 3 1 light microscopy sem edx around 0 1g of dried solid samples were ground for light microscopy and sem edx analysis the grinding was done to break the organic matter shell covering the vivianite crystals that prevented proper microscope observation the light microscope used was a leica mz95 equipped with a leica dfc320 camera the sem edx apparatus

3 mössbauer spectroscopy the samples were dried as explained in section 2 3 2 to prevent vivianite oxidation then they were introduced in plastic rings sealed with kapton foil and epoxy glue to prevent oxygen exposure and wrapped in aluminum foil for light protection the sample weight was adjusted to contain a maximum of 17 5 mg of fe cm2 if the sample contained too much fe it was diluted with inert carbon powder transmission 57fe mössbauer absorption spectra were collected at 300 k with a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a57co rh source velocity calibration was carried out using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using the mosswinn 4 0 program klencsár 1997 2 3 4 ferrozine method first 2 ml of sample was filtered and fixed with hcl 0 1 ml of 0 5m hcl directly at the wwtp to avoid fe oxidation reduction and analyzed under anaerobic conditions 4h after sampling the fe speciation was determined using the ferrozine method as explained in viollier et al 2000 in brief 1 ml of hcl fixed sample was added into a cuvette to 0 1 ml of a ferrozine solution which forms a pink complex with fe2 the absorbance was measured at 562 nm after 15 min of reaction with a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer then 0 15 ml of 1 4 m hydroxylamine was added to 0 8 ml of the complexed solution to reduce all the fe3 the reduction took place for 12h to ensure that all the organically bound fe was reduced rasmussen and nielsen 1996 finally 0 05 ml of 10m acetate buffer was added to the sample and the final absorbance was measured the fe2 and fe3 were calculated using these 2 absorbances 2 3 5 microwave digestion icp oes solid samples were destroyed in an ethos easy digester from milestone equipped with an sk 15 high pressure rotor around 50 mg of

standard solution were respectively 2 of hno3 and 10 mg l of yttrium 2 3 6 global parameters of the wwtp the following parameters of the wwtp were measured by the operators of nieuwveer on site p effluent concentration measured by aquon according to the nen norms h2s content in the biogas measured by inca 4000 t101 from union instruments gmbh cod removal measured by aquon according to the nen norms biogas production measured by st51 fr32c00a flow meter from fluid components international llc nitrogen removal measured by aquon according to the nen norms 3 results discussion recovery of phosphorus via magnetic extraction of vivianite is a recent technique and is still in development in prot et al 2019 we reached the first milestone by maximizing the quantity of p present as vivianite the results of wilfert et al 2018 had suggested that an increase in fe dosing could promote vivianite formation however they had conducted their study by examining sludge from 6 wwtps with a fixed fe p ratio to investigate the actual effect of the fe dosing on the vivianite content in the ds vivianite content efficiency of the dosing delay required to form vivianite therefore a controlled fe dosing increase at a single wwtp is required the water authority brabantse delta made this research possible by increasing the iron dosing at the wwtp nieuwveer the netherlands from 0 83 to 1 53 kg fe kg p in the influent for a period of 4 months the effect of this increase on phosphate behaviour and the integral operation of the treatment plant e g p level in effluent biogas production cod removal was studied and the results are discussed in this section since the strategy of recovering p as vivianite is novel the analytical methods are still under development and subject to possible improvements for this reason the first part of the discussion is dedicated to the quantification of vivianite in digested sludge 3 1 quantification of vivianite in digested sludge a short review and best practice the major problem while studying vivianite in digested sludge is its quantification wilfert et al 2018 used standard addition of synthetic vivianite together with xrd a drawback of this method is its use of pure vivianite even though the vivianite in sludge could be impure wilfert et al 2016 seitz et al 1973 moreover xrd is unable to detect small or amorphous vivianite which creates greater uncertainty despite these facts xrd results were in line with mössbauer results in their study even though vivianite content was always estimated on the higher end with xrd mössbauer spectroscopy can detect fe minerals independently of their size or crystallinity and is considered to be the best technique for vivianite quantification so far yet some discrepancies are present in the literature regarding sample handling and measuring and data fitting these problems will be discussed below and an improved practice for vivianite determination with mössbauer will be proposed to understand the data fitting for mössbauer spectroscopy it is important to know that a crystalline unit of vivianite bears 3 possible positions for fe 1 octahedral site called site a and 2 equivalent octahedral sites called site b mori and ito 1950 the most characteristic feature of vivianite is that it has 2 doublets for fe2 present in site a 1 fe2 ion and site b 2 fe2 ions the mössbauer parameters for these sites are well described and accepted in the literature site a isomer shift is 1 2 0 1 mm s quadrupole splitting qs 2 4 0 1 mm s and site b is 1 25 0 1 mm s qs 3 0 0 1 mm s mccammon et al 1980 rouzies and millet 1993 nembrini et al 1983 thus the amount of fe2 present in vivianite in a sample can be reliably quantified however vivianite can easily be oxidized by oxygen and or light čermáková et al 2013 mccammon et al 1980 leading to the transformation of a part of the fe2 from both sites into fe3 the signal of fe3 in vivianite is difficult to distinguish from that of fe3 species that can generally be present in sludge samples therefore the samples are generally protected from oxidation as much as possible wilfert et al 2018 wang et al 2019 this study to prevent minimize the oxidation of fe during sampling and handling the samples can be studied by mössbauer spectroscopy at temperature from 4 2k to 300k although wilfert et al 2016 2018 reported that measurements at 4 2k were not suitable for vivianite determination due to the complexity of the signal vivianite can be quantified at 100k wilfert et al 2018 wang et al 2019 but these analyses do not seem to add any information compared to the quicker and easier analyses at 300k several researchers working with ds proposed measurements at 300k with a fitting with 3 doublets fe2 in site a fe2 in site b and fe3 feii accounting for all the fe3 species including fe3 in vivianite and low spin fe2 compounds like pyrite prot et al 2019 frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2018 vivianite is likely to be partly oxidized in ds so its content was probably underestimated in these cases as the fe3 in the oxidized vivianite will not be taken into account to overcome the neglect of fe3 in the vivianite analysis rouzies and millet 1993 proposed to fit the fe3 in vivianite with 3 additional doublets because our samples could not be fitted this way we synthesized vivianite and let it oxidize for 15 days the resulting spectra could be fitted with the 2 fe2 doublets of vivianite and one doublet is 0 46 mm s and qs 0 63 mm s accounting for the oxidized fe in vivianite table b1 these parameters are in line with those reported by mccammon et al 1980 nembrini et al 1983 and rouzies and millet 1993 averaging the 3 doublets proposed for fe3 in vivianite the spectra of ds samples collected during the present study could successfully be fitted with 4 doublets fe2 site a fe2 site b the proposed is 0 46 mm s and qs 0 63 mm s doublet for fe3 in vivianite and a doublet accounting for the remaining fe3 and low spin fe2 with this fitting the quasi inevitable oxidation of vivianite doesn t lead to a constant underestimation of its content to summarize the authors propose a strategy where samples do not necessarily need to be protected from oxidation and are measured at 300k the spectra should be fitted with 4 doublets fe2 site a is 1 2 0 1 mm s qs 2 4 0 1 mm s fe2 site b is 1 25 0 1 mm s qs 3 0 0 1 mm s fe3 in vivianite is 0 46 mm s and qs 0 63 mm s and the remaining signal corresponding to other fe3 species low spin fe2 like pyrite these recommendations allow easier sample handling and higher accuracy of the vivianite quantification 3 2 effect of the higher fe dosing on vivianite formation 3 2 1 fe dosing increase promotes quick and efficient vivianite formation in ds the primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether increased fe dosing would effectively increase the proportion of vivianite present in ds as suggested by wilfert et al 2018 fig 2 shows that the fe content in ds increased over time from 40 mg g until it reaches a steady state at around 65 70 mg g despite the doubling of the fe dosed 494 kg day in phase i to 860 kg day in phase ii the fe content in ds did not double this may be the result of the mixing of on site produced sludge with 30 of external sludge before digestion which dilutes the fe rich produced sludge it is important to verify that this fe increase in the ds is accompanied by an increase of the vivianite content first of all xrd confirmed the presence of vivianite in all the samples appendix a also modelling using visual minteq showed that the fe and p concentrations in the slude liquor are above the saturation index for vivianite appendix e sem edx analysis also showed particles with a sheets agglomerate structure characteristic of vivianite and an fe p ratio close to 1 5 fig 3 zelibor et al 1988 rothe 2016 the quantification of vivianite in the samples was performed according to the improved mössbauer strategy described above the results indicate that the vivianite content in ds increased from 50 to 150 mg g of ts following the increase of fe in ds fig 2 the fraction of p present as vivianite followed the same trend with an increase from 20 to 50 fig 2 this confirms the main research hypothesis of this study an increase in fe dosing increases the proportion of p present as vivianite in ds interestingly the increase in vivianite immediately followed the increase in fe content in sludge indicating that the p present in digested sludge is quickly converted to vivianite nriagu et al 1974 stated that vivianite is the most stable p mineral in a reducing environment like ds this result suggests that vivianite could also be kinetically favored to confirm that this vivianite formation technique is efficient it is important to verify how much of the extra fe dosed is actually used to form vivianite firstly mass balances show that 99 of the fe in the digested sludge can be found in the solid fraction appendix f secondly data in appendix g suggests that the content of fe in vivianite increases linearly r2 0 86 with the fe content in ds the slope of this line is 1 24 0 16 confirming that all the extra fe present in ds was present as vivianite moreover a slope bigger than 1 suggests that some of the fe that was present in sludge in non vivianite species was converted to vivianite as well such non vivianite species could be fe oxides fesx or organically bound fe for example 3 2 2 fes compounds are forming prior to vivianite in digested sludge the data obtained in this study follow the same trend observed in wilfert et al 2018 appendix h the distribution of their data is broader since they used data from several studies several plants and different analytical methods and fitting their study showed that the fraction of p present as vivianite increased linearly with the fe p ratio and seemed to reach a plateau at fe p 1 5 which is the ratio in pure vivianite due to limited phosphorus availability for lower fe p ratios the absence of vivianite is likely related to the lower solubility product for ironsulfide the data of wilfert et al 2018 would seem to suggest that a fe p ratio of around 0 2 0 4 would be needed before vivianite precipitation occured x value for y 0 in appendix h our set of data suggests however that a value of 0 5 0 6 is required we hypothesize that these discrepancies are mainly due to the strong influence of the s content in sludge which needs to be consumed before any fe is available for vivianite precipitation this suggests that a comparison of data from different wwtps would only be possible if the quantity of s were taken into account accordingly a s corrected fe p ratio was calculated in our study assuming that all the s was formed as fes before vivianite even though fes2 is the most stable inorganic fe precipitate under anaerobic conditions pourbaix 1963 pyritization is a slow process under the digester conditions nielsen et al 2005 therefore the meta stable amorphous fes could be a precursor to the formation of pyrite morse et al 1998 dewil et al 2009 this could explain why no trace of crystalline fesx has been found in our samples by xrd the percentage of phosphorus in vivianite was plotted as a function of the s corrected fe p with data from both studies presenting less variation r2 0 86 for s corrected fe p in fig 4 and r2 0 76 for uncorrected fe p in fig h1 this suggests that the discrepancies observed were indeed related to the different sulphide content the data for the s corrected fe p ratio between 0 and 1 follow a linear trend y 1 01x 0 21 r2 0 86 this suggests that 100 of phosphorus will be present as vivianite for a s corrected fe p ratio of 1 2 although this is contradicted by the data with fe p 1 presented in fig 4 the proposed linear relation seems to be only valid for low s corrected fe p ratio from 0 to 1 the authors suggest this is due to the fact that a fraction of the phosphorus could be organically bound or precipitated with calcium or as struvite the intercept with the x axis indicates that a s corrected fe p ratio of 0 2 is needed before the formation of vivianite this suggests not only that s competes for fe but that fe is also depleted by another form before being available for vivianite precipitation this part of the fe could be present as amorphous fe oxides hydroxide no crystalline feo detected with xrd and or bound to humic substances abros kina et al 2016 lovley et al 1999 thermodynamic modelling suggests that vivianite fes and iron oxides can form in the conditions of the nieuwveer wwtp appendix e strengite is often mentioned as one of the possible fep minerals in wastewater and could form according to our modelling results however no trace of it has been found by xrd or mössbauer spectroscopy visual minteq does not take into account some parameters such as kinetics and activation energy in its model which can explain the discrepancies between the prediction and reality for example it is common that a mineral kinetically favored forms over a mineral thermodynamically favored brown et al 1985 this could explain why strengite has never been found in previous studies within our group wilfert et al 2015 2018 wang et al 2019 these observations lead to an important conclusion for wwtps aiming to recover p via vivianite the fe dosage needs to be adapted according to the sulphur content present in the sludge more specifically fe should be dosed in a molar ratio 1 1 compared to the s in ds before any vivianite can be found in ds this extra fe dosing required is not a waste as it will also help control h2s emission see 3 3 in most of cases s would have already been bound by fe therefore no extra fe is needed to compensate for s if one wants to increase the vivianite content 3 2 3 there is evidence that different types of vivianite are formed several results from the current study suggest that there are different kinds of vivianite formed in the wwtp at nieuwveer this finding is important since these vivianite species could have different properties directly impacting their magnetic recovery different degrees of oxidation and impurity inclusion could lead to different types of vivianite indeed vivianite can easily be oxidized by light and oxygen čermáková et al 2013 mccammon et al 1980 and fe atoms in its structure can be replaced by other cations rothe et al 2016 seitz et al 1973 oxidation of vivianite and substitution of fe by a non magnetic cation mg2 ca2 modify the structure of vivianite transition from crystalline to amorphous and could impact its magnetic properties mössbauer results suggest that not all the vivianite formed in nieuwveer is identical but do not allow a clear conclusion to be drawn about their characteristics detailed discussion in appendix i in their study wilfert et al 2018 used standard addition with xrd to quantify vivianite in ds as the xrd signal should be proportional to the quantity of vivianite however in the current study the xrd signal stays failry constant appendix i despite an increase in vivianite content in sludge this result is surprising and suggests that the newly formed vivianite is different as xrd can not detect it this other vivianite could be smaller or amorphous light microscope pictures of vivianite extracted from the ds at nieuwveer showed that not all the vivianite particles are identical a color gradient can be observed in fig 5 and hints that some particles are more oxidized than others colorless when non oxidized vivianite becomes bluer with a higher degree of oxidation zelibor et al 1988 ogorodova et al 2017 the oxidation of vivianite is accompanied by the departure of a proton from the vivianite structure destabilizing its crystalline matrix however due to the anaerobic conditions in the digester it is unlikely that vivianite oxidizes in this environment it is possible that the dark blue crystals formed in the early stages of the wwtp and were oxidized in the aerated zones wilfert et al 2018 already observed vivianite formation before digestion in several wwtps vivianite was also found in nieuwveer in the b stage and mixed sludge table b1 almost all the soluble fe in the a stage was fe2 giving favorable conditions for vivianite formation si 3 appendix e in the b stage the concentration of fe2 was low 0 2 ppm creating a barely saturated environment for vivianite formation si around 0 this suggests that the vivianite identified in the b sludge either forms in the a stage and is transported to the b stage afterward or forms slowly in the b stage this early formed vivianite will have been in oxidative conditions for enough time to be oxidized srt for b stage 16 days in nieuwveer to summarize there is clear evidence that different types of vivianite formed in nieuwveer but we could not identify their characteristics with certainty from the results we hypothesize that some vivianite forms early in the wwtp and has different characteristics oxidation level crystallinity than the vivianite forming under anaerobic conditions in the digester it is crucial to further study these vivianite species and their properties since it may influence their magnetic recovery 3 3 impact of increased fe dosing on the functioning of the wwtp while increasing fe dosing favors vivianite formation which is significant in terms of phosphorus recovery this should no happen to the detriment of the global functioning of the wwtp in this regard the following integral parameters of the nieuwveer wwtp were monitored p in the effluent h2s in the biogas nitrogen removal biogas production cod removal and dewaterability of the sludge since wwtps are influenced by seasonal effects the comparison was made to years with normal fe dosing but for the same time period period ii 01 01 to 30 04 as in fig 1 first of all total phosphorus concentrations in the effluent decreased after increasing the iron dosing fig 6 shows that it was reduced to an average of 0 42 mg l during the period of high fe dosing compared to an average of 1 28 mg p l for the 4 previous years in the same period fe is dosed in the first place to remove phosphorus so this observation is not surprising due to this decrease the wwtp at nieuwveer would be able to discharge its effluent in a more sensitive body of water closer to the plant and to improve water availability for agriculture in the region high fe dosing and subsequent recovery of phosphorus through vivianite is therefore a promising technology for areas where strict effluent limits are applied such as in countries bordering the baltic sea where stringent requirements for effluent p concentration can only be achieved by metal salt dosing suresh kumar et al 2019 the quantity of h2s in the biogas was reduced in nieuwveer to an average of 8 ppm under higher fe dosing compared to 26 ppm under normal fe dosing fig 6 this is in accordance with the observation that fe can be used to reduce the h2s in the biogas by binding it as fesx gutierrez et al 2010 mamais et al 1994 despite a clear decrease of h2s in the biogas an increase of s in the solid fraction of the ds is not noticeable a mass balance of the s in the digester showed that this h2s reduction in the biogas corresponds to only 246 g of s per day it represents 0 08 of the daily s load in the ds explaining why an increase in the solid s was not noticeable in our measurements appendix d as discussed above fesx forms preferentially over vivianite so we expected the soluble s pool to be already depleted before the increased fe dosing the observed h2s decrease goes against this thought but can be explained by thermodynamic as more fe is dosed there is more soluble fe in the ds thus soluble s is decreasing to keep the solid liquid equilibrium for fesx s confirmed by icp oes in appendix d the chemical potential theory says that the liquid and the gas phase need to be in equilibrium which can only be matched if s in the gas phase h2s decreases as well the data showed no significant change in the nitrogen removal performance of the wwtp after the increased iron dosing table 1 in addition no change in nh3 removal was observed this does not necessarily mean that the increased fe dosing has not affected the nitrogen cycle some possible impact of fe dosing are higher fe dosing could improve flocculation in the a stage allowing less cod to go to the b stage impairing the nitrogen removal if not enough cod is present to perform denitrification excessive fe dosing could also have the opposite effect by destabilizing the flocs allowing more cod to go to the b stage and thus improving denitrification according to bratby et al 2016 a concentration of fe2 in the range 0 8 80 ppm allows good flocculation our measurements indicate values in this range 10 20 ppm in the a stage indicating that destabilization of the flocs is unlikely another point to consider is that 10 25 of the nitrogen is organically bound and will be flocculated in the a stage as well henze et al 2008 reducing the required cod in the b stage in short the nitrogen cycle could be affected in several contradictory ways by fe dosing not leading to any significant difference more detailed measurements would be necessary to obtain a clearer answer but this was not the main objective of the current study during increased fe dosing cod removal was slightly improved from 91 7 to 93 0 table 1 the fe2 dosed is oxidized in the a stage to remove cod as is commonly the case however 20 50 of the fe that arrives at the b stage is still fe2 and this suggests that the oxidation of the fe ii in the a stage is not optimal appendix d fe2 is a less strong coagulant than fe3 due to its lower charge improved cod removal could still be possible if fe3 were used in the a stage or the oxidation of the fe2 was improved the water authority brabantse delta doses fe2 salts in nieuwveer because it is cheaper and not to promote vivianite formation the higher fe dosing did not have a significant impact on biogas production table 1 no increase of a sludge production nor cod removal 50 in the a stage was noticed despite more fe dosed explaining why the biogas production did not increase moreover the fe content jumped from 40 mg g of ts for the 2015 2018 period considered equal to the 04 12 2018 measurement to an average of 65 mg g for 2019 fig 2 this increase reduces the digestible content per tons of dry solid by 2 3 contributing to less biogas production per dry weight of sludge because the dewatered digested sludge is transported before incineration the sludge volume needs to be minimized to reduce transportation costs according to the results in table 1 increased fe dosing had no measurable effect on the dewaterability of the digested sludge the percentage of dry matter after dewatering of the digested sludge is comparable to other years and the same quantity of polymer was used to achieve this dry matter content however no specific actions was taken to optimize the sludge dewatering during this test higher fe dosing slightly decreases the vss in the sludge as it will increase the inorganic content of the sludge more vivianite formed the magnetic extraction of the formed vivianite reduces the inorganic content leading to higher vss fraction thus an increased heating value of the sludge after dewatering in short higher fe dosing did not appear to have any negative impact on the functioning of the wwtp in terms of n removal dewaterability biogas production and cod removal the latter showing slight improvement on the contrary it considerably reduced the p level in the effluent and the h2s content in the biogas 3 4 future perspectives for p recovery by magnetic extraction of vivianite the magnetic extraction of vivianite from ds is possible prot et al 2019 and pilot plant tests for magnetic recovery were taking place in parallel to this study this study confirmed that increasing fe dosing increases the share of p as vivianite and thus the share of recoverable phosphorus according to wilfert et al 2018 neither the type of fe salt used nor the type of installation influences the quantity of p present as vivianite after digestion suggesting that dosing will mainly depend on local aspects and a uniform guideline for practical implementation of higher fe dosing need not be given the quantity of fe dosed should be adapted to the objective of the water authority in terms of p level in the effluent h2s control and vivianite production wwtps seeking to maximize recovery of p as vivianite could aim at a s corrected fe p ratio see 3 2 2 in the digested sludge higher than 1 5 to convert more than 80 of the p into vivianite the cost increase associated with higher fe dosing is not negligible but can be offset by the savings in sludge disposal and better effluent quality for example in the case of nieuwveer the increase in fe dosing was on average 366 kg fe day corresponding to a cost of 304 day based on a cost price of 0 83 kg for feso4 7h2o as paid by the wwtp this wwtp produces 15 tons of dry solids per day with a disposal cost of around 277 per ton of dry solids assuming 23 dry matter leading to a daily cost of 4155 snb annual report 2018 assuming that all the extra vivianite formed would be removed from the digested sludge the amount of dry solid would be reduced by 10 making a saving of 415 day moreover the oxygen required to oxidize the extra fe2 dosed in the a stage represents only 0 1 of the aeration necessary to treat the cod in nieuwveer as a result no extra aeration costs are to be expected appendix k in the case of wwtp nieuwveer ca 90 of the p present in the influent ended up in the sewage sludge at the higher iron dosage these influent 5 ppm and effluent 0 5 ppm values are typical for sewage treatment plants in northern europe pons et al 2004 the results of this study and of wilfert et al 2018 indicate that if the iron dosage is adjusted to have a fe p molar ratio in digested sludge above 1 5 more than 80 of the phosphorus present in digested sludge can be present as vivianite our work on pilot scale magnetic separation of vivianite at nieuwveer revealed that 70 80 of the vivianite in digested sludge could be recovered unpublished results therefore we expect that stimulation of vivianite formation in combination with magnetic recovery from the sludge could recover 50 60 of the p present in the influent of the nieuwveer sewage treatment plant we believe that these results can be extrapolated for all wwtps bearing an anaerobic digester in the future vivianite recovery could be integrated with dissolution of the vivianite by alkaline treatment proof of principle in prot et al 2019 to recover the phosphorus in any desired form and to enable the reuse of the fe in the next cycle of phosphate recovery at the wwtp vivianite recovery recovers not only the dosed iron but also any iron that was present in the influent wastewater this makes vivianite recovery of particular interest for wwtps treating high fe bearing industrial wastewater in areas with significant aerobic groundwater intrusion in the sewer network in countries with strict effluent criteria the fe dosage is already high fe p ratio 1 5 is common therefore the digested sludge from these types of plants is often suitable for direct vivianite recovery without additional fe dosing in addition to recovery of p and fe via an alkaline treatment vivianite could be used as fe fertilizer for fe poor soils rombolà et al 2007 several high value applications of vivianite could also be considered depending on its purity after separation using vivianite as a component in lithium ion batteries or to create pigments are two such high value possibilities recham et al 2009 čermáková et al 2013 4 conclusion the share of p present as vivianite in digested sludge could be increased from 20 to 50 by dosing more iron in the nieuwveer wwtp confirming our earlier hypothesis that a high iron content in the sludge has a direct relation to a higher vivianite content wilfert et al 2018 more importantly all the additional iron that was dosed was used to produce vivianite quickly this is an important finding as it suggests a way to efficiently increase p recovery potential via vivianite for instance via magnetic separation from digested sludge our analyses suggest that different types of vivianite mineral coexist in digested sludge further studies need to be carried out to characterize these minerals as they could have implications for recovery methods for the vivianite for instance they may influence the magnetic properties of vivianite and possible uses of the recovered vivianite a thorough study of the wwtp global parameters revealed that the increased fe dosing did not affect the functioning of the wwtp moreover it effectively reduced the concentration of h2s in the biogas from 26 to 8 ppm and more importantly reduced the p in the effluent of the wwtp from 1 3 ppm to 0 4 ppm this indicates that especially if very low effluent phosphate is required a combination of high fe dosing with vivianite recovery is a promising solution to recover phosphorus from ds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

thermodynamic evaluations were carried out with visual minteq to study the stable minerals that could form in the digested sludge under the ph and concentrations conditions in the nieuwveer wwtp the saturation index as defined in mersmann 2001 indicates how thermodynamically favored a precipitation reaction is for vivianite its expression is s i log i a p k s with i a p γ f e 2 c f e 2 3 γ p o 4 3 c p o 4 3 2 where si is the saturation index ks is the solubility product of vivianite at 25 c worth 10 35 76 al borno and tomson 1994 γ is the activity coefficient of the ion in solution in mol l c the concentration of the ion in solution in mol l with this definition a solid can theoretically form if its si is 0 the higher the si the higher the chances of formation vivianite always presents a si 0 which confirms that its formation is thermodynamically possible its si values are mainly comprised between 2 and 5 suggesting that it is the equilibrium zone for vivianite in digested sludge some discrepancies concerning the value of the pks of vivianite can be found in literature while most of the researchers suggest a pks value around 35 37 al borno and tomson 1994 nriagu 1972 rosenqvist 1970 liu et al 2018 proposed a higher value 40 hypothesizing this value the si in our study would be significantly lower between 2 and 1 negative si seems impossible considering that vivianite is forming in ds indicating that the pks given by liu et al 2018 may be overestimated therefore we considered the pks 35 76 from al borno et al in our modelling it is interesting to note that the formation of amorphous fes is also possible si 0 another fesx compound greigite fe ii fe iii 2s4 known to be an amorphous intermediate to the formation of pyrite morse et al 1998 is always saturated with si values 25 and its presence cannot be excluded numerous fe oxides including ferrihydrite magnetite or hematite also have high si 7 and could be formed even though no clear evidence of their presence was found the formation of struvite and strengite fepo4 2h2o is also thermodynamically possible according to our simulation but no trace of these compounds was found by xrd or mössbauer visual minteq does not take into account some parameters like kinetics and activation energy in its model which can explain the discrepancies between the prediction and reality for example it is common that a mineral kinetically favored forms over a mineral thermodynamically favored brown et al 1985 in short the si values obtained in this simulation do not allow to draw clear conclusions but support the presence of fesx and the formation of vivianite over less favored p mineral as strengite or struvite table e1 saturation index for the minerals suspected to be present in digested sludge

the ratio of the spectral contribution site ii site i as given by mössbauer spectroscopy appendix b can be used at 300k it has a value of 2 for pure vivianite since 2 fe2 occupy the 2 octahedral sites ii while 1 fe2 occupies the octahedral site i mori and ito 1950 manning et al 1991 showed that divalent cations substitute preferentially in site ii decreasing the ratio on the contrary oxidation should occur more easily in the site i increasing the ratio rouzies and millet 1993 mccammon et al 1980 fig i1 ratio between site ii and i as given by mössbauer spectroscopy table b1 as a function of the vivianite content in the digested sludge of nieuwveer fig i1 interestingly the ratio site ii site i increased with the vivianite content in sludge fig i1 it can either suggest that the more vivianite in sludge the more oxidized it is 1 or the more vivianite in sludge the purer it is 2 we showed before that more vivianite was formed when the fe dosing was higher under these conditions the saturation index for the formation of vivianite should be higher so we can hypothesize that more vivianite formed before digestion this early formed vivianite goes through oxidative conditions and is therefore more likely to be oxidized which goes in the direction of the case 1 however the degree of oxidation as given by mössbauer ratio fe2 i fe2 ii fe3 i ii in table b1 stays constant with the vivianite content increase in ds disproving the hypothesis 1 the amount of cations susceptible to replace fe in vivianite ca mg were the most present stayed constant in the ds we could imagine that if there is more vivianite in sludge the impurities substituting fe should be more diluted in vivianite supporting the hypothesis 2 while fe dosing was increased our team was also operating a pilot

k the following calculation show that the aeration energy necessary to fully oxidize the extra fe dosed in nieuwveer 366 kg day is negligible compared to the aeration necessary for the cod removal the equation of oxidation of fe2 into fe3 is 4h o2 4fe2 4fe3 2h2o it means that 1 mol of oxygen is necessary to fully oxidize 4 mol of fe2 calculations give that to oxidize 366 kg of fe2 52 5 kg of o2 are necessary in the wwtp nieuwveer the average daily cod was 587 ppm o2 for the period january april 2019 the average flowrate on the same period being 76 273 m3 day it means that 44 8 tons of o2 are necessary to entirely remove this cod considering that the plant cod removal is 93 41 7 tons of o2 are used everyday to treat the cod it means that the o2 that would be necessary to fully oxidize the extra fe2 dose represents 0 1 of the o2 used for cod removal which is negligible 
17788,the recovery of phosphorus from secondary sources like sewage sludge is essential in a world suffering from resources depletion recent studies have demonstrated that phosphorus can be magnetically recovered as vivianite fe ii 3 po4 2 8h2o from the digested sludge ds of waste water treatment plants wwtp dosing iron to study the production of vivianite in digested sludge the quantity of fe dosed at the wwtp of nieuwveer the netherlands was increased from 0 83 to 1 53 kg fe kg p in the influent and the possible benefits for the functioning of the wwtp were evaluated higher fe dosing is not only relevant for p recovery but also for maximal recovery of organics from influent for e g biogas production the share of phosphorus present as vivianite in the ds increased from 20 to 50 after the increase in fe dosing making more phosphorus available for future magnetic recovery this increase was directly proportional to the increase of fe in ds suggesting that vivianite could be favored not only thermodynamically but also kinetically interestingly analyses suggest that several types of vivianite are formed in the wwtp and could differ in their purity oxidation state or crystallinity these differences could have an impact on the subsequent magnetic separation following the fe dosing increase p in the effluent and h2s in the biogas both decreased 1 28 to 0 42 ppm for p and 26 to 8 ppm for h2s no negative impact on the nitrogen removal biogas production cod removal or dewaterability was observed since quantification of vivianite in ds is complicated previous studies were reviewed and we proposed a more accurate mössbauer spectroscopy analysis and fitting for sludge samples this study is important from a p recovery point of view but also because iron addition can play a crucial role in future resource recovery wastewater facilities graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery waste water treatment plant wwtp magnetic recovery mössbauer spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd iron sulphide 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential nutrient for all living organisms and is a key element for global food production as it is widely used as fertilizer childers et al 2011 currently the raw material for its production is mined phosphate rock unfortunately the resources are scarce and concentrated in a few countries morocco holds 70 of the p rock which makes phosphorus a vulnerable resource cordell et al 2015 this situation creates the need to exploit secondary sources of phosphorus like manure or sewage sludge ohtake et al 2019 the phosphorus present in wastewater is normally removed at the waste water treatment plant wwtp the most popular p removal strategies are enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and chemical phosphorus removal cpr the first relies on phosphate accumulating organisms while the second involves iron dosing or more rarely aluminum dosing morse et al 1998 while phosphorus removal technologies are well established and widely applied phosphorus recovery remains a challenge wilfert et al 2015 currently the two main recovery routes are via struvite precipitation for wwtps using ebpr and after incineration for those using cpr however both methods have limitations the p recovery percentage is low for the former one cornel et al 2009 and infrastructure costs are high for the second desmidt et al 2015 recent studies indicate that the mineral vivianite fe ii 3 po4 3 8h2o is an important p sink in the digested sludge from cpr plants wilfert et al 2016 2018 our team has demonstrated that the magnetic extraction of vivianite from ds is possible at lab scale opening a possible new route for p recovery prot et al 2019 wilfert et al 2018 suggest that higher fe dosing could increase the conversion of the p in sludge into vivianite increasing the share of magnetically recoverable p besides its possible effect on vivianite production increased fe dosing is in line with current trends in wastewater treatment northern european countries such as the uk and germany have fixed low limits for p in wwtp effluent 0 15 0 3 ppm that may decrease even further in the future european sustainable phosphorus platform 2019 such low p levels can only be achieved by cpr usually by using fe salts suresh kumar et al 2019 moreover fe addition to the primary settler or the a stage of a wwtp enhances the production of primary sludge thus giving higher biogas yield after digestion li et al 2005 it appears that the use of fe in wastewater treatment fits in a future of net energy producing plants to verify the hypothesis of wilfert et al a controlled fe dosing increase was realized to investigate the actual effect of the fe dosing on vivianite production to achieve this the fe dosing was doubled at the nieuwveer wwtp the netherlands and the results are presented in this article special attention is given to the impact of the higher fe dosing on the integral parameters of the wwtp e g p level in effluent biogas production and n removal to ensure that vivianite production is not achieved to the detriment of the wwtp s primary objectives and in the scope of future wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtp and fe dosing the study took place at the ab plant in nieuwveer the netherlands influent 69 77m3 day in 2018 there a feso4 solution is dosed in the aerated a stage for p and cod removal the solid retention times srts are 0 72 day for the a stage 13 days for the b stage and 20 days for the anaerobic digester this wwtp receives external sludge from other wwtps at irregular intervals the external sludges are mixed with the a and b sludges before being thickened and fed to the digester the external sludge accounts for 30 of the total sludge volume to study the influence of the fe dosing increase the quantity of feso4 dosed in the a stage was doubled for 4 months the dosing can be broken down into 3 phases as shown in fig 1 the phase ii with the highest fe dosing will be the studied period 2 2 sample handling four samples were taken every two weeks from the sludge line the settled sludge from a stage the settled sludge from b stage the mixed a stage b stage and external sludge ms before digestion and the digested sludge appendix a the sludge line was sampled twice in phase i before the start of the fe dosing as a reference and once in phase iii eight other samples were taken at regular intervals for 4 months after which time a steady state should be reached in all the units appendix a samples were poured to the brim into air tight polyethylene bottles and stored in a 4 c fridge after 4 h of transportation at nieuwveer 1 2 ml of each sample was immediately filtered 0 45 μm filter and fixed with 0 05 ml of 0 5m hcl to prevent fe oxidation these samples were analyzed with the ferrozine method for fe speciation and icp oes for elemental composition sludge samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 3750 rpm the cake was dried at 25 c in a fume hood for 48h for total solid ts measurement and later ground and digested for elemental composition and sem edx a part of the cake of the ds was dried in a glove box under anaerobic and light free conditions to prevent vivianite oxidation for xrd x ray diffraction and mössbauer spectroscopy analysis the drying of the sludge was done at room temperature to avoid the decomposition of vivianite 2 3 analyses 2 3 1 light microscopy sem edx around 0 1g of dried solid samples were ground for light microscopy and sem edx analysis the grinding was done to break the organic matter shell covering the vivianite crystals that prevented proper microscope observation the light microscope used was a leica mz95 equipped with a leica dfc320 camera the sem edx apparatus was a jeol jsm 6480 lv scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an oxford instruments x act sdd energy dispersive x ray edx spectrometer the working distance was 10 mm for an accelerating

control user interface for the sem and oxford instruments aztec for the edx data processing 2 3 2 xrd after being dried in the dark in an anaerobic chamber the samples were introduced in a 0 7 mm glass capillary under anaerobic conditions and minimum light exposure the samples were kept and transported in a sealed sample holder covered with aluminum foil just before measurement the capillaries were sealed with a burner the device used was a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer with cu ka radiation 5 80 2θ step size 0 008 the peaks assignment was realized with the software origin pro 9 2 3 3 mössbauer spectroscopy the samples were dried as explained in section 2 3 2 to prevent vivianite oxidation then they were introduced in plastic rings sealed with kapton foil and epoxy glue to prevent oxygen exposure and wrapped in aluminum foil for light protection the sample weight was adjusted to contain a maximum of 17 5 mg of fe cm2 if the sample contained too much fe it was diluted with inert carbon powder transmission 57fe mössbauer absorption spectra were collected at 300 k with a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a57co rh source velocity calibration was carried out using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using the mosswinn 4 0 program klencsár 1997 2 3 4 ferrozine method first 2 ml of sample was filtered and fixed with hcl 0 1 ml of 0 5m hcl directly at the wwtp to avoid fe oxidation reduction and analyzed under anaerobic conditions 4h after sampling the fe speciation was determined using the ferrozine method as explained in viollier et al 2000 in brief 1 ml of hcl fixed sample was added into a cuvette to 0 1 ml of a ferrozine solution which forms a pink complex with fe2 the absorbance was measured at 562 nm after 15 min of reaction with a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer then 0 15 ml of 1 4 m hydroxylamine was added to 0 8 ml of the complexed solution to reduce all the fe3 the reduction took place for 12h to ensure that all the organically bound fe was reduced rasmussen and nielsen 1996 finally 0 05 ml of 10m acetate buffer was added to the sample and the final absorbance was measured the fe2 and fe3 were calculated using these 2 absorbances 2 3 5 microwave digestion icp oes solid samples were destroyed in an ethos easy digester from milestone equipped with an sk 15 high pressure rotor around 50 mg of

phosphorus via magnetic extraction of vivianite is a recent technique and is still in development in prot et al 2019 we reached the first milestone by maximizing the quantity of p present as vivianite the results of wilfert et al 2018 had suggested that an increase in fe dosing could promote vivianite formation however they had conducted their study by examining sludge from 6 wwtps with a fixed fe p ratio to investigate the actual effect of the fe dosing on the vivianite content in the ds vivianite content efficiency of the dosing delay required to form vivianite therefore a controlled fe dosing increase at a single wwtp is required the water authority brabantse delta made this research possible by increasing the iron dosing at the wwtp nieuwveer the netherlands from 0 83 to 1 53 kg fe kg p in the influent for a period of 4 months the effect of this increase on phosphate behaviour and the integral operation of the treatment plant e g p level in effluent biogas production cod removal was studied and the results are discussed in this section since the strategy of recovering p as vivianite is novel the analytical methods are still under development and subject to possible improvements for this reason the first part of the discussion is dedicated to the quantification of vivianite in digested sludge 3 1 quantification of vivianite in digested sludge a short review and best practice the major problem while studying vivianite in digested sludge is its quantification wilfert et al 2018 used standard addition of synthetic vivianite together with xrd a drawback of this method is its use of pure vivianite even though the vivianite in sludge could be impure wilfert et al 2016 seitz et al 1973 moreover xrd is unable to detect small or amorphous vivianite which creates greater uncertainty despite these facts xrd results were in line with mössbauer results in their study even though vivianite content was always estimated on the higher end with xrd mössbauer spectroscopy can detect fe minerals independently of their size or crystallinity and is considered to be the best technique for vivianite quantification so far yet some discrepancies are present in the literature regarding sample handling and measuring and data fitting these problems will be discussed below and an improved practice for vivianite determination with mössbauer will be proposed to understand the data fitting for mössbauer spectroscopy it is important to know that a crystalline unit of vivianite bears 3 possible positions for fe 1 octahedral site called site a and 2 equivalent octahedral sites called site b mori and ito 1950 the most characteristic feature of vivianite is that it has 2 doublets for fe2 present in site a 1 fe2 ion and site b 2 fe2 ions the mössbauer parameters for these sites are well described and accepted in the literature site a isomer shift is 1 2 0 1 mm s quadrupole splitting qs 2 4 0 1 mm s and site b is 1 25 0 1 mm s qs 3 0 0 1 mm s mccammon et al 1980 rouzies and millet 1993 nembrini et al 1983 thus the amount of fe2 present in vivianite in a sample can be reliably quantified however vivianite can easily be oxidized by oxygen and or light čermáková et al 2013 mccammon et al 1980 leading to the transformation of a part of the fe2 from both sites into fe3 the signal of fe3 in vivianite is difficult to distinguish from that of fe3 species that can generally be present in sludge samples therefore the samples are generally protected from oxidation as much as possible wilfert et al 2018 wang et al 2019 this study to prevent minimize the oxidation of fe during sampling and handling the samples can be studied by mössbauer spectroscopy at temperature from 4 2k to 300k although wilfert et al 2016 2018 reported that measurements at 4 2k were not suitable for vivianite determination due to the complexity of the signal vivianite can be quantified at 100k wilfert et al 2018 wang et al 2019 but these analyses do not seem to add any information compared to the quicker and easier analyses at 300k several researchers working with ds proposed measurements at 300k with a fitting with 3 doublets fe2 in site a fe2 in site b and fe3 feii accounting for all the fe3 species including fe3 in vivianite and low spin fe2 compounds like pyrite prot et al 2019 frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2018 vivianite is likely to be partly oxidized in ds so its content was probably underestimated in these cases as the fe3 in the oxidized vivianite will not be taken into account to overcome the neglect of fe3 in the vivianite analysis rouzies and millet 1993 proposed to fit the fe3 in vivianite with 3 additional doublets because our samples could not be fitted this way we synthesized vivianite and let it oxidize for 15 days the resulting spectra could be fitted with the 2 fe2 doublets of vivianite and one doublet is 0 46 mm s and qs 0 63 mm s accounting for the oxidized fe in vivianite table b1 these parameters are in line with those reported by mccammon et al 1980 nembrini et al 1983 and rouzies and millet 1993 averaging the 3 doublets proposed for fe3 in vivianite the spectra of ds samples collected during the present study could successfully be fitted with 4 doublets fe2 site a fe2 site b the proposed is 0 46 mm s and qs 0 63 mm s doublet for fe3 in vivianite and a doublet accounting for the remaining fe3 and low spin fe2 with this fitting the quasi inevitable oxidation of vivianite doesn t lead to a constant underestimation of its content to summarize the authors propose a strategy where samples do not necessarily need to be protected from oxidation and are measured at 300k the spectra should be fitted with 4 doublets fe2 site a is 1 2 0 1 mm s qs 2 4 0 1 mm s fe2 site b is 1 25 0 1 mm s qs 3 0 0 1 mm s fe3 in vivianite is 0 46 mm s and qs 0 63 mm s and the remaining signal corresponding to other fe3 species low spin fe2 like pyrite these recommendations allow easier sample handling and higher accuracy of the vivianite quantification 3 2 effect of the higher fe dosing on vivianite formation 3 2 1 fe dosing increase promotes quick and efficient vivianite formation in ds the primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether increased fe dosing would effectively increase the proportion of vivianite present in ds as suggested by wilfert et al 2018 fig 2 shows that the fe content in ds increased over time from 40 mg g until it reaches a steady state at around 65 70 mg g despite the doubling of the fe dosed 494 kg day in phase i to 860 kg day in phase ii the fe content in ds did not double this may be the result of the mixing of on site produced sludge with 30 of external sludge before digestion which dilutes the fe rich produced sludge it is important to verify that this fe increase in the ds is accompanied by an increase of the vivianite content first of all xrd confirmed the presence of vivianite in all the samples appendix a also modelling using visual minteq showed that the fe and p concentrations in the slude liquor are above the saturation index for vivianite appendix e sem edx analysis also showed particles with a sheets agglomerate structure characteristic of vivianite and an fe p ratio close to 1 5 fig 3 zelibor et al 1988 rothe 2016 the quantification of vivianite in the samples was performed according to the improved mössbauer strategy described above the results indicate that the vivianite content in ds increased from 50 to 150 mg g of ts following the increase of fe in ds fig 2 the fraction of p present as vivianite followed the same trend with an increase from 20 to 50 fig 2 this confirms the main research hypothesis of this study an increase in fe dosing increases the proportion of p present as vivianite in ds interestingly the increase in vivianite immediately followed the increase in fe content in sludge indicating that the p present in digested sludge is quickly converted to vivianite nriagu et al 1974 stated that vivianite is the most stable p mineral in a reducing environment like ds this result suggests that vivianite could also be kinetically favored to confirm that this vivianite formation technique is efficient it is important to verify how much of the extra fe dosed is actually used to form vivianite firstly mass balances show that 99 of the fe in the digested sludge can be found in the solid fraction appendix f secondly data in appendix g suggests that the content of fe in vivianite increases linearly r2 0 86 with the fe content in ds the slope of this line is 1 24 0 16 confirming that all the extra fe present in ds was present as vivianite moreover a slope bigger than 1 suggests that some of the fe that was present in sludge in non vivianite species was converted to vivianite as well such non vivianite species could be fe oxides fesx or organically bound fe for example 3 2 2 fes compounds are forming prior to vivianite in digested sludge the data obtained in this study follow the same trend observed in wilfert et al 2018 appendix h the distribution of their data is broader since they used data from several studies several plants and different analytical methods and fitting their study showed that the fraction of p present as vivianite increased linearly with the fe p ratio and seemed to reach a plateau at fe p 1 5 which is the ratio in pure vivianite due to limited phosphorus availability for lower fe p ratios the absence of vivianite is likely related to the lower solubility product for ironsulfide the data of wilfert et al 2018 would seem to suggest that a fe p ratio of around 0 2 0 4 would be needed before vivianite precipitation occured x value for y 0 in appendix h our set of data suggests however that a value of 0 5 0 6 is required we hypothesize that these discrepancies are mainly due to the strong influence of the s content in sludge which needs to be consumed before any fe is available for vivianite precipitation this suggests that a comparison of data from different wwtps would only be possible if the quantity of s were taken into account accordingly a s corrected fe p ratio was calculated in our study assuming that all the s was formed as fes before vivianite even though fes2 is the most stable inorganic fe precipitate under anaerobic conditions pourbaix 1963 pyritization is a slow process under the digester conditions nielsen et al 2005 therefore the meta stable amorphous fes could be a precursor to the formation of pyrite morse et al 1998 dewil et al 2009 this could explain why no trace of crystalline fesx has been found in our samples by xrd the percentage of phosphorus in vivianite was plotted as a function of the s corrected fe p with data from both studies presenting less variation r2 0 86 for s corrected fe p in fig 4 and r2 0 76 for uncorrected fe p in fig h1 this suggests that the discrepancies observed were indeed related to the different sulphide content the data for the s corrected fe p ratio between 0 and 1 follow a linear trend y 1 01x 0 21 r2 0 86 this suggests that 100 of phosphorus will be present as vivianite for a s corrected fe p ratio of 1 2 although this is contradicted by the data with fe p 1 presented in fig 4 the proposed linear relation seems to be only valid for low s corrected fe p ratio from 0 to 1 the authors suggest this is due to the fact that a fraction of the phosphorus could be organically bound or precipitated with calcium or as struvite the intercept with the x axis indicates that a s corrected fe p ratio of 0 2 is needed before the formation of vivianite this suggests not only that s competes for fe but that fe is also depleted by another form before being available for vivianite precipitation this part of the fe could be present as amorphous fe oxides hydroxide no crystalline feo detected with xrd and or bound to humic substances abros kina et al 2016 lovley et al 1999 thermodynamic modelling suggests that vivianite fes and iron oxides can form in the conditions of the nieuwveer wwtp appendix e strengite is often mentioned as one of the possible fep minerals in wastewater and could form according to our modelling results however no trace of it has been found by xrd or mössbauer spectroscopy visual minteq does not take into account some parameters such as kinetics and activation energy in its model which can explain the discrepancies between the prediction and reality for example it is common that a mineral kinetically favored forms over a mineral thermodynamically favored brown et al 1985 this could explain why strengite has never been found in previous studies within our group wilfert et al 2015 2018 wang et al 2019 these observations lead to an important conclusion for wwtps aiming to recover p via vivianite the fe dosage needs to be adapted according to the sulphur content present in the sludge more specifically fe should be dosed in a molar ratio 1 1 compared to the s in ds before any vivianite can be found in ds this extra fe dosing required is not a waste as it will also help control h2s emission see 3 3 in most of cases s would have already been bound by fe therefore no extra fe is needed to compensate for s if one wants to increase the vivianite content 3 2 3 there is evidence that different types of vivianite are formed several results from the current study suggest that there are different kinds of vivianite formed in the wwtp at nieuwveer this finding is important since these vivianite species could have different properties directly impacting their magnetic recovery different degrees of oxidation and impurity inclusion could lead to different types of vivianite indeed vivianite can easily be oxidized by light and oxygen čermáková et al 2013 mccammon et al 1980 and fe atoms in its structure can be replaced by other cations rothe et al 2016 seitz et al 1973 oxidation of vivianite and substitution of fe by a non magnetic cation mg2 ca2 modify the structure of vivianite transition from crystalline to amorphous and could impact its magnetic properties mössbauer results suggest that not all the vivianite formed in nieuwveer is identical but do not allow a clear conclusion to be drawn about their characteristics detailed discussion in appendix i in their study wilfert et al 2018 used standard addition with xrd to quantify vivianite in ds as the xrd signal should be proportional to the quantity of vivianite however in the current study the xrd signal stays failry constant appendix i despite an increase in vivianite content in sludge this result is surprising and suggests that the newly formed vivianite is different as xrd can not detect it this other vivianite could be smaller or amorphous light microscope pictures of vivianite extracted from the ds at nieuwveer showed that not all the vivianite particles are identical a color gradient can be observed in fig 5 and hints that some particles are more oxidized than others colorless when non oxidized vivianite becomes bluer with a higher degree of oxidation zelibor et al 1988 ogorodova et al 2017 the oxidation of vivianite is accompanied by the departure of a proton from the vivianite structure destabilizing its crystalline matrix however due to the anaerobic conditions in the digester it is unlikely that vivianite oxidizes in this environment it is possible that the dark blue crystals formed in the early stages of the wwtp and were oxidized in the aerated zones wilfert et al 2018 already observed vivianite formation before digestion in several wwtps vivianite was also found in nieuwveer in the b stage and mixed sludge table b1 almost all the soluble fe in the a stage was fe2 giving favorable conditions for vivianite formation si 3 appendix e in the b stage the concentration of fe2 was low 0 2 ppm creating a barely saturated environment for vivianite formation si around 0 this suggests that the vivianite identified in the b sludge either forms in the a stage and is transported to the b stage afterward or forms slowly in the b stage this early formed vivianite will have been in oxidative conditions for enough time to be oxidized srt for b stage 16 days in nieuwveer to summarize there is clear evidence that different types of vivianite formed in nieuwveer but we could not identify their characteristics with certainty from the results we hypothesize that some vivianite forms early in the wwtp and has different characteristics oxidation level crystallinity than the vivianite forming under anaerobic conditions in the digester it is crucial to further study these vivianite species and their properties since it may influence their magnetic recovery 3 3 impact of increased fe dosing on the functioning of the wwtp while increasing fe dosing favors vivianite formation which is significant in terms of phosphorus recovery this should no happen to the detriment of the global functioning of the wwtp in this regard the following integral parameters of the nieuwveer wwtp were monitored p in the effluent h2s in the biogas nitrogen removal biogas production cod removal and dewaterability of the sludge since wwtps are influenced by seasonal effects the comparison was made to years with normal fe dosing but for the same time period period ii 01 01 to 30 04 as in fig 1 first of all total phosphorus concentrations in the effluent decreased after increasing the iron dosing fig 6 shows that it was reduced to an average of 0 42 mg l during the period of high fe dosing compared to an average of 1 28 mg p l for the 4 previous years in the same period fe is dosed in the first place to remove phosphorus so this observation is not surprising due to this decrease the wwtp at nieuwveer would be able to discharge its effluent in a more sensitive body of water closer to the plant and to improve water availability for agriculture in the region high fe dosing and subsequent recovery of phosphorus through vivianite is therefore a promising technology for areas where strict effluent limits are applied such as in countries bordering the baltic sea where stringent requirements for effluent p concentration can only be achieved by metal salt dosing suresh kumar et al 2019 the quantity of h2s in the biogas was reduced in nieuwveer to an average of 8 ppm under higher fe dosing compared to 26 ppm under normal fe dosing fig 6 this is in accordance with the observation that fe can be used to reduce the h2s in the biogas by binding it as fesx gutierrez et al 2010 mamais et al 1994 despite a clear decrease of h2s in the biogas an increase of s in the solid fraction of the ds is not noticeable a mass balance of the s in the digester showed that this h2s reduction in the biogas corresponds to only 246 g of s per day it represents 0 08 of the daily s load in the ds explaining why an increase in the solid s was not noticeable in our measurements appendix d as discussed above fesx forms preferentially over vivianite so we expected the soluble s pool to be already depleted before the increased fe dosing the observed h2s decrease goes against this thought but can be explained by thermodynamic as more fe is dosed there is more soluble fe in the ds thus soluble s is decreasing to keep the solid liquid equilibrium for fesx s confirmed by icp oes in appendix d the chemical potential theory says that the liquid and the gas phase need to be in equilibrium which can only be matched if s in the gas phase h2s decreases as well the data showed no significant change in the nitrogen removal performance of the wwtp after the increased iron dosing table 1 in addition no change in nh3 removal was observed this does not necessarily mean that the increased fe dosing has not affected the nitrogen cycle some possible impact of fe dosing are higher fe dosing could improve flocculation in the a stage allowing less cod to go to the b stage impairing the nitrogen removal if not enough cod is present to perform denitrification excessive fe dosing could also have the opposite effect by destabilizing the flocs allowing more cod to go to the b stage and thus improving denitrification according to bratby et al 2016 a concentration of fe2 in the range 0 8 80 ppm allows good flocculation our measurements indicate values in this range 10 20 ppm in the a stage indicating that destabilization of the flocs is unlikely another point to consider is that 10 25 of the nitrogen is organically bound and will be flocculated in the a stage as well henze et al 2008 reducing the required cod in the b stage in short the nitrogen cycle could be affected in several contradictory ways by fe dosing not leading to any significant difference more detailed measurements would be necessary to obtain a clearer answer but this was not the main objective of the current study during increased fe dosing cod removal was slightly improved from 91 7 to 93 0 table 1 the fe2 dosed is oxidized in the a stage to remove cod as is commonly the case however 20 50 of the fe that arrives at the b stage is still fe2 and this suggests that the oxidation of the fe ii in the a stage is not optimal appendix d fe2 is a less strong coagulant than fe3 due to its lower charge improved cod removal could still be possible if fe3 were used in the a stage or the oxidation of the fe2 was improved the water authority brabantse delta doses fe2 salts in nieuwveer because it is cheaper and not to promote vivianite formation the higher fe dosing did not have a significant impact on biogas production table 1 no increase of a sludge production nor cod removal 50 in the a stage was noticed despite more fe dosed explaining why the biogas production did not increase moreover the fe content jumped from 40 mg g of ts for the 2015 2018 period considered equal to the 04 12 2018 measurement to an average of 65 mg g for 2019 fig 2 this increase reduces the digestible content per tons of dry solid by 2 3 contributing to less biogas production per dry weight of sludge because the dewatered digested sludge is transported before incineration the sludge volume needs to be minimized to reduce transportation costs according to the results in table 1 increased fe dosing had no measurable effect on the dewaterability of the digested sludge the percentage of dry matter after dewatering of the digested sludge is comparable to other years and the same quantity of polymer was used to achieve this dry matter content however no specific actions was taken to optimize the sludge dewatering during this test higher fe dosing slightly decreases the vss in the sludge as it will increase the inorganic content of the sludge more vivianite formed the magnetic extraction of the formed vivianite reduces the inorganic content leading to higher vss fraction thus an increased heating value of the sludge after dewatering in short higher fe dosing did not appear to have any negative impact on the functioning of the wwtp in terms of n removal dewaterability biogas production and cod removal the latter showing slight improvement on the contrary it considerably reduced the p level in the effluent and the h2s content in the biogas 3 4 future perspectives for p recovery by magnetic extraction of vivianite the magnetic extraction of vivianite from ds is possible prot et al 2019 and pilot plant tests for magnetic recovery were taking place in parallel to this study this study confirmed that increasing fe dosing increases the share of p as vivianite and thus the share of recoverable phosphorus according to wilfert et al 2018 neither the type of fe salt used nor the type of installation influences the quantity of p present as vivianite after digestion suggesting that dosing will mainly depend on local aspects and a uniform guideline for practical implementation of higher fe dosing need not be given the quantity of fe dosed should be adapted to the objective of the water authority in terms of p level in the effluent h2s control and vivianite production wwtps seeking to maximize recovery of p as vivianite could aim at a s corrected fe p ratio see 3 2 2 in the digested sludge higher than 1 5 to convert more than 80 of the p into vivianite the cost increase associated with higher fe dosing is not negligible but can be offset by the savings in sludge disposal and better effluent quality for example in the case of nieuwveer the increase in fe dosing was on average 366 kg fe day corresponding to a cost of 304 day based on a cost price of 0 83 kg for feso4 7h2o as paid by the wwtp this wwtp produces 15 tons of dry solids per day with a disposal cost of around 277 per ton of dry solids assuming 23 dry matter leading to a daily cost of 4155 snb annual report 2018 assuming that all the extra vivianite formed would be removed from the digested sludge the amount of dry solid would be reduced by 10 making a saving of 415 day moreover the oxygen required to oxidize the extra fe2 dosed in the a stage represents only 0 1 of the aeration necessary to treat the cod in nieuwveer as a result no extra aeration costs are to be expected appendix k in the case of wwtp nieuwveer ca 90 of the p present in the influent ended up in the sewage sludge at the higher iron dosage these influent 5 ppm and effluent 0 5 ppm values are typical for sewage treatment plants in northern europe pons et al 2004 the results of this study and of wilfert et al 2018 indicate that if the iron dosage is adjusted to have a fe p molar ratio in digested sludge above 1 5 more than 80 of the phosphorus present in digested sludge can be present as vivianite our work on pilot scale magnetic separation of vivianite at nieuwveer revealed that 70 80 of the vivianite in digested sludge could be recovered unpublished results therefore we expect that stimulation of vivianite formation in combination with magnetic recovery from the sludge could recover 50 60 of the p present in the influent of the nieuwveer sewage treatment plant we believe that these results can be extrapolated for all wwtps bearing an anaerobic digester in the future vivianite recovery could be integrated with dissolution of the vivianite by alkaline treatment proof of principle in prot et al 2019 to recover the phosphorus in any desired form and to enable the reuse of the fe in the next cycle of phosphate recovery at the wwtp vivianite recovery recovers not only the dosed iron but also any iron that was present in the influent wastewater this makes vivianite recovery of particular interest for wwtps treating high fe bearing industrial wastewater in areas with significant aerobic groundwater intrusion in the sewer network in countries with strict effluent criteria the fe dosage is already high fe p ratio 1 5 is common therefore the digested sludge from these types of plants is often suitable for direct vivianite recovery without additional fe dosing in addition to recovery of p and fe via an alkaline treatment vivianite could be used as fe fertilizer for fe poor soils rombolà et al 2007 several high value applications of vivianite could also be considered depending on its purity after separation using vivianite as a component in lithium ion batteries or to create pigments are two such high value possibilities recham et al 2009 čermáková et al 2013 4 conclusion the share of p present as vivianite in digested sludge could be increased from 20 to 50 by dosing more iron in the nieuwveer wwtp confirming our earlier hypothesis that a high iron content in the sludge has a direct relation to a higher vivianite content wilfert et al 2018 more importantly all the additional iron that was dosed was used to produce vivianite quickly this is an important finding as it suggests a way to efficiently increase p recovery potential via vivianite for instance via magnetic separation from digested sludge our analyses suggest that different types of vivianite mineral coexist in digested sludge further studies need to be carried out to characterize these minerals as they could have implications for recovery methods for the vivianite for instance they may influence the magnetic properties of vivianite and possible uses of the recovered vivianite a thorough study of the wwtp global parameters revealed that the increased fe dosing did not affect the functioning of the wwtp moreover it effectively reduced the concentration of h2s in the biogas from 26 to 8 ppm and more importantly reduced the p in the effluent of the wwtp from 1 3 ppm to 0 4 ppm this indicates that especially if very low effluent phosphate is required a combination of high fe dosing with vivianite recovery is a promising solution to recover phosphorus from ds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

thermodynamic evaluations were carried out with visual minteq to study the stable minerals that could form in the digested sludge under the ph and concentrations conditions in the nieuwveer wwtp the saturation index as defined in mersmann 2001 indicates how thermodynamically favored a precipitation reaction is for vivianite its expression is s i log i a p k s with i a p γ f e 2 c f e 2 3 γ p o 4 3 c p o 4 3 2 where si is the saturation index ks is the solubility product of vivianite at 25 c worth 10 35 76 al borno and tomson 1994 γ is the activity coefficient of the ion in solution in mol l c the concentration of the ion in solution in mol l with this definition a solid can theoretically form if its si is 0 the higher the si the higher the chances of formation vivianite always presents a si 0 which confirms that its formation is thermodynamically possible its si values are mainly comprised between 2 and 5 suggesting that it is the equilibrium zone for vivianite in digested sludge some discrepancies concerning the value of the pks of vivianite can be found in literature while most of the researchers suggest a pks value around 35 37 al borno and tomson 1994 nriagu 1972 rosenqvist 1970 liu et al 2018 proposed a higher value 40 hypothesizing this value the si in our study would be significantly lower between 2 and 1 negative si seems impossible considering that vivianite is forming in ds indicating that the pks given by liu et al 2018 may be overestimated therefore we considered the pks 35 76 from al borno et al in our modelling it is interesting to note that the formation of amorphous fes is also possible si 0 another fesx compound greigite fe ii fe iii 2s4 known to be an amorphous intermediate to the formation of pyrite morse et al 1998 is always saturated with si values 25 and its presence cannot be excluded numerous fe oxides including ferrihydrite magnetite or hematite also have high si 7 and could be formed even though no clear evidence of their presence was found the formation of struvite and strengite fepo4 2h2o is also thermodynamically possible according to our simulation but no trace of these compounds was found by xrd or mössbauer visual minteq does not take into account some parameters like kinetics and activation energy in its model which can explain the discrepancies between the prediction and reality for example it is common that a mineral kinetically favored forms over a mineral thermodynamically favored brown et al 1985 in short the si values obtained in this simulation do not allow to draw clear conclusions but support the presence of fesx and the formation of vivianite over less favored p mineral as strengite or struvite table e1 saturation index for the minerals suspected to be present in digested sludge

should occur more easily in the site i increasing the ratio rouzies and millet 1993 mccammon et al 1980 fig i1 ratio between site ii and i as given by mössbauer spectroscopy table b1 as a function of the vivianite content in the digested sludge of nieuwveer fig i1 interestingly the ratio site ii site i increased with the vivianite content in sludge fig i1 it can either suggest that the more vivianite in sludge the more oxidized it is 1 or the more vivianite in sludge the purer it is 2 we showed before that more vivianite was formed when the fe dosing was higher under these conditions the saturation index for the formation of vivianite should be higher so we can hypothesize that more vivianite formed before digestion this early formed vivianite goes through oxidative conditions and is therefore more likely to be oxidized which goes in the direction of the case 1 however the degree of oxidation as given by mössbauer ratio fe2 i fe2 ii fe3 i ii in table b1 stays constant with the vivianite content increase in ds disproving the hypothesis 1 the amount of cations susceptible to replace fe in vivianite ca mg were the most present stayed constant in the ds we could imagine that if there is more vivianite in sludge the impurities substituting fe should be more diluted in vivianite supporting the hypothesis 2 while fe dosing was increased our team was also operating a pilot installation in nieuwveer to magnetically extract vivianite from the ds unpublished results the extracted vivianite purity 55 80 was analyzed for cations concentrations to confirm 2 from the cations

necessary in the wwtp nieuwveer the average daily cod was 587 ppm o2 for the period january april 2019 the average flowrate on the same period being 76 273 m3 day it means that 44 8 tons of o2 are

17789,this study investigated the degradation and deactivation of an extracellular ampicillin resistance gene amp r encoded in plasmid puc19 during exposure to uv254 oh generated by uv 290 h2o2 and combined exposure to uv254 and oh and or so4 using uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 the degradation rates of amp r measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction increased with increasing target amplicon length 192 851 bps the rate constants for the degradation of puc19 2686 bps were calculated as 0 26 cm2 mj for uv254 and 1 5 1011 m 1s 1 for oh based on the degradation rates of amp r amplicons and assuming an equal sensitivity of dna damage across the entire plasmid dna repair proficient escherichia coli e coli ab1157 strain wild type and its repair deficient mutants including ab1886 uvra ab2463 reca ab2480 uvra reca and dh5α reca enda were applied as recipient cells in gene transformation assays results suggested that the elimination efficiency of transforming activity during uv254 and oh exposure was dependent on the type of dna repair genes in recipient e coli strains losses of transforming activity were slower than the degradation of puc19 by a factor of up to 5 for e coli dh5α highlighting the importance of dna repair in recipient cells the degradation rates of amp r amplicons were much larger by a factor of 4 in uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 than uv254 direct photolysis indicating the significant contribution of oh and so4 to the gene degradation not only uv254 and so4 but also oh contributed to the degradation of amp r during uv254 s2o8 2 which was attributed to the conversion of so4 to oh and a 10 fold larger reactivity of oh towards amp r as compared to so4 however the enhanced gene degradation by radicals did not lead to a faster elimination of gene transforming activity during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 suggesting that uv254 and radical induced dna damage were not additive in their contributions to losses of gene transforming activity wastewater effluent organic matter efom accelerated the degradation of amp r during uv254 irradiation by means of reactive species production through indirect photolysis reactions whereas efom mainly

polymerase chain reaction 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon however anthropogenic activities e g overuse and disposal of antibiotics are providing constant selection pressure on antibiotic resistant bacteria arb vikesland et al 2017 antibiotic resistance can be developed and disseminated within the bacterial population by genetic mutation cell division and the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes args davies and davies 2010 args are contaminants of concern in natural and engineered aquatic systems as arg transfer can be linked with the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens dodd 2012 pruden 2014 mobile genetic elements carrying args e g plasmids integrons and transposons can be disseminated to and expressed by recipient cells through horizontal gene transfer hgt including conjugation mediated by cell to cell contact transduction bacteriophage mediated and transformation mediated by extracellular dna lorenz and wackernagel 1994 of these transformation can be understood to represent the most basic mode of hgt as it does not require the presence of live donor cells or bacteriophages lorenz and wackernagel 1994 consequently quantification of the frequency with which an arg in extracellular dna can be transported into and expressed by a recipient cell through transformation hereafter referred to as transforming activity can provide a conservative measure of the ability of an arg to undergo hgt transforming activity encompasses a efficiency of extracellular dna transport into a recipient cell b any repair of that dna by the recipient cell in the event that the dna is damaged and c heritable incorporation and expression of the dna s genetic information by recipient cells and is therefore a function of both the recipient cell s ability to import repair and express a given arg and the quality and quantity of the extracellular dna containing the arg extracellular dna can be released into the environment though secretion by live cells and lysis of dead cells while unstable to nucleases likely to be present in many aquatic matrixes it can persist in the environment through adsorption onto soil and sediments lorenz and wackernagel 1994 mao et al 2014 nagler et al 2018 although conventional disinfection processes during water treatment e g chlorine and uv efficiently inactivate arb intracellular args are more difficult to degrade mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 he et al 2019 and can be released into water following the death of arb cells zheng et al 2017 sub inhibitory concentrations of disinfectants e g chlorine and monochloramine were even reported to promote the horizontal transfer of args by increasing the permeability of cell membranes and altering the expression of conjugation related genes guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the proportion of extracellular dna carrying args was found to increase after various biological and chemical processes in wastewater treatment revealing the potential risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination in discharged effluent and receiving environments liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 previous studies have reported the enrichment of args in surface water due to the discharged effluents from upstream wastewater treatment plants cacace et al 2019 wu et al 2019 osińska et al 2020 high diversity of args in reclaimed wastewater e g agriculture irrigation potable reuse may pose risks of antibiotic resistance dissemination to environmental bacteria and even human pathogens christou et al 2017 hong et al 2018 uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are increasingly applied for the removal of refractory contaminants during water treatment the elimination of contaminants in uv aop treatment is achieved by dual pathways namely direct uv photolysis depending on the uv absorbances and quantum yields of target compounds and oxidation by powerful radical species stefan 2018 the activation of hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and peroxydisulfate uv s2o8 2 by uv light produces hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 respectively which can degrade a wide range of contaminants as these two radicals react with many compounds at or near diffusion controlled reaction rates buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 have also been reported to efficiently inactivate arb cells michael kordatou et al 2015 ferro et al 2016 giannakis et al 2018 however detailed investigation into the reactivity of oh with intracellular args in these studies was limited due to the significant consumption of oh by constituents of the water matrix and cell membranes before reaching the cell interiors ferro et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a recent studies have reported that the reactivity of oh with extracellular chromosomal args is highly dependent on the length of the monitored arg targets he et al 2019 more studies are needed to assess whether the observed reactivities are generally applicable to other types of dna such as plasmid encoded args to the best of the authors knowledge little is known on the fate of args during so4 based treatment processes quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has been widely applied to quantify structurally intact args or to measure their degradation rates in water and wastewater treatment mckinney and pruden 2012 luby et al 2016 hiller et al 2019 it should be noted that qpcr methods usually record the degradation of a small fraction of a target arg s sequence length with amplicon sizes typically 1000 bps and not the entirety of a gene mckinney and pruden 2012 chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 in addition the efficiency of dna replication particularly of damaged dna in qpcr methods can be different from that observed in bacterial cells subjected to transformation with the same dna furthermore the uptake and repair of dna by recipient cells can play important roles in modulating gene transforming activity chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 while the correlation between the degradation of target arg amplicons measured by qpcr and the elimination of arg transforming activity was reasonably well explained for chromosomal args he et al 2019 it is still less clear for plasmid borne args exposure of dna to uv and oh is known to induce different types of dna damage von sonntag 2006 uv c generates cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds as the predominant dna lesions while oh can induce dna damage ranging from base oxidation to phosphate sugar backbone breakages görner 1994 sinha and häder 2002 von sonntag 2006 it is currently not completely clear how the various type s of dna damage resulting from uv oh and so4 are related to the deactivation of args for example whether dna lesions such as cpds formed by direct uv irradiation have the same effect on dna transforming activity as phosphate sugar backbone breakage by oh generated by h2o2 or s2o8 2 photolysis furthermore in uv aops dna lesions can be generated by both direct uv irradiation and radicals simultaneously the aim of this study was to investigate the fate of plasmid encoded e args during the common uv at 254 nm water disinfection process uv254 and its related aops plasmid puc19 encoding an ampicillin resistance gene amp r was purified from escherichia coli e coli host cells and exposed to uv254 to uv254 in combination with oh or so4 by using uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 or to oh only by combining uv at 290 nm with h2o2 i e uv 290 h2o2 uv 290 h2o2 treatment was chosen to study the effect of oh only exposure because irradiation of h2o2 by uv 290 can generate oh while neither uv 290 irradiation nor h2o2 directly affect amp r under these experimental conditions detailed in section 3 1 the treated plasmid samples were analysed by qpcr gel electrophoresis and arg transformation assay dna repair proficient e coli ab1157 wild type as well as repair deficient e coli mutants including ab1886 uvra ab2463 reca ab2480 uvra reca and dh5α reca enda were employed as recipient cells in the arg transformation assay competition kinetics methods using radical probe compounds were applied to measure the second order rate constants of oh and so4 with amp r segments experiments were also conducted in the presence of wastewater effluent organic matter efom to study the effect of dissolved organic matter dom on the

available e coli vector carrying an ampicillin resistance gene amp r 861 bp one hundred μl of e coli dh5α mid exponential growth phase culture in lb broth medium with 50 mg l of ampicillin was transferred into 150 ml of lb broth medium containing 50 mg l of ampicillin and incubated overnight 200 rpm 37 c plasmids were extracted from this overnight stock solution using an accuprep plasmid mini extraction kit bioneer 2016 the concentration of recovered plasmid dna was measured on a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop products wilmington usa 2 3 uv experiments uv254 based experiments were carried out with a uv quasi collimated beam device equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp emitting uv light primarily at 254 nm sankyo denki ltd tokyo japan the uv light was collimated onto the experimental solution which was contained in a petri dish placed on a magnetic stirrer the average uv intensity 0 3 mw cm2 was determined with atrazine chemical actinometry lee et al 2016 experimental solutions were prepared in autoclaved 2 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 the initial concentration of plasmid dna used in experiments was 0 3 or 1 μg ml the applied uv fluences ranged from 0 to 180 mj cm2 the initial concentrations of h2o2 and s2o8 2 were 0 5 mm for uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 respectively uv 290 h2o2 experiments were conducted using a model 66924 arc lamp source fitted with a 450 w o3 free xe arc lamp and focusing collimator and equipped with an atmospheric attenuation filter and dichroic mirror to restrict lamp output to near uv wavelengths 290 nm λ 400 nm newport oriel model 66924 stratford ct relatively high h2o2 concentrations i e 10 mm were applied for uv 290 h2o2 in order to increase the yield of oh due to the low absorbance of uv light by h2o2 in this wavelength region samples were withdrawn from the irradiated solutions in each experimental setup at predetermined time intervals for dna and probe compound analyses residual h2o2 and s2o8 2 were quenched with bovine catalase and thiosulfate respectively samples for dna analysis 500 μl were stored at 20 c and analysed within 24 h control experiments indicated that h2o2 and s2o8 2 did not affect qpcr analyses within these experimental conditions fig s1 2 4 radical probe compounds para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as oh probe during uv254 h2o2 and uv 290 h2o2 experiments both pcba

cfx96 real time pcr detection system bio rad hercules ca usa four different amplicons i e 192 400 603 and 851 bp were monitored which covered varying fractions of amp r as shown in fig s2 the longest size of amp r segment targeted in qpcr was 851 bp instead of the whole amp r gene 861 bp due to the low amplification efficiency of the 861 bp amplicon in the qpcr method the reaction mixture 20 μl consisted of 1 μl of each primer 1 μl of sample 10 μl of evagreen supermix and 7 μl of autoclaved dnase free water the qpcr protocol included one cycle at 95 c for 2 min 30 cycles at 95 c for 5 s an

transformation assays non ampicillin resistant e coli k12 bacteria strains dh5α reca enda ab1157 wild type ab1886 uvra ab2463 reca and ab2480 uvra reca were used as recipient cells for gene transformation assays dh5α strain was commercially available from atcc other strains were provided by cgsc coli genetic stock center at yale university details on transformation assays were described by yoon et al 2018 in brief competent cells were prepared by chemical treatment of non resistant e coli k12 strains using calcium chloride and glycerol shanehbandi et al 2013 and preserved at 80 c until use fifty μl of treated plasmid sample was mixed with 100 μl of thawed competent cells after incubating in ice for 30 min the mixture was quickly transferred onto a digital test tube heater 45 c for 45 s and then placed back in ice for 2 min after the heat shock the samples were mixed with 900 μl of lb broth and cultured for 45 min 200 rpm 37 c finally the incubated samples were serially diluted with lb broth and plated onto two types of lb agar plates i e with and without inclusion of 50 mg l of ampicillin after 24 h of incubation at 37 c the number of arb colonies transformants detected on selective agar plates with ampicillin were compared with the total recipient cells growing on nonselective agar plates without ampicillin the gene transformation efficiency was calculated as follows transformation efficiency t r a n s f o r m a n t c e l l s s e l e c t i v e p l a t e c f u m l t o t a l r e c i p i e n t c e l l s n o n s e l e c t i v e p l a t e c f u m l the typical concentrations of total recipient cells as measured by culturing on nonselective agar plates without ampicillin were approximately 3 108 and 2 108 cfu ml for e coli dh5α and e coli ab strains respectively control experiments conducted by directly plating the recipient cells without heat shock on nonselective plates showed 10 variation in the final colony counts of recipient cells as compared to the conditions incorporating heat shock fig s3 and 50 variation in colony counts between strains these results indicated that the type of bacterial strain used or stresses to which the strains were subjected during transformation assays e g heat shock did not significantly impact the fitness or growth rates of recipient cells on nonselective plates calibration curves prepared with known concentrations of plasmid dna indicated that the number of transformants linearly increased with increasing plasmid dna concentration from 10 5 10 1 μg ml fig s4 the transformation efficiency of amp r calculated for e coli k12 strains was in the range of 10 4 10 8 which was comparable with previous studies chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using sigmaplot 12 0 and graphpad prism 7 0 the fluence based rate constants for gene degradation and transformation efficiency loss under various experimental conditions were obtained by linear regression analysis and compared by performing the analysis of covariance ancova the null hypothesis was that the first order rate constants were identical with p 0 05 as the threshold significance level 3 results and discussions 3 1 e arg degradation during separate exposure to uv 254 and oh uv 254 exposure fig 1 a the solution containing puc19 was irradiated with uv254 light 0 130 mj cm2 the degradation of amp r segments 192 400 603 and 851 bp measured by qpcr followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence r2 0 99 fig 1a the 192 bp amp r segment was degraded by about 1 log at 110 mj cm2 whereas 4 log reduction was already achieved for the 851 bp segment which was close to the overall size of amp r 861 bp the resulting fluence based rate constants derived from the slopes of linear curves k u v a m p 2 303 s l o p e are summarized in table 1 the k u v a m p of amp r segments increased with amplicon size which was consistent with the increasing number of potential reaction sites with increasing number of nucleotide bps the k u v a m p values obtained from this study were comparable to previously reported values for the same amp r segments yoon et al 2018 the k u v p l a s m i d of puc19 plasmid could be estimated by extrapolating the k u v a m p of each segment to the entire plasmid e g k u v p l a s m i d k u v 192 b p 2686 b p 192 b p based on an assumption that the uv reactivity per base pair is the same across the entire plasmid the k u v p l a s m i d values estimated from the 192 400 603 and 851 bp amplicons were 2 9 0 06 10 1 2 3 0 04 10 1 2 6 0 05 10 1 and 2 7 0 06 10 1 cm2 mj respectively yielding an average k u v p l a s m i d value of 2 6 0 05 10 1 cm2 mj table 1 a theoretical approach was recently employed to estimate the photoreactivity of dna i e formation rate of cpds and 6 4 photoproducts based on the molar absorption coefficients quantum yields and the number of 5 bipyrimidine 3 doublets of a given dna yoon et al 2018 he et al 2019 by applying this approach the theoretical overall dna lesion formation rate on puc19 upon uv254 exposure k a l l l e s i o n s was calculated as 2 1 10 1 cm2 mj text s1 which was close to the average k u v p l a s m i d 2 6 10 1 cm2 mj determined from qpcr results as mentioned above oh exposure fig 1 b control experiments have confirmed that amp r segments were stable under uv 290 irradiation alone fig s5 which was attributed to the low uv absorbance of plasmid dna above 290 nm moreover 10 mm 340 mg l of h2o2 had negligible effect on the amp r segment fig s1 thus uv 290 h2o2 was applied to investigate the influence of oh on the degradation of e arg the oh exposure o h d t in the uv 290 h2o2 system was obtained by following the degradation of pcba which was additionally included in the experimental solution no uv 290 direct photolysis of pcba was observed in the absence of h2o2 fig s6 thus the oh exposure was calculated from o h d t l n p c b a p c b a 0 k o h p c b a elovitz and von gunten 1999 where k o h p c b a is the second order rate constant of oh with pcba 5 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the logarithmic scale degradation of amp r segments exhibited linear correlations with oh exposure during uv 290 h2o2 fig 1b the resulting bimolecular rate constants derived from the slopes of linear curves k o h a m p 2 303 s l o p e are summarized in table 1 the k o h a m p of amp r segments increased with amplicon size ranging from 8 1 109 m 1 s 1 for the 192 bp amplicon to 5 6 1010 m 1 s 1 for the 851 bp amplicon table 1 a good linear relationship r2 0 996 was observed between the k o h a m p and the base pair number of amp r segments fig s7 which was consistent with previous findings that oh non selectively reacts with all nucleotides in a dna sequence both at and gc contents he et al 2019 the k o h p l a s m i d of the entire plasmid was predicted to be 1 8 1011 m 1 s 1 by applying the base pair number of puc19 2686 bps into the regression equation of this linear relationship fig s7 alternatively similar to k u v p l a s m i d as mentioned above the k o h p l a s m i d of puc19 was also estimated by normalizing the k o h a m p of each segment qpcr analyses to the entire plasmid and calculating the average value as 1 5 0 07 1011 m 1 s 1 table 1 the k o h a m p values for the plasmid encoded amp r segments in this study were lower by a factor of 3 than those reported for the chromosome encoded blt genes with similar amplicon length he et al 2019 to see whether the reactivity difference is due to the conformational difference between the supercoiled form plasmid and linear form genomic dna the theoretical diffusion controlled rate constant for the reaction of oh with supercoiled puc19 was calculated based on a method proposed by he et al 2019 the theoretical maximum k o h value was predicted as 3 84 1011 m 1 s 1 for puc19 which yields a bp specific k o h value of 1 43 108 mat gc 1 s 1 when normalized to the length in at gc bps of puc19 2686 bps text s2 for comparison the theoretical maximum k o h value was 7 97 1012 m 1 s 1 for a hypothetical 50 kbp linear form segment of genomic dna yielding a bp specific k o h value of 1 59 108 mat gc 1 s 1 he et al 2019 this indicates that the conformational difference between the plasmid supercoiled and genomic linear dna the bp specific k o h differed only by a factor of 1 1 does not explain the observed oh reactivity difference the maximum k o h values for the amp r amplicons can also be calculated by multiplying the bp specific k o h 1 43 108 mat gc 1 s 1 with the length of each amplicon and ranged from 2 57 1010 m 1 s 1 for 192 bp to 1 14 1011 m 1 s 1 for 851 bp text s2 thus the experimental k o h a m p for puc19 were lower by a factor of 2 5 than the theoretical maximum k o h a m p values this difference is acceptable considering all possible experimental errors as well as uncertainties of parameters used in the model applied in the theoretical calculation structural degradation of plasmid fig 2 fig 2a shows the electrophoresis gel of puc19 exposed to uv254 the intact puc19 before the uv254 exposure showed a band located lower than the puc19 linearized by ecori plasmid dna generally exists in a supercoiled form which is smaller than its linear form and migrates faster in electrophoresis gel the uv254 irradiation 0 130 mj cm2 did not change the position of the band suggesting that the puc19 kept its supercoiled form without significant conformational change e g strand breakage it is well documented that the gene damage by uv254 is mainly caused by the formation of dna lesions such as cpds and 6 4 photoproducts pyrimidine adducts sinha and häder 2002 cadet and douki 2018 which are generally not detectable by gel electrophoresis analysis yoon et al 2018 the reaction pathways of oh with dna include addition to nucleobases producing adduct radicals and hydrogen abstraction from 2 deoxyribose sugar moiety von sonntag 2006 dizdaroglu and jaruga 2012 resulting in not only oxidized bases and abasic sites but also strand breaks cadet et al 1999 von sonntag 2006 the double strand breaks are expected to be mainly responsible for the conformational change from supercoiled to linear plasmid form gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the puc19 plasmid band gradually moved from the supercoiled to linear form position with increasing oh exposure fig 2b revealing the formation of double strand breaks in puc19 3 2 e arg deactivation loss of transforming activity during separate exposure to uv 254 and oh bacterial cells have developed the ability of repairing dna lesions induced by uv irradiation and oxidant stress e g radicals using several enzyme systems teebor et al 1988 sinha and häder 2002 the biological deactivation of puc19 upon separate treatment with uv254 and oh was studied by analysing its transformation of non resistant recipient cells having different dna repair abilities the decrease of transforming activity of puc19 followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence or oh exposure and was variable depending on the recipient cells used fig 3 the most rapid decrease was observed for ab2480 uvra reca during each separate treatment with uv254 and oh no transformant was detectable from ab2480 more than 4 log decrease when the uv fluence was above 5 mj cm2 or when the oh exposure was higher than 5 5 10 11 m s thus the fluence based rate constant for uv k u v t r a n s f o r m a t i o n and the second order rate constant for oh k o h t r a n s f o r m a t i o n for the elimination of ab2480 transforming activity were not calculated in this case due to the limited data points during uv254 exposure fig 3a the loss of transforming activity was slower in ab1886 uvra 0 24 cm2 mj than ab2480 followed by ab2463 reca 0 16 cm2 mj ab1157 wild type 0 10 cm2 mj and dh5α reca enda 0 07 cm2 mj where the values in parentheses show k u v t r a n s f o r m a t i o n table 1 the variation in the transformation efficiency of plasmids carrying the same dna damage indicated that the uv induced damage can be repaired by recipient cells to different extents depending on their repair gene proficiencies or deficiencies the uvrabc proteins involve the nucleotide excision repair of a variety of dna lesions including the uv induced cpds and 6 4 photoproducts this process is initiated by the interaction of uvra protein with dna to recognize the damaged sites kisker et al 2013 the reca protein is essential for the post replication repair of double strand breaks and single strand gaps e g t t dimers by homologous recombination smith and wang 1989 shinohara and ogawa 1995 these roles of uvra and reca proteins well explained the trend observed from the transformation rates of e coli strains ab2480 was most sensitive to uv induced dna damage on puc19 due to lack of both uvra and reca genes the uvra deficient ab1886 was the second most sensitive followed by the reca deficient ab2463 indicating that uvra played a more important role than reca for the repair of uv induced dna damage the wild type ab1157 was less sensitive than the other three e coli mutant strains owing to its dna repair capability by uvra and reca interestingly despite its deficiency in reca the dh5α strain exhibited even lower sensitivity to uv induced dna damage compared to wild type ab1157 this was possibly attributable to the lack of a functional enda gene in dh5α the enda gene is associated with the formation of extracellular dnase i which can hydrolyze exogenous plasmid dna consequently reducing its uptake and transformation shou et al 2019 in line with this the dh5α showed 10 fold higher transformation efficiency than the other e coli strains proficient in enda when all were transformed with equivalent concentrations of undamaged puc19 fig s4 this enda deficiency might therefore render e coli dh5α inherently more active for dna damage repair than the other strains despite its lack of reca during oh exposure fig 3b the rate of transforming activity loss was the highest for ab2480 followed by ab2463 reca 8 2 1010 m 1 s 1 ab1886 uvra 6 5 1010 m 1 s 1 ab1157 wild type 4 1 1010 m 1 s 1 and dh5α reca enda 2 9 1010 m 1 s 1 where the values in parentheses show k o h t r a n s f o r m a t i o n table 1 the reca deficient ab2463 showed higher sensitivity to oh induced dna damage than the uvra deficient ab1886 which was opposite compared to the case for uv254 fig 3a this suggests that reca is more efficient for repairing oh induced dna damage as homologous recombination is based on exchange of damaged nucleotide sequences alberts et al 2002 and capable of repairing not only base oxidation but also double strand breaks in contrast uvra is based on nucleotide excision repair and more specific to the repair of uv induced dna lesions base modification such as cpds but not efficient for double strand breaks alberts et al 2002 the apparent rate constants for the degradation of amp r segments puc19 plasmid and the loss of gene transforming activity are compared in fig 4 for both uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation the estimated degradation rates of the entire plasmid based on qpcr analyses overestimated the rates of puc19 deactivation loss of transforming activity observed for all repair proficient e coli recipient strains which can be explained by the repair of uv254 and oh induced damage by repair proficient recipient cells our results were in agreement with previous findings on the uv254 treated pwh1266 plasmid and its transformation of acinetobacter baylyi chang et al 2017 however the rate of gene deactivation during uv254 direct photolysis measured using uvra deficient ab1886 as the recipient strain was close to the estimated degradation rate of puc19 and the formation rate of dna lesions fig 4a and b the minimum rates of gene deactivation measured by double mutant ab2480 uvra reca were estimated based on the limited data points shown in fig 3 which gave 0 91 cm2 mj and 1 7 1011 m 1 s 1 for uv254 and oh exposure respectively these values were significantly larger than the gene deactivation rates measured by any of the repair proficient strains furthermore the degradation rate of the entire plasmid underestimated the loss of puc19 transforming activity measured by ab2480 uvra reca during uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation 3 3 e arg degradation and deactivation by combined exposure to uv254 and radicals the degradation of amp r and the elimination of gene transforming activity e coli dh5α as recipient cells were tested during combined exposure to uv254 and radicals oh and so4 in comparison to uv254 direct photolysis the degradation of amp r amplicons followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence r2 0 99 during uv254 uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 treatments fig 5 a lower initial concentration of puc19 0 3 μg ml and a higher fluence range 0 180 mj cm2 were applied in these tests than in the experiments described in the preceding sections however the degradation rate constants of amp r amplicons during uv254 direct photolysis i e 2 4 10 2 8 2 10 2 cm2 mj table s1 were in good agreement with those obtained during the treatment of 1 μg ml of puc19 by 0 130 mj cm2 of uv254 i e 2 0 10 2 8 9 10 2 cm2 mj table 1 the k u v 254 h 2 o 2 of amp r amplicons during uv254 h2o2 were in the range of 1 0 10 1 3 0 10 1 cm2 mj which were larger than the k u v 254 by a factor of 4 table s1 therefore the contribution of uv254 direct photolysis to the overall gene degradation during uv254 h2o2 was only about 25 k u v 254 k u v 254 h 2 o 2 100 revealing the significant role of oh exposure 75 the k u v 254 h 2 o 2 for the elimination of gene transforming activity was 5 1 0 2 10 2 cm2 mj which was larger than the k u v 254 by a factor of only 1 1 k u v 254 h 2 o 2 k u v 254 1 1 table s1 thus even though the oh exposure significantly accelerated gene degradation by a factor of 4 its contribution to the elimination of gene transforming activity was not as efficient as expected fig 6 summarizes the results from this study and the literature on the effect of oh exposure on degradation of the 851 bp amp r segment and loss of gene transforming activity measured using e coli dh5α as recipient strain plasmid puc4k or puc19 carrying amp r was treated with uv h2o2 at different conditions of uv wavelength and initial h2o2 concentrations i e uv254 h2o2 0 3 mm or 0 5 mm and uv 290 h2o2 10 mm the oh induced degradation and deactivation were calculated by subtracting the effect of uv254 direct photolysis from the overall results of corresponding uv254 h2o2 treatment although the statistical analysis showed a significant variation p 0 0149 in the slopes of linear curves in fig 6a the k o h 851 b p values during uv254 h2o2 treatment differed only by factors of 0 8 1 5 from that during the oh only process uv 290 h2o2 this suggested that uv254 induced gene damage on the plasmid e g cpds and pyrimidine adducts did not have a significant impact on the reactivity of oh with nucleobase and sugar moieties during uv254 h2o2 however the elimination of gene transforming activity measured using e coli dh5α as recipient strain varied significantly in the different treatments the loss of gene transforming activity attributable to oh was 5 times lower in uv254 h2o2 processes uv254 and oh co exist as compared to that in uv 290 h2o2 oh only this indicates that the elimination of gene transforming activity caused by uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation were not additive during uv254 h2o2 one possible explanation could be that some dna damage repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair by uvrabc also repaired oh induced lesions e g base oxidation located near the uv induced lesions leading to much less extensive loss of transforming activity than would be expected from simple summation of the losses in transforming activity observed for uv254 and oh exposure separately the degradation rates of amp r amplicons 1 0 10 1 3 2 10 1 cm2 mj during uv254 s2o8 2 were also 4 fold larger than those obtained during uv254 table s1 so4 is the primary radical generated during uv254 photolysis of s2o8 2 however so4 can further react with h2o oh and cl sometimes present as an impurity in aqueous solution to produce oh lutze et al 2015 using the degradation kinetics of radical probe compounds nitrobenzene and pcba figs s8 and s9 the steady state concentration of oh during uv254 s2o8 2 was determined to be 6 4 10 13 m which was approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that of so4 1 8 10 11 m under experimental conditions used here text s3 this was consistent with the theoretically estimated values considering all the possible reactions related to oh formation in the uv254 s2o8 2 system text s4 despite the much lower concentration the contribution of oh to the overall gene damage cannot be ignored as the amp r segments appeared to be much more reactive to oh than so4 see discussions below thus the percentages of gene degradation attributable to uv254 direct photolysis so4 and oh during uv254 s2o8 2 treatment could be estimated as 23 33 and 44 respectively where the relative contributions of each pathway to the overall gene damage were calculated based on the observed rate constants for degradation of amp r amplicons during uv254 and uv254 s2o8 2 treatments the steady state concentrations of oh and so4 in uv254 s2o8 2 experiments and the second order rate constants for reactions of oh and so4 with the amp r amplicons text s5 the second order rate constants of so4 with amp r segments were determined to be in the range of 1 07 1 96 109 m 1 s 1 text s5 and table s2 which were about an order of magnitude lower than the oh rate constants table 1 so4 preferentially adds to the electron rich sites of the nucleobases e g c5 of pyrimidines to generate radical adducts which decay to nucleobase radicals as intermediates followed by hydroxylation and oxidation in aqueous solution von sonntag 2006 however so4 is larger than oh and negatively charged therefore steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion might decrease the reactivity of so4 toward negatively charged dna molecules in comparison to oh similar to uv254 h2o2 processes the elimination rate of puc19 transforming activity during uv254 s2o8 2 treatment was also only slightly larger than that in uv254 direct photolysis k u v 254 s 2 o 8 2 k u v 254 1 1 table s1 even while the observed amplicon degradation rates were 4 fold faster for uv254 s2o8 2 compared to uv254 direct photolysis this further supports the above findings that co exposure to uv254 and radicals during uv254 aops did not lead to faster transforming activity loss than the separate exposures to uv254 and radicals due to the facile repair of uv254 and or radical induced dna damage in host cells 3 4 effect of wastewater effluent organic matter on the degradation of amp r during uv254 aops the efficiencies of amp r degradation during uv254 uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 experiments were investigated in the presence of efom 5 4 mg c l the uv 254 nm absorbance of efom solution a254 was 0 1 cm 1 the path length in the petri dish l was 1 6 cm thus the water factor wf 1 10 a254 l a254 l ln10 bolton and linden 2003 was calculated to be 0 84 the average uv intensity in the solution containing efom was then corrected from 0 30 mw cm2 to 0 25 mw cm2 using the calculated water factor lee et al 2016 the amp r segments were gradually degraded with increasing uv fluence following first order kinetics fig 7 interestingly the k u v a m p of each segment during uv254 irradiation in the presence of efom was approximately 1 2 times higher than the corresponding conditions without efom p 0 0001 table s1 chromophoric dissolved organic matter dom is known to generate reactive species upon uv irradiation such as triplet excited states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen and oh which have been proven to contribute to the oxidation of organic pollutants chin et al 2004 lester et al 2013 batista et al 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 bacteriophage ms2 was found to be inactivated by 3dom and singlet oxygen generated from sunlight irradiation of wastewater and river water dom isolates kohn et al 2007 kohn and nelson 2007 rosado lausell et al 2013 the reactive oxygen species e g singlet oxygen superoxide h2o2 generated during photooxidations involving 3dom were proposed to inactivate bacteria by damaging dna proteins and cell membranes song et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 our findings suggest that through its photosensitizing properties dom can indirectly contribute to the photodegradation of e args similar results were reported recently on the enhanced photo degradation of pbr322 plasmid encoded tet a and bla tem 1 genes in dom solution zhang et al 2019b this degradation pathway might play an especially important role during solar disinfection processes due to the low uv absorbance characteristics of dna at high wavelengths and consequent minimal direct uv photolysis under such conditions in contrast efom mainly acted as a radical scavenger during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 experiments the k u v 254 h 2 o 2 and k u v 254 s 2 o 8 2 treatment of amp r segments in the presence of efom were each decreased by a factor of 3 compared to the conditions without efom table s1 the degradation kinetics of pcba and nitrobenzene fig s10 also confirmed the much lower levels of radicals in the presence of efom e g so4 ss 9 5 10 13 m with efom vs 1 8 10 11 m without efom overall the degradation efficiency of amp r in the presence of efom increased only marginally within a factor of 1 4 during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 compared to uv254 alone due to the significant scavenging of radicals by efom 4 conclusions the degradation of amp r segments and the loss of gene transforming activity followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence and oh exposure during uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation uv 290 h2o2 the degradation rate constants of amp r segments increased with amplicon size which corresponded to the increase in nucleotide bps and hence reaction sites with increased amplicon length gel electrophoresis results indicated that uv254 0 130 mj cm2 did not change the supercoiled conformation of puc19 plasmid whereas oh exposure 0 2 7 10 10 m s led to strand breaks the loss of gene transforming activity varied depending on the type of recipient cells double mutant ab2480 which was deficient in repair genes uvra and reca was the most sensitive to dna damage induced by uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation the predicted degradation rates for the entire puc19 plasmid overestimated the loss in transforming activity of puc19 for all recipient cells other than ab2480 apparently due to the repair of dna damage by repair proficient strains the second order rate constants of oh with amp r segments were determined to be in the range of 8 1 109 5 6 1010 m 1 s 1 and showed a strong linear relationship with the base pair number of amp r segments suggesting that oh reacts with all nucleobases of plasmid dna non selectively the rate constants of so4 with amp r segments were an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding oh rate constants thus the contribution of the trace amount of oh to the overall gene damage cannot be ignored during uv254 s2o8 2 treatment although oh and so4 significantly accelerated 75 the degradation of amp r amplicons measured by qpcr during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 experiments this only marginally increased the gene deactivation rate 11 as gene damage caused by uv254 and radical co exposure appeared to be repaired more efficiently by recipient cells than the gene damage from the separate uv254 and radical exposures thus the elimination efficiency of the args transforming activities was similar for uv254 vs uv254 aops at the same uv fluence and the extent of elimination was mainly determined by the level of uv fluence because the transforming activity of the amp r gene could be lowered by only 1 log at a typical uv disinfection fluence for water treatment e g 40 mj cm2 but increased to more than 4 logs at an elevated uv fluence for uv aops e g 500 mj cm2 the use of uv aops may still prove beneficial for arg degradation and deactivation with the accompanying benefit of improved degradation of trace organic contaminants reactive species formed from the excitation of chromophoric organic matter appear to contribute to accelerated degradation of amp r during uv254 irradiation in the presence of efom compared to direct photolysis by uv254 alone whereas efom mainly acted as a radical

17789,this study investigated the degradation and deactivation of an extracellular ampicillin resistance gene amp r encoded in plasmid puc19 during exposure to uv254 oh generated by uv 290 h2o2 and combined exposure to uv254 and oh and or so4 using uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 the degradation rates of amp r measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction increased with increasing target amplicon length 192 851 bps the rate constants for the degradation of puc19 2686 bps were calculated as 0 26 cm2 mj for uv254 and 1 5 1011 m 1s 1 for oh based on the degradation rates of amp r amplicons and assuming an equal sensitivity of dna damage across the entire plasmid dna repair proficient escherichia coli e coli ab1157 strain wild type and its repair deficient mutants including ab1886 uvra ab2463 reca ab2480 uvra reca and dh5α reca enda were applied as recipient cells in gene transformation assays results suggested that the elimination efficiency of transforming activity during uv254 and oh exposure was dependent on the type of dna repair genes in recipient e coli strains losses of transforming activity were slower than the degradation of puc19 by a factor of up to 5 for e coli dh5α highlighting the importance of dna repair in recipient cells the degradation rates of amp r amplicons were much larger by a factor of 4 in uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 than uv254 direct photolysis indicating the significant contribution of oh and so4 to the gene degradation not only uv254 and so4 but also oh contributed to the degradation of amp r during uv254 s2o8 2 which was attributed to the conversion of so4 to oh and a 10 fold larger reactivity of oh towards amp r as compared to so4 however the enhanced gene degradation by radicals did not lead to a faster elimination of gene transforming activity during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 suggesting that uv254 and radical induced dna damage were not additive in their contributions to losses of gene transforming activity wastewater effluent organic matter efom accelerated the degradation of amp r during uv254 irradiation by means of reactive species production through indirect photolysis reactions whereas efom mainly

pressure on antibiotic resistant bacteria arb vikesland et al 2017 antibiotic resistance can be developed and disseminated within the bacterial population by genetic mutation cell division and the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes args davies and davies 2010 args are contaminants of concern in natural and engineered aquatic systems as arg transfer can be linked with the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens dodd 2012 pruden 2014 mobile genetic elements carrying args e g plasmids integrons and transposons can be disseminated to and expressed by recipient cells through horizontal gene transfer hgt including conjugation mediated by cell to cell contact transduction bacteriophage mediated and transformation mediated by extracellular dna lorenz and wackernagel 1994 of these transformation can be understood to represent the most basic mode of hgt as it does not require the presence of live donor cells or bacteriophages lorenz and wackernagel 1994 consequently quantification of the frequency with which an arg in extracellular dna can be transported into and expressed by a recipient cell through transformation hereafter referred to as transforming activity can provide a conservative measure of the ability of an arg to undergo hgt transforming activity encompasses a efficiency of extracellular dna transport into a recipient cell b any repair of that dna by the recipient cell in the event that the dna is damaged and c heritable incorporation and expression of the dna s genetic information by recipient cells and is therefore a function of both the recipient cell s ability to import repair and express a given arg and the quality and quantity of the extracellular dna containing the arg extracellular dna can be released into the environment though secretion by live cells and lysis of dead cells while unstable to nucleases likely to be present in many aquatic matrixes it can persist in the environment through adsorption onto soil and sediments lorenz and wackernagel 1994 mao et al 2014 nagler et al 2018 although conventional disinfection processes during water treatment e g chlorine and uv efficiently inactivate arb intracellular args are more difficult to degrade mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 he et al 2019 and can be released into water following the death of arb cells zheng et al 2017 sub inhibitory concentrations of disinfectants e g chlorine and monochloramine were even reported to promote the horizontal transfer of args by increasing the permeability of cell membranes and altering the expression of conjugation related genes guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the proportion of extracellular dna carrying args was found to increase after various biological and chemical processes in wastewater treatment revealing the potential risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination in discharged effluent and receiving environments liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 previous studies have reported the enrichment of args in surface water due to the discharged effluents from upstream wastewater treatment plants cacace et al 2019 wu et al 2019 osińska et al 2020 high diversity of args in reclaimed wastewater e g agriculture irrigation potable reuse may pose risks of antibiotic resistance dissemination to environmental bacteria and even human pathogens christou et al 2017 hong et al 2018 uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are increasingly applied for the removal of refractory contaminants during water treatment the elimination of contaminants in uv aop treatment is achieved by dual pathways namely direct uv photolysis depending on the uv absorbances and quantum yields of target compounds and oxidation by powerful radical species stefan 2018 the activation of hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and peroxydisulfate uv s2o8 2 by uv light produces hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 respectively which can degrade a wide range of contaminants as these two radicals react with many compounds at or near diffusion controlled reaction rates buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 have also been reported to efficiently inactivate arb cells michael kordatou et al 2015 ferro et al 2016 giannakis et al 2018 however detailed investigation into the reactivity of oh with intracellular args in these studies was limited due to the significant consumption of oh by constituents of the water matrix and cell membranes before reaching the cell interiors ferro et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a recent studies have reported that the reactivity of oh with extracellular chromosomal args is highly dependent on the length of the monitored arg targets he et al 2019 more studies are needed to assess whether the observed reactivities are generally applicable to other types of dna such as plasmid encoded args to the best of the authors knowledge little is known on the fate of args during so4 based treatment processes quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has been widely applied to quantify structurally intact args or to measure their degradation rates in water and wastewater treatment mckinney and pruden 2012 luby et al 2016 hiller et al 2019 it should be noted that qpcr methods usually record the degradation of a small fraction of a target arg s sequence length with amplicon sizes typically 1000 bps and not the entirety of a gene mckinney and pruden 2012 chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 in addition the efficiency of dna replication particularly of damaged dna in qpcr methods can be different from that observed in bacterial cells subjected to transformation with the same dna furthermore the uptake and repair of dna by recipient cells can play important roles in modulating gene transforming activity chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 while the correlation between the degradation of target arg amplicons measured by qpcr and the elimination of arg transforming activity was reasonably well explained for chromosomal args he et al 2019 it is still less clear for plasmid borne args exposure of dna to uv and oh is known to induce different types of dna damage von sonntag 2006 uv c generates cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds as the predominant dna lesions while oh can induce dna damage ranging from base oxidation to phosphate sugar backbone breakages görner 1994 sinha and häder 2002 von sonntag 2006 it is currently not completely clear how the various type s of dna damage resulting from uv oh and so4 are related to the deactivation of args for example whether dna lesions such as cpds formed by direct uv irradiation have the same effect on dna transforming activity as phosphate sugar backbone breakage by oh generated by h2o2 or s2o8 2 photolysis furthermore in uv aops dna lesions can be generated by both direct uv irradiation and radicals simultaneously the aim of this study was to investigate the fate of plasmid encoded e args during the common uv at 254 nm water disinfection process uv254 and its related aops plasmid puc19 encoding an ampicillin resistance gene amp r was purified from escherichia coli e coli host cells and exposed to uv254 to uv254 in combination with oh or so4 by using uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 or to oh only by combining uv at 290 nm with h2o2 i e uv 290 h2o2 uv 290 h2o2 treatment was chosen to study the effect of oh only exposure because irradiation of h2o2 by uv 290 can generate oh while neither uv 290 irradiation nor h2o2 directly affect amp r under these experimental conditions detailed in section 3 1 the treated plasmid samples were analysed by qpcr gel electrophoresis and arg transformation assay dna repair proficient e coli ab1157 wild type as well as repair deficient e coli mutants including ab1886 uvra ab2463 reca ab2480

dissolving the hydrophobic and transphilic fractions 2 1 by mass of efom in phosphate buffer 2 2 plasmid preparation plasmid puc19 was extracted from e coli dh5α puc19 2686 bp is a commercially available e coli vector carrying an ampicillin resistance gene amp r 861 bp one hundred μl of e coli dh5α mid exponential growth phase culture in lb broth medium with 50 mg l of ampicillin was transferred into 150 ml of lb broth medium containing 50 mg l of ampicillin and incubated overnight 200 rpm 37 c plasmids were extracted from this overnight stock solution using an accuprep plasmid

experiments were carried out with a uv quasi collimated beam device equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp emitting uv light primarily at 254 nm sankyo denki ltd tokyo japan the uv light was collimated onto the experimental solution which was contained in a petri dish placed on a magnetic stirrer the average uv intensity 0 3 mw cm2 was determined with atrazine chemical actinometry lee et al 2016 experimental solutions were prepared in autoclaved 2 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 the initial concentration of plasmid dna used in experiments was 0 3 or 1 μg ml the applied uv fluences ranged from 0 to 180 mj cm2 the initial concentrations of h2o2 and s2o8 2 were 0 5 mm for uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 respectively uv 290 h2o2 experiments were conducted using a model 66924 arc lamp source fitted with a 450 w o3 free xe arc lamp and focusing collimator and equipped with an atmospheric attenuation filter and dichroic mirror to restrict lamp output to near uv wavelengths 290 nm λ 400 nm newport oriel model 66924 stratford ct relatively high h2o2 concentrations i e 10 mm were applied for uv 290 h2o2 in order to increase the yield of oh due to the low absorbance of uv light by h2o2 in this wavelength region samples were withdrawn from the irradiated solutions in each experimental setup at predetermined time intervals for dna and probe compound analyses residual h2o2 and s2o8 2 were quenched with bovine catalase and thiosulfate respectively samples for dna analysis 500 μl were stored at 20 c and analysed within 24 h control experiments indicated that h2o2 and s2o8 2 did not affect qpcr analyses within these experimental conditions fig s1 2 4 radical probe compounds para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as oh probe during uv254 h2o2 and uv 290 h2o2 experiments both pcba

cfx96 real time pcr detection system bio rad hercules ca usa four different amplicons i e 192 400 603 and 851 bp were monitored which covered varying fractions of amp r as shown in fig s2 the longest size of amp r segment targeted in qpcr was 851 bp instead of the whole amp r gene 861 bp due to the low amplification efficiency of the 861 bp amplicon in the qpcr method the reaction mixture 20 μl consisted of 1 μl of each primer 1 μl of sample 10 μl of evagreen supermix and 7 μl of autoclaved dnase free water the qpcr protocol included one cycle at 95 c for 2 min 30 cycles at 95 c for 5 s an annealing step at 55 c for 60 s and an elongation at 72 c for 20 s followed by a melt curve analysis from 65 c to 95 c each sample was analysed in triplicate more information on qpcr analysis the dna sequence of amp r and the monitored qpcr target amplicons is described elsewhere yoon et al 2018 2 6 gel electrophoresis analysis puc19 plasmid 1 μg ml treated by uv254 and oh uv 290 h2o2 was analysed by gel electrophoresis to investigate the structural change of plasmid dna linearized puc19 was also prepared for use as a reference by incubating the plasmid with type ii restriction enzyme ecori neb usa at 37 c for 1 h followed by enzyme inactivation at 65 c for 20 min plasmid samples from uv254 oh uv 290 h2o2 and enzyme treatments as well as a 1 kb dna ladder enzynomics korea were loaded on 0 8 agarose gels at 4 v cm 1 for 35 min the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining gel images were captured on a uv transilluminator universal mutation detection system uvp llc usa 2 7 gene transformation assays non ampicillin resistant e coli k12 bacteria strains dh5α reca enda ab1157 wild type ab1886 uvra ab2463 reca and ab2480 uvra reca were used as recipient cells for gene transformation assays dh5α strain was commercially available from atcc other strains were provided by cgsc coli genetic stock center at yale university details on transformation assays were described by yoon et al 2018 in brief competent cells were prepared by chemical treatment of non resistant e coli k12 strains using calcium chloride and glycerol shanehbandi et al 2013 and preserved at 80 c until use fifty μl of treated plasmid sample was mixed with 100 μl of thawed competent cells after incubating in ice for 30 min the mixture was quickly transferred onto a digital test tube heater 45 c for 45 s and then placed back in ice for 2 min after the heat shock the samples were mixed with 900 μl of lb broth and cultured for 45 min 200 rpm 37 c finally the incubated samples were serially diluted with lb broth and plated onto two types of lb agar plates i e with and without inclusion of 50 mg l of ampicillin after 24 h of incubation at 37 c the number of arb colonies transformants detected on selective agar plates with ampicillin were compared with the total recipient cells growing on nonselective agar plates without ampicillin the gene transformation efficiency was calculated as follows transformation efficiency t r a n s f o r m a n t c e l l s s e l e c t i v e p l a t e c f u m l t o t a l r e c i p i e n t c e l l s n o n s e l e c t i v e p l a t e c f u m l the typical concentrations of total recipient cells as measured by culturing on nonselective agar plates without ampicillin were approximately 3 108 and 2 108 cfu ml for e coli dh5α and e coli ab strains respectively control experiments conducted by directly plating the recipient cells without heat shock on nonselective plates showed 10 variation in the final colony counts of recipient cells as compared to the conditions incorporating heat shock fig s3 and 50 variation in colony counts between strains these results indicated that the type of bacterial strain used or stresses to which the strains were subjected during transformation assays e g heat shock did not significantly impact the fitness or growth rates of recipient cells on nonselective plates calibration curves prepared with known concentrations of plasmid dna indicated that the number of transformants linearly increased with increasing plasmid dna concentration from 10 5 10 1 μg ml fig s4 the transformation efficiency of amp r calculated for e coli k12 strains was in the range of 10 4 10 8 which was comparable with previous studies chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using sigmaplot 12 0 and graphpad prism 7 0 the fluence based rate constants for gene degradation and transformation efficiency loss under various experimental conditions were obtained by linear regression analysis and compared by performing the analysis of covariance ancova the null hypothesis was that the first order rate constants were identical with p 0 05 as the threshold significance level 3 results and discussions 3 1 e arg degradation during separate exposure to uv 254 and oh uv 254 exposure fig 1 a the solution containing puc19 was irradiated with uv254 light 0 130 mj cm2 the degradation of amp r segments 192 400 603 and 851 bp measured by qpcr followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence r2 0 99 fig 1a the 192 bp amp r segment was degraded by about 1 log at 110 mj cm2 whereas 4 log reduction was already achieved for the 851 bp segment which was close to the overall size of amp r 861 bp the resulting fluence based rate constants derived from the slopes of linear curves k u v a m p 2 303 s l o p e are summarized in table 1 the k u v a m p of amp r segments increased with amplicon size which was consistent with the increasing number of potential reaction sites with increasing number of nucleotide bps the k u v a m p values obtained from this study were comparable to previously reported values for the same amp r segments yoon et al 2018 the k u v p l a s m i d of puc19 plasmid could be estimated by extrapolating the k u v a m p of each segment to the entire plasmid e g k u v p l a s m i d k u v 192 b p 2686 b p 192 b p based on an assumption that the uv reactivity per base pair is the same across the entire plasmid the k u v p l a s m i d values estimated from the 192 400 603 and 851 bp amplicons were 2 9 0 06 10 1 2 3 0 04 10 1 2 6 0 05 10 1 and 2 7 0 06 10 1 cm2 mj respectively yielding an average k u v p l a s m i d value of 2 6 0 05 10 1 cm2 mj table 1 a theoretical approach was recently employed to estimate the photoreactivity of dna i e formation rate of cpds and 6 4 photoproducts based on the molar absorption coefficients quantum yields and the number of 5 bipyrimidine 3 doublets of a given dna yoon et al 2018 he et al 2019 by applying this approach the theoretical overall dna lesion formation rate on puc19 upon uv254 exposure k a l l l e s i o n s was calculated as 2 1 10 1 cm2 mj text s1 which was close to the average k u v p l a s m i d 2 6 10 1 cm2 mj determined from qpcr results as mentioned above oh exposure fig 1 b control experiments have confirmed that amp r segments were stable under uv 290 irradiation alone fig s5 which was attributed to the low uv absorbance of plasmid dna above 290 nm moreover 10 mm 340 mg l of h2o2 had negligible effect on the amp r segment fig s1 thus uv 290 h2o2 was applied to investigate the influence of oh on the degradation of e arg the oh exposure o h d t in the uv 290 h2o2 system was obtained by following the degradation of pcba which was additionally included in the experimental solution no uv 290 direct photolysis of pcba was observed in the absence of h2o2 fig s6 thus the oh exposure was calculated from o h d t l n p c b a p c b a 0 k o h p c b a elovitz and von gunten 1999 where k o h p c b a is the second order rate constant of oh with pcba 5 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the logarithmic scale degradation of amp r segments exhibited linear correlations with oh exposure during uv 290 h2o2 fig 1b the resulting bimolecular rate constants derived from the slopes of linear curves k o h a m p 2 303 s l o p e are summarized in table 1 the k o h a m p of amp r segments increased with amplicon size ranging from 8 1 109 m 1 s 1 for the 192 bp amplicon to 5 6 1010 m 1 s 1 for the 851 bp amplicon table 1 a good linear relationship r2 0 996 was observed between the k o h a m p and the base pair number of amp r segments fig s7 which was consistent with previous findings that oh non selectively reacts with all nucleotides in a dna sequence both at and gc contents he et al 2019 the k o h p l a s m i d of the entire plasmid was predicted to be 1 8 1011 m 1 s 1 by applying the base pair number of puc19 2686 bps into the regression equation of this linear relationship fig s7 alternatively similar to k u v p l a s m i d as mentioned above the k o h p l a s m i d of puc19 was also estimated by normalizing the k o h a m p of each segment qpcr analyses to the entire plasmid and calculating the average value as 1 5 0 07 1011 m 1 s 1 table 1 the k o h a m p values for the plasmid encoded amp r segments in this study were lower by a factor of 3 than those reported for the chromosome encoded blt genes with similar amplicon length he et al 2019 to see whether the reactivity difference is due to the conformational difference between the supercoiled form plasmid and linear form genomic dna the theoretical diffusion controlled rate constant for the reaction of oh with supercoiled puc19 was calculated based on a method proposed by he et al 2019 the theoretical maximum k o h value was predicted as 3 84 1011 m 1 s 1 for puc19 which yields a bp specific k o h value of 1 43 108 mat gc 1 s 1 when normalized to the length in at gc bps of puc19 2686 bps text s2 for comparison the theoretical maximum k o h value was 7 97 1012 m 1 s 1 for a hypothetical 50 kbp linear form segment of genomic dna yielding a bp specific k o h value of 1 59 108 mat gc 1 s 1 he et al 2019 this indicates that the conformational difference between the plasmid supercoiled and genomic linear dna the bp specific k o h differed only by a factor of 1 1 does not explain the observed oh reactivity difference the maximum k o h values for the amp r amplicons can also be calculated by multiplying the bp specific k o h 1 43 108 mat gc 1 s 1 with the length of each amplicon and ranged from 2 57 1010 m 1 s 1 for 192 bp to 1 14 1011 m 1 s 1 for 851 bp text s2 thus the experimental k o h a m p for puc19 were lower by a factor of 2 5 than the theoretical maximum k o h a m p values this difference is acceptable considering all possible experimental errors as well as uncertainties of parameters used in the model applied in the theoretical calculation structural degradation of plasmid fig 2 fig 2a shows the electrophoresis gel of puc19 exposed to uv254 the intact puc19 before the uv254 exposure showed a band located lower than the puc19 linearized by ecori plasmid dna generally exists in a supercoiled form which is smaller than its linear form and migrates faster in electrophoresis gel the uv254 irradiation 0 130 mj cm2 did not change the position of the band suggesting that the puc19 kept its supercoiled form without significant conformational change e g strand breakage it is well documented that the gene damage by uv254 is mainly caused by the formation of dna lesions such as cpds and 6 4 photoproducts pyrimidine adducts sinha and häder 2002 cadet and douki 2018 which are generally not detectable by gel electrophoresis analysis yoon et al 2018 the reaction pathways of oh with dna include addition to nucleobases producing adduct radicals and hydrogen abstraction from 2 deoxyribose sugar moiety von sonntag 2006 dizdaroglu and jaruga 2012 resulting in not only oxidized bases and abasic sites but also strand breaks cadet et al 1999 von sonntag 2006 the double strand breaks are expected to be mainly responsible for the conformational change from supercoiled to linear plasmid form gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the puc19 plasmid band gradually moved from the supercoiled to linear form position with increasing oh exposure fig 2b revealing the formation of double strand breaks in puc19 3 2 e arg deactivation loss of transforming activity during separate exposure to uv 254 and oh bacterial cells have developed the ability of repairing dna lesions induced by uv irradiation and oxidant stress e g radicals using several enzyme systems teebor et al 1988 sinha and häder 2002 the biological deactivation of puc19 upon separate treatment with uv254 and oh was studied by analysing its transformation of non resistant recipient cells having different dna repair abilities the decrease of transforming activity of puc19 followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence or oh exposure and was variable depending on the recipient cells used fig 3 the most rapid decrease was observed for ab2480 uvra reca during each separate treatment with uv254 and oh no transformant was detectable from ab2480 more than 4 log decrease when the uv fluence was above 5 mj cm2 or when the oh exposure was higher than 5 5 10 11 m s thus the fluence based rate constant for uv k u v t r a n s f o r m a t i o n and the second order rate constant for oh k o h t r a n s f o r m a t i o n for the elimination of ab2480 transforming activity were not calculated in this case due to the limited data points during uv254 exposure fig 3a the loss of transforming activity was slower in ab1886 uvra 0 24 cm2 mj than ab2480 followed by ab2463 reca 0 16 cm2 mj ab1157 wild type 0 10 cm2 mj and dh5α reca enda 0 07 cm2 mj where the values in parentheses show k u v t r a n s f o r m a t i o n table 1 the variation in the transformation efficiency of plasmids carrying the same dna damage indicated that the uv induced damage can be repaired by recipient cells to different extents depending on their repair gene proficiencies or deficiencies the uvrabc proteins involve the nucleotide excision repair of a variety of dna lesions including the uv induced cpds and 6 4 photoproducts this process is initiated by the interaction of uvra protein with dna to recognize the damaged sites kisker et al 2013 the reca protein is essential for the post replication repair of double strand breaks and single strand gaps e g t t dimers by homologous recombination smith and wang 1989 shinohara and ogawa 1995 these roles of uvra and reca proteins well explained the trend observed from the transformation rates of e coli strains ab2480 was most sensitive to uv induced dna damage on puc19 due to lack of both uvra and reca genes the uvra deficient ab1886 was the second most sensitive followed by the reca deficient ab2463 indicating that uvra played a more important role than reca for the repair of uv induced dna damage the wild type ab1157 was less sensitive than the other three e coli mutant strains owing to its dna repair capability by uvra and reca interestingly despite its deficiency in reca the dh5α strain exhibited even lower sensitivity to uv induced dna damage compared to wild type ab1157 this was possibly attributable to the lack of a functional enda gene in dh5α the enda gene is associated with the formation of extracellular dnase i which can hydrolyze exogenous plasmid dna consequently reducing its uptake and transformation shou et al 2019 in line with this the dh5α showed 10 fold higher transformation efficiency than the other e coli strains proficient in enda when all were transformed with equivalent concentrations of undamaged puc19 fig s4 this enda deficiency might therefore render e coli dh5α inherently more active for dna damage repair than the other strains despite its lack of reca during oh exposure fig 3b the rate of transforming activity loss was the highest for ab2480 followed by ab2463 reca 8 2 1010 m 1 s 1 ab1886 uvra 6 5 1010 m 1 s 1 ab1157 wild type 4 1 1010 m 1 s 1 and dh5α reca enda 2 9 1010 m 1 s 1 where the values in parentheses show k o h t r a n s f o r m a t i o n table 1 the reca deficient ab2463 showed higher sensitivity to oh induced dna damage than the uvra deficient ab1886 which was opposite compared to the case for uv254 fig 3a this suggests that reca is more efficient for repairing oh induced dna damage as homologous recombination is based on exchange of damaged nucleotide sequences alberts et al 2002 and capable of repairing not only base oxidation but also double strand breaks in contrast uvra is based on nucleotide excision repair and more specific to the repair of uv induced dna lesions base modification such as cpds but not efficient for double strand breaks alberts et al 2002 the apparent rate constants for the degradation of amp r segments puc19 plasmid and the loss of gene transforming activity are compared in fig 4 for both uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation the estimated degradation rates of the entire plasmid based on qpcr analyses overestimated the rates of puc19 deactivation loss of transforming activity observed for all repair proficient e coli recipient strains which can be explained by the repair of uv254 and oh induced damage by repair proficient recipient cells our results were in agreement with previous findings on the uv254 treated pwh1266 plasmid and its transformation of acinetobacter baylyi chang et al 2017 however the rate of gene deactivation during uv254 direct photolysis measured using uvra deficient ab1886 as the recipient strain was close to the estimated degradation rate of puc19 and the formation rate of dna lesions fig 4a and b the minimum rates of gene deactivation measured by double mutant ab2480 uvra reca were estimated based on the limited data points shown in fig 3 which gave 0 91 cm2 mj and 1 7 1011 m 1 s 1 for uv254 and oh exposure respectively these values were significantly larger than the gene deactivation rates measured by any of the repair proficient strains furthermore the degradation rate of the entire plasmid underestimated the loss of puc19 transforming activity measured by ab2480 uvra reca during uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation 3 3 e arg degradation and deactivation by combined exposure to uv254 and radicals the degradation of amp r and the elimination of gene transforming activity e coli dh5α as recipient cells were tested during combined exposure to uv254 and radicals oh and so4 in comparison to uv254 direct photolysis the degradation of amp r amplicons followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence r2 0 99 during uv254 uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 treatments fig 5 a lower initial concentration of puc19 0 3 μg ml and a higher fluence range 0 180 mj cm2 were applied in these tests than in the experiments described in the preceding sections however the degradation rate constants of amp r amplicons during uv254 direct photolysis i e 2 4 10 2 8 2 10 2 cm2 mj table s1 were in good agreement with those obtained during the treatment of 1 μg ml of puc19 by 0 130 mj cm2 of uv254 i e 2 0 10 2 8 9 10 2 cm2 mj table 1 the k u v 254 h 2 o 2 of amp r amplicons during uv254 h2o2 were in the range of 1 0 10 1 3 0 10 1 cm2 mj which were larger than the k u v 254 by a factor of 4 table s1 therefore the contribution of uv254 direct photolysis to the overall gene degradation during uv254 h2o2 was only about 25 k u v 254 k u v 254 h 2 o 2 100 revealing the significant role of oh exposure 75 the k u v 254 h 2 o 2 for the elimination of gene transforming activity was 5 1 0 2 10 2 cm2 mj which was larger than the k u v 254 by a factor of only 1 1 k u v 254 h 2 o 2 k u v 254 1 1 table s1 thus even though the oh exposure significantly accelerated gene degradation by a factor of 4 its contribution to the elimination of gene transforming activity was not as efficient as expected fig 6 summarizes the results from this study and the literature on the effect of oh exposure on degradation of the 851 bp amp r segment and loss of gene transforming activity measured using e coli dh5α as recipient strain plasmid puc4k or puc19 carrying amp r was treated with uv h2o2 at different conditions of uv wavelength and initial h2o2 concentrations i e uv254 h2o2 0 3 mm or 0 5 mm and uv 290 h2o2 10 mm the oh induced degradation and deactivation were calculated by subtracting the effect of uv254 direct photolysis from the overall results of corresponding uv254 h2o2 treatment although the statistical analysis showed a significant variation p 0 0149 in the slopes of linear curves in fig 6a the k o h 851 b p values during uv254 h2o2 treatment differed only by factors of 0 8 1 5 from that during the oh only process uv 290 h2o2 this suggested that uv254 induced gene damage on the plasmid e g cpds and pyrimidine adducts did not have a significant impact on the reactivity of oh with nucleobase and sugar moieties during uv254 h2o2 however the elimination of gene transforming activity measured using e coli dh5α as recipient strain varied significantly in the different treatments the loss of gene transforming activity attributable to oh was 5 times lower in uv254 h2o2 processes uv254 and oh co exist as compared to that in uv 290 h2o2 oh only this indicates that the elimination of gene transforming activity caused by uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation were not additive during uv254 h2o2 one possible explanation could be that some dna damage repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair by uvrabc also repaired oh induced lesions e g base oxidation located near the uv induced lesions leading to much less extensive loss of transforming activity than would be expected from simple summation of the losses in transforming activity observed for uv254 and oh exposure separately the degradation rates of amp r amplicons 1 0 10 1 3 2 10 1 cm2 mj during uv254 s2o8 2 were also 4 fold larger than those obtained during uv254 table s1 so4 is the primary radical generated during uv254 photolysis of s2o8 2 however so4 can further react with h2o oh and cl sometimes present as an impurity in aqueous solution to produce oh lutze et al 2015 using the degradation kinetics of radical probe compounds nitrobenzene and pcba figs s8 and s9 the steady state concentration of oh during uv254 s2o8 2 was determined to be 6 4 10 13 m which was approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that of so4 1 8 10 11 m under experimental conditions used here text s3 this was consistent with the theoretically estimated values considering all the possible reactions related to oh formation in the uv254 s2o8 2 system text s4 despite the much lower concentration the contribution of oh to the overall gene damage cannot be ignored as the amp r segments appeared to be much more reactive to oh than so4 see discussions below thus the percentages of gene degradation attributable to uv254 direct photolysis so4 and oh during uv254 s2o8 2 treatment could be estimated as 23 33 and 44 respectively where the relative contributions of each pathway to the overall gene damage were calculated based on the observed rate constants for degradation of amp r amplicons during uv254 and uv254 s2o8 2 treatments the steady state concentrations of oh and so4 in uv254 s2o8 2 experiments and the second order rate constants for reactions of oh and so4 with the amp r amplicons text s5 the second order rate constants of so4 with amp r segments were determined to be in the range of 1 07 1 96 109 m 1 s 1 text s5 and table s2 which were about an order of magnitude lower than the oh rate constants table 1 so4 preferentially adds to the electron rich sites of the nucleobases e g c5 of pyrimidines to generate radical adducts which decay to nucleobase radicals as intermediates followed by hydroxylation and oxidation in aqueous solution von sonntag 2006 however so4 is larger than oh and negatively charged therefore steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion might decrease the reactivity of so4 toward negatively charged dna molecules in comparison to oh similar to uv254 h2o2 processes the elimination rate of puc19 transforming activity during uv254 s2o8 2 treatment was also only slightly larger than that in uv254 direct photolysis k u v 254 s 2 o 8 2 k u v 254 1 1 table s1 even while the observed amplicon degradation rates were 4 fold faster for uv254 s2o8 2 compared to uv254 direct photolysis this further supports the above findings that co exposure to uv254 and radicals during uv254 aops did not lead to faster transforming activity loss than the separate exposures to uv254 and radicals due to the facile repair of uv254 and or radical induced dna damage in host cells 3 4 effect of wastewater effluent organic matter on the degradation of amp r during uv254 aops the efficiencies of amp r degradation during uv254 uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 experiments were investigated in the presence of efom 5 4 mg c l the uv 254 nm absorbance of efom solution a254 was 0 1 cm 1 the path length in the petri dish l was 1 6 cm thus the water factor wf 1 10 a254 l a254 l ln10 bolton and linden 2003 was calculated to be 0 84 the average uv intensity in the solution containing efom was then corrected from 0 30 mw cm2 to 0 25 mw cm2 using the calculated water factor lee et al 2016 the amp r segments were gradually degraded with increasing uv fluence following first order kinetics fig 7 interestingly the k u v a m p of each segment during uv254 irradiation in the presence of efom was approximately 1 2 times higher than the corresponding conditions without efom p 0 0001 table s1 chromophoric dissolved organic matter dom is known to generate reactive species upon uv irradiation such as triplet excited states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen and oh which have been proven to contribute to the oxidation of organic pollutants chin et al 2004 lester et al 2013 batista et al 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 bacteriophage ms2 was found to be inactivated by 3dom and singlet oxygen generated from sunlight irradiation of wastewater and river water dom isolates kohn et al 2007 kohn and nelson 2007 rosado lausell et al 2013 the reactive oxygen species e g singlet oxygen superoxide h2o2 generated during photooxidations involving 3dom were proposed to inactivate bacteria by damaging dna proteins and cell membranes song et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 our findings suggest that through its photosensitizing properties dom can indirectly contribute to the photodegradation of e args similar results were reported recently on the enhanced photo degradation of pbr322 plasmid encoded tet a and bla tem 1 genes in dom solution zhang et al 2019b this degradation pathway might play an especially important role during solar disinfection processes due to the low uv absorbance characteristics of dna at high wavelengths and consequent minimal direct uv photolysis under such conditions in contrast efom mainly acted as a radical scavenger during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 experiments the k u v 254 h 2 o 2 and k u v 254 s 2 o 8 2 treatment of amp r segments in the presence of efom were each decreased by a factor of 3 compared to the conditions without efom table s1 the degradation kinetics of pcba and nitrobenzene fig s10 also confirmed the much lower levels of radicals in the presence of efom e g so4 ss 9 5 10 13 m with efom vs 1 8 10 11 m without efom overall the degradation efficiency of amp r in the presence of efom increased only marginally within a factor of 1 4 during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 compared to uv254 alone due to the significant scavenging of radicals by efom 4 conclusions the degradation of amp r segments and the loss of gene transforming activity followed first order kinetics with respect to uv fluence and oh exposure during uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation uv 290 h2o2 the degradation rate constants of amp r segments increased with amplicon size which corresponded to the increase in nucleotide bps and hence reaction sites with increased amplicon length gel electrophoresis results indicated that uv254 0 130 mj cm2 did not change the supercoiled conformation of puc19 plasmid whereas oh exposure 0 2 7 10 10 m s led to strand breaks the loss of gene transforming activity varied depending on the type of recipient cells double mutant ab2480 which was deficient in repair genes uvra and reca was the most sensitive to dna damage induced by uv254 direct photolysis and oh oxidation the predicted degradation rates for the entire puc19 plasmid overestimated the loss in transforming activity of puc19 for all recipient cells other than ab2480 apparently due to the repair of dna damage by repair proficient strains the second order rate constants of oh with amp r segments were determined to be in the range of 8 1 109 5 6 1010 m 1 s 1 and showed a strong linear relationship with the base pair number of amp r segments suggesting that oh reacts with all nucleobases of plasmid dna non selectively the rate constants of so4 with amp r segments were an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding oh rate constants thus the contribution of the trace amount of oh to the overall gene damage cannot be ignored during uv254 s2o8 2 treatment although oh and so4 significantly accelerated 75 the degradation of amp r amplicons measured by qpcr during uv254 h2o2 and uv254 s2o8 2 experiments this only marginally increased the gene deactivation rate 11 as gene damage caused by uv254 and radical co exposure appeared to be repaired more efficiently by recipient cells than the gene damage from the separate uv254 and radical exposures thus the elimination efficiency of the args transforming activities was similar for uv254 vs uv254 aops at the same uv fluence and the extent of elimination was mainly determined by the level of uv fluence because the transforming activity of the amp r gene could be lowered by only 1 log at a typical uv disinfection fluence for water treatment e g 40 mj cm2 but increased to more than 4 logs at an elevated uv fluence for uv aops e g 500 mj cm2 the use of uv aops may still prove beneficial for arg degradation and deactivation with the accompanying benefit of improved degradation of trace organic contaminants reactive species formed from the excitation of chromophoric organic matter appear to contribute to accelerated degradation of amp r during uv254 irradiation in the presence of efom compared to direct photolysis by uv254 alone whereas efom mainly acted as a radical
