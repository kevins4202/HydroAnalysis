21620,when supercavitation technique was used in surface vehicle supercavitating flow was formed on the surface of the submerged body via artificial ventilation which greatly reduced the navigation resistance and enhanced the navigation speed by combining the vof model and k ω sst turbulence model this study performed numerical simulation on the formed supercavitating flow field on the submerged body of the surface vehicle during artificial ventilation and examined the existence of the strut on the cavity form when the navigation parameters varied and the change regulation of the resistance coefficient of navigation body as the navigation inclination angle changed the pressure coefficient exhibited an asymmetrical distribution on two sides of the strut at a large navigation inclination angle the supercavities were more significantly affected by the strut and the drag resistance performance was poor with increasing navigation depth high pressure and low pressure regions around the strut expanded and the sunken separation position of the cavities moved forward resulting in the coating area of the vehicle by the formed cavities dropped and the resistance increased as the navigation speed increased the ratio of drag reduction increased gradually after the navigation speed exceeded to a certain value further increasing navigation speed did not increase but gradually decreased the ratio of drag reduction keywords ventilated supercavitating flow cfd strut submerged body drag reduction 1 introduction in recent years supercavitation technique has been applied to high speed surface vehicles a new type of high speed surface vehicles similar to small water plane area twin hull swath begovic et al 2015 gore 1985 exhibit a series of a advantages mainly including the small area of the strut water plane and favorable seakeeping capacity which now are recommended as a type of high speed experimental platform a typical swath vessel connects two submerged bodies via the strut however because of large wetting area and great resistance the vessel generally moves at low speeds forming supercavities on the swath vessels via artificial ventilation can lower the resistance by reducing the wetting surface of the submerged bodies thereby enhancing the motion speed supercavitation technique now has been applied to underwater vehicles such as torpedoes and underwater high speed projectiles and can reduce the resistance by approximately 80 compared to the fully wetting condition the application of supercavitation technique to surface vehicles now is still in the trial stage in spite of certain theoretical supports there still lacks of successful cases and references moghimi et al 2017 and jafarian and pishevar 2016 had used experimental and numerical simulation methods to study the supercavitation generated by different head and cavitator shapes georgiadis 2014 combined the supercavitating hydrofoil with swath to propose a high speed surface vehicle with a maximum speed of 120 knots it is similar to the hydrofoil small water plane area twin hull hyswath faison 2014 at high speed the vehicle relies on the lift force generated by the hypercavitation hydrofoil to provide support and the cavitation of the hypercavitation hydrofoil reduces the wetting area of the vehicle and further reduces the navigation drag xiang et al 2019 proposed a cavitating solver coupled with the bubble droplet cavitation model based on the openfoam platform simulation had been carried out for the cavitating hydrofoil of clark y sancoff et al 2016 developed the ghost high speed surface craft using supercavitation technology in his patent the hull utilizes the high speed propeller at the front end of the sub water body to generate cavitation effect and assist the air to enter the dense bubble area on the surface of the sub water body so as to reduce the drag and enable the sub water body to fly over the bubble at high speed zhao et al 2018 proposed a novel high speed surface vessel which has two symmetrical under water torpedo shaped sub water bodies connected to the hull with two couples of super cavitating hydrofoils simulation had been carried out for this novel vehicle with different wetting depths the hydrodynamics curves for both the fore and the aft hydrofoils were obtained and the three dimensional effect for the super cavitating hydrofoil as well as the interaction between the fore and the aft hydrofoils had been revealed xu et al 2018 studied the supercavitating flow around the axisymmetric projectile near the free surface by an experiment and numerical simulation it was concluded that the supercavity generated when the projectile is close and piercing the free surface is stable and the drag of this subzone in the free surface case is significantly lower than that of the fully wet subzone in the submerged case due to the surrounding supercavity unlike underwater supercavitating vehicles surface vehicles generally connect overwater load and underwater bodies via the strut structures the struts are necessary connecting structures whose large sizes impose significant effect on both forms and hydrodynamic characteristics of supercavities researches for relevant issues have been developed currently wosnik and arndt 2009 and zhou et al 2017 respectively analyzed the interaction between the control surface of the vehicle and the main cavitation by cfd software cfx through numerical simulation method and experimental method and obtained the variation rules of cavitation morphology after the control surface caused by different cavitation flow patterns and rudder angles of the control surface it was concluded that the control surface has no obvious effect on its upstream cavitation and the main cavitation deformation of the vehicle is large in the case of steering however because the size of the control surface at the tail of the supercavitating vehicle is small and the control surface is in the closed region at the tail of the cavity the effect of the control surface on the cavitation is not obvious and the flow field characteristics cannot be compared with the influence of the larger strut structure shang 2013 studied the feasibility of applying supercavitation technology to submarine with open source commercial cfd software openfoam based on vof method and sst turbulence model the shape of submarine with and without hull and rudder appendages was simulated numerically and the shape of natural cavitation over the hull was obtained wosnik et al 2003 studied the effects of cylindrical and elliptical struts on ventilated cavity shape and re entrant jet flow through water tunnel experiments it was found that the strut shape critically affects air demand through cavity strut wake interaction and once a supercavity extends beyond the length of the body it is enveloping a significant increase in ventilation gas is necessary to further increase the length of the cavity kinzel et al 2013 numerically simulated the results of wosnik et al 2003 ventilated supercavitation water tunnel experiments with elliptical struts using a level set method of compressible multiphase flow with mass transfer the simulation results can predict the effect of struts on the shape of cavity but the small scale bubble collapse in the downstream cavity mixture region cannot be well simulated jiang et al 2007 and liu et al 2009 used the stern support middle support and nose support to conduct experiments on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the aft section of the supercavitating vehicle and it was found that the middle support blocks the cavity from crossing over the strut to the tail of the vehicle this study aimed to use supercavitation technique to surface vehicles and produce supercavities on the submerged bodies by artificial ventilation to examine the variation rules of supercavity formation and the resistance coefficient of the vehicles with the navigation parameters 2 numerical model 2 1 basic governing equation currently mixture and vof multi phase flow models are common simulation methods for cavitating flow field the mixture model exhibits great numerical dissipation and cannot accurately capture the cavity interface chen et al 2009 the vof model hirt and nichols 1981 is suitable for solving the motion rules of the intersection interface and is preferable for observing the change in the cavity formation chen et al 2009 in addition the vof model exhibits certain advantage in calculating the vortex structure in the flow field inside the cavities since it can capture back jet flow phenomenon at the cavity tail and air leakage mode at the tail however the vof model requires great computational load during the iteration based on the unsteady algorithm in this study numerical simulation was performed on both the change in the cavity interface due to the existence of struts and the wave making when the strut of the vehicle passed through the water surface accordingly the vof model was selected for conducting numerical simulation on the ventilated supercavitating flow field providing the results more in line with the actual condition in addition since the vehicle model in this study moved at a low speed the velocity of the model νm 50 m s the natural cavitation effect was weak during the artificial ventilation process and can be ignored in numerical simulation therefore only the interaction between gas and liquid was taken into account based on the homogenous equalized multi phase theory multiple phases share same pressed and velocity field the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equation of the mixed media can be written as 1 ρ m t x i ρ m u i 0 2 t ρ m u j x i ρ m u i u j p x j ρ m g x i μ m μ t u i x j u j x i where the density and the dynamic viscosity of the mixed media denoted as ρ m and μ m can be obtained by weighed averaging of the volume components 3 ρ m α l ρ l α g ρ g μ

dynamic viscosity μ g is the gas dynamic viscosity in the vof model the method of tracing inter phase boundary is achieved by solving the volume fraction continuity equation as for the qth phase volume fraction equation is 5 α q t x i α q u i 0 where the subscript q l g denotes the liquid phase and the gas phase respectively 2 2 turbulence model with regard to a supercavitating flow field flow separation after the cavitator and air leakage and backflow of the cavitation wake flow are characterized by intensive turbulence therefore the selection of the turbulence model is quite critical for cavitation simulation precision in order to simulate the back injection flow and separated flow produced under adverse pressure gradient in this study k ω sst turbulence model developed by menter 1994 was selected due to the combination of k ε turbulence model and k ω turbulence model k ω sst model exhibits high simulation precision for the reentrant jet and separated flow the turbulent kinetic energy and the specific dissipation rate can be calculated as 6 ρ k t x j ρ k u j τ i j u i x j β ρ k ω x j μ μ t σ k 3 k x j 7 ρ ω t ρ ω u j x j ω k α 3 τ i j u i x j β 3 ρ ω 2 x j μ μ t σ ω

combinations of the corresponding coefficients in k ω and the modified k ε turbulence model as follows 10 ψ f 1 ψ k ω 1 f 1 ψ k ε α 3 f 1 α 1 1 f 1 α 2 11 k ω α 1 5 9 β 1 3 40 σ k 1 2 σ ω 1 2 β 9 100

model description and computational domain 3 1 description of the physical model in this study the physical model of the surface vehicle was designed according to the arrangement of swath vessels and the application of supercavitation technique to the submerged body the model consists of the strut and the submerged body as shown in fig 1 by means of artificial ventilation the supercavity were generated by the cavitator in the head of the model which then covered the submerged body to reduce the skin friction drag and enable the submerged body to travel at very high speeds the vehicle includes two structural parts to be specific the submerged underwater structure was composed of conical segment and the cylindrical segment and the disk cavitator ventilation system was installed in the head of the submerged body the strut was located in the middle of the vehicle and exhibited symmetrical arrangement with respect to the symmetry plane of the vehicle and both leading and the trailing edges of the strut cross section adopted streamlined design the cavitation number of a ventilated supercavitating vehicle generally ranges from 0 01 to 0 03 and the corresponding cavity slenderness ratio ranges from 11 to 21 zhang et al 2014 in order to stabilize the cavitation system the ventilated cavitation number and the slenderness ratio of the vehicle were set as 0 02 and 18 respectively in this study considering a real vessel with a displacement of approximately 30 tons the diameter and the length of the submerged body were set as 1 and 18 m respectively during the simulation the model parameters were set in accordance with a scale ratio 1 9 based on experiences the diameter of the disk cavitator was set as 1 5 of the model diameter and the attack angle of the cavitator α was set as a certain value to offset the gravity effect of the cavity table 1 lists the detailed parameters of the model 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions this study used starccm a commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd software fig 2 a displays the computational domain and the related grid division indicating that the cross sectional area was 210d 130d and the length was 6l both the inlet and outlet of the computational domain were defined as the velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively the velocity inlet was 1 2l away from the head of the vehicle while the pressure outlet was located at 3 8l away from the tail of the vehicle since the strut of the vehicle was partly submerged above the water surface the effect of water surface should also be taken into account based on the vof model appropriate two phase flow region was created in starccm the upper and lower half parts of the velocity inlet were air and water respectively the inlet pressure and the outlet pressure varied in accordance with the water depth variation rule p ρ g h the wall of the vehicle adopted no slip wall surface boundary condition the ventilation inlet of the cavitator was set as the mass flow inlet the normal directions of various ventilated surfaces were set as the ventilation directions the cavitation number in the cavity can be controlled by adjusting the mass flow rate in the view of the similarity law in the simulation the environmental pressure was adjusted for ensuring stable production of cavities the environmental pressure was set as 25 000 pa the grids on the wall surface of the vehicle and around the ventilated cavitating flow were refined moreover mesh refinement was applied along the water depth direction at the air water multi phase flow interface as shown in fig 2 b 3 3 effect of similarity law in the simulation in order to make the simulation results better conform to reality the simulation similarity law problem was considered the cavitation number was selected as the important similarity criterion number between the scale model and the real vessel to satisfy the similarity law the stability of the cavity can be evaluated according to the dynamic similarity parameter β 16 β σ v σ σ p 0 p c 1 2 ρ v 2 σ v p 0 p v 1 2 ρ v 2 where σ is the cavitation number σ v is the cavitation number under p v p 0 is the undisturbed pressure at the body position p c is the cavity pressure p v is the vapor pressure of the liquid v is the undisturbed velocity at the body position silberman and song 1961 proposed the cavity stability dynamic condition that the cavity is stable when β is around 5 3 in this study considering that the speed of the real vessel is about 90kn h and the speed of the simulation model is about 20 m s the dynamic similarity parameter β of the real vessel β r 5 7 and the model β m 5 7 at a water temperature of 20 c can be obtained by eq 14 which basically satisfies the cavity stability dynamic condition 3 4 evaluation of mesh independence according to the richardson extrapolation method the numerical calculated error induced by the mesh scale during the cfd calculation process can be estimated no matter in low order or high order format the numerically calculated results all approach the accurate solution with decreasing mesh size robert and sargent 1998 wilson et al 2001 in this study three different sets of meshes with different sizes namely fine medium and coarse meshes were generated on the surface of the supercavitating vehicle for further mesh convergence analysis by varying the basic mesh size the time step was calculated and the courant number remained unchanged so that the fineness rate of three sets of meshes along each direction was r k 2 table 2 lists the detailed mesh parameters and fig 3 compares three different kinds of mesh generation on the vehicle surface fig 4 displays the lift and drag on the surface of the vehicle under different mesh conditions the lift drag ratio of the vehicle denoted as λ a dimensionless parameter was selected as the coefficient validation parameter which can be written as 17 λ l r where l denotes the lift of the vehicle r denotes the drag of the vehicle table 3 lists the calculated lift drag ratios λ under different mesh conditions in the present mesh convergence analysis the parameters were described as follows the rate of convergence r k 18 r k ε k 21 ε k 32 where ε k 21 s 1 s 2 ε k 32 s 2 s 3 when 0 r k 1 the calculated result was monotonically convergent when r k 0 the calculated result exhibited oscillatory convergence when r k 1 the calculated result was divergent the first error expansion term δ k and the accuracy p k 19 δ k δ r e k ε k 21 r k p k 1 20 p k ln ε k 32 ε k 21 ln r k the

an empirical value and equals to 2 c k 1 suggests a negative high order item while c k 1 suggests a positive high order item in this study only the first error expansion item was analyzed by considering the effect of the high order item eq 17 can be corrected and the error δ k 1 can be derived as 22 δ k 1 c k δ r e k c k ε k 21 r k p k 1 according to eq 17 both the sign and the value of

independence analysis results it can thus be concluded that when mesh s 1 is adopted 0 r k 1 the monotone convergence condition is satisfied the error of the lift drag ratio of the vehicle is 2 9 and the lift drag ratio is corrected as 0 761 according to mesh independence analysis results fine mesh s 1 was used in the numerical simulation fig 5 displays the numerical simulation results of the submerged cavity shape and the theoretical calculation results by logvinovich empirical formula logvinovich 1969 leading to favorable consistency 4 simulation results and analysis 4 1 effect of the change in the navigation inclination angle on cavitating flow in order to examine the effect on cavitating flow the navigation inclination angle was set as three different values 0 30 and 45 corresponding to different operating conditions the navigation inclination angle is shown in fig 6 and table 5 lists all the calculation parameters is detail at a different navigation inclination angle the cavities that covered the surface of the submerged body as marked in gray in fig 7 were affected by the strut and changed in shape under the operating condition 1 when the navigation inclination angle equaled to 0 i e the strut was perpendicular to the water surface the cavity was subjected to identical interferences on both sides of the strut and thus exhibited a symmetrical shape fig 8 a displays the cavity s cross sectional shape the cavities were squeezed at the leading edge of the strut and then sunken inwards next the cavities were separated into two parts until developing to the tail of the vehicle as shown in fig 7 a the separated cavities gathered at the trailing edge of the strut to a certain degree but were not fused as shown in fig 7 b when the navigation inclination angle was not equal to 0 the effect of the strut on the cavity form was investigated by taking the operating condition 3 as the example it was stipulated that the cavitator pointed forward the side where the strut tilted towards the horizontal surface by less than 90 was regarded as the inner side while the other side was the outer side fig 9 displays the cavity formed on both sides of the tilted strut according to the simulation results the cavities on both sides of the strut were not symmetrically distributed around the symmetrical plane of the vehicle fig 8 c displays the cross sectional shape of the cavity as shown in fig 9 a and c the cavity on the outer side was slightly affected by the strut and showed small sunk deformation in contrast as shown in fig 9 b and d the cavity on the inner side greatly affected the strut and showed significant sunk deformation thereby leading to local collapse fig 9 d shows that the cavity on the inner side of the trailing edge of the strut already failed to cover the submerged body the effect of the navigation inclination angle on the cavitating flow field was then further analyzed by investigating the pressure coefficient and the resistance coefficient around the leading edge of the strut fig 10 displays the distribution of the pressure coefficient on the strut at an inclination angle of 45 on account of the inclination the pressure coefficient exhibited an asymmetrical distribution on both inner and outer sides to be specific the pressure region covered smaller area on the outer side while larger range on the inner side fig 11 displays the pressure coefficient curves on both inner and outer sides of the strut when the navigation inclination angle was 45 the enlarged drawing of the pressure curve at the leading edge of the strut indicates that the pressure coefficient on the inner side of the strut was greater than that on the outer side at the same position table 6 lists the pressure and resistance coefficients of the vehicle at different navigation inclination angles when the navigation inclination angle was 0 the pressure coefficient and the resistance coefficient exhibited identical distributions on both sides of the strut when the navigation inclination angle equaled to 30 and 45 the maximum pressure coefficients c p max on the inner side were identical to the values on the outer side whereas the minimum pressure coefficients c p min on the outer side were smaller than those on the inner side overall at a navigation inclination angle of 45 the resistance coefficient was greatest at a navigation inclination angle of 0 the resistance coefficient was lowest this can be attributed to the greater wetting area on the inner side of the vehicle when the inclination angle was unequal to 0 fig 12 depicts the variation in the resistance coefficient of the submerged body with the inclination angle since the vehicle generally moved at an inclination angle the pressure coefficient on the inner strut was greater and the mean pressure at the leading edge of the strut was greater accordingly at an inclination angle the position when the cavities were closed at the leading edge of the strut and the reentrant jet moved forward than the condition without inclination fig 13 a displays the profiles of the cavities on the symmetrical plane of the strut along the axis direction of the submerged body apparently at a larger inclination angle the closed position of the cavities moved forward without inclination the closing position of the cavities was basically close to the leading edge of the strut fig 13 b displays the distribution of pressure coefficient on the surface of the submerged body indicating that the rising position on the pressure coefficient curve at an inclination angle of 45 was farthest from the leading edge of the strut suggesting the occurrence of local collapse of the cavities at this position accordingly at a larger inclination angle of navigation the cavities were more significantly affected by the strut and the coating area of the vehicle by the cavities was smaller thereby yielding poorer drag reduction effect 4 2 effect of the change in the navigation depth on cavitating flow because of the existence of water surface when the vehicle moved at different depths and the wetting areas of the strut below the water surface were different indicating varying degrees of effects on the cavitating flow field in this study the distance between the axis of the vehicle and water surface was set as 200 400 and 600 mm for further comparison calculation parameters are shown in table 7 fig 14 displays the distribution patterns of the pressure coefficient at the leading edge of the strut when the navigation depth was set as 200 400 and 600 mm it can be observed that both the high pressure and low pressure regions occupied wider ranges around the strut at a greater navigation depth fig 15 displays the cavity form at a navigation depth of 600 mm as shown in fig 15 a by comparison with the condition at a navigation depth of 200 mm fig 8 a the sunken separation position of the cavities moved forward and more significantly affected by the strut fig 15 b shows that the wetting area at the tail of the cavities is also larger fig 16 displays the sectional profiles of the cavities on the submerged body from the cavitator to the leading edge of the strut when the navigation depth was 200 400 and 600 mm specifically fig 16 a displays the cross sectional profiles of the cavities on the submerged body obviously indicating that the coating area on the submerged body by cavities dropped with increasing navigation depth fig 16 b displays the cavity profiles of the longitudinal section along the axis direction of the submerged body as the navigation depth increased the sunken and separation position of the cavities moved forward and the radii of the cavities at the separation position also dropped steadily by comparing the cavity separation positions and radii in figs 12 a and 15 b it can be concluded that as the navigation depth varied the cavitating flow was more significantly affected by the strut than the change in the inclination angle fig 17 a displays the pressure coefficient curve on the one side of the strut cross section at 100 mm away from the central axis of the submerged body in fig 14 the pressure coefficients varied slightly at the leading edge of the strut when the navigation depth increased from 200 mm to 600 mm indicating that the pressure at the leading edge of the strut changed slightly with the variation in the navigation depth fig 17 b displays the distribution of pressure coefficient on the wall surface of the submerged body from the cavitator to the leading edge of the strut at a navigation depth of 600 mm the position where the cavities underwent pressure recovery was most forward in other words as the navigation depth increased the pressure region around the strut expanded therefore the area of high pressure and low pressure regions in the cavitating flow field at the leading edge of the strut is an important factor affecting the supercavitating flow form table 8 lists the pressure coefficients and resistance coefficients of the vehicle at different navigation depths as the navigation depth increased the resistance coefficient of the submerged body increased since the strut imposed greater effect on the cavities at a greater navigation depth the coating area on the submerged body by the cavities became smaller thereby increasing the wetting area on the submerged body 4 3 effect of the change of navigation speed on cavitating flow during the navigation the supercavitating vehicles do not move at a constant speed and thus the cavitating flow field changed with the navigation speed leading to the change of the ratio of drag reduction according to the similarity law when the ship model s froude number equals to that of the real ship they have an identical resistance coefficient in this study assuming that the froude number of the physical model was identical to that of the real ship the navigation speed was set at different values for exploring the effect on resistance table 9 lists the operating conditions in order to maintain a stable cavity form the ventilation quantity was set at different values at different navigation speeds to keep the ventilated cavitation number constant in the simulation fig 18 displays the variation curves of resistance and the ratio of drag reduction with the navigation speed as shown in fig 18 a the submerged body exhibited a remarkable drag reduction performance before and after the ventilation at the same speed however the resistance of the strut before the ventilation was slightly lower than that after the ventilation this can be attributed to the change in the pressure field around the leading edge of the strut after the ventilation thereby increasing the strut resistance as shown in fig 18 b at a low navigation speed the ratio of drag reduction increased with navigation speed the ratio of drag reduction reached the maximum at a navigation speed of 20 m s specifically the ratios of drag reduction of the submerged body and the vehicle were up to 60 and over 20 as the navigation speed increased from 25 m s to 30 m s the ratio of drag reduction began to drop mainly due to the fact that at a low navigation speed the cavities were significantly affected by the buoyance force as shown in fig 19 and the cavity axis varied upward at the tail accordingly the cavities broke away from the vehicle increasing the wetting area at the tail of the vehicle at a navigation speed of 20 m s the cavities were almost unaffected by the buoyancy force and the ratio of drag reduction was optimal as the navigation speed exceeded 20 m s the coating area on the submerged body by the cavities remained almost unchanged while the resistance on the part of the submerged body that was not coated by cavities and the strut resistance further increased with increasing speed therefore the total drag reduction efficiency dropped steadily with the navigation speed table 10 lists the resistance coefficients of the vehicle before and after ventilation at different navigation speeds fig 20 displays the distribution patterns of pressure coefficient at the leading edge of the strut when v 20 25 and 30 m s through comparison high pressure and low pressure regions were almost coincident suggesting almost identical effects on the cavity form at different navigation speeds fig 21 displays the profiles of the cavities on the symmetrical plane of the submerged body and the distribution pattern of pressure coefficient on the wall surface the pressure coefficient of the wall surface was lower at a higher navigation speed and the separation point of the cavity at the leading edge of the strut moved slightly forward with increasing speed it can thus be concluded that the change in the navigation speed only affected the ratio of drag reduction of the vehicle before and after ventilation but imposed slight effect on the supercavitating flow form by ignoring the effect of gravity the coating areas of the vehicle by the cavities remained almost unchanged at different navigation speeds 5 conclusions this study combined the vof model and k ω sst turbulence model for performing numerical simulation on the motion of the surface vehicles via artificial ventilation a supercavitating flow field was formed and the effects of the change in the navigation parameters on the cavity forms on the submerged body were investigated in depth through analysis the following conclusions were drawn 1 the change in the navigation inclination angle affected the cavity form on the submerged body when the inclination angle was unequal to 0 the cavities exhibited an asymmetrical distribution on both sides of the submerged body as the inclination angle increased the coating area of the submerged body by cavities increased and was unfavorable for drag reduction 2 the change in the navigation depth also affected the cavities on the submerged body at a larger navigation depth high pressure and low pressure regions around the strut were greater and the cavities around the strut were more seriously separated thereby decreasing the coating area of the submerged body by the cavities and drag reduction efficiency 3 as the navigation velocity exceeded a certain value a supercavitating air layer was formed on the surface of the submerged body thereby greatly reducing the resistance during the navigation process meanwhile the ratio of drag reduction increased gradually with increasing navigation velocity after exceeding a certain value further increasing the navigation speed would lower the ratio of drag reduction rather than increasing therefore a higher navigation speed is not always better from the perspective of economy according to present research conclusion supercavities were formed in the submerged body via artificial ventilation during the navigation of surface vehicle greatly reducing the navigation resistance moreover the strut structure significantly affected the supercavitating flow field in the submerged body considering the effects of strut resistance on the total resistance of the vehicle producing cavities on the strut surface via artificial ventilation would enhance the drag reduction performance however further in depth investigation is required in addition the physical model of the surface vehicle in this paper was simplified and the buoyancy force of the vehicle after the formation of supercavitating air layer was not taken into account in practical design certain wetting area should be reserved on the bottom of the submerged body and both the front and rear fins should be installed for maintaining gravitational equilibrium in conclusion the

21620,when supercavitation technique was used in surface vehicle supercavitating flow was formed on the surface of the submerged body via artificial ventilation which greatly reduced the navigation resistance and enhanced the navigation speed by combining the vof model and k ω sst turbulence model this study performed numerical simulation on the formed supercavitating flow field on the submerged

coefficient of navigation body as the navigation inclination angle changed the pressure coefficient exhibited an asymmetrical distribution on two sides of the strut at a large navigation inclination angle the supercavities were more significantly affected by the strut and the drag resistance performance was poor with increasing navigation depth high pressure and low pressure regions around the

navigation speed increased the ratio of drag reduction increased gradually after the navigation speed exceeded to a certain value further increasing navigation speed did not increase but gradually decreased the ratio of drag reduction keywords ventilated supercavitating flow cfd strut submerged body drag reduction 1 introduction in recent years supercavitation technique has been applied to high speed surface vehicles a new type of high speed surface vehicles similar to small water plane area twin hull swath begovic et al 2015 gore 1985 exhibit a series of a advantages mainly including the small area of the strut water plane and favorable seakeeping capacity which now are recommended as a type of high speed experimental platform a typical swath vessel connects two submerged bodies via the strut however because of large wetting area and great resistance the vessel generally moves at low speeds forming supercavities on the swath vessels via artificial ventilation can lower the resistance by reducing the wetting surface of the submerged bodies thereby enhancing the motion speed supercavitation technique now has been applied to underwater vehicles such as torpedoes and underwater high speed projectiles and can reduce the resistance by approximately 80 compared to the fully wetting condition the application of supercavitation technique to surface vehicles now is still in the trial stage in spite of certain theoretical supports there still lacks of successful cases and references moghimi et al 2017 and jafarian and pishevar 2016 had used experimental and numerical simulation methods to study the supercavitation generated by different head and cavitator shapes georgiadis 2014 combined the supercavitating hydrofoil with swath to propose a high speed surface vehicle with a maximum speed of 120 knots it is similar to the hydrofoil small water plane area twin hull hyswath faison 2014 at high speed the vehicle relies on the lift force generated by the hypercavitation hydrofoil to provide support and the cavitation of the hypercavitation hydrofoil reduces the wetting area of the vehicle and further reduces the navigation drag xiang et al 2019 proposed a cavitating solver coupled with the bubble droplet cavitation model based on the openfoam platform simulation had been carried out for the cavitating hydrofoil of clark y sancoff et al 2016 developed the ghost high speed surface craft using supercavitation technology in his patent the hull utilizes the high speed propeller at the front end of the sub water body to generate cavitation effect and assist the air to enter the dense bubble area on the surface of the sub water body so as to reduce the drag and enable the sub water body to fly over the bubble at high speed zhao et al 2018 proposed a novel high speed surface vessel which has two symmetrical under water torpedo shaped sub water bodies connected to the hull with two couples of super cavitating hydrofoils simulation had been carried out for this novel vehicle with different wetting depths the hydrodynamics curves for both the fore and the aft hydrofoils were obtained and the three dimensional effect for the super cavitating hydrofoil as well as the interaction between the fore and the aft hydrofoils had been revealed xu et al 2018 studied the supercavitating flow around the axisymmetric projectile near the free surface by an experiment and numerical simulation it was concluded that the supercavity generated when the projectile is close and piercing the free surface is stable and the drag of this subzone in the free surface case is significantly lower than that of the fully wet subzone in the submerged case due to the surrounding supercavity unlike underwater supercavitating vehicles surface vehicles generally connect overwater load and underwater bodies via the strut structures the struts are necessary connecting structures whose large sizes impose significant effect on both forms and hydrodynamic characteristics of supercavities researches for relevant issues have been developed currently wosnik and arndt 2009 and zhou et al 2017 respectively analyzed the interaction between the control surface of the vehicle and the main cavitation by cfd software cfx through numerical simulation method and experimental method and obtained the variation rules of cavitation morphology after the control surface caused by different cavitation flow patterns and rudder angles of the control surface it was concluded that the control surface has no obvious effect on its upstream cavitation and the main cavitation deformation of the vehicle is large in the case of steering however because the size of the control surface at the tail of the supercavitating vehicle is small and the control surface is in the closed region at the tail of the cavity the effect of the control surface on the cavitation is not obvious and the flow field characteristics cannot be compared with the influence of the larger strut structure shang 2013 studied the feasibility of applying supercavitation technology to submarine with open source commercial cfd software openfoam based on vof method and sst turbulence model the shape of submarine with and without hull and rudder appendages was simulated numerically and the shape of natural cavitation over the hull was obtained wosnik et al 2003 studied the effects of cylindrical and elliptical struts on ventilated cavity shape and re entrant jet flow through water tunnel experiments it was found that the strut shape critically affects air demand through cavity strut wake interaction and once a supercavity extends beyond the length of the body it is enveloping a significant increase in ventilation gas is necessary to further increase the length of the cavity kinzel et al 2013 numerically simulated the results of wosnik et al 2003 ventilated supercavitation water tunnel experiments with elliptical struts using a level set method of compressible multiphase flow with mass transfer the simulation results can predict the effect of struts on the shape of cavity but the small scale bubble collapse in the downstream cavity mixture region cannot be well simulated jiang et al 2007 and liu et al 2009 used the stern support middle support and nose support to conduct experiments on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the aft section of the supercavitating vehicle and it was found that the middle support blocks the cavity from crossing over the strut to the tail of the vehicle this study aimed to use supercavitation technique to surface vehicles and produce supercavities on the submerged bodies by artificial ventilation to examine the variation rules of supercavity formation and the resistance coefficient of the vehicles with the navigation parameters 2 numerical model 2 1 basic governing equation currently mixture and vof multi phase flow models are common simulation methods for cavitating flow field the mixture model exhibits great numerical dissipation and cannot accurately capture the cavity interface chen et al 2009 the vof model hirt and nichols 1981 is suitable for solving the motion rules of the intersection interface and is preferable for observing the change in the cavity formation chen et al 2009 in addition the vof model exhibits certain advantage in calculating the vortex structure in the flow field inside the cavities since it can capture back jet flow phenomenon at the cavity tail and air leakage mode at the tail however the vof model requires great computational load during the iteration based on the unsteady algorithm in this study numerical simulation was performed on both the change in the cavity interface due to the existence of struts and the wave making when the strut of the vehicle passed through the water surface accordingly the vof model was selected for conducting numerical simulation on the ventilated supercavitating flow field providing the results more in line with the actual condition in addition since the vehicle model in this study moved at a low speed the velocity of the model νm 50 m s the natural cavitation effect was weak during the artificial ventilation process and can be ignored in numerical simulation therefore only the interaction between gas and liquid was taken into account based on the homogenous equalized multi phase theory multiple phases share same pressed and velocity field the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equation of the mixed media can be written as 1 ρ m t x i ρ m u i 0 2 t ρ m u j x i ρ m u i u j p x j ρ m g

volume fraction equation is 5 α q t x i α q u i 0 where the subscript q l g denotes the liquid phase and the gas phase respectively 2 2 turbulence model with regard to a supercavitating flow field flow separation after the cavitator and air leakage and backflow of the cavitation wake flow are characterized by intensive turbulence therefore the selection of the turbulence model is quite critical for cavitation simulation precision in order to simulate the back injection flow and separated flow produced under adverse pressure gradient in this study k ω sst turbulence model developed by menter 1994 was selected due to the combination of k ε turbulence model and k ω turbulence model k ω sst model exhibits high simulation precision for the reentrant jet and separated flow the turbulent kinetic energy and the specific dissipation rate can be calculated as 6 ρ k t x j ρ k u j τ i j u i x j β ρ k ω x j μ μ t σ k 3 k x j 7 ρ ω t ρ ω u j x j ω k α 3 τ i j u i x j β 3 ρ ω 2 x j μ μ t σ ω

model description and computational domain 3 1 description of the physical model in this study the physical model of the surface vehicle was designed according to the arrangement of swath vessels and the application of supercavitation technique to the submerged body the model consists of the strut and the submerged body as shown in fig 1 by means of artificial ventilation the supercavity were generated by the cavitator in the head of the model which then covered the submerged body to reduce the skin friction drag and enable the submerged body to travel at very high speeds the vehicle includes two structural parts to be specific the submerged underwater structure was composed of conical segment and the cylindrical segment and the disk cavitator ventilation system was installed in the head of the submerged body the strut was located in the middle of the vehicle and exhibited symmetrical arrangement with respect to the symmetry plane of the vehicle and both leading and the trailing edges of the strut cross section adopted streamlined design the cavitation number of a ventilated supercavitating vehicle generally ranges from 0 01 to 0 03 and the corresponding cavity slenderness ratio ranges from 11 to 21 zhang et al 2014 in order to stabilize the cavitation system the ventilated cavitation number and the slenderness ratio of the vehicle were set as 0 02 and 18 respectively in this study considering a real vessel with a displacement of approximately 30 tons the diameter and the length of the submerged body were set as 1 and 18 m respectively during the simulation the model parameters were set in accordance with a scale ratio 1 9 based on experiences the diameter of the disk cavitator was set as 1 5 of the model diameter and the attack angle of the cavitator α was set as a certain value to offset the gravity effect of the cavity table 1 lists the detailed parameters of the model 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions this study used starccm a commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd software fig 2 a displays the computational domain and the related grid division indicating that the cross sectional area was 210d 130d and the length was 6l both the inlet and outlet of the computational domain were defined as the velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively the velocity inlet was 1 2l away from the head of the vehicle while the pressure outlet was located at 3 8l away from the tail of the vehicle since the strut of the vehicle was partly submerged above the water surface the effect of water surface should also be taken into account based on the vof model appropriate two phase flow region was created in starccm the upper and lower half parts of the velocity inlet were air and water respectively the inlet pressure and the outlet pressure varied in accordance with the water depth variation rule p ρ g h the wall of the vehicle adopted no slip wall surface boundary condition the ventilation inlet of the cavitator was set as the mass flow inlet the normal directions of various ventilated surfaces were set as the ventilation directions the cavitation number in the cavity can be controlled by adjusting the mass flow rate in the view of the similarity law in the simulation the environmental pressure was adjusted for ensuring stable production of cavities the environmental pressure was set as 25 000 pa the grids on the wall surface of the vehicle and around the ventilated cavitating flow were refined moreover mesh refinement was applied along the water depth direction at the air water multi phase flow interface as shown in fig 2 b 3 3 effect of similarity law in the simulation in order to make the simulation results better conform to reality the simulation similarity law problem was considered the cavitation number was selected as the important similarity criterion number between the scale model and the real vessel to satisfy the similarity law the stability of the cavity can be evaluated according to the dynamic similarity parameter β 16 β σ v σ σ p 0 p c 1 2 ρ v 2 σ v p 0 p v 1 2 ρ v 2 where σ is the cavitation number σ v is the cavitation number under p v p 0 is the undisturbed pressure at the body position p c is the cavity pressure p v is the vapor pressure of the liquid v is the undisturbed velocity at the body position silberman and song 1961 proposed the cavity stability dynamic condition that the cavity is stable when β is around 5 3 in this study considering that the speed of the real vessel is about 90kn h and the speed of the simulation model is about 20 m s the dynamic similarity parameter β of the real vessel β r 5 7 and the model β m 5 7 at a water temperature of 20 c can be obtained by eq 14 which basically satisfies the cavity stability dynamic condition 3 4 evaluation of mesh independence according to the richardson extrapolation method the numerical calculated error induced by the mesh scale during the cfd calculation process can be estimated no matter in low order or high order format the numerically calculated results all approach the accurate solution with decreasing mesh size robert and sargent 1998 wilson et al 2001 in this study three different sets of meshes with different sizes namely fine medium and coarse meshes were generated on the surface of the supercavitating vehicle for further mesh convergence analysis by varying the basic mesh size the time step was calculated and the courant number remained unchanged so that the fineness rate of three sets of meshes along each direction was r k 2 table 2 lists the detailed mesh parameters and fig 3 compares three different kinds of mesh generation on the vehicle surface fig 4 displays the lift and drag on the surface of the vehicle under different mesh conditions the lift drag ratio of the vehicle denoted as λ a dimensionless parameter was selected as the coefficient validation parameter which can be written as 17 λ l r where l denotes the lift of the vehicle r denotes the drag of the vehicle table 3 lists the calculated lift drag ratios λ under different mesh conditions in the present mesh convergence analysis the parameters were described as follows the rate of convergence r k 18 r k ε k 21 ε k 32 where ε k 21 s 1 s 2 ε k 32 s 2 s 3 when 0 r k 1 the calculated result was monotonically convergent when r k 0 the calculated result exhibited oscillatory convergence when r k 1 the calculated result was divergent the first error expansion term δ k and the accuracy p k 19 δ k δ r e k ε k 21 r k p k 1 20 p k ln ε k 32 ε k 21 ln r k the evaluation accuracy can be enhanced by introducing the correction factor c k described as follows 21 c k r k p k 1 r k p e s t 1 where r k denotes the fineness rate r k 2 in this study p e s t denotes an empirical value and equals to 2 c k 1 suggests a negative high order item while c k 1 suggests a positive high order item in this study only the first error expansion item was analyzed by considering the effect of the high order item eq 17 can be corrected and the error δ k 1 can be derived as 22 δ k 1 c k δ r e k c k ε k 21 r k p k 1 according to eq 17 both the sign and the value of

independence analysis results it can thus be concluded that when mesh s 1 is adopted 0 r k 1 the monotone convergence condition is satisfied the error of the lift drag ratio of the vehicle is 2 9 and the lift drag ratio is corrected as 0 761 according to mesh independence analysis results fine mesh s 1 was used in the numerical simulation fig 5 displays the numerical simulation results of the submerged cavity shape and the theoretical calculation results by logvinovich empirical formula logvinovich 1969 leading to favorable consistency 4 simulation results and analysis 4 1 effect of the change in the navigation inclination angle on cavitating flow in order to examine the effect on cavitating flow the navigation inclination angle was set as three different values 0 30 and 45 corresponding to different operating conditions the navigation inclination angle is shown in fig 6 and table 5 lists all the calculation parameters is detail at a different navigation inclination angle the cavities that covered the surface of the submerged body as marked in gray in fig 7 were affected by the strut and changed in shape under the operating condition 1 when the navigation inclination angle equaled to 0 i e the strut was perpendicular to the water surface the cavity was subjected to identical interferences on both sides of the strut and thus exhibited a symmetrical shape fig 8 a displays the cavity s cross sectional shape the cavities were squeezed at the leading edge of the strut and then sunken inwards next the cavities were separated into two parts until developing to the tail of the vehicle as shown in fig 7 a the separated cavities gathered at the trailing edge of the strut to a certain degree but were not fused as shown in fig 7 b when the navigation inclination angle was not equal to 0 the effect of the strut on the cavity form was investigated by taking the operating condition 3 as the example it was stipulated that the cavitator pointed forward the side where the strut tilted towards the horizontal surface by less than 90 was regarded as the inner side while the other side was the outer side fig 9 displays the cavity formed on both sides of the tilted strut according to the simulation results the cavities on both sides of the strut were not symmetrically distributed around the symmetrical plane of the vehicle fig 8 c displays the cross sectional shape of the cavity as shown in fig 9 a and c the cavity on the outer side was slightly affected by the strut and showed small sunk deformation in contrast as shown in fig 9 b and d the cavity on the inner side greatly affected the strut and showed significant sunk deformation thereby leading to local collapse fig 9 d shows that the cavity on the inner side of the trailing edge of the strut already failed to cover the submerged body the effect of the navigation inclination angle on the cavitating flow field was then further analyzed by investigating the pressure coefficient and the resistance coefficient around the leading edge of the strut fig 10 displays the distribution of the pressure coefficient on the strut at an inclination angle of 45 on account of the inclination the pressure coefficient exhibited an asymmetrical distribution on both inner and outer sides to be specific the pressure region covered smaller area on the outer side while larger range on the inner side fig 11 displays the pressure coefficient curves on both inner and outer sides of the strut when the navigation inclination angle was 45 the enlarged drawing of the pressure curve at the leading edge of the strut indicates that the pressure coefficient on the inner side of the strut was greater than that on the outer side at the same position table 6 lists the pressure and resistance coefficients of the vehicle at different navigation inclination angles when the navigation inclination angle was 0 the pressure coefficient and the resistance coefficient exhibited identical distributions on both sides of the strut when the navigation inclination angle equaled to 30 and 45 the maximum pressure coefficients c p max on the inner side were identical to the values on the outer side whereas the minimum pressure coefficients c p min on the outer side were smaller than those on the inner side overall at a navigation inclination angle of 45 the resistance coefficient was greatest at a navigation inclination angle of 0 the resistance coefficient was lowest this can be attributed to the greater wetting area on the inner side of the vehicle when the inclination angle was unequal to 0 fig 12 depicts the variation in the resistance coefficient of the submerged body with the inclination angle since the vehicle generally moved at an inclination angle the pressure coefficient on the inner strut was greater and the mean pressure at the leading edge of the strut was greater accordingly at an inclination angle the position when the cavities were closed at the leading edge of the strut and the reentrant jet moved forward than the condition without inclination fig 13 a displays the profiles of the cavities on the symmetrical plane of the strut along the axis direction of the submerged body apparently at a larger inclination angle the closed position of the cavities moved forward without inclination the closing position of the cavities was basically close to the leading edge of the strut fig 13 b displays the distribution of pressure coefficient on the surface of the submerged body indicating that the rising position on the pressure coefficient curve at an inclination angle of 45 was farthest from the leading edge of the strut suggesting the occurrence of local collapse of the cavities at this position accordingly at a larger inclination angle of navigation the cavities were more significantly affected by the strut and the coating area of the vehicle by the cavities was smaller thereby yielding poorer drag reduction effect 4 2 effect of the change in the navigation depth on cavitating flow because of the existence of water surface when the vehicle moved at different depths and the wetting areas of the strut below the water surface were different indicating varying degrees of effects on the cavitating flow field in this study the distance between the axis of the vehicle and water surface was set as 200 400 and 600 mm for further comparison calculation parameters are shown in table 7 fig 14 displays the distribution patterns of the pressure coefficient at the leading edge of the strut when the navigation depth was set as 200 400 and 600 mm it can be observed that both the high pressure and low pressure regions occupied wider ranges around the strut at a greater navigation depth fig 15 displays the cavity form at a navigation depth of 600 mm as shown in fig 15 a by comparison with the condition at a navigation depth of 200 mm fig 8 a the sunken separation position of the cavities moved forward and more significantly affected by the strut fig 15 b shows that the wetting area at the tail of the cavities is also larger fig 16 displays the sectional profiles of the cavities on the submerged body from the cavitator to the leading edge of the strut when the navigation depth was 200 400 and 600 mm specifically fig 16 a displays the cross sectional profiles of the cavities on the submerged body obviously indicating that the coating area on the submerged body by cavities dropped with increasing navigation depth fig 16 b displays the cavity profiles of the longitudinal section along the axis direction of the submerged body as the navigation depth increased the sunken and separation position of the cavities moved forward and the radii of the cavities at the separation position also dropped steadily by comparing the cavity separation positions and radii in figs 12 a and 15 b it can be concluded that as the navigation depth varied the cavitating flow was more significantly affected by the strut than the change in the inclination angle fig 17 a displays the pressure coefficient curve on the one side of the strut cross section at 100 mm away from the central axis of the submerged body in fig 14 the pressure coefficients varied slightly at the leading edge of the strut when the navigation depth increased from 200 mm to 600 mm indicating that the pressure at the leading edge of the strut changed slightly with the variation in the navigation depth fig 17 b displays the distribution of pressure coefficient on the wall surface of the submerged body from the cavitator to the leading edge of the strut at a navigation depth of 600 mm the position where the cavities underwent pressure recovery was most forward in other words as the navigation depth increased the pressure region around the strut expanded therefore the area of high pressure and low pressure regions in the cavitating flow field at the leading edge of the strut is an important factor affecting the supercavitating flow form table 8 lists the pressure coefficients and resistance coefficients of the vehicle at different navigation depths as the navigation depth increased the resistance coefficient of the submerged body increased since the strut imposed greater effect on the cavities at a greater navigation depth the coating area on the submerged body by the cavities became smaller thereby increasing the wetting area on the submerged body 4 3 effect of the change of navigation speed on cavitating flow during the navigation the supercavitating vehicles do not move at a constant speed and thus the cavitating flow field changed with the navigation speed leading to the change of the ratio of drag reduction according to the similarity law when the ship model s froude number equals to that of the real ship they have an identical resistance coefficient in this study assuming that the froude number of the physical model was identical to that of the real ship the navigation speed was set at different values for exploring the effect on resistance table 9 lists the operating conditions in order to maintain a stable cavity form the ventilation quantity was set at different values at different navigation speeds to keep the ventilated cavitation number constant in the simulation fig 18 displays the variation curves of resistance and the ratio of drag reduction with the navigation speed as shown in fig 18 a the submerged body exhibited a remarkable drag reduction performance before and after the ventilation at the same speed however the resistance of the strut before the ventilation was slightly lower than that after the ventilation this can be attributed to the change in the pressure field around the leading edge of the strut after the ventilation thereby increasing the strut resistance as shown in fig 18 b at a low navigation speed the ratio of drag reduction increased with navigation speed the ratio of drag reduction reached the maximum at a navigation speed of 20 m s specifically the ratios of drag reduction of the submerged body and the vehicle were up to 60 and over 20 as the navigation speed increased from 25 m s to 30 m s the ratio of drag reduction began to drop mainly due to the fact that at a low navigation speed the cavities were significantly affected by the buoyance force as shown in fig 19 and the cavity axis varied upward at the tail accordingly the cavities broke away from the vehicle increasing the wetting area at the tail of the vehicle at a navigation speed of 20 m s the cavities were almost unaffected by the buoyancy force and the ratio of drag reduction was optimal as the navigation speed exceeded 20 m s the coating area on the submerged body by the cavities remained almost unchanged while the resistance on the part of the submerged body that was not coated by cavities and the strut resistance further increased with increasing speed therefore the total drag reduction efficiency dropped steadily with the navigation speed table 10 lists the resistance coefficients of the vehicle before and after ventilation at different navigation speeds fig 20 displays the distribution patterns of pressure coefficient at the leading edge of the strut when v 20 25 and 30 m s through comparison high pressure and low pressure regions were almost coincident suggesting almost identical effects on the cavity form at different navigation speeds fig 21 displays the profiles of the cavities on the symmetrical plane of the submerged body and the distribution pattern of pressure coefficient on the wall surface the pressure coefficient of the wall surface was lower at a higher navigation speed and the separation point of the cavity at the leading edge of the strut moved slightly forward with increasing speed it can thus be concluded that the change in the navigation speed only affected the ratio of drag reduction of the vehicle before and after ventilation but imposed slight effect on the supercavitating flow form by ignoring the effect of gravity the coating areas of the vehicle by the cavities remained almost unchanged at different navigation speeds 5 conclusions this study combined the vof model and k ω sst turbulence model for performing numerical simulation on the motion of the surface vehicles via artificial ventilation a supercavitating flow field was formed and the effects of the change in the navigation parameters on the cavity forms on the submerged body were investigated in depth through analysis the following conclusions were drawn 1 the change in the navigation inclination angle affected the cavity form on the submerged body when the inclination angle was unequal to 0 the cavities exhibited an asymmetrical distribution on both sides of the submerged body as the inclination angle increased the coating area of the submerged body by cavities increased and was unfavorable for drag reduction 2 the change in the navigation depth also affected the cavities on the submerged body at a larger navigation depth high pressure and low pressure regions around the strut were greater and the cavities around the strut were more seriously separated thereby decreasing the coating area of the submerged body by the cavities and drag reduction efficiency 3 as the navigation velocity exceeded a certain value a supercavitating air layer was formed on the surface of the submerged body thereby greatly reducing the resistance during the navigation process meanwhile the ratio of drag reduction increased gradually with increasing navigation velocity after exceeding a certain value further increasing the navigation speed would lower the ratio of drag reduction rather than increasing therefore a higher navigation speed is not always better from the perspective of economy according to present research conclusion supercavities were formed in the submerged body via artificial ventilation during the navigation of surface vehicle greatly reducing the navigation resistance moreover the strut structure significantly affected the supercavitating flow field in the submerged body considering the effects of strut resistance on the total resistance of the vehicle producing cavities on the strut surface via artificial ventilation would enhance the drag reduction performance however further in depth investigation is required in addition the physical model of the surface vehicle in this paper was simplified and the buoyancy force of the vehicle after the formation of supercavitating air layer was not taken into account in practical design certain wetting area should be reserved on the bottom of the submerged body and both the front and rear fins should be installed for maintaining gravitational equilibrium in conclusion the

21621,extreme wind and waves can easily destroy aquaculture facilities in the open sea therefore it is essential to analyze the hydrodynamic responses of aquaculture facilities based on a numerical method to ensure the accuracy of calculation and avoid the huge computational resources required by computational fluid dynamics cfd this study adopts a new method that combines the boundary element method based on the potential flow theory with the morison equation to simulate the hydrodynamic response of a semisubmersible aquaculture facility in pure waves the hydrodynamic response including mooring line tension and motion response is simulated in pure waves and compared with experimental values the results show that the numerical data agree well with the experimental data based on the above work the numerical model presented here can be used to analyze the hydrodynamic response of a semisubmersible aquaculture facility the effects of wavelength and wave steepness on the mooring line tension and motion response are studied additionally with increasing draught both the force on the mooring line and the motion response decrease and thus an effective way for an aquaculture facility to avoid damage due to severe waves is through properly increasing draught keywords aquaculture facility mooring line tension motion response boundary element method 1 introduction in recent decades the marine aquaculture industry has developed rapidly and become an important way for humans to obtain seafood however aquaculture in fish cages near the coast has caused environmental pollution due to its high density which has led to a decline in seafood quality compared with the adverse impacts of nearshore aquaculture offshore fisheries have a smaller impact on the environment which are beneficial to the restoration and protection of the offshore ecological environment and help to achieve the sustainable use of key coastal biological resources thus aquaculture has begun to shift from nearshore to deep sea to further obtain more sea space and to improve water quality in practical engineering different types of offshore fish farming chu et al 2020 have been designed and applied in 2017 as a representative of deep sea aquaculture the world s first offshore fish farm ocean farm 1 was developed in norway and built in china it is mainly built of steel with a volume of 250 000 m3 a diameter of 110 m and a height of 69 m the fish farm is able to accommodate 1 5 million salmon is intended for offshore installation in water at depths of 100 300 m with a 25 year lifespan and may represent the first step towards a new era in aquaculture in addition combined with the development experience of norway s ocean farm 1 and the technology of salmon farming in the yellow sea china s unique salmon aquaculture facilities shenlan1 and shenlan 2 were built and developed for salmon farming approximately 130 nautical miles off the shore of rizhao shandong province east china shenlan 1 is able to culture 300 000 salmon and has a diameter of 60 m and height of 35 m shenlan 2 is in the planning stage it will have a 60 m diameter and a height of 80 m and will be able to accommodate approximately 1 million salmon compared with the traditional net cage the semisubmersible aquaculture facility has many obvious advantages including a larger aquaculture space and resistance to severe wind wave and current loads thus the hydrodynamic behavior of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility has become a very important subject of investigation many numerical and experimental studies on the hydrodynamic responses of fish cages have been conducted tsukrov et al 2003 developed a consistent finite element to analyze the wave and current loads on the netting and to evaluate the performance of a tension leg fish cage in the open ocean environment lee et al 2008 used a mathematical model to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of a fish farm with a floating collar in waves and currents based on the mass spring model the dynamic response of 5 by 2 floating fish farm collars was predicted through an extended 3d hydroelasticity theory by fu and moan 2012 xu et al 2011 2013 used the lumped mass method and the principle of rigid body kinematics to analyze a submersible net cage and mooring system in waves and irregular waves zhao et al 2013 analyzed the dynamic behavior of a box shaped net cage in pure waves and currents based on a physical model and numerical simulation kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2015 performed a series of model tests and numerical simulations to investigate the validity of different rational hydrodynamic load models li et al 2013a 2013b developed the buoyancy distribution method to address the instantaneous buoyancy on the floater in regular and irregular waves with the net and floater modeled by truss and beam elements respectively the responses of floating fish cages to waves and currents have been investigated su et al 2015 analyzed wave interactions with a porous and flexible cylindrical fish cage in which the bottom of the cylinder was simplified into rigid porous plates model tests of a floating fish cage were performed and the dynamic behavior of the fish cage in waves and current was studied by david 2015 bi et al 2015 adopted a porous media fluid model to study the wave attenuation inside and around a net cage in waves based on three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd the flexible cage system was modeled as a surface piercing porous flexible cylinder with a flexible porous membrane type bed further the efficiency of the cage system can be studied through analyzing the hydrodynamic force effect of structural porosity and deflections of the flexible walls and bed of the cage system which was conducted by mandal and sahoo 2016 a morison force model was proposed by cifuentes and kim 2017 and applied to the analysis of a cage under waves and currents shen et al 2018 proposed a realistic aquaculture net cage and used a numerical tool to study the dynamic response in irregular and regular waves and currents and to provide a reliable method to investigate the survival conditions of the system cha and lee 2018 conducted a series of tests to observe the performance of a net cage with a copper alloy net in a circulating water channel and wave tank the mooring line load and its pattern were measured and analyzed in different currents and waves huang et al 2018 established a numerical model to analyze the dynamic response of a floating net cage in waves and currents based on the finite element method and the calculated results were compared to those of li et al 2013b and were in good agreement in addition qu et al 2019 performed a series of model experiments to study the performance of different types of model square fish cages in uniform flow the shape deformation volume reduction and drag force were measured and analyzed although many traditional fish cages including gravity and box shaped net cages have been studied fewer numerical studies of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities have been completed zhao et al 2019 conducted a series of physical experiments to investigate the hydrodynamic response of a semisubmersible fish farm in waves and to analyze the mooring line tension and motion response in different wave heights wave periods and draughts liu et al 2019 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a submersible fish cage at various depths in waves and showed that the mooring line tension and the floating collar movement were significantly attenuated with increasing submergence depth the semisubmersible aquaculture facility is obviously different from the traditional fish cage which can have adjustments to its draught by pontoons and can avoid destruction when waves and winds are severe the objective of this study is to analyze the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility including mooring line tension and motion response based on a numerical simulation method and to provide reasonable and reliable suggestions for its practical engineering the present research is of purely scientific interest and has no commercial purpose the present paper is organized as follows a brief description of the numerical methods used to analyze semisubmersible aquaculture facilities is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the physical model test and verifies the numerical results in section 4 the hydrodynamic response including mooring line tension and motion response is analyzed and discussed for different wavelengths wave steepnesses and draughts finally some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 numerical methods based on the boundary element method and the morison equation the numerical model was established and applied to predict the hydrodynamic response including the mooring line tension and motion response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility exposed to regular waves the potential flow theory and second order stokes wave theory were considered and applied to the numerical calculation 2 1 environmental loading the semisubmersible aquaculture facility includes two kinds of structures in this numerical model one is a small scale member structure and the other is a large scale panel structure for the small scale member structure the wave loads are simplified to the drag force and inertial force acting on the structure based on the morison equation in addition the diffraction theory is applied to the large scale panel structure based on the boundary element method of potential flow theory by combining these two different scale structures including the small scale member structure and the large scale panel structure the hydrodynamic responses of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities can be simulated and analyzed this method avoids the huge amount of calculations by using only a unified surface element and inaccuracy of the calculation results is caused only by using the morison element fig 1 shows the meshing of the numerical model including the face element and the morison element the wave force of a small scale member structure can be calculated using the morison equation fig 2 shows the wave loads acting on the small scale member structure the morison equation zhang et al 2017 ghafari and dardel 2018 for the fluid forces acting on the cross section of a slender structural member can be obtained by 1 f 1 2 ρ d c d u f u s u f u s ρ c m u f ρ a c m 1 u s 1 2 ρ d c d u f u s u f u s ρ a 1 c a u f ρ a c a u s where f is the fluid force per unit length ρ is the water density c d is the drag coefficient d is the characteristic drag diameter u f and u s are the fluid particle velocity and structure velocity respectively u f and u s are the fluid particle acceleration and structure acceleration respectively c m c a 1 is the inertia coefficient and a is the cross sectional area for the large scale components the diffraction theory will be adopted the total wave force acting on the structure consists of three parts including the incident wave force diffraction wave force and radiation wave force as shown in fig 3 the total velocity potential φ and its governing equations zhang et al 2017 ghafari and dardel 2018 can be described as follows 2 φ φ i φ d φ r 3 φ x 0 d z 0 4 φ z ω 2 g φ 0 z d 5 φ n s i ω ξ n o n s t r u c t u r e 6 φ z 0 z 0 7 l i m r r φ s r i k φ 0 r where φ is the total velocity potential φ i is the incident potential φ d is the diffraction potential φ r is the radiation potential ω is the wave frequency g is the acceleration of gravity and k is the wavenumber 2 2 numerical model the numerical model of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility consists of four parts including the primary frame net weight and mooring system as shown in fig 4 to ensure the accuracy of the calculations and avoid the huge computational resources required for computational fluid dynamics cfd the numerical model adopts a new method that combines the boundary element method based on the potential flow theory and the morison equation to simulate the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility in pure waves the pontoons and thick columns are simulated by surface elements the nets and thin columns are simulated by the morison element to simplify the model and improve the calculation efficiency the net of the experimental model is equal to that of the numerical model based on the mesh grouping method in addition the motion equations of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility can be described as follows 8 ω e 2 m s m a i ω e c k h y s x j m f j m where m s is a structural mass matrix m a and c are the hydrodynamic added mass and the damping matrices including the hydrodynamic interaction coupling terms between the different structures respectively k h y s is the assembled hydrostatic stiffness matrix of each diagonal 6 6 hydrostatic stiffness submatrix all off diagonal 6 6 submatrices are null as there is no hydrostatic interaction among the different structures and f j m is the exciting force 3 physical model and validation to verify the rationality of the numerical model a series of physical model experiments were performed in a wave current flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian china the specific parameters of the physical model are described in zhao et al 2019 the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility including mooring line tension and motion response were selected for comparison to validate the calculated results 3 1 physical model in general the designed model of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities should meet the rules of geometric kinematic and dynamic similarity nevertheless it is difficult to achieve the same similarity for each part of the fish farm therefore different similarity criteria were adopted for each part of the fish farm system to reduce the influence of the scale effect on the structure in the experiment geometric similarity and gravity similarity were applied to the frame system the net system was designed using the mesh grouping method based on li et al 2005 to reach the different draughts the weight system can be adjusted by injecting water into the pontoon and hanging weights at the bottom of column in addition the rule of elastic similarity was primarily considered and applied to the mooring line to guarantee the stability and normal working of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility fig 5 shows the physical model in the wave current flume in the experiment four anchor forms were adopted for the fish farm the length of the mooring line is 3 0 m including 2 9 m of polyethylene rope and a 0 1 m stainless spring the force of the mooring line can be measured by the water resistant load cells which have a capacity of 10 n and the motion response can be obtained by a charge coupled device camera to collect accurate data the experimental data were measured three times and the average value was obtained to reduce errors and improve accuracy the mooring line tension in pure waves was calculated as follows 9 f w f t f p where f w is the average of the peak values for mooring line tension in pure waves f t is the total average of the peak values of mooring line tension and f p is the pretension of the mooring line the hydrodynamic responses of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities can be obtained by physical model experiments in waves the specific layout form of the physical model is shown in fig 6 two draughts were designed in this experiment 28 cm and 36 cm the wave height was 0 10 m and the wave periods were 1 2 s 1 4 s 1 6 s and 1 8 s which were designed and applied to verify the calculated results in addition the designed water depth was 1 0 m 3 2 experimental validation the numerical model was divided into many morison elements and surface elements to calculate the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility based on the discrete method to verify the rationality of the numerical simulation the experimental results were compared with the calculated values taking a draught of 36 cm as an example fig 7 shows the wave elevation with a wave height of 10 cm and a wave period of 1 8 s fig 7 shows that the average peak value of the wave elevation is 5 1 cm and that the average of the valley value is 4 9 cm thus the wave height is 10 cm which is consistent with the designed value in addition taking a draught of 36 cm as an example the numerical simulation results of the hydrodynamic response including the mooring line tension heave motion and pitch motion are compared with the test values from three aspects the force displacement and rotation angle as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 the maximum relative errors of the mooring line tension heave motion and pitch motion are 17 2 8 4 and 16 94 respectively for the num 1 however when the thick columns also are modeled by morison element num 2 there are the maximum difference of 19 01 for the mooring line tension 30 31 for heave motion and 41 31 for the pitch motion from the experimental values it can be observed from the above calculation results that there is a relatively large error between the experimental value and the value of num 2 considering the influence of the thick columns and pontoons on the wave propagation the numerical method num 1 which combines the boundary element method based on the potential flow theory with the morison equation can be adopted in the paper and working to ensure that the error was within a reasonable range the error between the simulated and experimental values occurs because the net was simulated by the member element based on the morison equation and thus the influence on the wave field cannot be considered the wave fields inside and behind the fish cage can be affected by the net and the thin column respectively in addition the numerical model was established in this study based on the potential flow theory ignoring the influence of viscosity on the pontoon and the thick column the numerical simulation conditions are difficult to render completely consistent with the actual conditions and there are small differences between the physical and numerical models based on the above analysis the numerical model num 1 will be applied to analyze the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility in pure waves 4 results and discussion in the open sea the aquaculture facility is easily subjected to severe wind waves and currents thus studying the stability of the aquaculture facility and the strength of the mooring line under this extreme environmental load is crucial one approach would be to improve the strength of the structure by choosing better steel and increasing the amount of steel used however this is not economical next we will analyze the hydrodynamic response using the numerical method and provide some reasonable suggestions for practical engineering optimization of the structure the hydrodynamic response of the aquaculture facility including the mooring line tension and motion response can be analyzed in different wavelengths wave steepness and draughts the wave is propagated along the x axis 4 1 influence of wave steepness and wavelength the mooring line tension and motion response were analyzed with different wave steepnesses and wavelengths the details of the wave cases are described in table 1 the wave steepness can be expressed as ε k a 2 π a l where ε is the wave steepness k is the wavenumber a is the wave amplitude and l is the wavelength the analyzed draughts of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility are 28 cm and 36 cm the maximum force on the mooring line and the motion response including surge motion heave motion and pitch motion are also presented fig 9 shows the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility including the mooring line tension and motion response with different wave steepnesses and wavelengths the mooring line tension increases as the wavelength increases and a positive correlation is observed between the motion response and the wavelength when the wave steepness is small the surge motion tends to gradually stabilize as the wavelength increases however as the wave steepness increases this phenomenon gradually becomes less obvious in addition the wave steepness also has a strong influence on the aquaculture facility as the wave steepness increases the mooring line tension and motion response also increase when the wavelength is 2 0 m the wave steepness has little effect on the hydrodynamic response of the aquaculture facility as the wavelength increases the effect of wave steepness gradually increases reaching its maximum at a wavelength of 3 5 m the above hydrodynamic response the increase with increasing wave steepness and wavelength can be explained as follows first considering a wave steepness of 0 2 as an example as shown in fig 10 the wave elevation can be obtained for different wavelengths including 2 0 m 2 5 m 3 0 m and 3 5 m when the wave steepness is a fixed value the wavelength and wave height will increase or decrease simultaneously which can be observed from the equation ε k a 2 π a l based on wave theory the area of the wave loads acting on the aquaculture facility and the water particle velocity will increase with increasing wavelength therefore the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility will increase as the wavelength increases second the impact of wave steepness is also significant for the hydrodynamic response when the wavelength is constant an increase in wave steepness will cause an increase in wave height which can be calculated using the equation ε k a 2 π a l considering a wavelength of 2 0 m as an example as shown in fig 11 the wave elevation for a wave steepness of 0 20 is higher than that for wave steepnesses of 0 15 and 0 10 and thus the effect of a wave with a wave steepness of 0 2 is greater than that of the other two wave steepnesses therefore as the wave steepness increases the hydrodynamic responses of the semisubmersible aquaculture facilities will increase in addition the increasing amplitude of the hydrodynamic response for wavelengths between 2 0 m and 3 5 m can be calculated as follows 10 ai a3 5 a2 0 where ai is the increasing amplitude of the hydrodynamic response a3 5 is the motion response corresponding to a 3 5 m wavelength and a2 0 is the motion response corresponding to a 2 0 m wavelength fig 12 shows a comparison of the increasing amplitude of the heave motion and surge motion and illustrates that the value of ai increases with the wave steepness for different draughts however the difference between the increasing amplitudes of the heave motion and surge motion reverses with increasing wave steepness although the surge motion is greater than the heave motion as can be observed in fig 9 ai of the heave motion is greater than that of the surge motion when the wave steepness is 0 10 or 0 15 nevertheless when the wave steepness is 0 20 ai of the heave motion is less than that of the surge motion as the wave steepness increases the influence of the wave steepness on surge gradually increases in addition the maximum difference is 2 9 cm with a prototype value of 3 48 m draught of 36 cm and wave steepness of 0 1 the minimum difference is 1 5 cm with a prototype value of 1 8 m draught of 28 cm and wave steepness of 0 2 4 2 influence of draught in practical engineering draught is an important factor that affects the hydrodynamic response of aquaculture facilities it is essential for a semisubmersible aquaculture facility to operate normally and resist environmental loads in different draughts therefore the mooring line tension and motion response were calculated and compared between draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm the initial tension was not included in the time history of the mooring line tension for example with a steepness of 0 2 the time histories of the hydrodynamic responses to draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm with a wave height of 0 159 m and a wave period of 1 273 s can be described fig 13 and fig 14 show comparisons of the time histories of the mooring line tension and motion response respectively including the surge heave and pitch motions fig 13 shows that the mooring line tension of the aquaculture facility for a draught of 28 cm is greater than that for a draught of 36 cm the difference in the mooring line tension between draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm is 6 95 similarly as the draught increases the motion response including the surge motion heave motion and pitch motion decreases the surge heave and pitch motions shown in fig 14 decrease by 15 9 19 0 and 3 26 respectively in addition the increasing percentage difference in the hydrodynamic response of a draught of 28 cm compared to a draught of 36 cm is shown in fig 15 the hydrodynamic response of the 28 cm draught is greater than that of the 36 cm draught for different wavelengths and wave steepnesses the maximum difference between the 28 cm and 36 cm draughts reached 73 16 in heave motion when the steepness was 0 10 as shown in fig 15 the increase in draught has a smaller effect on the pitch motion compared to the other hydrodynamic responses and the maximum difference is only 10 however the draught has a strong influence on the mooring line tension surge motion and heave motion the maximum gap between draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm is 57 for mooring line tension 33 96 for surge motion and 73 16 for heave motion as wave steepness increases the percentage difference in the mooring line tension between the two draughts decreases however the influence of wave steepness on the motion response is not obvious in addition there is no obvious change rule for the increasing percentage difference in the hydrodynamic responses caused by wavelength the hydrodynamic response including the mooring line tension and motion response gradually weakened as the draught increased the difference in the hydrodynamic response caused by the different draughts is mainly reflected in two aspects the area of wave loads acting on the structure and the water particle velocity which deserve further study and analysis in general when the aquaculture facility is in a semisubmersible state and not completely submerged the hydrodynamic response will increase as the draught increases because the projected area on the structure increases causing the wave loads on the structure to increase however in this study the upper and lower parts of the structure of the aquaculture facility are not symmetrical the pontoons at the bottom of the structure occupy a large projection area although the projected area increases as the draught increases the water particle velocity and the influence of waves decrease around the pontoon causing the force on the bottom of the aquaculture facility to decrease especially for the pontoon as shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows the trajectories of water particle motion for different water depths therefore the complexity of the wave structure interactions leads to decreases in the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility for different draughts 4 3 discussion of different influencing factors the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility to different wavelengths wave steepnesses and draughts has been analyzed however the strength of the hydrodynamic behavior due to different factors should be further studied it is impossible to simultaneously analyze the influence of every factor on the hydrodynamic response thus it is crucial to determine the most important factor from among the many influencing factors and to take corresponding measures to optimize and manage aquaculture facilities next these factors including the wave parameters and draught are analyzed and discussed fig 17 and fig 18 show the increase in the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength and per unit wave steepness including mooring line tension surge motion heave motion and pitch motion for draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm respectively fig 19 shows the increase in the hydrodynamic response per unit draught including mooring line tension surge motion heave motion and pitch motion for different wave steepnesses as the wave steepness and wavelength increase the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength and wave steepness increase as shown in figs 17 and 18 however no obvious correlation exists between the increases in the hydrodynamic response per unit draught and wave steepness as shown in fig 19 in addition the increasing ranges of the average values of the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength wave steepness and draught are 4 to 8 30 to 60 and 7 to 15 respectively the influence of wave steepness is far greater than that of wavelength and draught with an order of magnitude difference between wave steepness and wavelength the comparison of these three factors wavelength wave steepness and draught leads to the conclusion that the influence of wave steepness is the greatest followed by draught and wavelength the phenomena caused by these factors can be explained as follows first increases in wavelength and wave steepness can cause increases in wave height and wave elevation as shown in figs 10 and 11 however when the wavelength and wave steepness each increase by 0 1 the amplitude of the wave elevation increase is different as shown in fig 20 the enclosed area of wave elevation a1 is smaller than that of a2 therefore the wave energy action on the aquaculture facility for a2 is greater than that for a1 in addition based on wave theory an increase in wave elevation leads to increases in the area of the wave loads acting on the structure and the water particle velocity thus the hydrodynamic response caused by wave steepness is greater than that caused by wavelength second within a certain range a decrease in the draught of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities can lead to an increase in the hydrodynamic response although the rise of the aquaculture facility will result in a reduction in the projected area the influence of the waves around the pontoon will increase when the wave steepness is a fixed value an increase in wavelength will cause an increase in wave height therefore the wave action on the structure will become greater however compared to draught the influence of wavelength is relatively small because the asymmetry of the upper and lower parts of the aquaculture facility leads to the complexity of its hydrodynamic characteristics this phenomenon is worthy of further study and analysis 5 conclusions in the present study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semisubmersible aquaculture facility were studied based on a numerical method in pure waves the mooring line tension and motion response were calculated and verified by the experimental data a series of conclusions can be drawn as follows the mooring line tension and motion response including surge motion heave motion and pitch motion are positively correlated with wavelength however when the wave steepness is small the surge motion tends to gradually stabilize as the wavelength increases in addition the wave steepness has a significant influence on the mooring line tension and motion response as the wave steepness increases the mooring line tension and motion response increase the draught has a certain effect on the hydrodynamic response of aquaculture facility as the draught increases the mooring line tension and motion response decrease the maximum influences reached are 57 for mooring line tension and 73 16 for the motion response this phenomenon is beneficial to the stability of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility and helps avoid large motion of the aquaculture facility in severe waves through increasing the draught in addition three influencing factors wavelength wave steepness and draught were analyzed quantitatively the increasing ranges of the average values of the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength wave steepness and draught are 4 to 8 30 to 60 and 7 to 15 respectively therefore the influence of wave steepness on the hydrodynamic response of this semisubmersible aquaculture facility is the greatest the influence of draught is relatively weak and the influence of wavelength is the weakest credit authorship contribution statement hang fei liu conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft writing review editing chun wei bi

facility to avoid damage due to severe waves is through properly increasing draught keywords aquaculture facility mooring line tension motion response boundary element method 1 introduction in recent decades the marine aquaculture industry has developed rapidly and become an important way for humans to obtain seafood however aquaculture in fish cages near the coast has caused environmental pollution due to its high density which has led to a decline in seafood quality compared with the adverse impacts of nearshore aquaculture offshore fisheries have a smaller impact on the environment which are beneficial to the restoration and protection of the offshore ecological environment and help to achieve the sustainable use of key coastal biological resources thus aquaculture has begun to shift from nearshore to deep sea to further obtain more sea space and to improve water quality in practical engineering different types of offshore fish farming chu et al 2020 have been designed and applied in 2017 as a representative of deep sea aquaculture the world s first offshore fish farm ocean farm 1 was developed in norway and built in china it is mainly built of steel with a volume of 250 000 m3 a diameter of 110 m and a height of 69 m the fish farm is able to accommodate 1 5 million salmon is intended for offshore installation in water at depths of 100 300 m with a 25 year lifespan and may represent the first step towards a new era in aquaculture in addition combined with the development experience of norway s ocean farm 1 and the technology of salmon farming in the yellow sea china s unique salmon aquaculture facilities shenlan1 and shenlan 2 were built and developed for salmon farming approximately 130 nautical miles off the shore of rizhao shandong province east china shenlan 1 is able to culture 300 000 salmon and has a diameter of 60 m and height of 35 m shenlan 2 is in the planning stage it will have a 60 m diameter and a height of 80 m and will be able to accommodate approximately 1 million salmon compared with the traditional net cage the semisubmersible aquaculture facility has many obvious advantages including a larger aquaculture space and resistance to severe wind wave and current loads thus the hydrodynamic behavior of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility has become a very important subject of investigation many numerical and experimental studies on the hydrodynamic responses of fish cages have been conducted tsukrov et al 2003 developed a consistent finite element to analyze the wave and current loads on the netting and to evaluate the performance of a tension leg fish cage in the open ocean environment lee et al 2008 used a mathematical model to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of a fish farm with a floating

su et al 2015 analyzed wave interactions with a porous and flexible cylindrical fish cage in which the bottom of the cylinder was simplified into rigid porous plates model tests of a floating fish cage were performed and the dynamic behavior of the fish cage in waves and current was studied by david 2015 bi et al 2015 adopted a porous media fluid model to study the wave attenuation inside and around a net cage in waves based on three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd the flexible cage system was modeled as a surface piercing porous flexible cylinder with a flexible porous membrane type bed further the efficiency of the cage system can be studied through analyzing the hydrodynamic force effect of structural porosity and deflections of the flexible walls and bed of the

survival conditions of the system cha and lee 2018 conducted a series of tests to observe the performance of a net cage with a copper alloy net in a circulating water channel and wave tank the mooring line load and its pattern were measured and analyzed in different currents and waves huang et al 2018 established a numerical model to analyze the dynamic response of a floating net cage in waves and currents based on the finite element method and the calculated results were compared to those of li et al 2013b and were in good agreement in addition qu et al 2019 performed a series of model experiments to study the performance of different types of model square fish cages in uniform flow the shape deformation volume reduction and drag force were measured and analyzed although many traditional fish cages including gravity and box shaped net cages have been studied fewer numerical studies of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities have been completed zhao et al 2019 conducted a series of physical experiments to investigate the hydrodynamic response of a semisubmersible fish farm in waves and to analyze the mooring line tension and motion response in different wave heights wave periods and draughts liu et al 2019 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a submersible fish cage at various depths in waves and showed that the mooring line tension and the floating collar movement were significantly attenuated with increasing submergence depth the semisubmersible aquaculture facility is obviously different from the traditional fish cage which can have adjustments to its draught by pontoons and can avoid destruction when waves and winds are severe the objective of this study is to analyze the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility including mooring line tension and motion response based on a numerical simulation method and to provide reasonable and reliable suggestions for its practical engineering the present research

facility exposed to regular waves the potential flow theory and second order stokes wave theory were considered and applied to the numerical calculation 2 1 environmental loading the semisubmersible aquaculture facility includes two kinds of structures in this numerical model one is a small scale member structure and the other is a large scale panel structure for the small scale member structure the wave loads are simplified to the drag force and inertial force acting on the structure based on the morison equation in addition the diffraction theory is applied to the large scale panel structure based on the boundary element method of potential flow theory by combining these two different scale structures including the small scale member structure and the large scale panel structure the hydrodynamic responses of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities can be simulated and analyzed this method avoids the huge amount of calculations by using only a unified surface element and

large scale components the diffraction theory will be adopted the total wave force acting on the structure consists of three parts including the incident wave force diffraction wave force and radiation wave force as shown in fig 3 the total velocity potential φ and its governing equations zhang et al 2017 ghafari and dardel 2018 can be described as follows 2 φ φ i φ d φ r 3 φ x 0 d z 0 4 φ

is the radiation potential ω is the wave frequency g is the acceleration of gravity and k is the wavenumber 2 2 numerical model the numerical model of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility consists of four parts including the primary frame net weight and mooring system as shown in fig 4 to ensure the accuracy of the calculations and avoid the huge computational resources required for computational fluid dynamics cfd the numerical model adopts a new method that combines the boundary element method based on the potential flow theory and the morison equation to simulate the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility in pure waves the pontoons and thick columns are simulated by surface elements the nets and thin columns are simulated by the morison element to simplify the model and improve the calculation efficiency the net of the experimental model is equal to that of the numerical model based on the mesh grouping method in addition the motion equations of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility can be described as follows 8 ω e 2 m s m a i ω e c k h y s x j m f j m where m s is a structural mass matrix m a and c are the hydrodynamic added mass and the damping matrices including the hydrodynamic interaction coupling terms between the different structures respectively k h y s is the assembled hydrostatic stiffness matrix of each diagonal 6 6 hydrostatic stiffness submatrix all off diagonal 6 6 submatrices are null as there is no hydrostatic interaction among the different structures and f j m is the exciting force 3 physical model and validation to verify the rationality of the numerical model a series of physical model experiments were performed in a wave current flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian china the specific parameters of the physical model are described in zhao et al 2019 the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility including mooring line tension and motion response were selected for comparison to validate the calculated results 3 1 physical model in general the designed model of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities should meet the rules of geometric kinematic and dynamic similarity nevertheless it is difficult to achieve the same similarity for each part of the fish farm therefore different similarity criteria were adopted for each part of the fish farm system to reduce the influence of the scale effect on the structure in the experiment geometric similarity and gravity similarity were applied to the frame system the net system was designed using the mesh grouping method based on li et al 2005 to reach the different draughts the weight system can be adjusted by injecting water into the pontoon and hanging weights at the bottom of column in addition the rule of elastic similarity was primarily considered and applied to the mooring line to guarantee the stability and normal working of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility fig 5 shows the physical model in the wave current flume in the experiment four anchor forms were adopted for the fish farm the length of the mooring line is 3 0 m including 2 9 m of polyethylene rope and a 0 1 m stainless spring the force of the mooring line can be measured by the water resistant load cells which have a capacity of 10 n and the motion response can be obtained by a charge coupled device camera to collect accurate data the experimental data were measured three times and the average value was obtained to reduce errors and improve accuracy the mooring line tension in pure waves was calculated as follows 9 f w f t f p where f w is the average of the peak values for mooring line tension in pure waves f t is the total average of the peak values of mooring line tension and f p is the pretension of the mooring line the hydrodynamic responses of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities can be obtained by physical model experiments in waves the specific layout form of the physical model is shown in fig 6 two draughts were designed in this experiment 28 cm and 36 cm the wave height was 0 10 m and the wave periods were 1 2 s 1 4 s 1 6 s and 1 8 s which were designed and applied to verify the calculated results in addition the designed water depth was 1 0 m 3 2 experimental validation the numerical model was divided into many morison elements and surface elements to calculate the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility based on the discrete method to verify the rationality of the numerical simulation the experimental results were compared with the calculated values taking a draught of 36 cm as an example fig 7 shows the wave elevation with a wave height of 10 cm and a wave period of 1 8 s fig 7 shows that the average peak value of the wave elevation is 5 1 cm and that the average of the valley value is 4 9 cm thus the wave height is 10 cm which is consistent with the designed value in addition taking a draught of 36 cm as an example the numerical simulation results of the hydrodynamic response including the mooring line tension heave motion and pitch motion are compared with the test values from three aspects the force displacement and rotation angle as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 the maximum relative errors of the mooring line tension heave motion and pitch motion are 17 2 8 4 and 16 94 respectively for the num 1 however when the thick columns also are modeled by morison element num 2 there are the maximum difference of 19 01 for the mooring line tension 30 31 for heave motion and 41 31 for the pitch motion from the experimental values it can be observed from the above calculation results that there is a relatively large error between the experimental value and the value of num 2 considering the influence of the thick columns and pontoons on the wave propagation the numerical method num 1 which combines the boundary element method based on the potential flow theory with the morison equation can be adopted in the paper and working to ensure that the error was within a reasonable range the error between the simulated and experimental values occurs because the net was simulated by the member element based on the morison equation and thus the influence on the wave field cannot be considered the wave fields inside and behind the fish cage can be affected by the net and the thin column respectively in addition the numerical model was established in this study based on the potential flow theory ignoring the influence of viscosity on the pontoon and the thick column the numerical simulation conditions are difficult to render completely consistent with the actual conditions and there are small differences between the physical and numerical models based on the above analysis the numerical model num 1 will be applied to analyze the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility in pure waves 4 results and discussion in the open sea the aquaculture facility is easily subjected to severe wind waves and currents thus studying the stability of the aquaculture facility and the strength of the mooring line under this extreme environmental load is crucial one approach would be to improve the strength of the structure by choosing better steel and increasing the amount of steel used however this is not economical next we will analyze the hydrodynamic response using the numerical method and provide some reasonable suggestions for practical engineering optimization of the structure the hydrodynamic response of the aquaculture facility including the mooring line tension and motion response can be analyzed in different wavelengths wave steepness and draughts the wave is propagated along the x axis 4 1 influence of wave steepness and wavelength the mooring line tension and motion response were analyzed with different wave steepnesses and wavelengths the details of the wave cases are described in table 1 the wave steepness can be expressed as ε k a 2 π a l where ε is the wave steepness k is the wavenumber a is the wave amplitude and l is the wavelength the analyzed draughts of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility are 28 cm and 36 cm the maximum force on the mooring line and the motion response including surge motion heave motion and pitch motion are also presented fig 9 shows the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility including the mooring line tension and motion response with different wave steepnesses and wavelengths the mooring line tension increases as the wavelength increases and a positive correlation is observed between the motion response and the wavelength when the wave steepness is small the surge motion tends to gradually stabilize as the wavelength increases however as the wave steepness increases this phenomenon gradually becomes less obvious in addition the wave steepness also has a strong influence on the aquaculture facility as the wave steepness increases the mooring line tension and motion response also increase when the wavelength is 2 0 m the wave steepness has little effect on the hydrodynamic response of the aquaculture facility as the wavelength increases the effect of wave steepness gradually increases reaching its maximum at a wavelength of 3 5 m the above hydrodynamic response the increase with increasing wave steepness and wavelength can be explained as follows first considering a wave steepness of 0 2 as an example as shown in fig 10 the wave elevation can be obtained for different wavelengths including 2 0 m 2 5 m 3 0 m and 3 5 m when the wave steepness is a fixed value the wavelength and wave height will increase or decrease simultaneously which can be observed from the equation ε k a 2 π a l based on wave theory the area of the wave loads acting on the aquaculture facility and the water particle velocity will increase with increasing wavelength therefore the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility will increase as the wavelength increases second the impact of wave steepness is also significant for the hydrodynamic response when the wavelength is constant an increase in wave steepness will cause an increase in wave height which can be calculated using the equation ε k a 2 π a l considering a wavelength of 2 0 m as an example as shown in fig 11 the wave elevation for a wave steepness of 0 20 is higher than that for wave steepnesses of 0 15 and 0 10 and thus the effect of a wave with a wave steepness of 0 2 is greater than that of the other two wave steepnesses therefore as the wave steepness increases the hydrodynamic responses of the semisubmersible aquaculture facilities will increase in addition the increasing amplitude of the hydrodynamic response for wavelengths between 2 0 m and 3 5 m can be calculated as follows 10 ai a3 5 a2 0 where ai is the increasing amplitude of the hydrodynamic response a3 5 is the motion response corresponding to a 3 5 m wavelength and a2 0 is the motion response corresponding to a 2 0 m wavelength fig 12 shows a comparison of the increasing amplitude of the heave motion and surge motion and illustrates that the value of ai increases with the wave steepness for different draughts however the difference between the increasing amplitudes of the heave motion and surge motion reverses with increasing wave steepness although the surge motion is greater than the heave motion as can be observed in fig 9 ai of the heave motion is greater than that of the surge motion when the wave steepness is 0 10 or 0 15 nevertheless when the wave steepness is 0 20 ai of the heave motion is less than that of the surge motion as the wave steepness increases the influence of the wave steepness on surge gradually increases in addition the maximum difference is 2 9 cm with a prototype value of 3 48 m draught of 36 cm and wave steepness of 0 1 the minimum difference is 1 5 cm with a prototype value of 1 8 m draught of 28 cm and wave steepness of 0 2 4 2 influence of draught in practical engineering draught is an important factor that affects the hydrodynamic response of aquaculture facilities it is essential for a semisubmersible aquaculture facility to operate normally and resist environmental loads in different draughts therefore the mooring line tension and motion response were calculated and compared between draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm the initial tension was not included in the time history of the mooring line tension for example with a steepness of 0 2 the time histories of the hydrodynamic responses to draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm with a wave height of 0 159 m and a wave period of 1 273 s can be described fig 13 and fig 14 show comparisons of the time histories of the mooring line tension and motion response respectively including the surge heave and pitch motions fig 13 shows that the mooring line tension of the aquaculture facility for a draught of 28 cm is greater than that for a draught of 36 cm the difference in the mooring line tension between draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm is 6 95 similarly as the draught increases the motion response including the surge motion heave motion and pitch motion decreases the surge heave and pitch motions shown in fig 14 decrease by 15 9 19 0 and 3 26 respectively in addition the increasing percentage difference in the hydrodynamic response of a draught of 28 cm compared to a draught of 36 cm is shown in fig 15 the hydrodynamic response of the 28 cm draught is greater than that of the 36 cm draught for different wavelengths and wave steepnesses the maximum difference between the 28 cm and 36 cm draughts reached 73 16 in heave motion when the steepness was 0 10 as shown in fig 15 the increase in draught has a smaller effect on the pitch motion compared to the other hydrodynamic responses and the maximum difference is only 10 however the draught has a strong influence on the mooring line tension surge motion and heave motion the maximum gap between draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm is 57 for mooring line tension 33 96 for surge motion and 73 16 for heave motion as wave steepness increases the percentage difference in the mooring line tension between the two draughts decreases however the influence of wave steepness on the motion response is not obvious in addition there is no obvious change rule for the increasing percentage difference in the hydrodynamic responses caused by wavelength the hydrodynamic response including the mooring line tension and motion response gradually weakened as the draught increased the difference in the hydrodynamic response caused by the different draughts is mainly reflected in two aspects the area of wave loads acting on the structure and the water particle velocity which deserve further study and analysis in general when the aquaculture facility is in a semisubmersible state and not completely submerged the hydrodynamic response will increase as the draught increases because the projected area on the structure increases causing the wave loads on the structure to increase however in this study the upper and lower parts of the structure of the aquaculture facility are not symmetrical the pontoons at the bottom of the structure occupy a large projection area although the projected area increases as the draught increases the water particle velocity and the influence of waves decrease around the pontoon causing the force on the bottom of the aquaculture facility to decrease especially for the pontoon as shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows the trajectories of water particle motion for different water depths therefore the complexity of the wave structure interactions leads to decreases in the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility for different draughts 4 3 discussion of different influencing factors the hydrodynamic response of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility to different wavelengths wave steepnesses and draughts has been analyzed however the strength of the hydrodynamic behavior due to different factors should be further studied it is impossible to simultaneously analyze the influence of every factor on the hydrodynamic response thus it is crucial to determine the most important factor from among the many influencing factors and to take corresponding measures to optimize and manage aquaculture facilities next these factors including the wave parameters and draught are analyzed and discussed fig 17 and fig 18 show the increase in the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength and per unit wave steepness including mooring line tension surge motion heave motion and pitch motion for draughts of 28 cm and 36 cm respectively fig 19 shows the increase in the hydrodynamic response per unit draught including mooring line tension surge motion heave motion and pitch motion for different wave steepnesses as the wave steepness and wavelength increase the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength and wave steepness increase as shown in figs 17 and 18 however no obvious correlation exists between the increases in the hydrodynamic response per unit draught and wave steepness as shown in fig 19 in addition the increasing ranges of the average values of the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength wave steepness and draught are 4 to 8 30 to 60 and 7 to 15 respectively the influence of wave steepness is far greater than that of wavelength and draught with an order of magnitude difference between wave steepness and wavelength the comparison of these three factors wavelength wave steepness and draught leads to the conclusion that the influence of wave steepness is the greatest followed by draught and wavelength the phenomena caused by these factors can be explained as follows first increases in wavelength and wave steepness can cause increases in wave height and wave elevation as shown in figs 10 and 11 however when the wavelength and wave steepness each increase by 0 1 the amplitude of the wave elevation increase is different as shown in fig 20 the enclosed area of wave elevation a1 is smaller than that of a2 therefore the wave energy action on the aquaculture facility for a2 is greater than that for a1 in addition based on wave theory an increase in wave elevation leads to increases in the area of the wave loads acting on the structure and the water particle velocity thus the hydrodynamic response caused by wave steepness is greater than that caused by wavelength second within a certain range a decrease in the draught of semisubmersible aquaculture facilities can lead to an increase in the hydrodynamic response although the rise of the aquaculture facility will result in a reduction in the projected area the influence of the waves around the pontoon will increase when the wave steepness is a fixed value an increase in wavelength will cause an increase in wave height therefore the wave action on the structure will become greater however compared to draught the influence of wavelength is relatively small because the asymmetry of the upper and lower parts of the aquaculture facility leads to the complexity of its hydrodynamic characteristics this phenomenon is worthy of further study and analysis 5 conclusions in the present study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semisubmersible aquaculture facility were studied based on a numerical method in pure waves the mooring line tension and motion response were calculated and verified by the experimental data a series of conclusions can be drawn as follows the mooring line tension and motion response including surge motion heave motion and pitch motion are positively correlated with wavelength however when the wave steepness is small the surge motion tends to gradually stabilize as the wavelength increases in addition the wave steepness has a significant influence on the mooring line tension and motion response as the wave steepness increases the mooring line tension and motion response increase the draught has a certain effect on the hydrodynamic response of aquaculture facility as the draught increases the mooring line tension and motion response decrease the maximum influences reached are 57 for mooring line tension and 73 16 for the motion response this phenomenon is beneficial to the stability of the semisubmersible aquaculture facility and helps avoid large motion of the aquaculture facility in severe waves through increasing the draught in addition three influencing factors wavelength wave steepness and draught were analyzed quantitatively the increasing ranges of the average values of the hydrodynamic response per unit wavelength wave steepness and draught are 4 to 8 30 to 60 and 7 to 15 respectively therefore the influence of wave steepness on the hydrodynamic response of this semisubmersible aquaculture facility is the greatest the influence of draught is relatively weak and the influence of wavelength is the weakest credit authorship contribution statement hang fei liu conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft writing review editing chun wei bi

21622,the very large floating structure vlfs deployed near seashore islands and reefs are always exposed to the extremely complex encountering waves traditional methods with homogeneous wave inputs are not applicable for the hydroelastic analysis of this type vlfs in this paper the authors carry out a numerical and experimental investigation on hydroelastic responses of an 8 module vlfs near a

8 module vlfs hydroelastic response complicated wave condition direct coupling analysis method experiment 1 introduction the rapid expansion of world population the exhausting of inland resources and the requirement for sustainable development of world economy have strengthened the efforts of mankind to increase the capability of resource exploitation and space utilization in the ocean very large floating structures vlfs are among those marine structures which have attracted long lasting attention in ocean utilization fig 1 great progresses have been made on conceptual design dynamic responses analysis mooring system anti motion device multi module connection technology model tests safety and reliability analysis of vlfs in the past few decades lee and newman 2000 ohmatsu 2000 watanabe et al 2004 ohkusu and namba 2004 wang and wang 2015 cheng et al 2016 wu et al 2017a b wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 japan launched a mega float project in 1995 this project investigated the major technical problems and the possibility for building a large floating airport sueok and sato 2000 later a 5 module vlfs with 1 000 m in length 60 m in width and 3 m in depth was constructed and deployed in tokyo bay meanwhile usa carried out the research project of mobile offshore base zueck et al 2000 aimed to provide a movable pre positioned floating naval base for cargos transferring from airplanes and container ships to the shore in the present century the project study on dynamic characteristics of vlfs had been carried out in shanghai jiao tong university from 2001 to 2005 wang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 and the project response and structure safety of vlfs in complicated environment had been completed by china ship scientific research center from 2013 to 2017 ding et al 2017 2019 2020 wu et al 2017a b shi et al 2018 for a vlfs the environmental conditions and the reasonable degree of load are the key factors to determine its safety therefore it is of great significance for the structural design and safety evaluation of vlfs to reasonably estimate the loads on floating structures in complex and changeable environments comparing to an ordinary ship lower rigidity due to larger dimension of a vlfs may easily make its natural frequencies drop down to the wave frequency region thus the hydroelastic effects should be considered in the assessment of wave responses and structural safety of a vlfs in the past several years extensive investigations have been carried out on the hydroelastic responses of vlfs in deep open seas and the hydroelastic methods range from two dimensional linear theory bishop and price 1979 three dimensional linear theory wu 1984 shin et al 2015 two dimensional nonlinear theory xia et al 2004 to three dimensional nonlinear theory tian and wu 2006 hu et al 2012 lee et al 2020 as well as different hybrid hydroelastic analysis methods belibassakis and athanassoulis 2005 kim et al 2013 karperaki et al 2016 wu et al 2016 ding et al 2017 wei et al 2018 young et al 2020 liu et al 2020 however if a vlfs is located in shallow water near seashore or island the complex seabed topography water depth as well as the inhomogeneous encounter waves will make significant influences on its dynamic responses the dynamic response analysis of vlfs will face following three problems 1 the existing 3d hydroelastic analysis method which is based on green s function of infinite or finite water depth is no longer applicable 2 not only its complex shape and multi module characteristics but also the hydroelastic effect coupled with the complex flow field should be taken into account 3 the object of experimental simulation involves with not only the coupling response of multi module floating body connecting device and complex mooring system but also the multi scale propagation of wave and current in complex marine geographic environment therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of complicated wave environments by introducing the wave model which can be combined with traditional 3d hydroelasticity theory to develop a new coupling model in this paper a direct coupling analysis method dcam of hydroelastic responses of floating structures in complicated wave environments was established in this model the 3d hydroelasticity theory of floating bodies was combined with the shallow water wave theory of boussinesq equation compared with the traditional hydroelasticity theories the introduction of wave model and applying the imaginary vertical closed boundary between inner and outer flow fields provided a new development direction for the hydroelastic response analysis of vlfs in the complicated environments it is therefore unnecessary to introduce assumptions such as slowly changing seabed topography constant water depth floating plate 2d seabed topography processing and additional diffraction terms the detailed theoretical derivation numerical solution method and the relevant calculation program thafts br three dimension hydroelastic analysis of floating and traveling structures boussinesq rankine which became one module of the commercial software thafts c s s r c 2011 were also completed the dcam and the calculation program were verified and validated by comparing with the model test results of an 8 module vlfs near a typical island the conclusions drawn from the results can provide information and guidance in the design optimization and safety assessment of structure and connectors of a multi module vlfs deployed near the coast island or coral reef 2 model description the main idea of dcam is to construct an imaginary vertical closed boundary from free surface to the seabed around the floating body the fluid domain is divided into outer and inner computational regions by the imaginary vertical closed boundary fig 2 in the outer region the boussinesq equation is used to simulate the wave propagation on the complex seabed on the other hand a potential flow solver with the rankine sources distributed over the whole boundaries of the inner region is adopted and the classical hydroelasticity theory is used to calculate the dynamic responses of the floating structure on the imaginary vertical closed boundary the continuity relations including the wave elevation and the vertical distribution of fluid velocity are used to connect the fluid motions between the outer and inner regions in a two way coupling manner the notations of all the boundaries of these two regions are shown in table 1 2 1 outer region boussinesq equation 2 1 1 basic equations fully nonlinear boussinesq equation proposed by wei et al 1995 is used to simulate wave propagation and deformation in the outer region the governing equations are as follows continuity of mass 1 η t h η v α z α 1 2 h η h v α 1 2 z α 2 1 6 h 2 h η η 2 v α 0 continuity of momentum 2 v α t v α v α g η z α 1 2 z α v α h v α t 1 2 z α 2 η 2 v α v α 1 2 h v α η v α 2 1 2 z α η v α h v α η 1 2 η v α t h v α t 0 where h represents the local water depth the variables for solving the equation are the wave elevation η η x y z t and the horizontal velocity v α u α v α at z z α 0 531 h the horizontal and vertical components of the water particle velocity are as follows 3 1 v v α z α z h v α 1 2 z α 2 z 2 v α 3 2 w h v α z v α the wave evolution problem is described in a two dimensional way by the equations the boundary conditions on the seabed s bto and free surface s fo of the outer region have to be satisfied respectively the boundary condition on s c will be defined in section 2 3 2 1 2 verification for the assumption of velocity distribution in the analysis of hydrodynamic loads acting on floating bodies special attention is paid to the vertical distribution of the water particle velocity therefore whether the horizontal velocity distribution given in the formula 3 is correct or not and whether its accuracy is enough to provide accurate flow field information for hydrodynamic analysis of floating bodies in the inner region are the key to the establishment of the direct coupling analysis method for the boussinesq equation the prediction ability of wave propagation and deformation has been verified by many results from different means such as model tests field measurements and analytic solutions rare literature can be found for the validation of eqs 3 1 a typical section of the terrain near an island was selected to carry out the related velocity distribution measurement experiments in the two dimensional flume of the state key laboratory of port and offshore engineering dalian university of technology in the model test several flow velocity sensors were arranged along the water depth at typical topographic change positions fig 3 and table 2 in order to obtain the horizontal velocity distributions the contrast results between model tests and boussinesq equation under different wave heights and periods are shown in figs 4 6 the results from cfd method based on ranse reynolds average navier stokes equation with rng renormalization group k ε turbulence model wu et al 2008 are also presented in the figs 4 6 for the further verification the 2d computational domain includes 35 m near shore area and 50 m extended slope for wave elimination structural mesh with 88 800 cells is applied for computation domain with at least 40 grids per wavelength it can be found that 1 the wave height makes great influence on the velocity of flow and the larger wave height always causes higher velocity but the effect of the wave period is relatively small 2 the difference between the experimental and numerical results near the wave surface and the bottom is slightly larger than that at the middle water layer measurement point especially for 3 and v5 which locate behind a steep slope and the wave breaking zone mainly due to the influence of complex seabed topography and the non linear deformation near wave surface therefore we should avoid building the coupling boundaries on such two kind of areas 3 generally speaking the numerical results are in good agreement with the model tests the velocity simulation results given by boussinesq equation have good accuracy which can provide accurate flow field information of the incoming wave around the imaginary vertical closed boundary for the direct coupling analysis method 2 2 inner region rankine source method and3d hydroelasticity theory to account for the effect of complex seabed profile on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in the inner region the time domain three dimensional hydroelasticity theory and the rankine source method are employed by introducing the principal coordinates p r t r 1 2 m the displacement u u v w of the vlfs is expressed as the aggregation of the principal modes u r u r v r w r r 1 2 m of the structure in vacuum 4 u r 1 m u r p r t for a zero speed floating structure the unsteady velocity potential φ x y z t can be decomposed into 5 φ x y z t

o n s f i the calculations of s i 1 r d s and s i n 1 r d s in the equation are very frequently used in the panel method which can be used to solve the boundary integral equations in order to obtain the results of these two integrals accurately and efficiently two strategies are generally adopted i e calculating the near field and the far field separately the determination of near and far field could depend on the distance between field point and source point the calculations of near field and far field are based on the accurate and approximate formulas independently however the panel method considers that the source strength at the center point of each panel represents the source strength of the whole panel which may lead to discontinuity of the strength between the cells there may be a jump between the source strength of one panel and the surrounding strength in this regard further improvements can be made such as using higher order panel method or using gauss integral method to make full use of the panel information the generalized hydroelastic equations of motion in time domain may be represented in terms of the principal coordinate vector p t in the matrix form 12 a a p t

solutions to the flow fields of inner and outer regions are given in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively how to solve the internal and external flow field jointly is the core issue of this section the matching conditions on the imaginary vertical closed boundary s c are as follows for incident wave potential φ 0 the outer region solutions of eqs 1 and 2 provide η c v α c on the imaginary vertical closed boundary s c the vertical distribution of the horizontal and vertical velocity components v x y z u v and w x y z on s c can be obtained by eq 3 which have been verified by the model test results they are denoted as v c o w c o the boundary conditions of incident potential on s c in the inner region is 22 x φ 0 y φ 0 v c o w z φ 0 w c o on s c for the diffraction and radiation wave potentials φ d ψ 1 k and χ k k 1 2 in the inner region an additional imaginary vertical closed boundary s c surrounding s c with certain distance is introduced to allow the total transmission of the diffraction and radiation waves on s c from the inner region to the outer region the diffraction and radiation waves satisfy the boundary conditions of numerical wave absorbers on it according to the conclusion given by clement 1996 the dissipation term is added to the dynamic condition of free surface by using the artificial wave elimination method the improved condition of free surface can be expressed as follows 23 2 φ d t 2 g φ d z κ x 2 φ d z t on s c 24 κ x 00 x 3 l 5 0 1 0 1 cos x 3 l 5 2 l 5 π 3 l 5 x l the boundary condition on s c for solving the boussinesq equations in the outer region only need η c v α c for the wave height η c on the imaginary vertical closed boundary it can be easily calculated after the total velocity potential is obtained the v α c can be calculated based on the horizontal velocity components v i i 1 2 on each element of imaginary vertical closed boundary by lagrange interpolation 2 4 solving procedures the numerical procedures coupling the shallow water wave propagation with the three dimensional hydroelastic analysis of a vlfs are performed in time domain 1 at a time step t n with the incident wave on s i the known boundary conditions on s s bto and s fo and the data η c n v α c n on s c prescribed by the inner region solutions at the time step t n 1 boussinesq equations are solved to produce η v α in the outer region and their values on s c denoted as η c o v α c o 2 employing the solution v α and eq 3 the distribution of the horizontal and vertical velocity components on s c are obtained to define the inner region boundary condition on s c denoted as v c o w c o 3 with the input waves v v c o w w c o on s c as shown in eq 22 assuming there is no floating body in the inner region rankine source method eq 8 together with eqs 10 and 11 are used to calculate the incident waves in the inner region in this way the influence of detailed seabed profile on the generalized incident wave exciting force f 0 t the froude krylov force may be more rationally accounted for 4 eqs 8 11 together with the wave absorbing condition for φ d ψ 1 k and χ k on s c are used to solve the radiation and diffraction potentials in the inner region the generalized hydrodynamic coefficients a the radiation impulse response function k and the generalized diffraction wave exciting forces f d at time t n may then be determined and eq 12 be solved for the principal coordinates p k t n the total velocity potential φ r t n of eq 5 and hence the wave elevation η c the horizontal velocity along the line z z α 0 531 h on s c are calculated and denoted as η c i v α c i 5 compare η c i v α c i with η c o v α c o on s c if the mean square values of their magnitude differences δ η δ u are not less than a prescribed criterion ε let η c n v α

calculation with the incident wave at t n 1 on s i and the boundary condition η c n 1 v α c n 1 on s c the flow diagram for the procedures of the solution is shown in fig 7 3 experimental and numerical modelling 3 1 experimental setup an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs with a reduction scale λ 100 1 was tested in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering of shanghai jiao tong university the uneven seabed was simplified as a 2 slope two dimensional topography as shown in fig 8 a to simulate the effect of inhomogeneous encounter waves a model island was fixed between the slope seabed and vlfs model figs 8 10 the particulars of each module and the stiffness components of connectors are shown in table 3 3 2 numerical model the rmfc method rigid modules and flexible connectors is used to build the vlfs model and the bush elements are used to simulate the stiffness of hinged connectors between two adjacent modules as shown in the table 3 the numerical model is shown in the fig 11 including hydrodynamic calculation area terrain grid the single structure model the connection between adjacent modules and the hydrodynamic calculation model of the 8 module vlfs the dynamic characteristics of the 8 module vlfs in vacuum can be obtained by the dry analysis of the above three dimensional finite element model four typical modes and corresponding principal coordinates are shown in the fig 12 and fig 13 which can provide a reference for the subsequent analysis of motions and connector loads 4 comparison and analysis of numerical predictions and model test results 4 1 inhomogeneous wave field 13 wave height recorders w1 w13 in the fig 14 are arranged in the far field deep water near reefs and near different modules of floating bodies in order to get the inhomogeneous wave field in the model tests in the numerical simulation the incident waves are set based on the model test results of wave heights w1 so as to ensure that the far field incident waves are the same a typical regular incident wave h 3 1 m t 13 0s is scattered by the island and the uneven seabed as shown in fig 14 the comparison of the predicted and measured results of wave height at the 13 observation positions w1 w13 are shown in fig 15 it can be found that the island model makes a certain shielding effect on wave propagation especially for short period waves which results in a fact that the wave heights on the back side of the island model are significantly smaller than those on both sides the calculated wave height distribution is in good agreement with the measured results of the model test which verifies the accuracy of the thafts br in wave propagation and deformation fig 16 shows the directional distribution function g f θ at different measuring points under an irregular wave condition h 1 3 5 54 m t p 10 7s the g f θ can indicate the distribution of wave energy in different directions the following phenomena may be observed 1 the main wave direction at w2 and w3 change obviously due to the shelter effect of the island model especially at w2 the main wave direction reverses due to the wave diffraction through the island while at w3 the main wave direction is mainly affected by the diffraction waves from the left and right sides of the island 2 the wave directions encountered by the eight modules of vlfs basically have two main characteristics one is for the modules on both sides which are basically consistent with the far field incident wave as shown by the results of w4 the other is the modules in the middle i e the modules behind the island as shown by the results of w7 the main wave direction has been deflected to a certain extent of 5 15 3 the main wave direction behind the vlfs is relatively complex and the energy distribution is dispersed as shown in the fig 16 f it can be found that the encounter waves of vlfs are obviously inhomogeneous therefore the classical 3d hydroelastic methods which is based on green s function of infinite or finite water depth are no longer applicable the thafts br based on dcam which can take the influence of complex wave environments into account will be used to predict the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs near an island 4 2 motions comparisons between the predictions by thafts br and the model test results of the transfer functions of motions of module 1 and module 4 are presented in fig 17 fig 18 exhibits the distribution of the transfer functions of motions along the vlfs under typical regular wave conditions t 13 0s and the model test results of module 1 and module 4 are also given for comparison in the figures it can be found that 1 the thafts br based on dcam may reasonably predict the motions of multi modules vlfs in the complicated wave environments 2 there exist differences among different modules for the heave and pitch motions but the roll motions are very close this is mainly induced by the use of connector configurations which only release the degree of freedom in pitch direction 4 3 connector loads the inhomogeneous incident wave and the effect of the uneven seabed make the distribution of hydrodynamic loads acting on the 8 modules the responses of the modules and the connecting forces between two adjacent modules rather complicated further investigation on fig 19 shows that the f x and f z of c7 located in the middle are obviously larger than the c1 in the edge while the f y is the opposite by comparing with the principal coordinates in fig 13 it can be found that the connecting force f x is mainly determined by the responses of the first horizontal bending mode the 14th mode of the 8 module vlfs while the connecting force f z is dominated by the first two torque modes the 17th and 19th modes and the first vertical bending mode the 20th mode table 4 gives the comparisons between the predictions and the test results of connecting force components of c1 and c7 in different incident wave conditions it shows that the present thafts br may reasonably predict the connector loads of the multi modules vlfs in the complicated wave environments at the same time it can be found that the connector loads in b2 wave condition are slightly larger than that in b3 although the wave height of b2 is only about 0 8 of b3 this is because the spectrum peak period of b2 just falls into one of the peak frequency intervals of connector load rao which can be seen in fig 19 the first peak frequency interval is 0 45 rad s 0 55 rad s t 11 42s 13 96s and the second peak frequency interval is 0 70 rad s 0 95 rad s t 6 61s 8 97s this provides a reference for the design of vlfs and its connectors requiring the resonant frequencies to be far away from the common encountered wave 5 conclusions a direct coupling analysis method of hydroelastic response of multi module vlfs in complicated wave environments is developed on the basis of 3d hydroelasticity theory and boussinesq equation model tests of detailed flow field measurement and an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs near a typical island are performed to provide a reference for comparison and validation of the numerical method the following conclusions can be drawn 1 comparing the model test results it can be found that the accurate velocity simulation results can be obtained by boussinesq equation so as to ensure accurate flow field information of the incoming wave around the imaginary vertical closed boundary for the dcam 2 the numerical predictions using the thafts br including the inhomogeneous wave field motions and connector loads are compared with the model test results and good agreement is achieved it is proved that the thafts br has provided an applicable tool for the design and optimization of the structure of the modules and the connectors of a multi module vlfs deployed near coast or island with complicated wave environments 3 the connector loads can reach 50 000 tons in the survival inhomogeneous wave condition h 1 3 5 54 m t p 10 7s while less than 20 000 tons in the corresponding homogeneous wave condition it is a big challenge to stay safe for the design and construction of this key part of the vlfs deployed near islands moreover some other topics such as the non linear responses induced by the severe typhoon environment slamming loads the influence of non linear connector characteristics on the motion predictions and safety assessment of a multi module vlfs need further investigations in the future the full scale measurements are on demand for further validation credit authorship

21622,the very large floating structure vlfs deployed near seashore islands and reefs are always exposed to the extremely complex encountering waves traditional methods with homogeneous wave inputs are not applicable for the hydroelastic analysis of this type vlfs in this paper the authors carry out a numerical and experimental investigation on hydroelastic responses of an 8 module vlfs near a

8 module vlfs hydroelastic response complicated wave condition direct coupling analysis method experiment 1 introduction the rapid expansion of world population the exhausting of inland resources and the requirement for sustainable development of world economy have strengthened the efforts of mankind to increase the capability of resource exploitation and space utilization in the ocean very large floating structures vlfs are among those marine structures which have attracted long lasting attention in ocean utilization fig 1 great progresses have been made on conceptual design dynamic responses analysis mooring system anti motion device multi module connection technology model tests safety and reliability analysis of vlfs in the past few decades lee and newman 2000 ohmatsu 2000 watanabe et al 2004 ohkusu and namba 2004 wang and wang 2015 cheng et al 2016 wu et al 2017a b wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 japan launched a mega float project in 1995 this project investigated the major technical problems and the possibility for building a large floating airport sueok and sato 2000 later a 5 module vlfs with 1 000 m in length 60 m in width and 3 m in depth was constructed and deployed in tokyo bay meanwhile usa carried out the research project of mobile offshore base zueck et al 2000 aimed to provide a movable pre positioned floating naval base for cargos transferring from airplanes and container ships to the shore in the present century the project study on dynamic characteristics of vlfs had been carried out in shanghai jiao tong university from 2001 to 2005 wang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 and the project response and structure safety of vlfs in complicated environment had been completed by china ship scientific research center from 2013 to 2017 ding et al 2017 2019 2020 wu et al 2017a b shi et al 2018 for a vlfs the environmental conditions and the reasonable degree of load are the key factors to determine its safety therefore it is of great significance for the structural design and safety evaluation of vlfs to reasonably estimate the loads on floating structures in complex and changeable environments comparing to an ordinary ship lower rigidity due to larger dimension of a vlfs may easily make its natural frequencies drop down to the wave frequency region thus the hydroelastic effects should be considered in the assessment of wave responses and structural safety of a vlfs in the past several years extensive investigations have been carried out on the hydroelastic responses of vlfs in deep open seas and the hydroelastic methods range from two dimensional linear theory bishop and price 1979 three dimensional linear theory wu 1984 shin et al 2015 two dimensional nonlinear theory xia et al 2004 to three dimensional nonlinear theory tian and wu 2006 hu et al 2012 lee et al 2020 as well as different hybrid hydroelastic analysis methods belibassakis and athanassoulis 2005 kim et al 2013 karperaki et al 2016 wu et al 2016 ding et al 2017 wei et al 2018 young et al 2020 liu et al 2020 however if a vlfs is located in shallow water near seashore or island the complex seabed topography water depth as well as the inhomogeneous encounter waves will make significant influences on its dynamic responses the dynamic response analysis of vlfs will face following three problems 1 the existing 3d hydroelastic analysis method which is based on green s function of infinite or finite water depth is no longer applicable 2 not only its complex shape and multi module characteristics but also the hydroelastic effect coupled with the complex flow field should be taken into account 3 the object of experimental simulation involves with not only the coupling response of multi module floating body connecting device and complex mooring system but also the multi scale propagation of wave and current in complex marine geographic environment therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of complicated wave environments by introducing the wave model which can be combined with traditional 3d hydroelasticity theory to develop a new coupling model in this paper a direct coupling analysis method dcam of hydroelastic responses of floating structures in complicated wave environments was established in this model the 3d hydroelasticity theory of floating bodies was combined with the shallow water wave theory of boussinesq equation compared with the traditional hydroelasticity theories the introduction of wave model and applying the imaginary vertical closed boundary between inner and outer flow fields provided a new development direction for the hydroelastic response analysis of vlfs in the complicated environments it is therefore unnecessary to introduce assumptions such as slowly changing seabed topography constant water depth floating plate 2d seabed topography processing and additional diffraction terms the detailed theoretical derivation numerical solution method and the relevant calculation program thafts br three dimension hydroelastic analysis of floating and traveling structures boussinesq rankine which became one module of the commercial software thafts c s s r c 2011 were also completed the dcam and the calculation program were verified and validated by comparing with the model test results of an 8 module vlfs near a typical island the conclusions drawn from the results can provide information and guidance in the design optimization and safety assessment of structure and connectors of a multi module vlfs deployed near the coast island or coral reef 2 model description the main idea of dcam is to construct an imaginary vertical closed boundary from free surface to the seabed around the floating body the fluid domain is divided into outer and inner computational regions by the imaginary vertical closed boundary fig 2 in the outer region the boussinesq equation is used to simulate the wave propagation on the complex seabed on the other hand a potential flow solver with the rankine sources distributed over the whole boundaries of the inner region is adopted and the classical hydroelasticity theory is used to calculate the dynamic responses of the floating structure on the imaginary vertical closed boundary the continuity relations including the wave elevation and the vertical distribution of fluid velocity are used to connect the fluid motions between the outer and inner regions in a two way coupling manner the notations of all the boundaries of these two regions are shown in table 1 2 1 outer region boussinesq equation 2 1 1 basic equations fully nonlinear boussinesq equation proposed by wei et al 1995 is used to simulate wave propagation and deformation in the outer region the governing equations are as follows continuity of mass 1 η t h η v α z α 1 2 h η h v α 1 2 z α 2 1 6 h 2 h η η 2 v α 0 continuity of momentum 2 v α t v α v α g η z α 1 2 z α v α h v α t 1 2 z α 2 η 2 v α v α 1 2 h v α η v α 2 1 2 z α η v α h v α η 1 2 η v α t h v α t 0 where h represents the local water depth the variables for solving the equation are the wave elevation η η x y z t and the horizontal velocity v α u α v α at z z α 0 531 h the horizontal and vertical components of the water particle velocity are as follows 3 1 v v α z α z h v α 1 2 z α 2 z 2 v α 3 2 w h v α z v α the wave evolution problem is described in a two dimensional way by the equations the boundary conditions on the seabed s bto and free surface s fo of the outer region have to be satisfied respectively the boundary condition on s c will be defined in section 2 3 2 1 2 verification for the assumption of velocity distribution in the analysis of hydrodynamic loads acting on floating bodies special attention is paid to the vertical distribution of the water particle velocity therefore whether the horizontal velocity distribution given in the formula 3 is correct or not and whether its accuracy is enough to provide accurate flow field information for hydrodynamic analysis of floating bodies in the inner region are the key to the establishment of the direct coupling analysis method for the boussinesq equation the prediction ability of wave propagation and deformation has been verified by many results from different means such as model tests field measurements and analytic solutions rare literature can be found for the validation of eqs 3 1 a typical section of the terrain near an island was selected to carry out the related velocity distribution measurement experiments in the two dimensional flume of the state key laboratory of port and offshore engineering dalian university of technology in the model test several flow velocity sensors were arranged along the water depth at typical topographic change positions fig 3 and table 2 in order to obtain the horizontal velocity distributions the contrast results between model tests and boussinesq equation under different wave heights and periods are shown in figs 4 6 the results from cfd method based on ranse reynolds average navier stokes equation with rng renormalization group k ε turbulence model wu et al 2008 are also presented in the figs 4 6 for the further verification the 2d computational domain includes 35 m near shore area and 50 m extended slope for wave elimination structural mesh with 88 800 cells is applied for computation domain with at least 40 grids per wavelength it can be found that 1 the wave height makes great influence on the velocity of flow and the larger wave height always causes higher velocity but the effect of the wave period is relatively small 2 the difference between the experimental and numerical results near the wave surface and the bottom is slightly larger than that at the middle water layer measurement point especially for 3 and v5 which locate behind a steep slope and the wave breaking zone mainly due to the influence of complex seabed topography and the non linear deformation near wave surface therefore we should avoid building the coupling boundaries on such two kind of areas 3 generally speaking the numerical results are in good agreement with the model tests the velocity simulation results given by boussinesq equation have good accuracy which can provide accurate flow field information of the incoming wave around the imaginary vertical closed boundary for the direct coupling analysis method 2 2 inner region rankine source method and3d hydroelasticity theory to account for the effect of complex seabed profile on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in the inner region the time domain three dimensional hydroelasticity theory and the rankine source method are employed by introducing the principal coordinates p r t r 1 2 m the displacement u u v w of the vlfs is expressed as the aggregation of the principal modes u r u r v r w r r 1 2 m of the structure in vacuum 4 u r 1 m u r p r t for a zero speed floating structure the unsteady velocity potential φ x y z t can be decomposed into 5 φ x y z t φ 0 x y z t φ d x y z t φ r x y z t where φ 0 φ d and φ r are incident wave potential diffraction wave potential and the radiation potential respectively 6 φ r r t k 0 t ϕ k r τ p k t τ d τ 7 ϕ k r t

χ k are radiation potentials representing the transient and the memory effects all potentials φ o r t φ d r t ψ 1 k and χ k satisfy the laplace equation introduce φ to denote either of φ o φ d ψ 1 k or χ k and distributing the rankine sources over the whole boundary of the inner region s s b s c s b t i s f i the φ can be expressed as 8 2 π φ r s 1 r n φ r 0 t φ r 0 t n 1 r d s where r r r o r o x o y o z o is the source point n is the unit normal vector at r 0 on the boundary the fluid structure interface boundary condition should be satisfied on the mean wetted surface of the body s b

o n s f i the calculations of s i 1 r d s and s i n 1 r d s in the equation are very frequently used in the panel method which can be used to solve the boundary integral equations in order to obtain the results of these two integrals accurately and efficiently two strategies are generally adopted i e calculating the near field and the far field separately the determination of near and far field could depend on the distance between field point and source point the calculations of near field and far field are based on the accurate and approximate formulas independently however the panel method considers that the source strength at the center point of each panel represents the source strength of the whole panel which may lead to discontinuity of the strength between the cells there may be a jump between the source strength of one panel and the surrounding strength in this regard further improvements can be made such as using higher order panel method or using gauss integral method to make full use of the panel information the generalized hydroelastic equations of motion in time domain may be represented in terms of the principal coordinate vector p t in the matrix form 12 a a p t b p t c c δ c p t 0 t k t τ p τ d τ f 0 t f d t where a b and c are generalized modal inertial modal damping and modal stiffness matrices respectively of the dry structure a and c are the matrices of generalized hydrodynamic added mass coefficients and restoring coefficients k t is the radiation impulse response function or retardation function a and k t are defined by the integrals of ψ 1 k and χ

wetted surface s b of the body δ c is the additional restoring coefficient induced by the mooring system in linear theory its element is 13 δ c r k i u t r h i u k r 1 2 m k 1 2 m where h i is a 3 3 matrix representing the increments of the three mooring force components induced by a unit displacement in each of the three directions of the i th mooring line connection point on the floating structure when solving the equation above the trapezoidal integration rule is used to discretize the convolution in the equation and then the corresponding numerical calculation can be carried out assuming that the total calculation period is 0 to t and the time step is δ t there are m time points in total when t t n 14 0 t k t τ p τ d τ δ t 2 k 0 p t n δ t 2 k t n p 0 δ t n 1 n 1 k t n t n p t

force in numerical calculation it is assumed that there are no waves outside the 0 t range and the upper and lower limits of integral are t t m and 0 t 1 by substituting the above formulas into the time domain hydroelastic response equation 18 the equation may be written as 16 a 0 p t b 0 p t c 0 p t r t where a 0 a a b 0 b δ t 2 κ 0 c 0 c c δ c r t δ t n 1 m k r 0 t n t n k r d t n t n ζ 0 t n

solutions to the flow fields of inner and outer regions are given in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively how to solve the internal and external flow field jointly is the core issue of this section the matching conditions on the imaginary vertical closed boundary s c are as follows for incident wave potential φ 0 the outer region solutions of eqs 1 and 2 provide η c v α c on the imaginary vertical closed boundary s c the vertical distribution of the horizontal and vertical velocity components v x y z u v and w x y z on s c can be obtained by eq 3 which have been verified by the model test

potentials φ d ψ 1 k and χ k k 1 2 in the inner region an additional imaginary vertical closed boundary s c surrounding s c with certain distance is introduced to allow the total transmission of the diffraction and radiation waves on s c from the inner region to the outer region the diffraction and radiation waves satisfy the boundary conditions of numerical wave absorbers on it according to the conclusion given by clement 1996 the dissipation term is added to the dynamic condition of free surface by using the artificial wave elimination method the improved condition of free surface can be

region only need η c v α c for the wave height η c on the imaginary vertical closed boundary it can be easily calculated after the total velocity potential is obtained the v α c can be calculated based on the horizontal velocity components v i i 1 2 on each element of imaginary vertical closed boundary by lagrange interpolation 2 4 solving procedures the numerical procedures coupling the shallow water wave propagation with the three dimensional hydroelastic analysis of a vlfs are performed in time domain 1 at a time step t n with the incident wave on s i the known boundary conditions

calculation with the incident wave at t n 1 on s i and the boundary condition η c n 1 v α c n 1 on s c the flow diagram for the procedures of the solution is shown in fig 7 3 experimental and numerical modelling 3 1 experimental setup an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs with a reduction scale λ 100 1 was tested in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering of shanghai jiao tong university the uneven seabed was simplified as a 2 slope two dimensional topography as shown in fig 8 a to simulate the effect of inhomogeneous encounter waves a model island was fixed between the slope seabed and vlfs model figs 8 10 the particulars of each module and the stiffness components of connectors are shown in table 3 3 2 numerical model the rmfc method rigid modules and flexible connectors is used to build the vlfs model and the bush elements are used to simulate the stiffness of hinged connectors between two adjacent modules as shown in the table 3 the numerical model is shown in the fig 11 including hydrodynamic calculation area terrain grid the single structure model the connection between adjacent modules and the hydrodynamic calculation model of the 8 module vlfs the dynamic characteristics of the 8 module vlfs in vacuum can be obtained by the dry analysis of the above three dimensional finite element model four typical modes and corresponding principal coordinates are shown in the fig 12 and fig 13 which can provide a reference for the subsequent analysis of motions and connector loads 4 comparison and analysis of numerical predictions and model test results 4 1 inhomogeneous wave field 13 wave height recorders w1 w13 in the fig 14 are arranged in the far field deep water near reefs and near different modules of floating bodies in order to get the inhomogeneous wave field in the model tests in the numerical simulation the incident waves are set based on the model test results of wave heights w1 so as to ensure that the far field incident waves are the same a typical regular incident wave h 3 1 m t 13 0s is scattered by the island and the uneven seabed as shown in fig 14 the comparison of the predicted and measured results of wave height at the 13 observation positions w1 w13 are shown in fig 15 it can be found that the island model makes a certain shielding effect on wave propagation especially for short period waves which results in a fact that the wave heights on the back side of the island model are significantly smaller than those on both sides the calculated wave height distribution is in good agreement with the measured results of the model test which verifies the accuracy of the thafts br in wave propagation and deformation fig 16 shows the directional distribution function g f θ at different measuring points under an irregular wave condition h 1 3 5 54 m t p 10 7s the g f θ can indicate the distribution of wave energy in different directions the following phenomena may be observed 1 the main wave direction at w2 and w3 change obviously due to the shelter effect of the island model especially at w2 the main wave direction reverses due to the wave diffraction through the island while at w3 the main wave direction is mainly affected by the diffraction waves from the left and right sides of the island 2 the wave directions encountered by the eight modules of vlfs basically have two main characteristics one is for the modules on both sides which are basically consistent with the far field incident wave as shown by the results of w4 the other is the modules in the middle i e the modules behind the island as shown by the results of w7 the main wave direction has been deflected to a certain extent of 5 15 3 the main wave direction behind the vlfs is relatively complex and the energy distribution is dispersed as shown in the fig 16 f it can be found that the encounter waves of vlfs are obviously inhomogeneous therefore the classical 3d hydroelastic methods which is based on green s function of infinite or finite water depth are no longer applicable the thafts br based on dcam which can take the influence of complex wave environments into account will be used to predict the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs near an island 4 2 motions comparisons between the predictions by thafts br and the model test results of the transfer functions of motions of module 1 and module 4 are presented in fig 17 fig 18 exhibits the distribution of the transfer functions of motions along the vlfs under typical regular wave conditions t 13 0s and the model test results of module 1 and module 4 are also given for comparison in the figures it can be found that 1 the thafts br based on dcam may reasonably predict the motions of multi modules vlfs in the complicated wave environments 2 there exist differences among different modules for the heave and pitch motions but the roll motions are very close this is mainly induced by the use of connector configurations which only release the degree of freedom in pitch direction 4 3 connector loads the inhomogeneous incident wave and the effect of the uneven seabed make the distribution of hydrodynamic loads acting on the 8 modules the responses of the modules and the connecting forces between two adjacent modules rather complicated further investigation on fig 19 shows that the f x and f z of c7 located in the middle are obviously larger than the c1 in the edge while the f y is the opposite by comparing with the principal coordinates in fig 13 it can be found that the connecting force f x is mainly determined by the responses of the first horizontal bending mode the 14th mode of the 8 module vlfs while the connecting force f z is dominated by the first two torque modes the 17th and 19th modes and the first vertical bending mode the 20th mode table 4 gives the comparisons between the predictions and the test results of connecting force components of c1 and c7 in different incident wave conditions it shows that the present thafts br may reasonably predict the connector loads of the multi modules vlfs in the complicated wave environments at the same time it can be found that the connector loads in b2 wave condition are slightly larger than that in b3 although the wave height of b2 is only about 0 8 of b3 this is because the spectrum peak period of b2 just falls into one of the peak frequency intervals of connector load rao which can be seen in fig 19 the first peak frequency interval is 0 45 rad s 0 55 rad s t 11 42s 13 96s and the second peak frequency interval is 0 70 rad s 0 95 rad s t 6 61s 8 97s this provides a reference for the design of vlfs and its connectors requiring the resonant frequencies to be far away from the common encountered wave 5 conclusions a direct coupling analysis method of hydroelastic response of multi module vlfs in complicated wave environments is developed on the basis of 3d hydroelasticity theory and boussinesq equation model tests of detailed flow field measurement and an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs near a typical island are performed to provide a reference for comparison and validation of the numerical method the following conclusions can be drawn 1 comparing the model test results it can be found that the accurate velocity simulation results can be obtained by boussinesq equation so as to ensure accurate flow field information of the incoming wave around the imaginary vertical closed boundary for the dcam 2 the numerical predictions using the thafts br including the inhomogeneous wave field motions and connector loads are compared with the model test results and good agreement is achieved it is proved that the thafts br has provided an applicable tool for the design and optimization of the structure of the modules and the connectors of a multi module vlfs deployed near coast or island with complicated wave environments 3 the connector loads can reach 50 000 tons in the survival inhomogeneous wave condition h 1 3 5 54 m t p 10 7s while less than 20 000 tons in the corresponding homogeneous wave condition it is a big challenge to stay safe for the design and construction of this key part of the vlfs deployed near islands moreover some other topics such as the non linear responses induced by the severe typhoon environment slamming loads the influence of non linear connector characteristics on the motion predictions and safety assessment of a multi module vlfs need further investigations in the future the full scale measurements are on demand for further validation credit authorship

21623,thick walled cylinder models are the most commonly used analytical models for corrosion induced cracking of concrete cover which have been developed for decades and have become a mature theoretical series this paper reviews their development history and classifies their characteristics furthermore the performances of these models on predicting cracking time of concrete cover are tested by comparing with collected test data and the effects of controlling factors are analyzed it is found that the main characteristics of these models include the differences in the assumptions and constitutive laws for cracked concrete number of cylinders and hypotheses of crack morphologies among the evaluated models el maaddawy and soudki 2007 and chernin et al 2010 have the best predicting performances and the cracking time extends with the increase of concrete cover thickness tensile strength porous zone thickness and creep coefficient while it decreases with the increase of concrete elastic modulus rust volumetric expansion factor and corrosion current density the main limitations include the ill considerations of heterogeneity of concrete non uniform corrosion along rebar applied load corner rebar or multi rebars conditions biaxial stress state of concrete compatibility conditions between the cracked and uncracked concrete rust production rate and the values of involving parameters keywords rebar corrosion concrete cover cracking thick walled cylinder models service life 1 introduction rebar corrosion is a main cause affecting the durability and safety of reinforced concrete structures which leads to series of structural degradations including 1 cracking of concrete cover 2 reduction of cross section area of rebar and 3 loss of bond strength between the corroded rebar and concrete qiao et al 2016 among these degenerations cracking of concrete cover may be the most dangerous for the durability of concrete structures because it can provide more potential transport tunnels for aggressive agents which will significantly accelerate the corrosion process and cause further deterioration of structures especially for those exposed to marine environment or de icing salts under normal conditions the high alkaline environment of concrete with a ph value as high as 13 5 can sufficiently protect the rebar against corrosion by forming a passive film of iron oxides however this protective film can be destroyed by aggressive agents such as chloride irons and carbon dioxide after that the reacted irons transform into ferrous ions and later become solid corrosion product rust which has a larger volume as much as 2 6 5 times of the virgin steel bar the newly generated corrosion product fills the concrete pores around rebar and impose corrosion expansion on surrounding concrete which finally cracks the concrete cover the service life of reinforced concrete rc structures is generally defined in three different ways see in fig 1 1 initiation of rebar depassivation 2 cracking of concrete cover 3 surface crack width grows to a critical value the first criterion is decided by physical and chemical processes that depend on the penetration processes of aggressive agents and the destruction of the protective film while the second and third criteria involve mechanical processes of the concrete response under corrosion expansion it is pointed out that the consideration adopting the depassivation time as the end of service life is in many cases too conservative andrade et al 1993 thus the cracking and crack propagation of concrete are also important to predict the service life of concrete structures on the other hand crack width is a measurable parameter to assess the corrosion state of embedded rebar considering that even the newly developed nondestructive methods to detect the corrosion of rebars nowadays such as optical fiber zhao et al 2013 and magnetic field ridha et al 2005 can only obtain qualitative information therefore a lot of efforts have been devoted to investigating the concrete cracking due to rebar corrosion by using experimental andrade et al 1993 qiao et al 2016 empirical vidal et al 2004 zhang et al 2010 analytical bažant 1979 liu and weyers 1998 and numerical methods chernin et al 2012 sanz et al 2015 however test methods usually adopting strain gauges to observe the local deformation cannot obtain the process tracking of stress evolution and crack development in concrete due to the following reasons 1 strain gauges may fail to capture cracks unless a fairly large number of gauges are used because of the challenge to determine the positions of cracks sanz et al 2017 2 strain gauges can only be placed at fixed positions and specific directions thus they are not able to provide a full field analysis and 3 strain gauges usually fracture locally at critical sections close to failure unexpectedly jiang et al 2017 what s more although experimental studies are essential for studying corrosion induced cracking of a concrete cover it is not feasible to examine the influence of variation of a large number of parameters such as the concrete cover thickness diameter and location of a reinforcing bar and concrete material properties on the corrosion process due to time and cost limits in addition the empirical equations for evaluating crack width based on the experimental data also show large scatters chernin et al 2012 as for the numerical models they are relatively complex and cannot give a closed form solution and at the same time some of the numerical models show significant overestimation of crack widths compared with experimental results chernin et al 2012 besides the experimental and numerical studies considerable efforts have invested in using analytical methods to predict the cracking time and surface crack width in a concrete cover some researches employed the geometrical approaches by considering the configuration of cracks for example maruyama et al 1989 proposed an approach in which the movement of the concrete between cracks was treated as rigid and then cabrera 1996 developed this method further to include additional parameters such as thickness of the side concrete cover and the angle between the first and second cracks besides thoft christensen 2001 developed a new approach assuming that the increase in the volume of crack was equal to the volume of the rust produced at the concrete steel interface obviously these methods cannot reflect the mechanical response of concrete in corrosion process in order to solve this problem the other models tried to use mechanical methods to calculate the crack initiation and propagation through the evolutions of stress and strain in concrete for example li et al 2008 evaluated the stress in concrete and cracking time by using the complex variable method of muskhelishvili in which concrete around the rebar was modeled as an elastic infinite plane with a circular aperture as the most commonly used analytical models for predicting concrete cracking the thick walled cylinder models simplify concrete around the rebar into a cylinder of which the thickness is taken as the thinnest concrete cover the effect of rebar corrosion in concrete is represented by exposing internal pressures or displacements on the inner wall of the cylinder chernin and val 2010 lu et al 2011 this set of models has been developed for decades of years since bažant 1979 in bažant s model concrete was treated as a homogeneous linear elastic material and the expansion of corrosion products was modeled by a uniform increase in the diameter of the cylindrical hole around the rebar the concrete cover was assumed to totally crack when the average tensile stress becomes equal to the tensile strength of concrete however comparison with experimental data showed that the bažant s model significantly underestimated the time to crack initiation chernin and val 2010 nevertheless this pioneering work provided a new way for predicting the cracking of concrete cover induced by rebar corrosion after that a lot of modifications were performed on the thick walled cylinder model to make it better realize the corrosion process and better fit experimental results this paper first summarizes the procedure of calculating the service life of reinforced concrete structures by using the thick walled cylinder models then the development history of thick walled cylinder models is summed up and the characteristics of different thick walled cylinder models are analyzed after that the performances of these models are evaluated by comparing the predicted cracking times with collected test data and also the effects of controlling factors for cracking time of concrete are analyzed finally the limitations of the thick walled cylinder models are evaluated trying to figure out the possible improvements in future work 2 determination of service life of concrete structures the damage process of corrosion induced concrete cracking is plotted in fig 2 it can be seen that the initiation of rebar corrosion is a physical electrochemical process and generally there are two kinds of steel corrosion in reinforced concrete chloride induced corrosion and carbonation induced corrosion in the case of chloride induced corrosion chloride firstly penetrates through concrete cover and then accumulates around the rebar surface when the chloride content at the rebar surface reaches critical value the passive film will be destroyed while for carbonation induced corrosion the ph of concrete will decrease due to carbonization reaction at ph 11 5 the passive film becomes unstable and at ph 9 this film will be totally destroyed fick s second law is commonly used to describe the penetration and distribution of chloride ions in concrete the solution of fick s second law for one dimensional diffusion problem is expressed as follows wang et al 2016 1 c x t c 0 c s c 0 1 e r f x 2 d cl t where c x t is the chloride content at depth x and time t d cl is the chloride diffusion coefficient c s and c 0 are the surface and initial chloride contents respectively therefore the chloride content at any concrete depth and time can be determined based on eq 1 when the accumulated chloride content around the rebar reaches the critical value c cr the function can be stated as 2 t c 2 4 d cl e r f 1 1 c cr c 0 c s c 0 2 where c is the thickness of concrete cover while for carbonation induced corrosion fick s first law is generally used to describe the carbonation process and the time of corrosion initiation of steel bars could be determined as köliö et al 2014 3 t c k 2 where k refers to the carbonation coefficient after depassivation of the protective film the rebar begins to corrode as mentioned before the newly generated corrosion products will first fill the concrete pores around the rebar then the accumulated rust will impose pressure on surrounding concrete and induce tensile stress in tangential direction and cracks will initiate at the rebar concrete interface where the maximum tensile stress of concrete first reaches then these initial cracks propagate to concrete surface as inner cracks which cannot be detected from outside of the concrete cover finally these cracks reach concrete surface and become visual at a width about 50 μm andrade et al 1993 after that the surface cracks develop as long as corrosion continues it should be pointed out that the cracking of concrete cover is the interest of all the thick walled cylinder models but most of them do not concern about the propagation of surface crack this implies that most researchers prefer the cracking of concrete cover as the end of service life for structures however some authors argued that the corroded depth of rebar is very small and the performance of structure is slightly affected at the cracking time therefore they extended the model to make it possible to predict the development of surface crack li et al 2006 chen and xiao 2012 chen and alani 2013 su and zhang 2015 as an electro chemical process the corrosion amount w cor at any specific time can be calculated based on corrosion time and corrosion current density the corresponding time of this amount could be determined by faraday s law as follows 4 t n f i cor a w cor where i cor is corrosion current a is the relative atom mass of steel 55 85 g mol n is the valence of corrosion product of metal n 2 and 3 for ferrous and ferric irons respectively and f is the faraday s constant 9 65 104 c mol thus the time at cracking or reaching a critical crack width can be obtained as long as the corresponding corrosion amount has been determined 3 characteristics of thick walled cylinder models in this section firstly the development process of thick walled cylinder models is summed up and then the characteristics of different models are analyzed table 1 summarizes the symbols and abbreviations used in the following sections 3 1 development of the thick walled cylinder models the main mechanical characteristics of different thick walled cylinder models are listed in table 2 from this table it can be seen that about twenty different kinds of thick walled cylinder models with various assumptions have been proposed as stated before concrete cover firstly experiences an expansion period at elastic stage which is the same for all of the thick walled cylinder models and the classical elastic mechanical solutions for stress and displacement can be obtained by using the timoshenko theory these models start to differ at the moment when concrete around the steel bar reaches its tensile strength initial cracking according to their geometrical division of the concrete cylinder these models could be divided into single cylinder double cylinder and n ring models from table 2 it can be seen that for the single cylinder models of bažant 1979 liu and weyers 1998 and ei maaddawy and sudki 2007 concrete still keeps elastic after the moment when concrete at the concrete steel interface reaches its tensile strength and concrete cover is assumed to be fully cracked when the average tensile stress equals concrete tensile strength which is equivalent to assuming that the concrete is perfectly plastic by contrast in the single cylinder models of zhao and jin 2006 and lu et al 2011 the cracked concrete was assumed losing its tensile strength and thus no stress exists in tangential direction and the thick walled cylinder only composes of the sound concrete until the concrete finally crashed brittlely above models did not take cracks into consideration while in the models considering crack initiation and propagation cracks are treated as smeared morphology which are uniformly distributed in the cracked zone or discrete morphology which are called fictitious cracks in the double cylinder models using smeared crack assumption corrosion induced cracks are deemed to initiate at the concrete steel interface and propagate outward to the concrete surface simultaneously thus the concrete is divided into uncracked and cracked zones with the cracked zone propagating gradually from the concrete steel interface to the concrete surface as shown in table 2 the continuity conditions of stress and displacement at the boundary of the two concrete zones are used as compatibility conditions the main difference of these double cylinder models is the various constitutive relationships adopted for the cracked concrete for example in the model of xu et al 2007 the tangential stress in cracked concrete is simplified to be in a linear relationship with the radius of the cracked zone which ranges from 0 at the concrete steel interface to f t at the outer boundary of the cracked concrete while bhargava et al 2005 assumed that the cracked zone still kept isotropy but the elastic modulus decreased in terms of the softening stage of concrete constitutive relationship furthermore guzmán et al 2012 modified bhargava s model by treating the corrosion of rebar in concrete as a plain strain problem however in other double cylinder models cracked zone was assumed to be anisotropic at radial and tangential directions and different methods were proposed to ascertain the decreased elastic modulus stiffness in the tangential direction for example in the models of li et al 2006 and li and yang 2011 the stiffness reduction in tangential direction was calculated by the average tangential strain and average cracking strain over the cracked zone while in chernin et al 2010 the residual stiffness was estimated based on non linear fe analysis and a power relationship was regressed between the residual stiffness and the radial coordinate in the n ring models cracked concrete are also assumed to be anisotropic and the concrete section is divided into n rings in which the stiffness of each ring is determined according to its specific strain pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 lin et al 2010 shodja et al 2010 kiani and shodja 2011 wang et al 2014 thus the cracked and uncracked zones of concrete are no longer needed to be distinguished artificially and the solution for each ring could be calculated using finite difference method pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 lin et al 2010 or finite element method shodja et al 2010 kiani and shodja 2011 wang et al 2014 as a special n ring model zhao and jin 2011 used damage mechanics and the damage variable d v is calculated based on mohr coulomb failure criterion and mazar s damage model the stress and strain of the outer ring of cracked concrete d v 0 could be obtained first and then the inner rings could be calculated inwards in sequence for the models using fictitious crack assumption su and zhang 2015 chen and xiao 2012 chen and alani 2013 han and lee 2014 balafas and burgoyne 2011 zhong et al 2010 wang and liu 2004a 2004b all of them adopted double cylinder model in which the cracked zone is composed of several fictitious cracks and elastic concrete segments between them for the outer elastic cylinder the boundary conditions are the same with that of the models using smeared crack assumption while for the cracked zone the segment between two adjacent cracks are abstracted to establish the equilibrium equation with the pressures on the inner and outer walls of the segment and the stresses along the crack walls which are calculated according to the relationship of crack width and stress of concrete 3 2 classification of thick walled cylinder models the main characteristics of the thick walled cylinder models are classified in table 3 including the characteristics analyzed above these characteristics include 1 hypotheses for cracked concrete no tensile strength degradation of stiffness degradation of strength or totally plasticity 2 crack morphologies smeared crack or fictitious crack 3 hypotheses of constitutive law for cracked concrete linear bilinear exponential power softening or simply assume the stress in cracked concrete is linear with the radius 4 cylinder number single cylinder double cylinder or n rings 5 the ability of the model to calculate crack propagation at the concrete surface or not 6 rate of rust production constant or decreased model the constant model is based on faraday s law and the rust production is linear with the corrosion current while the decreased rate model is first proposed by liu and weyers 1998 which is according to the experimental observation that the rust production rate decreases with the thickness of rust layer 6 the values of involving parameters such as the rust volumetric expansion factor α thickness porous zone around rebar δ 0 ratio of rust penetration into racks k volume ratio of cracks occupied by rust to total cracks concrete creep coefficient ϕ valence of rust n and poison s ratio of concrete υ c this discrepancy in the values of these parameters occurs due to the fact that these parameters are time varying such as concrete creep coefficient or based on the production environment such as the rust volumetric expansion factor or cannot be precisely measured such as the porous zone around rebar ratio of rust penetration into racks and poison s ratio of concrete the valence of rust is an electrochemical parameter used to convert the rust amount into cracking time as in eq 4 it is determined by the type of rust for example it is 2 and 3 for ferrous and ferric irons respectively as stated in section 2 however due to the complexity of rust composition it is unable to accurately ascertain this value from table 3 it can be seen in most of these models the valence of rust n is set as 2 ferrous iron while in the model of zhong et al 2010 n is taken as 3 ferric iron and some other models such as lu et al 2011 li et al 2006 li and yang 2011 set n as 2 5 which is the average value of the valence of ferrous and ferric irons 4 the performances of thick walled cylinder models 4 1 comparison with test data for cracking time in order to evaluate the performances of different thick walled cylinder models 57 test data of corrosion induced cracking time of reinforced concrete specimens are collected in table 4 and the predicted values by part of the above models are presented the main input parameters include rebar diameter d concrete cover thickness c tensile strength f t elastic modulus e c and corrosion current density i corr as can be seen in table 4 in the accelerated corrosion tests 100 μa cm2 is a commonly used corrosion current density in order to shorten the test time although in natural conditions the corrosion current density is usually smaller than 1 μa cm2 in the model of liu and weyers 1998 two kinds of rust were considered thus both cases are calculated and also two porous zone thicknesses δ 0 10 μm and 20 μm of the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 and chernin et al 2010 are calculated respectively while in the model of pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 only the results using constant rate for rust production are present what s more the model of zhao and jin 2006 was originally proposed to predict the corrosion depth of rebar in order to compare with other models the corrosion depth is converted to cracking time by using faraday s law the detailed calculation method to convert corrosion depth to cracking time can be referred to appendix a due to the appearance of complex number in calculating process results of some specimens cannot be obtained however due to the large workload only part of the thick walled cylinder models are reproduced and verified with author s original results to broadly ascertain the performances of the thick walled cylinder models more work needs to be done all of the predicted cracking times are expressed as normalized values by dividing the corresponding test data in addition in order to show the predicting performances of these models clearly in one figure as shown in fig 3 the specimens from different tests are re numbered and used as the abscissa of fig 3 from table 4 and fig 3 it is clearly seen that the performances predicted are different for various models and test data the different performance for various models is due to their specific characteristics as summarized in section 3 2 on the whole the models of liu and weyers 1998 and zhao and jin 2006 have the largest discrepancies while the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 δ 0 20 μm and chernin et al 2010 δ 0 10 μm have relatively good performances in order to quantitatively assess the performances of the analytical models two indexes are introduced here the first one is the mean value m which is the average of the 57 predicted values of each model the second one is the deviation factor d which is the average of square of the difference between the predicted and test times the values of the two indexes for different models are listed in the bottom of table 4 it can be inferred that the model which has the mean value closer to 1 and the deviation factor closer to 0 can be treated as a good predicting model based on this principle the above models can be divided into three groups the first group includes the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 δ 0 20 μm and chernin et al 2010 δ 0 10 μm in which m is both 1 02 and d are 0 70 and 0 72 respectively these two models have the best predicting performances the second group includes the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 δ 0 10 μm chernin et al 2010 δ 0 20 μm lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 in which m is about 1 4 1 6 and d is about 1 3 1 9 these models can give relative good prediction results the third group includes the models of liu and weyers 1998 pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 and zhao and jin 2006 in which m and d both have large gaps with 1 and 0 respectively therefore these models cannot predict the cracking time of concrete cover accurately by using the least square method the performance of these models can be improved by optimizing the parameters for different models with different values based on the collected test data the detailed calculation process can be referred to appendix b 4 2 parameter analysis of controlling factors for concrete cracking the main parameters controlling the corrosion induced cracking of concrete include geometrical parameters concrete cover thickness c and rebar diameter d material parameters porous zone thickness δ 0 and concrete creep coefficient ϕ mechanical parameters tensile strength f t and elastic modulus e c rust parameter rust volumetric expansion factor α and electrochemical parameter corrosion current density i corr in order to show the influences of these parameters on cracking time the specimen of andrade et al 1993 which has f t 3 55 mpa e c 22 gpa d 16 mm c 20 mm and exposed by a corrosion current density of 100 μa cm2 is selected as the reference specimen and the relationships of the cracking time and these controlling parameters by different models are plotted in fig 4 the results of zhao and jin 2006 are not presented due to the reason that complex numbers appear in the results of some cases from fig 4 it can be seen that 1 except rebar diameter the trends of other parameters on the cracking time for different models are the same saying that the cracking time extends with the increase of concrete cover thickness tensile strength porous zone thickness and creep coefficient while it decreases with the increase of concrete elastic modulus rust expansion factor and corrosion current density 2 for rebar diameter the results of liu and weyers 1998 el maaddawy and soudki 2007 pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 and chernin et al 2010 show that the cracking time increase with the increase of rebar diameter while those of lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 show an opposite trend however the former trend is inconsistent with the test data such as the data of mullard and stewart 2011 3 the model of liu and weyers 1998 has the largest variation for each parameter mainly because it used a decreased rust production rate model which can largely prolong the cracking time while the other models used a constant one the quantitative effects of the influencing parameters on predicted cracking time by the analytical models are listed in table 5 which is converted from the data in fig 4 and expressed as the relative change of the predicted cracking time at the two endpoint values of each parameter for example in liu and weyers model when rebar diameter increases from 12 mm to 32 mm the normalized cracking time increases from 1 8 to 6 5 thus the influence of the rebar diameter on predicted cracking time of liu and weyers model is calculated as 6 5 1 8 1 8 100 351 then all the parameters can be sorted on the impact level by comparing the averaged results of all models for each parameter the order of each parameter is listed in the last column of table 5 it can be seen that in the analyzed ranges of these parameters corrosion current density exhibits the most significant effect followed by rust expansion factor and concrete cover thickness they can be regarded as the control parameters for estimating the cracking time of concrete cover 5 limitations of thick walled cylinder models although certain agreements have been found by comparing the thick walled cylinder models to experimental data some primary limitations of these models still exist 1 homogeneity assumption of concrete cannot well represent the heterogeneous property of such a composite material in all of the above models the crack initiate at the concrete steel interface acturally due to the weak strength crack may also initiate at the aggregate mortar interface itz 2 smeared crack assumption is not able to distinguish the crack pattern of concrete from cracking spalling or delamination however this pattern is important to assess the risk of corroded structures 3 the restrained effect of surrounding concrete outside the cylinder zone is ignored in most of these models except the model of su and zhang 2015 in which the confinement of the surrounding concrete is considered by enlarging the cylinder radius and the enlargement was determined by comparing the cracking times obtained from the thick walled cylinder model with experimental results it was found the enlargement could reach 1 6 times of the original radius of concrete 4 in fact corner rebars usually break down earlier than middle rebars but this effect has not been considered in the above models nor the interaction between multi rebars 5 the corrosion problem is assumed to be a 2d problem whether for a plain stress liu and weyers 1998 lu et al 2011 or a plain strain guzmán et al 2012 problem however non uniform corrosion may occur along the length of rebar in the experiment of torres acosta and sagüés 2004 the influence of non uniform corrosion lengths was studied and it was found that the cracking time decreased with the increase of corrosion length which could be seen from the results of specimen 50 52 the corrosion lengths are 19 1 41 5 and 346 mm respectively of torres acosta and sagüés 2004 in table 4 6 all of these analytical models assumed that concrete cracks at the time when tangential stress reaches tensile strength however concrete cover also bears compression stress at the radial direction as shown in table 2 which means that concrete is in a biaxial stress state and the crack may appear at a value smaller than the tensile strength due to the effect of radial compression stress 7 theoretically speaking the stress strain and displacement should keep continuity at the boundary of the cracked and uncracked concrete however some models only considered part of these compatibility conditions for example strain compatibility is not ensured in the model of bhargava et al 2005 chernin et al 2010 8 although many models adopted decreased rate assumption for rust production this consideration violates faraday s law of electrolysis chernin et al 2010 9 as stated in section 3 2 some parameters such as the rust volumetric expansion factor porous zone thickness and creep coefficient have different values in various models and these differences have significant effects on the cracking time of concrete cover as shown in fig 4 10 acturally the reinforced concrete members must be loaded and the interaction between the sustainable load and corrosion is under study in recent years ye et al 2018 however only the model of li and yang 2011 considered the load effect in the thick walled models from a case with the applied load of 40 kn m on a reinforced concrete structure it was found the cracking time decreased 7 1 when considering the load effect from above analysis these limitations can be summarized as the ill considerations of material assumption heterogeneity of concrete corrosion morphology non uniform corrosion along the rebar applied load rebar conditions corner rebar or multi rebars constitutive law of concrete biaxial stress state mechanical compatibility conditions principle of electrochemistry decreased rate model for rust production and the values of involving parameters rust volumetric expansion factor porous zone thickness and creep coefficient 6 summary and conclusion this paper first summarized the procedure of calculating the service life of reinforced concrete structures by using the thick walled cylinder models then the development history of thick walled cylinder models was summed up and the characteristics of different thick walled cylinder models were analyzed after that the performances of these models were evaluated by comparing the predicted cracking times with collected test data and the effects of controlling factors for cracking time of concrete were also presented finally the limitations of these models were analyzed based on these analyses the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the main characteristics of these models include different assumptions and constitutive laws for cracked concrete number of cylinders hypotheses of cracks morphologies the ability to calculate surface crack propagation or not and the different values of some involving parameters such as rust volumetric expansion factor and concrete creep coefficient 2 it is found that among the evaluated models el maaddawy and soudki 2007 with δ 0 20 μm and chernin et al 2010 with δ 0 10 μm have the best predicting performances and the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 with δ 0 10 μm chernin et al 2010 with δ 0 20 μm lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 can give relative good predicting results while the models of liu and weyers 1998 pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 and zhao and jin 2006 cannot predict the cracking time of concrete cover accurately 3 the cracking time of all of the evaluated models extends with the increase of concrete cover thickness tensile strength porous zone thickness and creep coefficient while it decreases with the increase of concrete elastic modulus rust volumetric expansion factor and corrosion current density however for rebar diameter different trends are obtained from various models and the results of lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 agree with the test phenomenon that the cracking time decrease with the increase of rebar diameter 4 the main limitations of these models include the ill considerations of heterogeneity of concrete material non uniform corrosion along rebar applied load corner rebar or multi rebars conditions biaxial stress state of concrete compatibility

are gratefully acknowledged appendix a method to convert corrosion depth to cracking time the thick walled cylinder models discussed in the present paper are focused on the uniform corrosion the configuration for uniform corrosion of rebar after corrosion is plotted in fig a1 the corroded area of the rebar a cor could be calculated by geometrical relationship a 1 a cor d 0 2 d 0 x 2 where d 0 is the original rebar diameter and x is the corrosion depth the mass loss of the corroded rebar w cor is a 2 w cor ρ s a cor l where l is the length of rebar and ρ s is the density of steel the corrosion cracking time tcr can be calculated by w cor through faraday s law as shown in eq 4 appendix b method to improve the performance of analytical models the performance of the analytical models are tried to be improved by optimizing the values of the parameters which have different values for different models and the values of these parameters are back calculated by using the least square method two points are considered 1 two parameters are considered in the back calculation process i e the rust expansion factor and porous zone thickness acturally there are many other parameters with different values such as the valence of rust rust elastic modulus and creep coefficient in different analytical models as stated in section 3 2 here the rust expansion factor and porous zone thickness are selected because they have relatively significant effects on the cracking time of concrete cover as shown in fig 4 another important reason is that these two parameters are included in most of the analytical models in contrast rust elastic modulus is only contained in part of these models 2 some of these analytical models are too complex to be back calculated thus here only the simple and explicit models are improved by using the least square method including the models of liu and weyers 1998 ei maddawy and soudiki et al 2007 and lu et al 2011 the best values of these two parameters are the ones which minimize the sum of square of the relative differences between the predictive values and the test data i e the deviation factor d the calculation formula of the least square method is expressed as b 1 d min min 1 n i 1 n t i α δ 0 t i t i 2 where n is the total specimen number n 57 and t i is the tested cracking time of each specimen t i α δ 0 is the calculated cracking time of each specimen after substituting different values of α and δ 0 into each analytical models and d min is the minimum value of the average of the square of the relative differences according to the above method the test data of each specimen are substituted in eq b 1 and the optimal values of d min for various models are obtained and listed in table b1 the performance of these analytical models with original and modified values of α and δ0 is plotted in fig b1 it can be seen that on the whole the predicted cracking times of these specimens are closed to the test data when using the modified values of α and δ0 especially for those originally having very large scatters such as specimen 28 34 42 table b1 optimal parameter values and deviation factor for each analytical model table b1 items

21623,thick walled cylinder models are the most commonly used analytical models for corrosion induced cracking of concrete cover which have been developed for decades and have become a mature theoretical series this paper reviews their development history and classifies their characteristics furthermore the performances of these models on predicting cracking time of concrete cover are tested by comparing with collected test data and the effects of controlling factors are analyzed it is found that the main characteristics of these models include the differences in the assumptions and constitutive laws for cracked concrete number of cylinders and hypotheses of crack morphologies among the evaluated models el maaddawy and soudki 2007 and chernin et al 2010 have the best predicting performances and the cracking time extends with the increase of concrete cover thickness tensile strength porous zone thickness and creep coefficient while it decreases with the increase of concrete elastic modulus rust volumetric expansion factor and corrosion current density the main limitations include the ill considerations of heterogeneity of concrete non uniform corrosion along rebar applied load corner rebar or multi rebars conditions biaxial stress state of concrete compatibility conditions between the cracked and uncracked concrete rust production rate and the values of involving parameters keywords rebar corrosion concrete cover cracking thick walled cylinder models service life 1 introduction rebar corrosion is a main cause affecting the durability and safety of reinforced concrete structures which leads to series of structural degradations including 1 cracking of concrete cover 2 reduction of cross section area of rebar and 3 loss of bond strength between the corroded rebar and concrete qiao et al 2016 among these degenerations cracking of concrete cover may be the most dangerous for the durability of concrete structures because it can provide more potential transport tunnels for aggressive agents which will significantly accelerate the corrosion process and cause further deterioration of structures especially for those exposed to marine environment or de icing salts under normal conditions the high alkaline environment of concrete with a ph value as high as 13 5 can sufficiently protect the rebar against corrosion by forming a passive film of iron oxides however this protective film can be destroyed by aggressive agents such as chloride irons and carbon dioxide after that the reacted irons transform into ferrous ions and later become solid corrosion product rust which has a larger volume as much as 2 6 5 times of the virgin steel bar the newly generated corrosion product fills the concrete pores around rebar and impose corrosion expansion on surrounding concrete which finally cracks the concrete cover the service life of reinforced concrete rc structures is generally defined in three different ways see in fig 1 1 initiation of rebar depassivation 2 cracking of concrete cover 3 surface crack width grows to a critical value the first criterion is decided by physical and chemical processes that depend on the penetration processes of aggressive agents and the destruction of the protective film while the second and third criteria involve mechanical processes of the concrete response under corrosion expansion it is pointed out that the consideration adopting the depassivation time as the end of service life is in many cases too conservative andrade et al 1993 thus the cracking and crack propagation of concrete are also important to predict the service life of concrete structures on the other hand crack width is a measurable parameter to assess the corrosion state of embedded rebar considering that even the newly developed nondestructive methods to detect the corrosion of rebars nowadays such as optical fiber zhao et al 2013 and magnetic field ridha et al 2005 can only obtain qualitative information therefore a lot of efforts have been devoted to investigating the concrete cracking due to rebar corrosion by using experimental andrade et al 1993 qiao et al 2016 empirical vidal et al 2004 zhang et al 2010 analytical bažant 1979 liu and weyers 1998 and numerical methods chernin et al 2012 sanz et al 2015 however test methods usually adopting strain gauges to observe the local deformation cannot obtain the process tracking of stress evolution and crack development in concrete due to the following reasons 1 strain gauges may fail to capture cracks unless a fairly large number of gauges are used because of the challenge to determine the positions of cracks sanz et al 2017 2 strain gauges can only be placed at fixed positions and specific directions thus they are not able to provide a full field analysis and 3 strain gauges usually fracture locally at critical sections close to failure unexpectedly jiang et al 2017 what s more although experimental studies are essential for studying corrosion induced cracking of a concrete cover it is not feasible to examine the influence of variation of a large number of parameters such as the concrete cover thickness diameter and location of a reinforcing bar and concrete material properties on the corrosion process due to time and cost limits in addition the empirical equations for evaluating crack width based on the experimental data also show large scatters chernin et al 2012 as for the numerical models they are relatively complex and cannot give a closed form solution and at the same time some of the numerical models show significant overestimation of crack widths compared with experimental results chernin et al 2012 besides the experimental and numerical studies considerable efforts have invested in using analytical methods to predict the cracking time and surface crack width in a concrete cover some researches employed the geometrical approaches by considering the configuration of cracks for example maruyama et al 1989 proposed an approach in which the movement of the concrete between cracks was treated as rigid and then cabrera 1996 developed this method further to include additional parameters such as thickness of the side concrete cover and the angle between the first and second cracks besides thoft christensen 2001 developed a new approach assuming that the increase in the volume of crack was equal to the volume of the rust produced at the concrete steel interface obviously these methods cannot reflect the mechanical response of concrete in corrosion process in order to solve this problem the other models tried to use mechanical methods to calculate the crack initiation and propagation through the evolutions of stress and strain in concrete for example li et al 2008 evaluated the stress in concrete and cracking time by using the complex variable method of muskhelishvili in which concrete around the rebar was modeled as an elastic infinite plane with a circular aperture as the most commonly used analytical models for predicting concrete cracking the thick walled cylinder models simplify concrete around the rebar into a cylinder of which the thickness is taken as the thinnest concrete cover the effect of rebar corrosion in concrete is represented by exposing internal pressures or displacements on the inner wall of the cylinder chernin and val 2010 lu et al 2011 this set of models has been developed for decades of years since bažant 1979 in bažant s model concrete was treated as a homogeneous linear elastic material and the expansion of corrosion products was modeled by a uniform increase in the diameter of the cylindrical hole around the rebar the concrete cover was assumed to totally crack when the average tensile stress becomes equal to the tensile strength of concrete however comparison with experimental data showed that the bažant s model significantly underestimated the time to crack initiation chernin and val 2010 nevertheless this pioneering work provided a new way for predicting the cracking of concrete cover induced by rebar corrosion after that a lot of modifications were performed on the thick walled cylinder model to make it better realize the corrosion process and better fit experimental results this paper first summarizes the procedure of calculating the service life of reinforced concrete structures by using the thick walled cylinder models then the development history of thick walled cylinder models is summed up and the characteristics of different thick walled cylinder models are analyzed after that the performances of these models are evaluated by comparing the predicted cracking times with collected test data and also the effects of controlling factors for cracking time of concrete are analyzed finally the limitations of the thick walled cylinder models are evaluated trying to figure out the possible improvements in future work 2 determination of service life of concrete structures the damage process of corrosion induced concrete cracking is plotted in fig 2 it can be seen that the initiation of rebar corrosion is a physical electrochemical process and generally there are two kinds of steel corrosion in reinforced concrete chloride induced corrosion and carbonation induced corrosion in the case of chloride induced corrosion chloride firstly penetrates through concrete cover and then accumulates around the rebar surface when the chloride content at the rebar surface reaches critical value the passive film will be destroyed while for carbonation induced corrosion the ph of concrete will decrease due to carbonization reaction at ph 11 5 the passive film becomes unstable and at ph 9 this film will be totally destroyed fick s second law is commonly used to describe the penetration and distribution of chloride ions in concrete the solution of fick s second law for one dimensional diffusion problem is expressed as follows wang et al 2016 1 c x t c 0 c s c 0 1 e r f x 2 d cl t where c x t is the chloride content at depth x and time t d cl is the chloride diffusion coefficient c s and c 0 are the surface and initial chloride contents respectively therefore the chloride content at any concrete depth and time can be determined based on eq 1 when the accumulated chloride content around the rebar reaches the critical value c cr the function can be stated as 2 t c 2 4 d cl e r f 1 1 c cr c 0 c s c 0 2 where c is the thickness of concrete cover while for carbonation induced corrosion fick s first law is generally used to describe the carbonation process and the time of corrosion initiation of steel bars could be determined as köliö et al 2014 3 t c k 2 where k refers to the carbonation coefficient after depassivation of the protective film the rebar begins to corrode as mentioned before the newly generated corrosion products will first fill the concrete pores around the rebar then the accumulated rust will impose pressure on surrounding concrete and induce tensile stress in tangential direction and cracks will initiate at the rebar concrete interface where the maximum tensile stress of concrete first reaches then these initial cracks propagate to concrete surface as inner cracks which cannot be detected from outside of the concrete cover finally these cracks reach concrete surface and become visual at a width about 50 μm andrade et al 1993 after that the surface cracks develop as long as corrosion continues it should be pointed out that the cracking of concrete cover is the interest of all the thick walled cylinder models but most of them do not concern about the propagation of surface crack this implies that most researchers prefer the cracking of concrete cover as the end of service life for structures however some authors argued that the corroded depth of rebar is very small and the performance of structure is slightly affected at the cracking time therefore they extended the model to make it possible to predict the development of surface crack li et al 2006 chen and xiao 2012 chen and alani 2013 su and zhang 2015 as an electro chemical process the corrosion amount w cor at any specific time can be calculated based on corrosion time and corrosion current density the corresponding time of this amount could be determined by faraday s law as follows 4 t n f i cor a w cor where i cor is corrosion current a is the relative atom mass of steel 55 85 g mol n is the valence of corrosion product of metal n 2 and 3 for ferrous and ferric irons respectively and f is the faraday s constant 9 65 104 c mol thus the time at cracking or reaching a critical crack width can be obtained as long as the corresponding corrosion amount has been determined 3 characteristics of thick walled cylinder models in this section firstly the development process of thick walled cylinder models is summed up and then the characteristics of different models are analyzed table 1 summarizes the symbols and abbreviations used in the following sections 3 1 development of the thick walled cylinder models the main mechanical characteristics of different thick walled cylinder models are listed in table 2 from this table it can be seen that about twenty different kinds of thick walled cylinder models with various assumptions have been proposed as stated before concrete cover firstly experiences an expansion period at elastic stage which is the same for all of the thick walled cylinder models and the classical elastic mechanical solutions for stress and displacement can be obtained by using the timoshenko theory these models start to differ at the moment when concrete around the steel bar reaches its tensile strength initial cracking according to their geometrical division of the concrete cylinder these models could be divided into single cylinder double cylinder and n ring models from table 2 it can be seen that for the single cylinder models of bažant 1979 liu and weyers 1998 and ei maaddawy and sudki 2007 concrete still keeps elastic after the moment when concrete at the concrete steel interface reaches its tensile strength and concrete cover is assumed to be fully cracked when the average tensile stress equals concrete tensile strength which is equivalent to assuming that the concrete is perfectly plastic by contrast in the single cylinder models of zhao and jin 2006 and lu et al 2011 the cracked concrete was assumed losing its tensile strength and thus no stress exists in tangential direction and the thick walled cylinder only composes of the sound concrete until the concrete finally crashed brittlely above models did not take cracks into consideration while in the models considering crack initiation and propagation cracks are treated as smeared morphology which are uniformly distributed in the cracked zone or discrete morphology which are called fictitious cracks in the double cylinder models using smeared crack assumption corrosion induced cracks are deemed to initiate at the concrete steel interface and propagate outward to the concrete surface simultaneously thus the concrete is divided into uncracked and cracked zones with the cracked zone propagating gradually from the concrete steel interface to the concrete surface as shown in table 2 the continuity conditions of stress and displacement at the boundary of the two concrete zones are used as compatibility conditions the main difference of these double cylinder models is the various constitutive relationships adopted for the cracked concrete for example in the model of xu et al 2007 the tangential stress in cracked concrete is simplified to be in a linear relationship with the radius of the cracked zone which ranges from 0 at the concrete steel interface to f t at the outer boundary of the cracked concrete while bhargava et al 2005 assumed that the cracked zone still kept isotropy but the elastic modulus decreased in terms of the softening stage of concrete constitutive relationship furthermore guzmán et al 2012 modified bhargava s model by treating the corrosion of rebar in concrete as a plain strain problem however in other double cylinder models cracked zone was assumed to be anisotropic at radial and tangential directions and different methods were proposed to ascertain the decreased elastic modulus stiffness in the tangential direction for example in the models of li et al 2006 and li and yang 2011 the stiffness reduction in tangential direction was calculated by the average tangential strain and average cracking strain over the cracked zone while in chernin et al 2010 the residual stiffness was estimated based on non linear fe analysis and a power relationship was regressed between the residual stiffness and the radial coordinate in the n ring models cracked concrete are also assumed to be anisotropic and the concrete section is divided into n rings in which the stiffness of each ring is determined according to its specific strain pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 lin et al 2010 shodja et al 2010 kiani and shodja 2011 wang et al 2014 thus the cracked and uncracked zones of concrete are no longer needed to be distinguished artificially and the solution for each ring could be calculated using finite difference method pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 lin et al 2010 or finite element method shodja et al 2010 kiani and shodja 2011 wang et al 2014 as a special n ring model zhao and jin 2011 used damage mechanics and the damage variable d v is calculated based on mohr coulomb failure criterion and mazar s damage model the stress and strain of the outer ring of cracked concrete d v 0 could be obtained first and then the inner rings could be calculated inwards in sequence for the models using fictitious crack assumption su and zhang 2015 chen and xiao 2012 chen and alani 2013 han and lee 2014 balafas and burgoyne 2011 zhong et al 2010 wang and liu 2004a 2004b all of them adopted double cylinder model in which the cracked zone is composed of several fictitious cracks and elastic concrete segments between them for the outer elastic cylinder the boundary conditions are the same with that of the models using smeared crack assumption while for the cracked zone the segment between two adjacent cracks are abstracted to establish the equilibrium equation with the pressures on the inner and outer walls of the segment and the stresses along the crack walls which are calculated according to the relationship of crack width and stress of concrete 3 2 classification of thick walled cylinder models the main characteristics of the thick walled cylinder models are classified in table 3 including the characteristics analyzed above these characteristics include 1 hypotheses for cracked concrete no tensile strength degradation of stiffness degradation of strength or totally plasticity 2 crack morphologies smeared crack or fictitious crack 3 hypotheses of constitutive law for cracked concrete linear bilinear exponential power softening or simply assume the stress in cracked concrete is linear with the radius 4 cylinder number single cylinder double cylinder or n rings 5 the ability of the model to calculate crack propagation at the concrete surface or not 6 rate of rust production constant or decreased model the constant model is based on faraday s law and the rust production is linear with the corrosion current while the decreased rate model is first proposed by liu and weyers 1998 which is according to the experimental observation that the rust production rate decreases with the thickness of rust layer 6 the values of involving parameters such as the rust volumetric expansion factor α thickness porous zone around rebar δ 0 ratio of rust penetration into racks k volume ratio of cracks occupied by rust to total cracks concrete creep coefficient ϕ valence of rust n and poison s ratio of concrete υ c this discrepancy in the values of these parameters occurs due to the fact that these parameters are time varying such as concrete creep coefficient or based on the production environment such as the rust volumetric expansion factor or cannot be precisely measured such as the porous zone around rebar ratio of rust penetration into racks and poison s ratio of concrete the valence of rust is an electrochemical parameter used to convert the rust amount into cracking time as in eq 4 it is determined by the type of rust for example it is 2 and 3 for ferrous and ferric irons respectively as stated in section 2 however due to the complexity of rust composition it is unable to accurately ascertain this value from table 3 it can be seen in most of these models the valence of rust n is set as 2 ferrous iron while in the model of zhong et al 2010 n is taken as 3 ferric iron and some other models such as lu et al 2011 li et al 2006 li and yang 2011 set n as 2 5 which is the average value of the valence of ferrous and ferric irons 4 the performances of thick walled cylinder models 4 1 comparison with test data for cracking time in order to evaluate the performances of different thick walled cylinder models 57 test data of corrosion induced cracking time of reinforced concrete specimens are collected in table 4 and the predicted values by part of the above models are presented the main input parameters include rebar diameter d concrete cover thickness c tensile strength f t elastic modulus e c and corrosion current density i corr as can be seen in table 4 in the accelerated corrosion tests 100 μa cm2 is a commonly used corrosion current density in order to shorten the test time although in natural conditions the corrosion current density is usually smaller than 1 μa cm2 in the model of liu and weyers 1998 two kinds of rust were considered thus both cases are calculated and also two porous zone thicknesses δ 0 10 μm and 20 μm of the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 and chernin et al 2010 are calculated respectively while in the model of pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 only the results using constant rate for rust production are present what s more the model of zhao and jin 2006 was originally proposed to predict the corrosion depth of rebar in order to compare with other models the corrosion depth is converted to cracking time by using faraday s law the detailed calculation method to convert corrosion depth to cracking time can be referred to appendix a due to the appearance of complex number in calculating process results of some specimens cannot be obtained however due to the large workload only part of the thick walled cylinder models are reproduced and verified with author s original results to broadly ascertain the performances of the thick walled cylinder models more work needs to be done all of the predicted cracking times are expressed as normalized values by dividing the corresponding test data in addition in order to show the predicting performances of these models clearly in one figure as shown in fig 3 the specimens from different tests are re numbered and used as the abscissa of fig 3 from table 4 and fig 3 it is clearly seen that the performances predicted are different for various models and test data the different performance for various models is due to their specific characteristics as summarized in section 3 2 on the whole the models of liu and weyers 1998 and zhao and jin 2006 have the largest discrepancies while the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 δ 0 20 μm and chernin et al 2010 δ 0 10 μm have relatively good performances in order to quantitatively assess the performances of the analytical models two indexes are introduced here the first one is the mean value m which is the average of the 57 predicted values of each model the second one is the deviation factor d which is the average of square of the difference between the predicted and test times the values of the two indexes for different models are listed in the bottom of table 4 it can be inferred that the model which has the mean value closer to 1 and the deviation factor closer to 0 can be treated as a good predicting model based on this principle the above models can be divided into three groups the first group includes the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 δ 0 20 μm and chernin et al 2010 δ 0 10 μm in which m is both 1 02 and d are 0 70 and 0 72 respectively these two models have the best predicting performances the second group includes the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 δ 0 10 μm chernin et al 2010 δ 0 20 μm lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 in which m is about 1 4 1 6 and d is about 1 3 1 9 these models can give relative good prediction results the third group includes the models of liu and weyers 1998 pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 and zhao and jin 2006 in which m and d both have large gaps with 1 and 0 respectively therefore these models cannot predict the cracking time of concrete cover accurately by using the least square method the performance of these models can be improved by optimizing the parameters for different models with different values based on the collected test data the detailed calculation process can be referred to appendix b 4 2 parameter analysis of controlling factors for concrete cracking the main parameters controlling the corrosion induced cracking of concrete include geometrical parameters concrete cover thickness c and rebar diameter d material parameters porous zone thickness δ 0 and concrete creep coefficient ϕ mechanical parameters tensile strength f t and elastic modulus e c rust parameter rust volumetric expansion factor α and electrochemical parameter corrosion current density i corr in order to show the influences of these parameters on cracking time the specimen of andrade et al 1993 which has f t 3 55 mpa e c 22 gpa d 16 mm c 20 mm and exposed by a corrosion current density of 100 μa cm2 is selected as the reference specimen and the relationships of the cracking time and these controlling parameters by different models are plotted in fig 4 the results of zhao and jin 2006 are not presented due to the reason that complex numbers appear in the results of some cases from fig 4 it can be seen that 1 except rebar diameter the trends of other parameters on the cracking time for different models are the same saying that the cracking time extends with the increase of concrete cover thickness tensile strength porous zone thickness and creep coefficient while it decreases with the increase of concrete elastic modulus rust expansion factor and corrosion current density 2 for rebar diameter the results of liu and weyers 1998 el maaddawy and soudki 2007 pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 and chernin et al 2010 show that the cracking time increase with the increase of rebar diameter while those of lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 show an opposite trend however the former trend is inconsistent with the test data such as the data of mullard and stewart 2011 3 the model of liu and weyers 1998 has the largest variation for each parameter mainly because it used a decreased rust production rate model which can largely prolong the cracking time while the other models used a constant one the quantitative effects of the influencing parameters on predicted cracking time by the analytical models are listed in table 5 which is converted from the data in fig 4 and expressed as the relative change of the predicted cracking time at the two endpoint values of each parameter for example in liu and weyers model when rebar diameter increases from 12 mm to 32 mm the normalized cracking time increases from 1 8 to 6 5 thus the influence of the rebar diameter on predicted cracking time of liu and weyers model is calculated as 6 5 1 8 1 8 100 351 then all the parameters can be sorted on the impact level by comparing the averaged results of all models for each parameter the order of each parameter is listed in the last column of table 5 it can be seen that in the analyzed ranges of these parameters corrosion current density exhibits the most significant effect followed by rust expansion factor and concrete cover thickness they can be regarded as the control parameters for estimating the cracking time of concrete cover 5 limitations of thick walled cylinder models although certain agreements have been found by comparing the thick walled cylinder models to experimental data some primary limitations of these models still exist 1 homogeneity assumption of concrete cannot well represent the heterogeneous property of such a composite material in all of the above models the crack initiate at the concrete steel interface acturally due to the weak strength crack may also initiate at the aggregate mortar interface itz 2 smeared crack assumption is not able to distinguish the crack pattern of concrete from cracking spalling or delamination however this pattern is important to assess the risk of corroded structures 3 the restrained effect of surrounding concrete outside the cylinder zone is ignored in most of these models except the model of su and zhang 2015 in which the confinement of the surrounding concrete is considered by enlarging the cylinder radius and the enlargement was determined by comparing the cracking times obtained from the thick walled cylinder model with experimental results it was found the enlargement could reach 1 6 times of the original radius of concrete 4 in fact corner rebars usually break down earlier than middle rebars but this effect has not been considered in the above models nor the interaction between multi rebars 5 the corrosion problem is assumed to be a 2d problem whether for a plain stress liu and weyers 1998 lu et al 2011 or a plain strain guzmán et al 2012 problem however non uniform corrosion may occur along the length of rebar in the experiment of torres acosta and sagüés 2004 the influence of non uniform corrosion lengths was studied and it was found that the cracking time decreased with the increase of corrosion length which could be seen from the results of specimen 50 52 the corrosion lengths are 19 1 41 5 and 346 mm respectively of torres acosta and sagüés 2004 in table 4 6 all of these analytical models assumed that concrete cracks at the time when tangential stress reaches tensile strength however concrete cover also bears compression stress at the radial direction as shown in table 2 which means that concrete is in a biaxial stress state and the crack may appear at a value smaller than the tensile strength due to the effect of radial compression stress 7 theoretically speaking the stress strain and displacement should keep continuity at the boundary of the cracked and uncracked concrete however some models only considered part of these compatibility conditions for example strain compatibility is not ensured in the model of bhargava et al 2005 chernin et al 2010 8 although many models adopted decreased rate assumption for rust production this consideration violates faraday s law of electrolysis chernin et al 2010 9 as stated in section 3 2 some parameters such as the rust volumetric expansion factor porous zone thickness and creep coefficient have different values in various models and these differences have significant effects on the cracking time of concrete cover as shown in fig 4 10 acturally the reinforced concrete members must be loaded and the interaction between the sustainable load and corrosion is under study in recent years ye et al 2018 however only the model of li and yang 2011 considered the load effect in the thick walled models from a case with the applied load of 40 kn m on a reinforced concrete structure it was found the cracking time decreased 7 1 when considering the load effect from above analysis these limitations can be summarized as the ill considerations of material assumption heterogeneity of concrete corrosion morphology non uniform corrosion along the rebar applied load rebar conditions corner rebar or multi rebars constitutive law of concrete biaxial stress state mechanical compatibility conditions principle of electrochemistry decreased rate model for rust production and the values of involving parameters rust volumetric expansion factor porous zone thickness and creep coefficient 6 summary and conclusion this paper first summarized the procedure of calculating the service life of reinforced concrete structures by using the thick walled cylinder models then the development history of thick walled cylinder models was summed up and the characteristics of different thick walled cylinder models were analyzed after that the performances of these models were evaluated by comparing the predicted cracking times with collected test data and the effects of controlling factors for cracking time of concrete were also presented finally the limitations of these models were analyzed based on these analyses the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the main characteristics of these models include different assumptions and constitutive laws for cracked concrete number of cylinders hypotheses of cracks morphologies the ability to calculate surface crack propagation or not and the different values of some involving parameters such as rust volumetric expansion factor and concrete creep coefficient 2 it is found that among the evaluated models el maaddawy and soudki 2007 with δ 0 20 μm and chernin et al 2010 with δ 0 10 μm have the best predicting performances and the models of el maaddawy and soudki 2007 with δ 0 10 μm chernin et al 2010 with δ 0 20 μm lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 can give relative good predicting results while the models of liu and weyers 1998 pantazopoulou and papoulia 2001 and zhao and jin 2006 cannot predict the cracking time of concrete cover accurately 3 the cracking time of all of the evaluated models extends with the increase of concrete cover thickness tensile strength porous zone thickness and creep coefficient while it decreases with the increase of concrete elastic modulus rust volumetric expansion factor and corrosion current density however for rebar diameter different trends are obtained from various models and the results of lu et al 2011 and guzmán et al 2012 agree with the test phenomenon that the cracking time decrease with the increase of rebar diameter 4 the main limitations of these models include the ill considerations of heterogeneity of concrete material non uniform corrosion along rebar applied load corner rebar or multi rebars conditions biaxial stress state of concrete compatibility

supported by the opening project of state key laboratory of green building materials 2018 and the fundamental research funds for the central universities of people s republic of china their supports are gratefully acknowledged appendix a method to convert corrosion depth to cracking time the thick walled cylinder models discussed in the present paper are focused on the uniform corrosion the configuration for uniform corrosion of rebar after corrosion is plotted in fig a1 the corroded area of the rebar a cor could be calculated by geometrical relationship a 1 a cor d 0 2 d 0 x 2 where d 0 is the original rebar diameter and x is the corrosion depth the mass loss of the corroded rebar w cor is a 2 w cor ρ s a cor l where l is the length of rebar and ρ s is the density of steel the corrosion cracking time tcr can be calculated by w cor through faraday s law as shown in eq 4 appendix b method to improve the performance of analytical models the performance of the analytical models are tried to be improved by optimizing the values of the parameters which have different values for different models and the values of these parameters are back calculated by using the least square method two points are considered 1 two parameters are considered in the back calculation process i e the rust expansion factor and porous zone thickness acturally there are many other parameters with different values such as the valence of rust rust elastic modulus and creep coefficient in different analytical models as stated in section 3 2 here the rust expansion factor and porous zone thickness are selected because they have relatively significant effects on the cracking time of concrete cover as shown in fig 4 another important reason is that these two parameters are included in most of the analytical models in contrast rust elastic modulus is only contained in part of these models 2 some of these analytical models are too complex to be back calculated thus here only the simple and explicit models are improved by using the least square method including the models of liu and weyers 1998 ei maddawy and soudiki et al 2007 and lu et al 2011 the best values of these two parameters are the ones which minimize the sum of square of the relative differences between the predictive values and the test data i e the deviation factor d the calculation formula of the least square method is expressed as b 1 d min min 1 n i 1 n t i α δ 0 t i t i 2 where n is the total specimen number n 57 and t i is the tested cracking time of each specimen t i α δ 0 is the calculated cracking time of each specimen after substituting different values of α and δ 0 into each analytical models and d min is the minimum value of the average of the square of the relative differences according to the above method the test data of each specimen are substituted in eq b 1 and the optimal values of d min for various models are obtained and listed in table b1 the performance of these analytical models with original and modified values of α and δ0 is plotted in fig b1 it can be seen that on the whole the predicted cracking times of these specimens are closed to the test data when using the modified values of α and δ0 especially for those originally having very large scatters such as specimen 28 34 42 table b1 optimal parameter values and deviation factor for each analytical model table b1 items

21624,extracting wave energy is a promising solution for renewable energy production because of the high energy intensity of ocean waves when compared to other renewable energy resources on another front of ocean utilization large floating platforms are an effective solution for creating artificial space on the sea for various purposes such as airports seaports aquaculture platforms and recreation and residential areas integrating wave energy converters with large floating platforms brings many benefits owing to space sharing cost sharing and multiple functions of the integrated system this paper presents a literature review of wave energy converter and large floating platform integration overviews of wave energy and large floating platform technologies are first presented this is followed by a review of various integrated systems between wave energy converters and large floating platforms a brief on hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems and some recommendations for future studies keywords ocean energy utilization ocean space utilization wave energy converter large floating platform integrated system hydrodynamic analysis 1 introduction renewable energy has become more attractive because of low carbon emissions associated with renewable energy production and depletions of non renewable energy resources such as oil gas and coal among various types of renewable energy wave energy possesses many positive features including i the wave energy intensity is much higher than the intensity of some other types of renewable energy such as solar energy and wind energy clément et al 2002 lópez et al 2013 e g it was claimed that the intensity is about 2 3 kw m2 for wave energy 0 4 0 6 kw m2 for wind energy and 0 1 0 2 kw m2 for solar energy lópez et al 2013 ii wave energy resources are enormous e g when compared to the electricity consumption as seen in fig 1 gunn and stock williams 2012 iii co2 emissions associated with wave energy generation have been claimed to be very low when compared to those associated with non renewable energy generation smaller than those associated with solar energy generation and rather comparable to those associated with wind energy generation parker et al 2007 thorpe 1999 iv wave conditions can be well predicted ahead of the time lópez et al 2013 sheng 2019 the predicted incoming waves can be used for operational planning pinson et al 2012 v wave energy converters wecs can generate power up to 90 of the time while wind and solar energy converters can generate power only up to 30 of the time lópez et al 2013 sheng 2019 despite great efforts have been invested in the research and development of wecs since the 1970s global oil crisis falcão 2010 the current wave energy technology is not economically competitive when compared to other renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar energy technologies clément et al 2002 lópez et al 2013 the electricity generated from ocean waves using the current wave energy technology is more expensive than the electricity generated from other sources of energy astariz and iglesias 2015 a promising way to reduce the cost of electricity generated from ocean waves is to minimize costs of installation mooring foundation operation and maintenance astariz and iglesias 2015 irena 2014 this cost component accounts for about 40 50 of wave energy project life costs bedard et al 2005 irena 2014 in order to reduce costs of installation mooring foundation operation and maintenance wecs may be integrated with other purpose marine structures irena 2014 mustapa et al 2017 the integration also brings other benefits including i increasing wec reliability because other purpose marine structures can provide additional strength to wecs to operate in strong wave conditions and moving wec components can be minimized by placing some wec components on other purpose marine structures mustapa et al 2017 ii reducing mooring foundation footprints and hence limiting negative environmental impact because wecs can share mooring foundation with other purpose marine structures iii increasing the efficiency in using ocean space because the ocean space is used for multiple purposes owing to these enormous benefits the integration between wave energy converters and other purpose marine structures has received a lot of attention extensive studies have been carried out for integrated systems between wecs and i floating wind turbines pérez collazo et al 2015 ii bottom founded breakwaters mustapa et al 2017 iii floating breakwaters zhao et al 2019 iv conventional offshore floating platforms taghipour and moan 2008 or v ship like platforms wang et al 2018 on another front of ocean utilization large floating platforms have been used or proposed to be used for various applications lamas pardo et al 2015 suzuki 2005 wang and wang 2014 typical examples include floating runways watanabe et al 2004a mobile offshore bases remmers et al 1998 floating bridges watanabe 2003 floating piers jung et al 2020 kusaka and ueda 2014 floating breakwaters kusaka and ueda 2014 floating ports ahn et al 2013 ocean thermal energy

floating oil storage facilities dai et al 2019 when compared to the conventional land reclamation method large floating platforms possess the following advantages for creating artificial space from the sea i low construction costs for deep seas and soft seabeds ii short construction time iii being easy for expansion and downsizing iv mobility v being immune to rising sea levels due to global warming and vi being ecofriendly wang and wang 2014 motivated by these various applications and advantages of large floating platforms maeda et al 2001 2000 mooted the integration between wecs with large floating platforms besides bringing along some benefits as discussed earlier such an integration also brings the following benefits i reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform because wecs play a role as wave energy absorbers ii improving the wave attenuation performance of large floating platforms if used as breakwaters and iii providing power supply for operations on the platform when compared to integrated systems between conventional platforms e g used in oil and gas exploration or floating breakwaters and wecs integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs generally have several distinct properties firstly dimensions of large floating platforms are up to a few hundred meters or even kilometres tables 1 and 2 on the other hand the dimensions of conventional platforms are usually not larger than 100 m palo 2014 secondly large floating platforms are usually flexible the flexibility of large floating platforms results from two sources i the flexibility of connections between platform modules and ii elastic deformations of large floating platforms under applied loads and wave action in detail for ease of manufacturing transportation and installation large floating platforms usually consist of several modules joined together the connections between platform modules are not necessarily rigid but may be flexible suzuki et al 2006 when flexible connections are used the entire large floating platform cannot be regarded as a rigid body as for a conventional floating rigid platform because their responses under action of external loads are different figs 2 a and b on the other hand elastic deformations instead of rigid body motions of large floating platforms see fig 2c need to be considered when the length of the platform is larger than the wavelength and the characteristic length λ c 2 π d ρ w g 1 4 where d is the flexural rigidity of the platform ρ w is the mass density of water g is the gravitational acceleration suzuki et al 2006 1998 prompted by the enormous benefits when integrating wecs with large floating platforms researchers have developed various integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms since the early 2000s this review paper provides readers with the background information on large floating platform and wave energy converter technologies sec 2 and sec 3 respectively various wec and large floating platform integrated systems sec 4 a brief on hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems sec 5 and some recommendations for future studies sec 6 2 overview of large floating platform technology large floating platforms can be categorized into two main types pontoon type floating platforms and semi submersible type floating platforms wang and wang 2014 semi submersible floating platforms are partly raised above the sea level by using column tubes or air cushions an example of semi submersible floating platforms supported by column tubes is the mobile offshore base mob fig 3 a while an example of semi submersible floating platforms supported by air cushions is the pneumatically stabilized platform psp fig 3b semi submersible floating platforms are generally able to withstand strong waves and usually preferred for intermediate or harsh wave conditions lamas pardo et al 2015 in order to restrain horizontal motions of semi submersible large floating platforms mooring lines or tethers may be used figs 4 a and b pontoon type large floating platforms are like giant plates resting on the water surface they are characterized by their small depth to width ratios when compared to semi submersible floating platforms pontoon type floating platforms possess some superior properties such as high stability low manufacturing and maintenance costs wang and wang 2014 practical examples of pontoon type floating platforms are presented in table 1 and fig 5 a general application of this type of platforms is presented in fig 6 which shows a general mega float system consisting of four main components a large floating platform superstructures an access bridge and a mooring system mooring lines or tethers figs 4a and b may be used to restrain horizontal motions of pontoon type platforms however these types of mooring systems are usually not suitable for relatively shallow water or when a tight constraint on horizontal motions of platforms is required for such conditions pier quay wall systems or dolphin frameguide mooring systems figs 4c and d are usually adopted wang and tay 2011 pontoon type floating platforms are usually deployed in benign wave conditions for a higher energy environment pontoon type floating platforms may be protected by bottom founded breakwaters fig 7 a however the use of bottom founded breakwaters has some drawbacks such as the requirement of massive construction destruction of the marine eco system and disruption of water flow wang et al 2010 to overcome these drawbacks many other methods for reducing hydrodynamic responses of pontoon type large floating platforms have been proposed wang et al 2010 these methods include the use of floating breakwaters tay et al 2009 vertical mooring lines nguyen et al 2018 floating horizontal plates kim et al 2005 submerged vertical plates ohta et al 1999 submerged horizontal plates watanabe et al 2003 submerged inclined plates cheng et al 2016 takaki and nishikawa 2001 flexible connections between platform modules riyansyah et al 2010 gao et al 2011 and large submerged horizontal plates underneath the platform mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 see figs 7b i 3 overview of wave energy converter technology modern wave energy converters wecs may be categorized as follows oscillating water column owc wecs oscillating body wecs and overtopping wecs babarit 2017 falcão 2010 falnes 2007 an owc wec consists of a semi submerged chamber that keeps a trapped air column above a water column fig 8 a under wave action the water column rises and falls making the trapped air flow through an air turbine such as a wells turbine fig 9 a to generate electricity the main advantage of owc wecs is that their designs are simple and usually reliable this is because owc wecs usually have only one major moving component and that is the air turbine however it was reported that the wave energy extraction efficiency of owc wecs hitherto has not been high and is currently being improved irena 2014 this disadvantage of owc wecs may result from large dimensions of air chambers alcorn 2013 and the fact that the efficiency of air turbines is not high when compared to the efficiency of other pto systems irena 2014 examples of owc wecs are the pico plant brito melo et al 2008 and the mutriku plant torre enciso et al 2009 see fig 10 an overtopping wec comprises a water reservoir structure fig 8b the water inside the reservoir structure is restored at a higher level than the water outside the reservoir structure the potential energy of the collected water above the surface of the water outside the reservoir structure is transformed into electricity by using a hydro turbine such as the kaplan turbine fig 9b overtopping wecs are generally simple but the dimensions of the water reservoir structure are usually large irena 2014 examples of owc wecs are the wave dragon kofoed et al 2006 and the sea slot cone generator margheritini et al 2009 see fig 11 regarding oscillating body wecs ob wecs the main energy conversion mechanism of these wave energy converters is to transform the relative motion between oscillating bodies or between one oscillating body and one fixed body e g foundation at the seabed into electricity hydraulic or direct drive power take off pto systems figs 9c and d may be adopted for ob wecs têtu 2017 the main advantage of ob wecs generally lies in their high wave energy extraction efficiency babarit et al 2012 irena 2014 this superior property results from large motions of oscillating bodies at resonance i e when the natural frequency of oscillating bodies is close to the incident wave frequency however due to large motions of oscillating bodies the survivability and reliability of ob wecs are usually big problems especially when ob wecs are deployed in offshore conditions lópez et al 2013 some examples of oscillating body wecs are heaving wecs or the ceto wec babarit et al 2004 carnegie 2019 oscillating wave surge converters or the oyster wec renzi and dias 2013 whittaker and folley 2012 and raft wecs or the pelamis wec haren and mei 1979 yemm et al 2012 see figs 8c e and fig 12 4 wec and large floating platform integrated systems integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs may be categorized as i pontoon type platforms with owc wecs ii pontoon type platforms with ob wecs iii semi submersible platforms with owc wecs and iv semi submersible platforms with ob wecs 4 1 pontoon type platforms with owc wecs the idea to integrate owc wecs with pontoon type large floating platforms was mooted by maeda et al 2001 2000 these initial studies focused on reductions in hydrodynamic responses of a platform by using embedded owc units at both the fore and the aft of the platform fig 13 or around the perimeter of the platform the latter arrangement of owc units should be preferred when incident waves come from any direction if incident waves come from one direction the former arrangement of owc units may be preferred so as to reduce hydrodynamic responses of the fore and the aft because the responses of these portions are largest over the entire platform e g see nguyen et al 2018 another possible arrangement of owc units is to be placed only at the fore of the platform however this possible arrangement was not considered for comparison with the arrangement of owc units placed at both the fore and the aft the experimental and numerical results showed that owc units are effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform e g the vertical displacement of the fore may be reduced by up to about 70 maeda et al 2001 subsequent studies on the use of embedded owc units hong and kyoung 2007 kyoung and hong 2009 showed that reductions in hydrodynamic responses of platforms are significantly affected by pto damping and there exists an optimal pto damping for maximizing reductions of hydrodynamic responses of platforms this is because by using an appropriate value of pto damping the amount of incident waves absorbed for power production can be maximized ning et al 2016 thereby minimizing the amount of incident waves transmitted in order to achieve high reductions in hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms multiple owc units are proposed fig 14 a ikoma et al 2015 maeda et al 2001 alternatively a combination between owc units and the mitigating methods presented in fig 6 may be adopted examples of such a combination are i the use of submerged vertical plates and owc units fig 14b ikoma et al 2002 as a portion of incident waves is reflected from the submerged vertical plate additional reductions in hydrodynamic responses of the platform can be achieved ii the use of sacrificial platforms and owc units fig 14c hong and kyoung 2007 kyoung and hong 2009 iii the use of floating breakwaters and owc units fig 14d shigemitsu et al 2001 wang et al 2010 in addition to the use of the above mentioned embedded owc units floating owc breakwaters have been used to reduce hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms hong et al 2006 hong and hong 2007 owc breakwaters can be placed at a distance in front of but without connection to the platform hong et al 2006 however owc breakwaters connected with the fore of platforms by hinges fig 15 a hong and hong 2007 may be preferable as such a design does not require an additional mooring system similar to embedded owc units maeda et al 2001 2000 owc breakwaters are generally effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of platforms under action of short and intermediate waves but they are not effective for long waves e g fig 15b this property of owc breakwaters is generally similar to that of a conventional floating breakwater where its effectiveness in attenuating wave energy is limited for long waves zhao et al 2019 however when compared to an equivalent conventional floating breakwater an owc breakwater is generally more effective in attenuating wave energy owing to the presence of pto damping zhao et al 2019 the benefit of pto damping to hydrodynamic responses of platforms can be also seen in fig 15b which shows that reductions in responses of platforms can be improved by using an appropriate value of pto damping besides the function to reduce hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms the embedded owc units and the owc breakwater have another function and that is to produce power only the power capture factor i e power produced incident wave power see sec 5 1 associated with embedded owc units has been presented by ikoma et al 2015 2012 2002 and maeda et al 2000 their results showed that owc units are effective for extracting wave energy for example the power capture factor is up to about 0 5 for the design shown in fig 13a a larger power capture factor may be achieved by placing a submerged vertical plate right after the fore owc unit fig 14b ikoma et al 2002 this is because the interference between the incident wave and the wave reflected from the submerged vertical plate may amplify the height of the oscillating wave column the results for the design shown in fig 13a maeda et al 2000 also showed that as the wave period increases the power capture factor generally first increases and then decreases after reaching its maximum value e g as seen in fig 16 the range of wave periods where the power capture factor is considerable e g larger than a user defined value δ may be called the effective wave energy extraction bandwidth see fig 16 the bandwidth for the design with a single owc unit can be widened by using multiple owc units as shown in fig 14a ikoma et al 2015 2012 this is because the power capture factors associated with different owc units reach their maximum values at different wave periods ikoma et al 2012 thus the resulting power capture factor associated with multiple owc units has multiple peaks at different wave periods ikoma et al 2015 2012 the wide effective wave energy extraction bandwidth has also been observed for stand alone owc wecs with multiple chambers ning et al 2019 4 2 pontoon type platforms with ob wecs by adopting the design of raft wecs and the use of horizontal plates connected to the fore of platforms as shown in fig 7d tay 2017 proposed a raft wec type attachment for extracting wave energy as well as reducing hydrodynamic responses of pontoon type large floating platforms the raft wec type attachment consists of a single wide auxiliary pontoon e g 60 m in width connected to the fore of a large platform with hinges and pto systems the relative rotation between the single wide pontoon and the fore of the platform is utilized for power production nguyen et al 2019a proposed a modular raft wec type attachment by replacing the single wide auxiliary pontoon of the raft wec type attachment by multiple independent narrow pontoons fig 17 when compared to the raft wec type attachment the modular raft wec type attachment possesses several advantages including i easier for installation and manufacturing owing to the modularity in the design ii more flexible for expansion and downsizing iii more reliable because the attachment with multiple pontoons has a higher redundancy iv more effective in extracting wave energy and reducing hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms under action of oblique waves if wavelengths are comparable to the overall width of the attachment nguyen et al 2019a sarkar et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2017 when compared to the horizontal plates connected to the fore of a large platform by hinge or rigid connections the modular raft wec type attachment is more effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform nguyen et al 2019a this is because a portion of incident waves can be transformed into useful energy owing to the use of pto systems the modular raft wec type attachment or the raft wec type attachment possesses high wave energy extraction efficiency for relatively short waves e g the power capture factor is up to about 0 7 nguyen et al 2019b reductions in hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms are also high for short waves e g the vertical displacement at the fore of the platform can be reduced up to 80 for wave periods less than 6 s nguyen et al 2019b higher wave energy extraction efficiency or higher reductions in hydrodynamic responses of platforms can be achieved by adjusting the number of platform modules and the module connection stiffness nguyen et al 2019b however if module connection design is altered for improving power production reductions in hydrodynamic responses of platforms are generally compromised and vice versa nguyen et al 2019b the modular raft wec type attachment or the raft wec type attachment has several disadvantages including i the power capture factor is rather limited for long waves nguyen et al 2019b this is because the motions of the auxiliary pontoon and the fore of the large platform oscillate in almost the same phase for long waves resulting in a small relative rotation tay 2017 ii the required length of auxiliary pontoons is heavily dependent on the wavelength λ e g the auxiliary pontoon length is about λ 3 for maximum power output nguyen et al 2019a hence the required auxiliary pontoon length is large for long waves long auxiliary pontoons may result in high material costs and a large pto damping coefficient this is because the optimal pto damping coefficient for maximum power production is heavily dependent on the auxiliary pontoon length nguyen et al 2019a for raft wecs the optimal pto damping coefficient is proportional to the wavelength but to the cube of the pontoon length zheng et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 and ren et al 2019 proposed the use of embedded pto systems in between platform modules fig 18 the relative rotation between adjacent platform modules is utilized for power production similar to the power capture factor associated with the raft wec type attachment the power capture factor associated with embedded pto systems was found to be high up to about 0 6 for short waves zhang et al 2019 when compared to large floating platforms with the raft wec type attachment large floating platforms with embedded pto systems do not require auxiliary pontoons thereby reducing material costs however the reported reductions in hydrodynamic responses of the platform owing to the use of embedded pto systems are generally less significant than those for the case where the raft wec type attachment is used nguyen et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 in terms of wave energy extraction placing pto systems between platform modules may be not preferred for platforms having stringent motion requirements e g for a floating runway where the slope of the platform must be less than 1 suzuki 2005 this is because the power produced by embedded pto systems should be small due to the small motions of such platforms for such platforms if the modular raft wec type attachment nguyen et al 2019a is used the power produced may be still considerable as the auxiliary pontoons can be designed for maximizing their motions by adopting the design of oscillating wave surge converters and the use of a submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore of platform as in fig 7e nguyen and wang 2020a proposed an owsc type attachment comprising a submerged vertical flap connected to the fore of the platform with hinges and pto systems fig 19 the owsc type attachment possesses a wide effective energy extraction bandwidth the power capture factor is considerable for most wave periods e g up to 0 55 for wave period t 9 s and up to 0 2 for t 16 s nguyen and wang 2020a for maximum power production the required flap length is only about λ 10 which is much smaller than the required pontoon length for the raft wec type attachment about λ 3 another advantage of the owsc type attachment is that it is very effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of platforms under action of short waves because a large portion of short waves is reflected from the submerged vertical flap when compared to the submerged vertical flap rigidly connected to the fore of a platform the owsc type attachment is more effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform nguyen and wang 2020a the owsc type attachment has two main disadvantages i the use of the submerged vertical flap may result in increasing significantly the horizontal wave force acting on the structure and hence on the mooring system however the increase in the horizontal wave force when using the owsc type attachment is less significant than that using the submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore of the platform nguyen and wang 2020a ii the effectiveness of this attachment in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform is negligible for long waves nguyen and wang 2020a this property is inherited from the corresponding mitigating method that consists of a submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore of platforms masanobu et al 2003 ohta et al 1999 nguyen et al 2020a studied a two mode wec type attachment comprising both submerged vertical and floating horizontal plates connected to the fore of large floating platforms with hinges and pto systems fig 20 fig 21 shows the variations of the power capture factor cf and the reduction in vertical displacement of the fore of the platform hr a mode configuration is represented by three letters involving v for a submerged vertical plate and h for a floating horizontal plate if a mode configuration is vhv the arrangement of six auxiliary plates is vhvvhv as shown in fig 20 fig 21 shows that the two mode attachment possesses good wave energy extraction and hydrodynamic response mitigation performances for a wide range of wave periods these properties result from the combination of the performances of the submerged vertical plates and the floating horizontal plates the two mode attachment also shows a good balance between wave energy extraction and hydrodynamic response mitigation nguyen et al 2020a nguyen and wang 2020b proposed heaving wec type attachments to pontoon type large floating platforms each heaving wec type attachment consists of a pto system connected to the platform at one end and to the seabed at the other end fig 22 the heaving motion relative to the seabed is utilized for power production when compared to other wec type attachments heaving wec type attachments may be more suitable for sites where incident waves come from various directions this is because the heaving motions or vertical displacements of platforms should be considerable for all incident wave angles whereas the relative rotations between auxiliary pontoons or submerged vertical flaps and the fore of platforms are generally negligible for large oblique waves heaving wec type attachments are also better than other wec type attachments in extracting wave energy and reducing hydrodynamic responses of platforms under action of long waves nguyen and wang 2020b however the use of heaving wec type attachments requires additional foundations which may be costly for platforms having stringent motion requirements heaving wec type attachments may be not preferred for extracting wave energy as the power produced should be small due to the small motions of such platforms 4 3 semi submersible platforms with owc wecs crema et al 2015 and crema 2017 conducted experimental studies on semi submersible large floating platforms supported by multiple air cushions and integrated with owc wecs fig 23 their studies investigate how the power capture factor and the hydrodynamic response of platforms are affected by various design parameters of owc wecs as well as wave conditions experimental results showed that the power capture factor is high up to 0 8 and the hydrodynamic responses of platforms can also be reduced effectively owing to the integrated owc wecs crema 2017 float inc 2019b proposed integrating rho cee wecs with pneumatically stabilized platforms fig 24 functioned as offshore security ports the rho cee wec consists of three chambers of different sizes fig 25 similar to the integrated system with multiple owc units mentioned in sec 4 1 the integrated system with rho cee wecs is effective in extracting wave energy for a wide range of wave periods owing to the use of multiple chambers currently the energy restored in the oscillating wave columns is transformed into the up and down motions of rafts and then converted into useful energy by hydraulic pto systems future approach may involve using pneumatic pto systems as in conventional owc wecs brown 2014 4 4 semi submersible platforms with ob wecs zhang et al 2017 2016 suggested placing pto systems in between the upper deck and supporting floating columns see fig 26 a portion of the relative vertical displacement between the upper deck and floating columns can be transformed into useful energy and the vertical displacement of the upper deck can be reduced at the same time zhang et al 2017 2016 showed that this integrated system is rather effective in extracting wave energy e g the power capture factor is up to 0 2 in head sea conditions moreover this integrated system has the following advantageous features i auxiliary structures are not required because pto systems can be installed in between the upper deck and the supporting floating columns ii the system may be suitable for sites where incident waves come from various directions as discussed for the heaving wec type attachment however installation and maintenance for pto systems may be difficult because pto systems are underneath the upper deck recently zhang et al 2019 2018 suggested placing pto systems in between semi submersible platform modules as shown in fig 27 this integrated system is effective in reducing the pitching motions of the platform because the relative pitch motion between adjacent platform modules is transformed into useful energy similar to pontoon type platforms with embedded pto systems placed in between platform modules this integrated system furnishes a high power capture factor which may exceed unity for modules of 300 m in length zhang et al 2018 however the corresponding optimal pto damping coefficient for maximum power production is very large e g 1010 n m much larger than the conventional upper limit e g 4 108 n m for pto damping coefficient used for stand alone wecs babarit et al 2011 if the pto damping coefficient is limited to 108 n m the power capture factor becomes small e g less than 0 1 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for platforms having stringent motion requirements placing pto systems between platform modules zhang et al 2018 or between the upper deck and supporting columns zhang et al 2016 may be not preferred for extracting wave energy this is because the power produced should be small due to the small motions of such platforms the guangzhou institute of energy conversion giec 2019 built a semi submersible aquaculture platform sharp eagle wecs sheng et al 2017 consisting of multiple auxiliary pontoons are connected to the fore of the platform fig 28 the wave energy extraction mechanism of this integrated system is relatively similar to that of the integrated system between pontoon type large floating platforms and modular raft wecs as described in sec 4 2 the performance in terms of wave energy extraction and reduction in hydrodynamic responses of the semi submersible platform is not available in the public domain 5 brief on hydrodynamic analysis of large floating platforms with wecs hydrodynamic analysis of integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs is basically similar to that of large floating platforms palo 2005 watanabe et al 2004a or of stand alone wecs falcão and henriques 2016 sheng 2019 however it requires a special consideration on flexibility of large floating platforms if the conventional hydrodynamic analysis of stand alone wecs is adopted or on pto systems if the conventional hydrodynamic analysis of large floating platforms is adopted these special considerations are discussed in this section basic assumptions and equations for hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems are also presented 5 1 basic assumptions and equations hydrodynamic analysis can be performed in the frequency domain or in the time domain the frequency domain analysis is fast and is preferable for linear hydrodynamic analysis the time domain analysis needs to be carried out when considering transient responses of the structure or nonlinearities due to pto systems liu et al 2017 wave forces kyoung et al 2006 mooring forces ni et al 2018 or the compressibility of the air trapped in chambers of owc wecs pawitan et al 2019 viviano et al 2019 current research studies on integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs focus only on the frequency domain analysis hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems in the frequency domain is usually carried out with the following assumptions i the structure has an isotropic homogeneous and linear elastic material and the motions of the structure are small ii the fluid is inviscid and incompressible the fluid flow is irrotational and the wave amplitude is small where the linear wave theory is applicable iii the behaviour of pto systems is linear where the pto force is proportional to the pto velocity and displacement and iv mooring forces are proportional to motions of the structure and hence the mooring system can be modelled as a linear spring system in the frequency domain the equation of motion for the integrated systems may be written as nguyen et al 2019a 1 ω 2 m m a i ω c d k k rf k m u f exc f pto where ω is the angular frequency of the incident wave i the imaginary unit i 2 1 m the global mass matrix k the global stiffness matrix of the structure m a the global matrix of added mass c d the global hydrodynamic damping matrix f exc the global vector comprising frequency dependent complex amplitudes of wave forces k m the global mooring stiffness matrix k rf the global restoring stiffness matrix kim et al 2013 senjanović et al 2008 f pto the global vector comprising frequency dependent complex amplitudes of linear pto forces babarit et al 2012 sheng 2019 and u the vector consisting of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of displacements of the structure the hydrodynamic matrices m a c d f exc can be obtained based on the linear wave theory where the velocity potential is used to represent fluid motions conventionally the hydrodynamic problem is decomposed into the diffraction problem and the radiation problem in the radiation problem the radiation velocity potentials are represented in terms of eigenmodes which may be taken as either the natural mode for the vibration of the structure in air dry mode kashiwagi 2004 or the natural mode for the vibration of the structure in fluid wet mode hanamoto and fujita 2002 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 the dry mode is widely used due to its simplicity although the wet mode can represent the physical vibration of the structure in fluid the approach to use eigenmodes in the hydrodynamic problem is usually referred to as a modal expansion approach an alternative approach for the hydrodynamic problem is the direct approach kim et al 2013 tay et al 2007 in this approach only the total velocity potentials are considered without decomposing into diffraction and radiation components the hydrodynamic matrices are obtained without any help of eigenmodes when compared to the modal expansion approach the direct approach has an advantage that it can be extended directly to nonlinear hydrodynamic analysis kim et al 2013 pal et al 2018 the power capture factor cf also known as the power capture width ratio is defined as renzi et al 2014 2 c f p av p in b where p av is the time averaged power produced by pto systems p in is the power per unit width of the incident wave front and b is the overall dimension of the structure along the direction that is perpendicular to the wave direction the incident wave power is given by falnes 2002 3 p in 1 4 ρ w g a 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where a is the wave amplitude k is the wavenumber and h is the water depth the time averaged power produced by pto systems of ob wecs is given by nguyen et al 2019a 4 p av 1 2 ω 2 j 1 n c p j δ u j 2 where n is the number of pto systems c pj is the linear damping coefficient of the j th pto system j 1 2 n δu j is the amplitude of the relative motion that is utilized to produce power using the j th pto system the time averaged power produced by pto systems of owc wecs is given by falnes 2002 zheng et al 2019 5 p av 1 2 j 1 n c p j p j 2 where p j is the amplitude of the air pressure in the jth owc chamber when calculating the air pressure the air compressibility may be neglected for simplicity hong et al 2004 or may be linearized so as it can be considered in the frequency domain babarit et al 2011 the latter approach may be preferable as the air compressibility has been claimed to be important for owc wecs pawitan et al 2019 viviano et al 2019 5 2 models of structure the structural matrices m k in eq 1 can be obtained based on a particular model of the structure which consists of a large floating platform and auxiliary structures e g auxiliary pontoons of the raft wec type attachment note that auxiliary structures do not exist for some integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms e g when pto systems are placed in between platform modules to account for the flexibility of the structure a 3d model of the entire structure based on the shell theory may be adopted kim et al 2013 however to reduce the complexity for modelling simplified models are usually used for semi submersible platforms the rigid module flexible connector rmfc model zhang et al 2018 is usually adopted pontoon type large floating platforms can be modelled as floating beams karperaki et al 2016 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 wu et al 1995 if they are longish in shape however such beam models could not capture the two dimensional responses of platforms thus pontoon type large floating platforms can be modelled as plates according to the kirchhoff plate theory kashiwagi 1998 kyoung et al 2005 or the more refined mindlin plate theory that allows for effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia utsunomiya et al 2000 watanabe et al 2006 it is worth noting that the mindlin plate theory introduces bending rotation variables and thus it does not need the second and third derivatives of the deflection function thus the mindlin plate theory furnishes more accurate stress resultants than the kirchhoff plate theory wang et al 2001 watanabe et al 2004a 5 3 models of pto systems the behaviour of direct drive pto systems or wells turbines can be well illustrated by a linear pto model where the pto force is proportional to the displacement and velocity babarit et al 2012 sheng 2019 for hydraulic pto systems although a nonlinear coulomb pto model is more accurate babarit et al 2012 sheng 2019 the linear pto model can still be used with reasonable accuracy e g see liu et al 2018 2017 and zheng et al 2015 current studies on hydrodynamic analysis of wec and large floating platform integrated systems focus only on linear pto models hong and hong 2007 nguyen et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 6 conclusions and recommendations for future studies presented herein is a review of various integrated systems between wave energy converters wecs and large floating platforms as well as a brief on hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems the integrated systems proposed in the literature are summarized in table 3 they may be divided into four main categories i pontoon type platforms with oscillating water column owc wecs ii pontoon type platforms with oscillating body ob wecs iii semi submersible platforms with owc wecs and iv semi submersible platforms with ob wecs each category should possess main advantages and disadvantages of both the platform and the wecs in general owc wecs are simpler and more reliable than ob wecs but their wave energy extraction efficiency is usually lower on the other hand pontoon type platforms possess higher stability and are easier for manufacturing and maintenance when compared to semi submersible platforms however pontoon type platforms may be only suitable for nearshore conditions whereas semi submersible platforms are preferred offshore conditions because of the platform structural properties when compared to the integrated systems deployed in nearshore sites those deployed in offshore sites may have higher power output as the wave power resource in offshore sites is larger however operation and maintenance costs for the offshore integrated systems should be higher in addition due to action of strong waves the reliability and survivability of the offshore integrated systems may be big problems some recommendations for future studies include i developing novel integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms or modifying the current integrated systems for better performances in extracting wave energy and reducing in hydrodynamic responses of platforms ii developing time domain models or viscous correction models to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of wec and large floating platform integrated systems iii investigating effects of nonlinearities due to pto systems mooring systems wave forces or the air compressibility in chambers of owc wecs iv evaluating and improving reliability and survivability of integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms under action of extreme wave conditions v conducting feasibility analyses that include cost estimates of wec and large floating platform integrated systems

21624,extracting wave energy is a promising solution for renewable energy production because of the high energy intensity of ocean waves when compared to other renewable energy resources on another front of ocean utilization large floating platforms are an effective solution for creating artificial space on the sea for various purposes such as airports seaports aquaculture platforms and recreation and residential areas integrating wave energy converters with large floating platforms brings many benefits owing to space sharing cost sharing and multiple functions of the integrated system this paper presents a literature review of wave energy converter and large floating platform integration overviews of wave energy and large floating platform technologies are first presented this is followed by a review of various integrated systems between wave energy converters and large floating platforms a brief on hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems and some recommendations for future studies keywords ocean energy utilization ocean space utilization wave energy converter large floating platform integrated system hydrodynamic analysis 1 introduction renewable energy has become more attractive because of low carbon emissions associated with renewable energy production and depletions of non renewable energy resources such as oil gas and coal among various types of renewable energy wave energy possesses many positive features including i the wave energy intensity is much higher than the intensity of some other types of renewable energy such as solar energy and wind energy clément et al 2002 lópez et al 2013 e g it was claimed that the intensity is about 2 3 kw m2 for wave energy 0 4 0 6 kw m2 for wind energy and 0 1 0 2 kw m2 for solar energy lópez et al 2013 ii wave energy resources are enormous e g when compared to the electricity consumption as seen in fig 1 gunn and stock williams 2012 iii co2 emissions associated with wave energy generation have been claimed to be very low when compared to those associated with non renewable energy generation smaller than those associated with solar energy generation and rather comparable to those associated with wind energy generation parker et al 2007 thorpe 1999 iv wave conditions can be well predicted ahead of the time lópez et al 2013 sheng 2019 the predicted incoming waves can be used for operational planning pinson et al 2012 v wave energy converters wecs can generate power up to 90 of the time while wind and solar energy converters can generate power only up to 30 of the time lópez et al 2013 sheng 2019 despite great efforts have been invested in the research and development of wecs since the 1970s global oil crisis falcão 2010 the current wave energy technology is not economically competitive when compared to other renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar energy technologies clément et al 2002 lópez et al 2013 the electricity generated from ocean waves using the current wave energy technology is more expensive than the electricity generated from other sources of energy astariz and iglesias 2015 a promising way to reduce the cost of electricity generated from ocean waves is to minimize costs of installation mooring foundation operation and maintenance astariz and iglesias 2015 irena 2014 this cost component accounts for about 40 50 of wave energy project life costs bedard et al 2005 irena 2014 in order to reduce costs of installation mooring foundation operation and maintenance wecs may be integrated with other purpose marine structures irena 2014 mustapa et al 2017 the integration also brings other benefits including i increasing wec reliability because other purpose marine structures can provide additional strength to wecs to operate in strong wave conditions and moving wec components can be minimized by placing some wec components on other purpose marine structures mustapa et al 2017 ii reducing mooring foundation footprints and hence limiting negative environmental impact because wecs can share mooring foundation with other purpose marine structures iii increasing the efficiency in using ocean space because the ocean space is used for multiple purposes owing to these enormous benefits the integration between wave energy converters and other purpose marine structures has received a lot of attention extensive studies have been carried out for integrated systems between wecs and i floating wind turbines pérez collazo et al 2015 ii bottom founded breakwaters mustapa et al 2017 iii floating breakwaters zhao et al 2019 iv conventional offshore floating platforms taghipour and moan 2008 or v ship like platforms wang et al 2018 on another front of ocean utilization large floating platforms have been used or proposed to be used for various applications lamas pardo et al 2015 suzuki 2005 wang and wang 2014 typical examples include floating runways watanabe et al 2004a mobile offshore bases remmers et al 1998 floating bridges watanabe 2003 floating piers jung et al 2020 kusaka and ueda 2014 floating breakwaters kusaka and ueda 2014 floating ports ahn et al 2013 ocean thermal energy conversion otec platforms yee 2014 floating container terminals wang et al 2006 floating recreation and residential areas seasteading 2019 floating fish farms buck et al 2018 chu et al 2020 and floating oil storage facilities dai et al 2019 when compared to the conventional land reclamation method large floating platforms possess the following advantages for creating artificial space from the sea i low construction costs for deep seas and soft seabeds ii short construction time iii being easy for expansion and downsizing iv mobility v being immune to rising sea levels due to global warming and vi being ecofriendly wang and wang 2014 motivated by these various applications and advantages of large floating platforms maeda et al 2001 2000 mooted the integration between wecs with large floating platforms besides bringing along some benefits as discussed earlier such an integration also brings the following benefits i reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform because wecs play a role as wave energy absorbers ii improving the wave attenuation performance of large floating platforms if used as breakwaters and iii providing power supply for operations on the platform when compared to integrated systems between conventional platforms e g used in oil and gas exploration or floating breakwaters and wecs integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs generally have several distinct properties firstly dimensions of large floating platforms are up to a few hundred meters or even kilometres tables 1 and 2 on the other hand the dimensions of conventional platforms are usually not larger than 100 m palo 2014 secondly large floating platforms are usually flexible the flexibility of large floating platforms results from two sources i the flexibility of connections between platform modules and ii elastic deformations of large floating platforms under applied loads and wave action in detail for ease of manufacturing transportation and installation large floating platforms usually consist of several modules joined together the connections between platform modules are not necessarily rigid but may be flexible suzuki et al 2006 when flexible connections are used the entire large floating platform cannot be regarded as a rigid body as for a conventional floating rigid platform because their responses under action of external loads are different figs 2 a and b on the other hand elastic deformations instead of rigid body motions of large floating platforms see fig 2c need to be considered when the length of the platform is larger than the wavelength and the characteristic length λ c 2 π d ρ w g 1 4 where d is the flexural rigidity of the platform ρ w is the mass density of water g is the gravitational acceleration suzuki et al 2006 1998 prompted by the enormous benefits when integrating wecs with large floating platforms researchers have developed various integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms since the early 2000s this review paper provides readers with the background information on large floating platform and wave energy converter technologies sec 2 and sec 3 respectively various wec and large floating platform integrated systems sec 4 a brief on hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems sec 5 and some recommendations for future studies sec 6 2 overview of large floating platform technology large floating platforms can be categorized into two main types pontoon type floating platforms and semi submersible type floating platforms wang and wang 2014 semi submersible floating platforms are partly raised above the sea level by using column tubes or air cushions an example of semi submersible floating platforms supported by column tubes is the mobile offshore base mob fig 3 a while an example of semi submersible floating platforms supported by air cushions is the pneumatically stabilized platform psp fig 3b semi submersible floating platforms are generally able to withstand strong waves and usually preferred for intermediate or harsh wave conditions lamas pardo et al 2015 in order to restrain horizontal motions of semi submersible large floating platforms mooring lines or tethers may be used figs 4 a and b pontoon type large floating platforms are like giant plates resting on the water surface they are characterized by their small depth to width ratios when compared to semi submersible floating platforms pontoon type floating platforms possess some superior properties such as high stability low manufacturing and maintenance costs wang and wang 2014 practical examples of pontoon type floating platforms are presented in table 1 and fig 5 a general application of this type of platforms is presented in fig 6 which shows a general mega float system consisting of four main components a large floating platform superstructures an access bridge and a mooring system mooring lines or tethers figs 4a and b may be used to restrain horizontal motions of pontoon type platforms however these types of mooring systems are usually not suitable for relatively shallow water or when a tight constraint on horizontal motions of platforms is required for such conditions pier quay wall systems or dolphin frameguide mooring systems figs 4c and d are usually adopted wang and tay 2011 pontoon type floating platforms are usually deployed in benign wave conditions for a higher energy environment pontoon type floating platforms may be protected by bottom founded breakwaters fig 7 a however the use of bottom founded breakwaters has some drawbacks such as the requirement of massive construction destruction of the marine eco system and disruption of water flow wang et al 2010 to overcome these drawbacks many other methods for reducing hydrodynamic responses of pontoon type large floating platforms have been proposed wang et al 2010 these methods include the use of floating breakwaters tay et al 2009 vertical mooring lines nguyen et al 2018 floating horizontal plates kim et al 2005 submerged vertical plates ohta et al 1999 submerged horizontal plates watanabe et al 2003 submerged inclined plates cheng et al 2016 takaki and nishikawa 2001 flexible connections between platform modules riyansyah et al 2010 gao et al 2011 and large submerged horizontal plates underneath the platform mohapatra and guedes soares 2019 see figs 7b i 3 overview of wave energy converter technology modern wave energy converters wecs may be categorized as follows oscillating water column owc wecs oscillating body wecs and overtopping wecs babarit 2017 falcão 2010 falnes 2007 an owc wec consists of a semi submerged chamber that keeps a trapped air column above a water column fig 8 a under wave action the water column rises and falls making the trapped air flow through an air turbine such as a wells turbine fig 9 a to generate electricity the main advantage of owc wecs is that their designs are simple and usually reliable this is because owc wecs usually have only one major moving component and that is the air turbine however it was reported that the wave energy extraction efficiency of owc wecs hitherto has not been high and is currently being improved irena 2014 this disadvantage of owc wecs may result from large dimensions of air chambers alcorn 2013 and the fact that the efficiency of air turbines is not high when compared to the efficiency of other pto systems irena 2014 examples of owc wecs are the pico plant brito melo et al 2008 and the mutriku plant torre enciso et al 2009 see fig 10 an overtopping wec comprises a water reservoir structure fig 8b the water inside the reservoir structure is restored at a higher level than the water outside the reservoir structure the potential energy of the collected water above the surface of the water outside the reservoir structure is transformed into electricity by using a hydro turbine such as the kaplan turbine fig 9b overtopping wecs are generally simple but the dimensions of the water reservoir structure are usually large irena 2014 examples of owc wecs are the wave dragon kofoed et al 2006 and the sea slot cone generator margheritini et al 2009 see fig 11 regarding oscillating body wecs ob wecs the main energy conversion mechanism of these wave energy converters is to transform the relative motion between oscillating bodies or between one oscillating body and one fixed body e g foundation at the seabed into electricity hydraulic or direct drive power take off pto systems figs 9c and d may be adopted for ob wecs têtu 2017 the main advantage of ob wecs generally lies in their high wave energy extraction efficiency babarit et al 2012 irena 2014 this superior property results from large motions of oscillating bodies at resonance i e when the natural frequency of oscillating bodies is close to the incident wave frequency however due to large motions of oscillating bodies the survivability and reliability of ob wecs are usually big problems especially when ob wecs are deployed in offshore conditions lópez et al 2013 some examples of oscillating body wecs are heaving wecs or the ceto wec babarit et al 2004 carnegie 2019 oscillating wave surge converters or the oyster wec renzi and dias 2013 whittaker and folley 2012 and raft wecs or the pelamis wec haren and mei 1979 yemm et al 2012 see figs 8c e and fig 12 4 wec and large floating platform integrated systems integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs may be categorized as i pontoon type platforms with owc wecs ii pontoon type platforms with ob wecs iii semi submersible platforms with owc wecs and iv semi submersible platforms with ob wecs 4 1 pontoon type platforms with owc wecs the idea to integrate owc wecs with pontoon type large floating platforms was mooted by maeda et al 2001 2000 these initial studies focused on reductions in hydrodynamic responses of a platform by using embedded owc units at both the fore and the aft of the platform fig 13 or around the perimeter of the platform the latter arrangement of owc units should be preferred when incident waves come from any direction if incident waves come from one direction the former arrangement of owc units may be preferred so as to reduce hydrodynamic responses of the fore and the aft because the responses of these portions are largest over the entire platform e g see nguyen et al 2018 another possible arrangement of owc units is to be placed only at the fore of the platform however this possible arrangement was not considered for comparison with the arrangement of owc units placed at both the fore and the aft the experimental and numerical results showed that owc units are effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform e g the vertical displacement of the fore may be reduced by up to about 70 maeda et al 2001 subsequent studies on the use of embedded owc units hong and kyoung 2007 kyoung and hong 2009 showed that reductions in hydrodynamic responses of platforms are significantly affected by pto damping and there exists an optimal pto damping for maximizing reductions of hydrodynamic responses of platforms this is because by using an appropriate value of pto damping the amount of incident waves absorbed for power production can be maximized ning et al 2016 thereby minimizing the amount of incident waves transmitted in order to achieve high reductions in hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms multiple owc units are proposed fig 14 a ikoma et al 2015 maeda et al 2001 alternatively a combination between owc units and the mitigating methods presented in fig 6 may be adopted examples of such a combination are i the use of submerged vertical plates and owc units fig 14b ikoma et al 2002 as a portion of incident waves is reflected from the submerged vertical plate additional reductions in hydrodynamic responses of the platform can be achieved ii the use of sacrificial platforms and owc units fig 14c hong and kyoung 2007 kyoung and hong 2009 iii the use of floating breakwaters and owc units fig 14d shigemitsu et al 2001 wang et al 2010 in addition to the use of the above mentioned embedded owc units floating owc breakwaters have been used to reduce hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms hong et al 2006 hong and hong 2007 owc breakwaters can be placed at a distance in front of but without connection to the platform hong et al 2006 however owc breakwaters connected with the fore of platforms by hinges fig 15 a hong and hong 2007 may be preferable as such a design does not require an additional mooring system similar to embedded owc units maeda et al 2001 2000 owc breakwaters are generally effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of platforms under action of short and intermediate waves but they are not effective for long waves e g fig 15b this property of owc breakwaters is generally similar to that of a conventional floating breakwater where its effectiveness in attenuating wave energy is limited for long waves zhao et al 2019 however when compared to an equivalent conventional floating breakwater an owc breakwater is generally more effective in attenuating wave energy owing to the presence of pto damping zhao et al 2019 the benefit of pto damping to hydrodynamic responses of platforms can be also seen in fig 15b which shows that reductions in responses of platforms can be improved by using an appropriate value of pto damping besides the function to reduce hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms the embedded owc units and the owc breakwater have another function and that is to produce power only the power capture factor i e power produced incident wave power see sec 5 1 associated with embedded owc units has been presented by ikoma et al 2015 2012 2002 and maeda et al 2000 their results showed that owc units are effective for extracting wave energy for example the power capture factor is up to about 0 5 for the design shown in fig 13a a larger power capture factor may be achieved by placing a submerged vertical plate right after the fore owc unit fig 14b ikoma et al 2002 this is because the interference between the incident wave and the wave reflected from the submerged vertical plate may amplify the height of the oscillating wave column the results for the design shown in fig 13a maeda et al 2000 also showed that as the wave period increases the power capture factor generally first increases and then decreases after reaching its maximum value e g as seen in fig 16 the range of wave periods where the power capture factor is considerable e g larger than a user defined value δ may be called the effective wave energy extraction bandwidth see fig 16 the bandwidth for the design with a single owc unit can be widened by using multiple owc units as shown in fig 14a ikoma et al 2015 2012 this is because the power capture factors associated with different owc units reach their maximum values at different wave periods ikoma et al 2012 thus the resulting power capture factor associated with multiple owc units has multiple peaks at different wave periods ikoma et al 2015 2012 the wide effective wave energy extraction bandwidth has also been observed for stand alone owc wecs with multiple chambers ning et al 2019 4 2 pontoon type platforms with ob wecs by adopting the design of raft wecs and the use of horizontal plates connected to the fore of platforms as shown in fig 7d tay 2017 proposed a raft wec type attachment for extracting wave energy as well as reducing hydrodynamic responses of pontoon type large floating platforms the raft wec type attachment consists of a single wide auxiliary pontoon e g 60 m in width connected to the fore of a large platform with hinges and pto systems the relative rotation between the single wide pontoon and the fore of the platform is utilized for power production nguyen et al 2019a proposed a modular raft wec type attachment by replacing the single wide auxiliary pontoon of the raft wec type attachment by multiple independent narrow pontoons fig 17 when compared to the raft wec type attachment the modular raft wec type attachment possesses several advantages including i easier for installation and manufacturing owing to the modularity in the design ii more flexible for expansion and downsizing iii more reliable because the attachment with multiple pontoons has a higher redundancy iv more effective in extracting wave energy and reducing hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms under action of oblique waves if wavelengths are comparable to the overall width of the attachment nguyen et al 2019a sarkar et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2017 when compared to the horizontal plates connected to the fore of a large platform by hinge or rigid connections the modular raft wec type attachment is more effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform nguyen et al 2019a this is because a portion of incident waves can be transformed into useful energy owing to the use of pto systems the modular raft wec type attachment or the raft wec type attachment possesses high wave energy extraction efficiency for relatively short waves e g the power capture factor is up to about 0 7 nguyen et al 2019b reductions in hydrodynamic responses of large floating platforms are also high for short waves e g the vertical displacement at the fore of the platform can be reduced up to 80 for wave periods less than 6 s nguyen et al 2019b higher wave energy extraction efficiency or higher reductions in hydrodynamic responses of platforms can be achieved by adjusting the number of platform modules and the module connection stiffness nguyen et al 2019b however if module connection design is altered for improving power production reductions in hydrodynamic responses of platforms are generally compromised and vice versa nguyen et al 2019b the modular raft wec type attachment or the raft wec type attachment has several disadvantages including i the power capture factor is rather limited for long waves nguyen et al 2019b this is because the motions of the auxiliary pontoon and the fore of the large platform oscillate in almost the same phase for long waves resulting in a small relative rotation tay 2017 ii the required length of auxiliary pontoons is heavily dependent on the wavelength λ e g the auxiliary pontoon length is about λ 3 for maximum power output nguyen et al 2019a hence the required auxiliary pontoon length is large for long waves long auxiliary pontoons may result in high material costs and a large pto damping coefficient this is because the optimal pto damping coefficient for maximum power production is heavily dependent on the auxiliary pontoon length nguyen et al 2019a for raft wecs the optimal pto damping coefficient is proportional to the wavelength but to the cube of the pontoon length zheng et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 and ren et al 2019 proposed the use of embedded pto systems in between platform modules fig 18 the relative rotation between adjacent platform modules is utilized for power production similar to the power capture factor associated with the raft wec type attachment the power capture factor associated with embedded pto systems was found to be high up to about 0 6 for short waves zhang et al 2019 when compared to large floating platforms with the raft wec type attachment large floating platforms with embedded pto systems do not require auxiliary pontoons thereby reducing material costs however the reported reductions in hydrodynamic responses of the platform owing to the use of embedded pto systems are generally less significant than those for the case where the raft wec type attachment is used nguyen et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 in terms of wave energy extraction placing pto systems between platform modules may be not preferred for platforms having stringent motion requirements e g for a floating runway where the slope of the platform must be less than 1 suzuki 2005 this is because the power produced by embedded pto systems should be small due to the small motions of such platforms for such platforms if the modular raft wec type attachment nguyen et al 2019a is used the power produced may be still considerable as the auxiliary pontoons can be designed for maximizing their motions by adopting the design of oscillating wave surge converters and the use of a submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore of platform as in fig 7e nguyen and wang 2020a proposed an owsc type attachment comprising a submerged vertical flap connected to the fore of the platform with hinges and pto systems fig 19 the owsc type attachment possesses a wide effective energy extraction bandwidth the power capture factor is considerable for most wave periods e g up to 0 55 for wave period t 9 s and up to 0 2 for t 16 s nguyen and wang 2020a for maximum power production the required flap length is only about λ 10 which is much smaller than the required pontoon length for the raft wec type attachment about λ 3 another advantage of the owsc type attachment is that it is very effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of platforms under action of short waves because a large portion of short waves is reflected from the submerged vertical flap when compared to the submerged vertical flap rigidly connected to the fore of a platform the owsc type attachment is more effective in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform nguyen and wang 2020a the owsc type attachment has two main disadvantages i the use of the submerged vertical flap may result in increasing significantly the horizontal wave force acting on the structure and hence on the mooring system however the increase in the horizontal wave force when using the owsc type attachment is less significant than that using the submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore of the platform nguyen and wang 2020a ii the effectiveness of this attachment in reducing hydrodynamic responses of the platform is negligible for long waves nguyen and wang 2020a this property is inherited from the corresponding mitigating method that consists of a submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore of platforms masanobu et al 2003 ohta et al 1999 nguyen et al 2020a studied a two mode wec type attachment comprising both submerged vertical and floating horizontal plates connected to the fore of large floating platforms with hinges and pto systems fig 20 fig 21 shows the variations of the power capture factor cf and the reduction in vertical displacement of the fore of the platform hr a mode configuration is represented by three letters involving v for a submerged vertical plate and h for a floating horizontal plate if a mode configuration is vhv the arrangement of six auxiliary plates is vhvvhv as shown in fig 20 fig 21 shows that the two mode attachment possesses good wave energy extraction and hydrodynamic response mitigation performances for a wide range of wave periods these properties result from the combination of the performances of the submerged vertical plates and the floating horizontal plates the two mode attachment also shows a good balance between wave energy extraction and hydrodynamic response mitigation nguyen et al 2020a nguyen and wang 2020b proposed heaving wec type attachments to pontoon type large floating platforms each heaving wec type attachment consists of a pto system connected to the platform at one end and to the seabed at the other end fig 22 the heaving motion relative to the seabed is utilized for power production when compared to other wec type attachments heaving wec type attachments may be more suitable for sites where incident waves come from various directions this is because the heaving motions or vertical displacements of platforms should be considerable for all incident wave angles whereas the relative rotations between auxiliary pontoons or submerged vertical flaps and the fore of platforms are generally negligible for large oblique waves heaving wec type attachments are also better than other wec type attachments in extracting wave energy and reducing hydrodynamic responses of platforms under action of long waves nguyen and wang 2020b however the use of heaving wec type attachments requires additional foundations which may be costly for platforms having stringent motion requirements heaving wec type attachments may be not preferred for extracting wave energy as the power produced should be small due to the small motions of such platforms 4 3 semi submersible platforms with owc wecs crema et al 2015 and crema 2017 conducted experimental studies on semi submersible large floating platforms supported by multiple air cushions and integrated with owc wecs fig 23 their studies investigate how the power capture factor and the hydrodynamic response of platforms are affected by various design parameters of owc wecs as well as wave conditions experimental results showed that the power capture factor is high up to 0 8 and the hydrodynamic responses of platforms can also be reduced effectively owing to the integrated owc wecs crema 2017 float inc 2019b proposed integrating rho cee wecs with pneumatically stabilized platforms fig 24 functioned as offshore security ports the rho cee wec consists of three chambers of different sizes fig 25 similar to the integrated system with multiple owc units mentioned in sec 4 1 the integrated system with rho cee wecs is effective in extracting wave energy for a wide range of wave periods owing to the use of multiple chambers currently the energy restored in the oscillating wave columns is transformed into the up and down motions of rafts and then converted into useful energy by hydraulic pto systems future approach may involve using pneumatic pto systems as in conventional owc wecs brown 2014 4 4 semi submersible platforms with ob wecs zhang et al 2017 2016 suggested placing pto systems in between the upper deck and supporting floating columns see fig 26 a portion of the relative vertical displacement between the upper deck and floating columns can be transformed into useful energy and the vertical displacement of the upper deck can be reduced at the same time zhang et al 2017 2016 showed that this integrated system is rather effective in extracting wave energy e g the power capture factor is up to 0 2 in head sea conditions moreover this integrated system has the following advantageous features i auxiliary structures are not required because pto systems can be installed in between the upper deck and the supporting floating columns ii the system may be suitable for sites where incident waves come from various directions as discussed for the heaving wec type attachment however installation and maintenance for pto systems may be difficult because pto systems are underneath the upper deck recently zhang et al 2019 2018 suggested placing pto systems in between semi submersible platform modules as shown in fig 27 this integrated system is effective in reducing the pitching motions of the platform because the relative pitch motion between adjacent platform modules is transformed into useful energy similar to pontoon type platforms with embedded pto systems placed in between platform modules this integrated system furnishes a high power capture factor which may exceed unity for modules of 300 m in length zhang et al 2018 however the corresponding optimal pto damping coefficient for maximum power production is very large e g 1010 n m much larger than the conventional upper limit e g 4 108 n m for pto damping coefficient used for stand alone wecs babarit et al 2011 if the pto damping coefficient is limited to 108 n m the power capture factor becomes small e g less than 0 1 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for platforms having stringent motion requirements placing pto systems between platform modules zhang et al 2018 or between the upper deck and supporting columns zhang et al 2016 may be not preferred for extracting wave energy this is because the power produced should be small due to the small motions of such platforms the guangzhou institute of energy conversion giec 2019 built a semi submersible aquaculture platform sharp eagle wecs sheng et al 2017 consisting of multiple auxiliary pontoons are connected to the fore of the platform fig 28 the wave energy extraction mechanism of this integrated system is relatively similar to that of the integrated system between pontoon type large floating platforms and modular raft wecs as described in sec 4 2 the performance in terms of wave energy extraction and reduction in hydrodynamic responses of the semi submersible platform is not available in the public domain 5 brief on hydrodynamic analysis of large floating platforms with wecs hydrodynamic analysis of integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs is basically similar to that of large floating platforms palo 2005 watanabe et al 2004a or of stand alone wecs falcão and henriques 2016 sheng 2019 however it requires a special consideration on flexibility of large floating platforms if the conventional hydrodynamic analysis of stand alone wecs is adopted or on pto systems if the conventional hydrodynamic analysis of large floating platforms is adopted these special considerations are discussed in this section basic assumptions and equations for hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems are also presented 5 1 basic assumptions and equations hydrodynamic analysis can be performed in the frequency domain or in the time domain the frequency domain analysis is fast and is preferable for linear hydrodynamic analysis the time domain analysis needs to be carried out when considering transient responses of the structure or nonlinearities due to pto systems liu et al 2017 wave forces kyoung et al 2006 mooring forces ni et al 2018 or the compressibility of the air trapped in chambers of owc wecs pawitan et al 2019 viviano et al 2019 current research studies on integrated systems between large floating platforms and wecs focus only on the frequency domain analysis hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems in the frequency domain is usually carried out with the following assumptions i the structure has an isotropic homogeneous and linear elastic material and the motions of the structure are small ii the fluid is inviscid and incompressible the fluid flow is irrotational and the wave amplitude is small where the linear wave theory is applicable iii the behaviour of pto systems is linear where the pto force is proportional to the pto velocity and displacement and iv mooring forces are proportional to motions of the structure and hence the mooring system can be modelled as a linear spring system in the frequency domain the equation of motion for the integrated systems may be written as nguyen et al 2019a 1 ω 2 m m a i ω c d k k rf k m u f exc f pto where ω is the angular frequency of the incident wave i the imaginary unit i 2 1 m the global mass matrix k the global stiffness matrix of the structure m a the global matrix of added mass c d the global hydrodynamic damping matrix f exc the global vector comprising frequency dependent complex amplitudes of wave forces k m the global mooring stiffness matrix k rf the global restoring stiffness matrix kim et al 2013 senjanović et al 2008 f pto the global vector comprising frequency dependent complex amplitudes of linear pto forces babarit et al 2012 sheng 2019 and u the vector consisting of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of displacements of the structure the hydrodynamic matrices m a c d f exc can be obtained based on the linear wave theory where the velocity potential is used to represent fluid motions conventionally the hydrodynamic problem is decomposed into the diffraction problem and the radiation problem in the radiation problem the radiation velocity potentials are represented in terms of eigenmodes which may be taken as either the natural mode for the vibration of the structure in air dry mode kashiwagi 2004 or the natural mode for the vibration of the structure in fluid wet mode hanamoto and fujita 2002 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 the dry mode is widely used due to its simplicity although the wet mode can represent the physical vibration of the structure in fluid the approach to use eigenmodes in the hydrodynamic problem is usually referred to as a modal expansion approach an alternative approach for the hydrodynamic problem is the direct approach kim et al 2013 tay et al 2007 in this approach only the total velocity potentials are considered without decomposing into diffraction and radiation components the hydrodynamic matrices are obtained without any help of eigenmodes when compared to the modal expansion approach the direct approach has an advantage that it can be extended directly to nonlinear hydrodynamic analysis kim et al 2013 pal et al 2018 the power capture factor cf also known as the power capture width ratio is defined as renzi et al 2014 2 c f p av p in b where p av is the time averaged power produced by pto systems p in is the power per unit width of the incident wave front and b is the overall dimension of the structure along the direction that is perpendicular to the wave direction the incident wave power is given by falnes 2002 3 p in 1 4 ρ w g a 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where a is the wave amplitude k is the wavenumber and h is the water depth the time averaged power produced by pto systems of ob wecs is given by nguyen et al 2019a 4 p av 1 2 ω 2 j 1 n c p j δ u j 2 where n is the number of pto systems c pj is the linear damping coefficient of the j th pto system j 1 2 n δu j is the amplitude of the relative motion that is utilized to produce power using the j th pto system the time averaged power produced by pto systems of owc wecs is given by falnes 2002 zheng et al 2019 5 p av 1 2 j 1 n c p j p j 2 where p j is the amplitude of the air pressure in the jth owc chamber when calculating the air pressure the air compressibility may be neglected for simplicity hong et al 2004 or may be linearized so as it can be considered in the frequency domain babarit et al 2011 the latter approach may be preferable as the air compressibility has been claimed to be important for owc wecs pawitan et al 2019 viviano et al 2019 5 2 models of structure the structural matrices m k in eq 1 can be obtained based on a particular model of the structure which consists of a large floating platform and auxiliary structures e g auxiliary pontoons of the raft wec type attachment note that auxiliary structures do not exist for some integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms e g when pto systems are placed in between platform modules to account for the flexibility of the structure a 3d model of the entire structure based on the shell theory may be adopted kim et al 2013 however to reduce the complexity for modelling simplified models are usually used for semi submersible platforms the rigid module flexible connector rmfc model zhang et al 2018 is usually adopted pontoon type large floating platforms can be modelled as floating beams karperaki et al 2016 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 wu et al 1995 if they are longish in shape however such beam models could not capture the two dimensional responses of platforms thus pontoon type large floating platforms can be modelled as plates according to the kirchhoff plate theory kashiwagi 1998 kyoung et al 2005 or the more refined mindlin plate theory that allows for effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia utsunomiya et al 2000 watanabe et al 2006 it is worth noting that the mindlin plate theory introduces bending rotation variables and thus it does not need the second and third derivatives of the deflection function thus the mindlin plate theory furnishes more accurate stress resultants than the kirchhoff plate theory wang et al 2001 watanabe et al 2004a 5 3 models of pto systems the behaviour of direct drive pto systems or wells turbines can be well illustrated by a linear pto model where the pto force is proportional to the displacement and velocity babarit et al 2012 sheng 2019 for hydraulic pto systems although a nonlinear coulomb pto model is more accurate babarit et al 2012 sheng 2019 the linear pto model can still be used with reasonable accuracy e g see liu et al 2018 2017 and zheng et al 2015 current studies on hydrodynamic analysis of wec and large floating platform integrated systems focus only on linear pto models hong and hong 2007 nguyen et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 6 conclusions and recommendations for future studies presented herein is a review of various integrated systems between wave energy converters wecs and large floating platforms as well as a brief on hydrodynamic analysis of the integrated systems the integrated systems proposed in the literature are summarized in table 3 they may be divided into four main categories i pontoon type platforms with oscillating water column owc wecs ii pontoon type platforms with oscillating body ob wecs iii semi submersible platforms with owc wecs and iv semi submersible platforms with ob wecs each category should possess main advantages and disadvantages of both the platform and the wecs in general owc wecs are simpler and more reliable than ob wecs but their wave energy extraction efficiency is usually lower on the other hand pontoon type platforms possess higher stability and are easier for manufacturing and maintenance when compared to semi submersible platforms however pontoon type platforms may be only suitable for nearshore conditions whereas semi submersible platforms are preferred offshore conditions because of the platform structural properties when compared to the integrated systems deployed in nearshore sites those deployed in offshore sites may have higher power output as the wave power resource in offshore sites is larger however operation and maintenance costs for the offshore integrated systems should be higher in addition due to action of strong waves the reliability and survivability of the offshore integrated systems may be big problems some recommendations for future studies include i developing novel integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms or modifying the current integrated systems for better performances in extracting wave energy and reducing in hydrodynamic responses of platforms ii developing time domain models or viscous correction models to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of wec and large floating platform integrated systems iii investigating effects of nonlinearities due to pto systems mooring systems wave forces or the air compressibility in chambers of owc wecs iv evaluating and improving reliability and survivability of integrated systems between wecs and large floating platforms under action of extreme wave conditions v conducting feasibility analyses that include cost estimates of wec and large floating platform integrated systems
