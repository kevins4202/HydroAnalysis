century is a century of ocean and ocean is a strategic and resource space for the survival and sustainable development of human beings unmanned marine vehicles are vital tools in exploiting and exploring the ocean and they are capable of performing various missions in the sea environment motion control of unmanned marine vehicles is a fundamental problem for marine vehicle development and has received tremendous attention by researchers zereik et al 2018 al khatib et al 2015 xiang et al 2017a b c peng et al 2018 2019a b cui et al 2016 2017 dai et al 2016 2018 especially cooperative control of a vehicle fleet contributes to increase efficiency performance and robustness over a single one topics along this line of research include formation control abreu and pascoal 2015 abreu et al 2015 cooperative target tracking breivik et al 2008 cui et al 2010 elhaki and shojaei 2018 dai et al 2018 cooperative trajectory tracking chen and tian 2013 do 2016 fu and yu 2018 and cooperative path following ihle et al 2007 ghommam and mnif 2009 almeida et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2019 peng et al 2017 hung and pascoal 2018 the cooperative path following is to drive a vehicle fleet to follow parameterized paths and achieve a desired formation configuration simultaneously during the past few years various methods are proposed to develop the cooperative path following controllers for usvs in ihle et al 2007 a backstepping technique and a passivity based synchronization method are employed to design cooperative path following controllers with both continuous time and discrete time path update laws in ghommam and mnif 2009 cooperative path following controllers are developed for a fleet of usvs subject to constant disturbances and a time varying delay in communication topology in almeida et al 2010 nonlinear adaptive cooperative path following controllers are developed for a group of usvs by using a lyapunov based technique and graph theory and a circular formation pattern is achieved in almeida et al 2011 cooperative path following in the presence of discrete time periodic communication is addressed in wang et al 2013 a neural network based dynamic surface control method is involved into the cooperative path following controller design such that the design process is simplified in hung and pascoal 2018 a model predictive control method and an event triggered mechanism are employed to figure out the cooperative path following problem subject to inputs and inter vehicle communication network constraints in liu et al 2019 cooperative path following controllers are designed based on a backstepping technique a line of sight guidance principle and a parameter cyclic pursuit approach such that a ring networked symmetric formation pattern is reached it is worth noting that the aforementioned results ihle et al 2007 ghommam and mnif 2009 almeida et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 hung and pascoal 2018 liu et al 2019 require that each vehicle is assigned by a parameterized path known as a priori resulting in a centralized structure the communication burden of the central node will increase as the growth of the vehicle number without knowing the full path information distributed path following of marine vehicles is considered in peng et al 2017 in peng et al 2017 a modular design approach is employed to develop distributed containment maneuvering controllers for usvs holding a spatial temporal decoupling property the proposed method in peng et al 2017 focuses on the fully actuated usvs however most usvs are configured or moving in an under actuated fashion and it is highly desirable to investigate the distributed path following problem of under actuated usvs motivated by the above observations this paper investigates the distributed containment maneuvering problem for a fleet of under actuated usvs subject to model uncertainties and ocean disturbances at first distributed guidance laws are presented by combining a containment control method with a path maneuvering mechanism based on the information of neighbors an auxiliary variable is employed to deal with the under actuation next an extended state observer eso is developed to estimate the unknown model uncertainties and ocean disturbances and an anti disturbance kinetic control law is designed based on the eso and a linear tracking differentiator td finally through the lyapunov stability analysis the closed loop system is proven to be input to state stable iss and the containment maneuvering errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin the main features of the paper are presented as follows compared with the result in peng et al 2017 where the containment maneuvering controllers are proposed for fully actuated usvs only containment maneuvering controllers are designed for under actuated usvs herein which are more practical it should be stressed that the design method given in peng et al 2017 cannot be applied to under actuated usvs addressed herein in contrast to the existing works in ihle et al 2007 ghommam and mnif 2009 almeida et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 hung and pascoal 2018 liu et al 2019 where each vehicle is assigned a parameterized path known as a priori distributed containment maneuvering controllers are proposed where the path information is only to be known by a small fraction of usvs different from the works in elhaki and shojaei 2018 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017 2018 where neural networks or fuzzy systems are employed to approximate the unknown vehicle kinetics an eso is developed to estimate the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances as a result it is easier to implement than the approximation based estimation due to the simplified estimation architecture and decreased tuning parameters the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 some concepts on graph theory and some notations are introduced then the problem formulation for distributed containment maneuvering for under actuated usvs is given in section 3 the controller design and stability analysis are presented in section 4 simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers section 5 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 notation throughout this paper r n denotes n dimensional

at least one virtual leader that has access to the super leader the communication topology among followers is directed 2 3 problem formulation a three degrees of freedom model for under actuated usv

i s with 7 s 0 1 1 0 consider a networked multiple usvs system containing m under actuated usvs and n m n m virtual leaders the fleet of under actuated usvs are guided to follow a convex hull spanned by the multiple virtual leaders and only a fraction of the usvs can communicate with virtual leaders the usvs are numbered with 1 to m and the virtual leaders are numbered with m 1 to n a graphic of the networked multiple usvs system is depicted in fig 1 the virtual leaders move along parameterized paths and the path information is given by p k r θ k x k r θ k y k r θ k t r 2 k m 1 n where θ k is a path variable the partial differentiation of p k r θ k is represented as p k r θ k θ k p k r θ k θ k it is assumed that p k r θ k and p k r θ k θ k are bounded the communication topology among multiple usvs and virtual leaders can be described by a graph g and its laplacian matrix l can be partitioned into 8 l l 1 l 2 l 3 l 0 where l 1 r m m l 2 r m n m l 3 r n m m and l 0 r n m n m in addition consider a super leader which evolves 9 θ 0 v s where v s is a desired path update speed the objective of this paper is to force a fleet of under actuated usvs to achieve a geometric objective a velocity objective and a phase objective to be specific the three objectives can be characterized as follows geometric objective force the ith usv to follow a convex combination of multiple virtual leaders moving along multiple parameterized paths 10 lim t p i t k m 1 n λ k p k r θ k t δ 0 δ 1 where λ k r k m 1 n λ k 1 with λ k 0 δ 0 δ 0 0 t r 2 with δ 0 r being an auxiliary variable to solve the under actuated problem and to be specified in next section δ 1 r is a small constant velocity objective drive the path update of each virtual leader to a desired speed v s as 11 lim t θ k t v s δ 2 where k m 1 n and δ 2 r is a small constant phase objective drive the path updates of virtual leaders satisfying 12 lim t θ k t θ 0 t p k δ 3 where k l m 1 n k l and δ 3 r is a small constant θ 0 is a path variable of a super leader p k r is a constant denoting a deviation between the kth virtual leader and the super leader 3 design and analysis in this part we aim to develop distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs first an eso is developed based on a nominal usv kinetic model such that model uncertainties and ocean disturbances can be estimated then distributed guidance laws are proposed by combing a path maneuvering scheme with a containment control method based on the information of neighbor besides an auxiliary variable is employed such that the proposed guidance laws can be applied to under actuated usvs next an eso based kinetic control law is designed for each vehicle in order to enforce the coordination of virtual leaders three kinds of path update laws are designed subsequently where a preassigned formation pattern among virtual leaders is achieved finally the stability of the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs is analyzed the controller architecture is depicted in fig 2 3 1 eso design at first in order to relax the assumption on the full knowledge of the usv kinetic model skjetne et al 2005 the kinetics in 5 is rewritten as follows 13 m i u u i τ i u f i u u i v i r i t m i v v i f i v u i v i r i t m i r r i τ i r f i r u i v i r i t where m i u m i v m i r are nominal mass and inertia by using the nominal terms the perturbations around the nominal terms are permitted f i k k u v r are unknown functions including model uncertainties ocean disturbances uncertain inertial matrices and are expressed by 14 f i u m i u m i u 1 f i u τ i w u t m i u 1 m i u 1 τ i u f i v m i v m i v 1 f i v τ i w v t f i r m i r m i r 1 f i r τ i w r t m i r 1 m i r 1 τ i r in order to estimate the unknown functions in 13 an eso is established as follows 15 ν ˆ i k i 1 o ν ˆ i ν i m i 1 τ i ζ ˆ i ζ ˆ i k i 2 o ν ˆ i ν i where k i 1 o r 2 2 k i 2 o r 2 2 are observer gain matrices ν ˆ i is the estimation of ν i with ν i u i r i t r 2 ζ ˆ i is the estimation of ζ i with ζ i m i u 1 f i u m i r 1 f i r t r 2 m i diag m i u m i r r 2 2 τ i τ i u τ i r t r 2 letting ν i ν ˆ i ν i and ζ i ζ ˆ i ζ i 15 can be put into 16 ν i k i 1 o ν ˆ i ν i ζ i ζ i k i 2 o ν ˆ i ν i ζ i defining e i 1 ν i t ζ i t t r 4 16 can be rewritten as 17 e i 1 a i e i 1 b i ζ i where a i k i 1 o 1 k i 2 o 0 b i 0 2 i 2 because a i is a hurwitz matrix there exists a positive definite matrix p i 1 satisfying the following inequality 18 a i t p i 1 p i 1 a i ℓ i i 4 where ℓ i r is a positive constant in order to facilitate the stability analysis the following assumption is made assumption 3 the functions f i k k u v r satisfy f i k f i k u i f i k v i f i k r i f i k t m 0 m 1 u i l m 2 v i l m 3 r i l for some positive m j j 0 1 2 3 and l is a positive integer remark 1 the unknown functions f i k k u v r are velocity related functions considering the control inputs of an usv are limited the velocities are naturally bounded hence assumptions 3 is reasonable for a practical usv similar assumptions can be found in zhao and guo 2015 guo et al 2016 remark 2 in addition to the eso various learning schemes can also be used to approximate the unknown uncertainties existing in the kinetics related works can be found in xu et al 2018 dai et al 2016 li et al 2018 3 2 controller design by using eso the unknown kinetics in 13 is estimated in what follows distributed containment maneuvering controllers are designed and divided into following steps step 1 two tracking errors are defined as follows 19 z i 1 r i t ψ i j 1 m a i j p i p j k m 1 n a i k p i p k r θ k z ˆ i 2 ν ˆ i ν i r where z i 1 is a containment maneuvering error expressed in the body fixed reference frame and consists of two parts the first part j 1 m a i j p i p j characterizes the error between the ith usv and its neighbors the second part k m 1 n a i k p i p k r θ k describes the path maneuvering errors of a subset of usvs who obtain the path information if all vehicles know the path information i e a i k 1 i k it will result in a centralized architecture and require a large number of communication resources to get path information taking the time derivative of z i 1 along 4 it follows that 20 z i 1 r i s z i 1 d i u i v i j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k θ k where d i j 1 n a i j and ℏ i k r i t ψ i p k r θ k θ k regarding to an under actuated usv the second entry of the containment maneuvering error cannot be cancelled by designing an appropriate guidance signal in sway direction to address it an auxiliary variable δ 0 is employed and the containment maneuvering tracking error is redefined as z i 1 z i 1 δ 0 aguiar and hespanha 2007 using the variable δ 0 the error dynamics 20 can be rewritten as follows 21 z i 1 r i s z i 1 r i s δ 0 j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k θ k d i u i v i defining θ k v s ω k 21 can be transforming into a compact form as follows 22 z i 1 r i s z i 1 g i ν i j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k v s ω k 0 d i v i where ω k is a coordination variable and g i is given by 23 g i d i 0 0 δ 0 to stabilize 22 a distributed containment maneuvering guidance law is designed as follow 24 α i g i 1 k i 1 z i 1 j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k v s 0 d i v i where k i 1 r 2 2 is a kinematic gain matrix remark 3 for an under actuated usv the second entry of z i 1 cannot be stabilized by designing v i to this end the auxiliary variable δ 0 is introduced such that r i appears in the error dynamics of z i 1 then r i can be designed to generate rotational motion instead of the lateral motion such that the second entry of z i 1 can be stabilized remark 4 the selection of the auxiliary variable δ 0 is elaborated as follows at first because the kinematic control gain is the reciprocal value of δ 0 a too small δ 0 will generate undesired oscillations second δ 0 should be chosen less than the half length of the vehicle as a result a tradeoff should be taken for δ 0 step 2 a second order linear td is used to obtain the estimates of α i and α i as follows 25 ν i r ν i r d ν i r d ε i 2 ν i r α i 2 ε i ν i r d where ν i r d r 2 is an estimate of α i ε i r being a positive constant from the convergence analysis of linear td in guo and zhao 2011 it can be derived that there exist positive constants q i r and q i d r such that 26 ν i r α i q i ν i r d α i q i d in what follows we aim to construct a control law τ i at the kinetic level based on the eso and linear td taking the time derivative of z ˆ i 2 and using 15 yields 27 z ˆ i 2 k i 1 o ν i m i 1 τ i ζ ˆ i ν i r to stabilize z ˆ i 2 a kinetic control law is taken as 28 τ i m i k i 2 z i 2 g i z i 1 ν i r d ζ ˆ i where z i 2 ν i ν i r k i 2 r 2 2 is a kinetic control gain matrix substituting 24 28 into 22 and 27 we can obtain the following error dynamics 29 z i 1 r i s z i 1 k i 1 z i 1 g i ν i z ˆ i 2 q i k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k ω k z ˆ i 2 k i 2 z ˆ i 2 ϱ i ν i g i z i 1 where q i ν i r α i and ϱ i k i 1 o k i 2 step 3 in this step the variable ω k is to be designed to enforce the coordination among virtual leaders 3 2 1 design 1 without containment maneuvering error feedback in this case the motion of virtual leaders is independent of any follower usvs then ω k is designed as 30 ω k μ k e k where μ k r is a positive design parameter e k is a path variable coordination error for the kth virtual leader and defined as 31 e k l m 1 n a k l θ k θ l p k l b k θ k θ 0 p k where p k l p k p l with p i i k l being the deviation between the ith virtual leader and the super leader here only a small fraction of virtual leaders have access to the information of the super leader by using p k a formation pattern among virtual leaders can be realized one can choose different deviations to achieve various containment maneuvering patterns define a global path coordination error 32 θ k e θ k θ 0 p k and it follows that 33 θ e ω μ h θ e where ω ω m 1 ω n t μ diag μ m 1 μ n θ e θ m 1 e θ n e t and h l 0 b b denotes a leader adjacency matrix defined as b diag b 1 b n m where b i 1 if the ith virtual leader accesses the information of the super leader otherwise b i 0 it is noted that all eigenvalues of h are positive mei et al 2012 hence the leader system 33 is global asymptotically stable 3 2 2 design 2 containment maneuvering error feedback in design 1 the motion of virtual leaders is independent of any followers to enforce the coordination of virtual leaders and establish a feedback mechanism from follower usvs to virtual leaders ω k is designed as 34 ω k μ k ϑ k ϑ k i 1 m a k i ℏ i k t z i 1 e k where the first term of ϑ k establishes a feedback mechanism by involving the containment maneuvering error z i 1 into the path update law design it allows that there exists a negotiation between the virtual leader and the usv that obtains the information of the leader from 32 the error dynamics of θ k e is given as follows 35 θ k e ω k 3 2 3 design 3 filtered containment maneuvering error feedback in the path update law 34 ω k may suffer from a large deviation from zero in the initial stage which results in undesired dangerous maneuvers for usvs a smoother way to cope with ω k is to treat it as a state that updates as 36 ω k ι k 1 ϑ k ϖ k ϖ k ι k 2 ϖ k μ k ϑ k where ι k 1 ι k 2 r are positive constants the additional term ι k 1 ϑ k is to guarantee the boundedness of the closed loop signals in practical implementations ι k 1 can be chosen small enough as a result the error dynamics in terms of θ k e and ϖ k can be described by 37 θ k e ι k 1 ϑ k ϖ k ϖ k ι k 2 ϖ k μ k ϑ k 3 3 stability analysis recalling 17 29 and 37 the closed loop system can be expressed as the following two subsystems 38 σ 1 e i 1 a i e i 1 b i ζ i 39 σ 2 z i 1 r i s z i 1 k i 1 z i 1 g i ν i z ˆ i 2 q

vehicle dynamics 4 and 13 together with the eso 15 the control laws 24 25 28 and the path update law 36 if there exists a positive definite matrix p i 1 satisfying 18 the closed loop system cascaded by the subsystem σ 1 in 38 and the subsystem σ 2 in 39 is iss proof by using lemmas 1 and 2 a direct application of cascade theory reveals that the complete cascade system ζ i q i z i 1 z ˆ i 2 θ k e ϖ k ζ i is iss krstic et al 1995 by assumption 3 there exists a positive constant ζ i r such that ζ i ζ i besides q i is bounded by 26 it follows that the error signals z i 1 z ˆ i 2 θ k e ϖ k and ζ i are all bounded note that as t γ i 1 and γ 2 0 and it follows from 47 and 57 that z 1 is ultimately bounded by 60 lim t z 1 lim t e 2 i 1 m κ i c ν i κ i o ζ i ζ i κ i c q i q i let p p 1 t p m t t r

equal to 1 under assumption 1 it implies that there exists a small positive constant δ 1 such that 10 is satisfied since 64 z i 2 ν i z ˆ i 2 ν i z ˆ i 2 it renders that z i 2 is bounded from 36 the boundedness of θ k e and z i 1 imply that ω k are bounded hence there exists a positive constant δ 2 such that 11 is satisfied under assumption 2 we have 65 λ min h θ e 2 θ e t h θ e implying that there exists a positive constant δ 3 such that 12 is satisfied this proof completes the stability analyses of the cascade system formed by 17 29 35 and the cascade system formed by 17 29 and 37 are similar to the theorem 1 and are omitted here remark 5 compared with the previous works peng et al 2017 2018 the contribution of this work is threefold first different from the works in peng et al 2017 2018 where distributed maneuvering controllers are proposed for fully actuated usvs only distributed maneuvering controllers are developed for under actuated usvs herein which are more practical second compared with the containment maneuvering problem studied in peng et al 2017 where the virtual leaders are synchronized only a desired containment maneuvering pattern can be achieved by preassigning a formation among virtual leaders such that the containment maneuvering pattern can be more flexible finally different from peng et al 2017 2018 where approximation based estimation methods are used an eso is employed herein therefore the estimation architecture is simpler and the tuning parameters are less 4 simulation results in this part a simulation study is given to verify the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of under actuated usvs consider a network consisting of five usvs and three virtual leaders the model parameters can be found in skjetne et al 2005 the ocean disturbance is modelled as a first order gauss markov process as τ i w k γ i k τ i w k w k γ i k 0 k u v r and w k denotes white noises roetenberg et al 2005 the communication topology is given in fig 3 it can be seen that the communication links are undirected for the virtual leaders and are directed for the follower usvs the path information of the virtual leader 6 is given in 66 and it can obtain the information of super leader usv1 usv3 and usv5 can access the path information of virtual leaders usv2 and usv4 can acquire the information from their neighbors only 66 p 6 r θ 6 0 2 θ 6 0 2 θ 6 θ 6 400 120 40 2 sin θ 6 400 200 3 π 4 40 40 2 cos θ 6 400 200 3 π 4 400 θ 6 400 200 π 0 2 θ 6 400 200 π 160 0 2 θ 6 400 200 π 400 200 π θ 6 800 200 π 40 40

systems the communication topology selected herein satisfies assumptions 1 and 2 various communication topologies can be chosen as long as assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied as a result the communication topology is not chosen randomly in order to obtain a triangle formation pattern among the virtual leaders the deviations between the virtual leaders and the super leader are given by p 6 20 p 7 0 p 8 20 the auxiliary variable δ 0 is set as 0 1 the eso observer gains and the control gains are chosen as k i 1 o diag 20 20 k i 2 o diag 100 100 k i 1 diag 0 1 0 1 k i 2 diag 2 2 the time constant of the linear td is given as ε i 2 in the simulation the path update law based on the filtered containment maneuvering error feedback is used and the parameters are chosen as ι k 1 0 0001 ι k 2 10 μ k 10 the time constant of the ocean disturbance is set as γ i k 0 5 the mean and variance values of the white noise w k are set as 0 and 0 01 respectively to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method we compare the proposed method with a pi control method and an eso based control method the pi controller used for each usv is as follows 67 τ i k i p ν i α i k i i 0 t ν i α i d t where k i p m i k i 2 and k i i is chosen as k i i diag 0 1 0 1 the simulation results are shown in figs 4 12 in fig 4 by using the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers five usvs are able to follow the convex combination of the virtual leaders moving along the three parameterized paths with a triangle formation configuration regardless of the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances the along track errors of five usvs are given in fig 5 it can be seen that the modified containment maneuvering error z i 1 x converges to a neighborhood of the origin fig 6 shows that the cross track errors of five usvs and they converge to zero ultimately the guidance signals generated by the proposed controller are plotted in fig 7 the small chattering existing in the α i c r is caused by the switching of the straight line and the curve the comparisons of the kinetic tracking performance and the control inputs using the three methods are given in figs 8 11 it can be observed that under the almost the same control inputs the transient performance of the proposed method is faster than those of the pi control and eso based control methods besides compared with the pi control method the anti disturbance performance of the eso based control method is better the uncertain estimation performance of the proposed method is depicted in fig 12 it is observed that the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances are estimated by eso accurately 5 conclusions this paper presents distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs in the controllers design distributed guidance laws are designed based on the path maneuvering and the containment scheme by resorting to the auxiliary variable design the proposed distributed guidance laws can be applied to under actuated usvs then an eso is developed to estimate the uncertainties and an anti disturbance kinetic control law is proposed based on the eso and linear td for each usv three kinds of path update laws are designed subsequently and a more flexible containment maneuvering pattern can be achieved by preassigning a formation among virtual leaders finally it is proven that the closed loop system is iss via lyapunov theory and cascade stability analysis the simulation results show that the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for the fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs are feasible and efficient in future work it is desirable to verify the theory in practical vehicles acknowledgments this work was supported in part by the national

containment maneuvering controllers for the under actuated usvs keywords distributed containment maneuvering under actuation extended state observer unmanned surface vehicles 1 introduction the 21st century is a century of ocean and ocean is a strategic and resource space for the survival and sustainable development of human beings unmanned marine vehicles are vital tools in exploiting and exploring the ocean and they are capable of performing various missions in the sea environment motion control of unmanned marine vehicles is a fundamental problem for marine vehicle development and has received tremendous attention by researchers zereik et al 2018 al khatib et al 2015 xiang et al 2017a b c peng et al 2018 2019a b cui et al 2016 2017 dai et al 2016 2018 especially cooperative control of a vehicle fleet contributes to increase efficiency performance and robustness over a single one topics along this line of research include formation control abreu and pascoal 2015 abreu et al 2015 cooperative target tracking breivik et al 2008 cui et al 2010 elhaki and shojaei 2018 dai et al 2018 cooperative trajectory tracking chen and tian 2013 do 2016 fu and yu 2018 and cooperative path following ihle et al 2007 ghommam and mnif 2009 almeida et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2019 peng et al 2017 hung and pascoal 2018 the cooperative path following is to drive a vehicle fleet to follow parameterized paths and achieve a desired formation configuration simultaneously during the past few years various methods are proposed to develop the cooperative path following controllers for usvs in ihle et al 2007 a backstepping technique and a passivity based synchronization method are employed to design cooperative path following controllers with both continuous time and discrete time path update laws in ghommam and mnif 2009 cooperative path following controllers are developed for a fleet of usvs subject to constant disturbances and a time varying delay in communication topology in almeida et al 2010 nonlinear adaptive cooperative path following controllers are developed for a group of usvs by using a lyapunov based technique and graph theory and a circular formation pattern is achieved in almeida et al 2011 cooperative path following in the presence of discrete time periodic communication is addressed in wang et al 2013 a neural network based dynamic surface control method is involved into the cooperative path following controller design such that the design process is simplified in hung and pascoal 2018 a model predictive control method and an event triggered mechanism are employed to figure out the cooperative path following problem subject to inputs and inter vehicle communication network constraints in liu et al 2019 cooperative path following controllers are designed based on a backstepping technique a line of sight guidance principle and a parameter cyclic pursuit approach such that a ring networked symmetric formation pattern is reached it is worth noting that the aforementioned results ihle et al 2007 ghommam and mnif 2009 almeida et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 hung and pascoal 2018 liu et al 2019 require that each vehicle is assigned by a parameterized path known as a priori resulting in a centralized structure the communication burden of the central node will increase as the growth of the vehicle number without knowing the full path information distributed path following of marine vehicles is considered in peng et al 2017 in peng et al 2017 a modular design approach is employed to develop distributed containment maneuvering controllers for usvs holding a spatial temporal decoupling property the proposed method in peng et al 2017 focuses on the fully actuated usvs however most usvs are configured or moving in an under actuated fashion and it is highly desirable to investigate the distributed path following problem of under actuated usvs motivated by the above observations this paper investigates the distributed containment maneuvering problem for a fleet of under actuated usvs subject to model uncertainties and ocean disturbances at first distributed guidance laws are presented by combining a containment control method with a path maneuvering mechanism based on the information of neighbors an auxiliary variable is employed to deal with the under actuation next an extended state observer eso is developed to estimate the unknown model uncertainties and ocean disturbances and an anti disturbance kinetic control law is designed based on the eso and a linear tracking differentiator td finally through the lyapunov stability analysis the closed loop system is proven to be input to state stable iss and the containment maneuvering errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin the main features of the paper are presented as follows compared with the result in peng et al 2017 where the containment maneuvering controllers are proposed for fully actuated usvs only containment maneuvering controllers are designed for under actuated usvs herein which are more practical it should be stressed that the design method given in peng et al 2017 cannot be applied to under actuated usvs addressed herein in contrast to the existing works in ihle et al 2007 ghommam and mnif 2009 almeida et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 hung and pascoal 2018 liu et al 2019 where each vehicle is assigned a parameterized path known as a priori distributed containment maneuvering controllers are proposed where the path information is only to be known by a small fraction of usvs different from the works in elhaki and shojaei 2018 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017 2018 where neural networks or fuzzy systems are employed to approximate the unknown vehicle kinetics an eso is developed to estimate the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances as a result it is easier to implement than the approximation based estimation due to the simplified estimation architecture and decreased tuning parameters the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 some concepts on graph theory and some notations are introduced then the problem formulation

by the multiple virtual leaders and only a fraction of the usvs can communicate with virtual leaders the usvs are numbered with 1 to m and the virtual leaders are numbered with m 1 to n a graphic of the networked multiple usvs system is depicted in fig 1 the virtual leaders move along parameterized paths and the path information is given by p k r θ k x k r θ k y k r θ k t r 2 k m 1 n where θ k is a path variable the partial differentiation of p k r θ k is represented as p k r θ k θ k p k r θ k θ k it is assumed that p k r θ k and p k r θ k θ k are bounded the communication topology among multiple usvs and virtual leaders can be described by a graph g and its laplacian matrix l can be partitioned into 8 l l 1 l 2 l 3 l 0 where l 1 r m m l 2 r m n m l 3 r n m m and l 0 r n m n m in addition consider a super leader which evolves 9 θ 0 v s where v s is a desired path update speed the objective of this paper is to force a fleet of under actuated usvs to achieve a geometric objective a velocity objective and a phase objective to be specific the three objectives can be characterized as follows geometric objective force the ith usv to follow a convex combination of multiple virtual leaders moving along multiple parameterized paths 10 lim t p i t k m 1 n λ k p k r θ k t δ 0 δ 1 where λ k r k m 1 n λ k 1 with λ k 0 δ 0 δ 0 0 t r 2 with δ 0 r being an auxiliary

small constant θ 0 is a path variable of a super leader p k r is a constant denoting a deviation between the kth virtual leader and the super leader 3 design and analysis in this part we aim to develop distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs first an eso is developed based on a nominal usv kinetic model such that model uncertainties and ocean disturbances can be estimated then distributed guidance laws are proposed by combing a path maneuvering scheme with a containment control method based on the information of neighbor besides an auxiliary variable is employed such that the proposed guidance laws can be applied to under actuated usvs next an eso based kinetic control law is designed for each vehicle in order to enforce the coordination of virtual leaders three kinds of path update laws are designed subsequently where a preassigned formation pattern among virtual leaders is achieved finally the stability of the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs is analyzed the controller architecture is depicted in fig 2 3 1 eso design at first in order to relax the assumption on the full knowledge of the usv kinetic model skjetne et al 2005 the kinetics in 5 is rewritten as follows 13 m i u u i τ i u f i u u i v i r i t m i v v i f i v u i v i r i t m i r r i τ i r f i r u i v i r i t where m i u m i v m i r are nominal mass and inertia by using the nominal terms the perturbations around the nominal terms are permitted f i k k u v r are unknown functions including model uncertainties ocean disturbances uncertain inertial matrices and are expressed by 14 f i u m i u m i u 1 f i u τ i w u t m i u 1 m i u 1 τ i u f i v m i v m i v 1 f i v τ i w v t f i r m i r m i r 1 f i r τ i w r t m i r 1 m i r 1 τ i r in order to estimate the unknown functions in 13 an eso is established as follows 15 ν ˆ i k i 1 o ν ˆ i ν i m i 1 τ i ζ ˆ i ζ ˆ i k i 2 o ν ˆ i ν i where k i 1 o r 2 2 k i 2 o r 2 2 are observer gain matrices ν ˆ i is the estimation of ν i with ν i u i r i t r 2 ζ ˆ i is the estimation of ζ i with ζ i m i u 1 f i u m i r 1 f i r t r 2 m i diag m i u m i r r 2 2 τ i τ i u τ i r t r 2 letting ν i ν ˆ i ν i and ζ i ζ ˆ i ζ i 15 can be put into 16 ν i k i 1 o ν ˆ i ν i ζ i ζ i k i 2 o ν ˆ i ν i ζ i defining e i 1 ν i t ζ i t t r 4 16 can be rewritten as 17 e i 1 a i e i 1 b i ζ i where a i k i 1 o 1 k i 2 o 0 b i 0 2 i 2 because a i is a hurwitz matrix there exists a positive definite matrix p i 1 satisfying the following inequality 18 a i t p i 1 p i 1 a i ℓ i i 4 where ℓ i r is a positive constant in order to facilitate the stability analysis the following assumption is made assumption 3 the functions f i k k u v r satisfy f i k f i k u i f i k v i f i k r i f i k t m 0 m 1 u i l m 2 v i l m 3 r i l for some positive m j j 0 1 2 3 and l is a positive integer remark 1 the unknown functions f i k k u v r are velocity related functions considering the control inputs of an usv are limited the velocities are naturally bounded hence assumptions 3 is reasonable for a practical usv similar assumptions can be found in zhao and guo 2015 guo et al 2016 remark 2 in addition to the eso various learning schemes can also be used to approximate the unknown uncertainties existing in the kinetics related works can be found in xu et al 2018 dai et al 2016 li et al 2018 3 2 controller design by using eso the unknown kinetics in 13 is estimated in what follows distributed containment maneuvering controllers are designed and divided into following steps step 1 two tracking errors are defined as follows 19 z i 1 r i t ψ i j 1 m a i j p i p j k m 1 n a i k p i p k r θ k z ˆ i 2 ν ˆ i ν i r where z i 1 is a containment maneuvering error expressed in the body fixed reference frame and consists of two parts the first part j 1 m a i j p i p j characterizes the error between the ith usv and its neighbors the second part k m 1 n a i k p i p k r θ k describes the path maneuvering errors of a subset of usvs who obtain the path information if all vehicles know the path information i e a i k 1 i k it will result in a centralized architecture and require a large number of communication resources to get path information taking the time derivative of z i 1 along 4 it follows that 20 z i 1 r i s z i 1 d i u i v i j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k θ k where d i j 1 n a i j and ℏ i k r i t ψ i p k r θ k θ k regarding to an under actuated usv the second entry of the containment maneuvering error cannot be cancelled by designing an appropriate guidance signal in sway direction to address it an auxiliary variable δ 0 is employed and the containment maneuvering tracking error is redefined as z i 1 z i 1 δ 0 aguiar and hespanha 2007 using the variable δ 0 the error dynamics 20 can be rewritten as follows 21 z i 1 r i s z i 1 r i s δ 0 j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k θ k d i u i v i defining θ k v s ω k 21 can be transforming into a compact form as follows 22 z i 1 r i s z i 1 g i ν i j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k v s ω k 0 d i v i where ω k is a coordination variable and g i is given by 23 g i d i 0 0 δ 0 to stabilize 22 a distributed containment maneuvering guidance law is designed as follow 24 α i g i 1 k i 1 z i 1 j 1 m a i j r i t ψ i r j ψ j u j v j k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k v s 0 d i v i where k i 1 r 2 2 is a kinematic gain matrix remark 3 for an under actuated usv the second entry of z i 1 cannot be stabilized by designing v i to this end the auxiliary variable δ 0 is introduced such that r i appears in the error dynamics of z i 1 then r i can be designed to generate rotational motion instead of the lateral motion such that the second entry of z i 1 can be stabilized remark 4 the selection of the auxiliary variable δ 0 is elaborated as follows at first because the kinematic control gain is the reciprocal value of δ 0 a too small δ 0 will generate undesired oscillations second δ 0 should be chosen less than the half length of the vehicle as a result a tradeoff should be taken for δ 0 step 2 a second order linear td is used to obtain the estimates of α i and α i as follows 25 ν i r ν i r d ν i r d ε i 2 ν i r α i 2 ε i ν i r d where ν i r d r 2 is an estimate of α i ε i r being a positive constant from the convergence analysis of linear td in guo and zhao 2011 it can be derived that there exist positive constants q i r and q i d r such that 26 ν i r α i q i ν i r d α i q i d in what follows we aim to construct a control law τ i at the kinetic level based on the eso and linear td taking the time derivative of z ˆ i 2 and using 15 yields 27 z ˆ i 2 k i 1 o ν i m i 1 τ i ζ ˆ i ν i r to stabilize z ˆ i 2 a kinetic control law is taken as 28 τ i m i k i 2 z i 2 g i z i 1 ν i r d ζ ˆ i where z i 2 ν i ν i r k i 2 r 2 2 is a kinetic control gain matrix substituting 24 28 into 22 and 27 we can obtain the following error dynamics 29 z i 1 r i s z i 1 k i 1 z i 1 g i ν i z ˆ i 2 q i k m 1 n a i k ℏ i k ω k z ˆ i 2 k i 2 z ˆ i 2 ϱ i ν i g i z i 1 where q i ν i r α i and ϱ i k i 1 o k i 2 step 3 in this step the variable ω k is to be designed to enforce the coordination among virtual leaders 3 2 1 design 1 without containment maneuvering error feedback in this case the motion of virtual leaders is independent of any follower usvs then ω k is designed as 30 ω k μ k e k where μ k r is a positive design parameter e k is a path variable coordination error for the kth virtual leader and defined as 31 e k l m 1 n a k l θ k θ l p k l b k θ k θ 0 p k where p k l p k p l with p i i k l being the deviation between the ith virtual leader and the super leader here only a small fraction of virtual leaders have access to the information of the super leader by using p k a formation pattern among virtual leaders can be realized one can choose different deviations to achieve various containment maneuvering patterns define a global path coordination error 32 θ k e θ k θ 0 p k and it follows that 33 θ e ω μ h θ e where ω ω m 1 ω n t μ diag μ m 1 μ n θ e θ m 1 e θ n e t and h l 0 b b denotes a leader adjacency matrix defined as b diag b 1 b n m where b i 1 if the ith virtual leader accesses the information of the super leader otherwise b i 0 it is noted that all eigenvalues of h are positive mei et al 2012 hence the leader system 33 is global asymptotically stable 3 2 2 design 2 containment maneuvering error feedback in design 1 the motion of virtual leaders is independent of any followers to enforce the coordination of virtual leaders and establish a feedback mechanism from follower usvs to virtual leaders ω k is designed as 34 ω k μ k ϑ k ϑ k i 1 m a k i ℏ i k t z i 1 e k where the first term of ϑ k establishes a feedback mechanism by involving the containment maneuvering error z i 1 into the path update law design it allows that there exists a negotiation between the virtual leader and the usv that obtains the information of the leader from 32 the error dynamics of θ k e is given as follows 35 θ k e ω k 3 2 3 design 3 filtered containment maneuvering error feedback in the path update law 34 ω k may suffer from a large deviation from zero in the initial stage which results in undesired dangerous maneuvers for usvs a smoother way to cope with ω k is to treat it as a state that updates as 36 ω k ι k 1 ϑ k ϖ k ϖ k ι k 2 ϖ k μ k ϑ k where ι k 1 ι k 2 r are positive constants the additional term ι k 1 ϑ k is to guarantee the boundedness of the closed loop signals in practical implementations ι k 1 can be chosen small enough as a result the error dynamics in terms of θ k e and ϖ k can be described by 37 θ k e ι k 1 ϑ k ϖ k ϖ k ι k 2 ϖ k μ k ϑ k 3 3 stability analysis recalling 17 29 and 37 the closed loop system can be expressed as the following two subsystems 38 σ 1 e i 1 a i e i 1 b i ζ i 39 σ 2 z i 1 r i s z i 1 k i 1 z i 1 g i ν i z ˆ i 2 q

boundedness of θ k e and z i 1 imply that ω k are bounded hence there exists a positive constant δ 2 such that 11 is satisfied under assumption 2 we have 65 λ min h θ e 2 θ e t h θ e implying that

similar to the theorem 1 and are omitted here remark 5 compared with the previous works peng et al 2017 2018 the contribution of this work is threefold first different from the works in peng et al 2017 2018 where distributed maneuvering controllers are proposed for fully actuated usvs only distributed maneuvering controllers are developed for under actuated usvs herein which are more practical second compared with the containment maneuvering problem studied in peng et al 2017 where the virtual leaders are synchronized only a desired containment maneuvering pattern can be achieved by preassigning a formation among virtual leaders such that the containment maneuvering pattern can be more flexible finally different from peng et al 2017 2018 where approximation based estimation methods are used an eso is employed herein therefore the estimation architecture is simpler and the tuning parameters are less 4 simulation results in this part a simulation study is given to verify the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of under actuated usvs consider a network consisting of five usvs and three virtual leaders the model parameters can be found in skjetne et al 2005 the ocean disturbance is modelled as a first order gauss markov process as τ i w k γ i k τ i w k w k γ i k 0 k u v r and w k denotes white noises roetenberg et al 2005 the communication topology is given in fig 3 it can be seen that the communication links are undirected for the virtual leaders and are directed for the follower usvs the path information of the virtual leader 6 is given in 66 and it can obtain the information of super leader usv1 usv3 and usv5 can access the path information of virtual leaders usv2 and usv4 can acquire the information from their neighbors only 66 p 6 r θ 6 0 2 θ 6 0 2 θ 6 θ 6 400 120 40 2 sin θ 6 400 200 3 π 4 40 40 2 cos θ 6 400 200 3 π 4 400 θ 6 400 200 π 0 2 θ 6 400 200 π 160 0 2 θ 6 400 200 π 400 200 π θ 6 800 200 π 40 40

systems the communication topology selected herein satisfies assumptions 1 and 2 various communication topologies can be chosen as long as assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied as a result the communication topology is not chosen randomly in order to obtain a triangle formation pattern among the virtual leaders the deviations between the virtual leaders and the super leader are given by p 6 20 p 7 0 p 8 20 the auxiliary variable δ 0 is set as 0 1 the eso observer gains and the control gains are chosen as k i 1 o diag 20 20 k i 2 o diag 100 100 k i 1 diag 0 1 0 1 k i 2 diag 2 2 the time constant of the linear td is given as ε i 2 in the simulation the path update law based on the filtered containment maneuvering error feedback is used and the parameters are chosen as ι k 1 0 0001 ι k 2 10 μ k 10 the time constant of the ocean disturbance is set as γ i k 0 5 the mean and variance values of the white noise w k are set as 0 and 0 01 respectively to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method we compare the proposed method with a pi control method and an eso based control method the pi controller used for each usv is as follows 67 τ i k i p ν i α i k i i 0 t ν i α i d t where k i p m i k i 2 and k i i is chosen as k i i diag 0 1 0 1 the simulation results are shown in figs 4 12 in fig 4 by using the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers five usvs are able to follow the convex combination of the virtual leaders moving along the three parameterized paths with a triangle formation configuration regardless of the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances the along track errors of five usvs are given in fig 5 it can be seen that the modified containment maneuvering error z i 1 x converges to a neighborhood of the origin fig 6 shows that the cross track errors of five usvs and they converge to zero ultimately the guidance signals generated by the proposed controller are plotted in fig 7 the small chattering existing in the α i c r is caused by the switching of the straight line and the curve the comparisons of the kinetic tracking performance and the control inputs using the three methods are given in figs 8 11 it can be observed that under the almost the same control inputs the transient performance of the proposed method is faster than those of the pi control and eso based control methods besides compared with the pi control method the anti disturbance performance of the eso based control method is better the uncertain estimation performance of the proposed method is depicted in fig 12 it is observed that the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances are estimated by eso accurately 5 conclusions this paper presents distributed containment maneuvering controllers for a fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs in the controllers design distributed guidance laws are designed based on the path maneuvering and the containment scheme by resorting to the auxiliary variable design the proposed distributed guidance laws can be applied to under actuated usvs then an eso is developed to estimate the uncertainties and an anti disturbance kinetic control law is proposed based on the eso and linear td for each usv three kinds of path update laws are designed subsequently and a more flexible containment maneuvering pattern can be achieved by preassigning a formation among virtual leaders finally it is proven that the closed loop system is iss via lyapunov theory and cascade stability analysis the simulation results show that the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for the fleet of uncertain under actuated usvs are feasible and efficient in future work it is desirable to verify the theory in practical vehicles acknowledgments this work was supported in part by the national

22631,in the present investigation interactions between the vortices shedding from a single sphere and the boundary layer flow over a flat plate with various gap ratios have been investigated at re 5000 using the techniques of dye visualization and particle image velocimetry a passive jet has been created to control the flow past the sphere by a hole drilled into the sphere from the forward stagnation point to the rear of the sphere with various diameters the results show that the complex flow downstream of the sphere which is occurred from the combination of karman vortex street and the boundary layer over the flat plate can be controlled by a passive jet because the jet flow interrupts periodicity of the vortices shedding from the sphere by supplying fluid flow into the wake with relatively high velocity presence of the hole significantly attenuates the magnitudes of the turbulence characteristics furthermore the magnitudes of the turbulence characteristics decrease with increasing the hole diameter depending on the location of the sphere in the boundary layer however a larger hole diameter can result in higher turbulence levels in the region of the passive jet hence the effectiveness of the each case the diameter of the hole changes with the location of the sphere over the flat plate keywords flow control passive jet piv sphere turbulence 1 introduction flow around a sphere which is an ideal three dimensional bluff body has been gathering attractions in many engineering applications of single and two phase flows for various industries such as gas tanks artistic structures sports balls unmanned underwater vehicles etc interaction between atmospheric boundary layer flow of winds and buildings conveying of particles along pipes and underwater piping systems are obvious examples of these types of flows it is known that boundary layer flow causes vorticity flux which makes wake of a solid body more complicated than the wake of a solid body in a uniform flow by altering vortex shedding characteristics moreover a jet like flow also called gap flow has the ability to occur between a body and a wall flat plate when the body is in the close region of the wall distributions of vorticity generated by pressure and velocity gradients of the bluff body and gap flow create force and velocity fluctuations leading to vortex induced vibrations and scouring effects on the whole structure therefore experimental data about these types of flows could help engineers and scientists to eliminate possible errors that can cause irrevocable results wake characteristics and aerodynamic forces of a sphere contacting a stationary wall were investigated by okamoto 1980 an experimental study was conducted by tsutsui 2008 to explore qualitatively flow past a sphere positioned at various heights above a turbulent boundary layer using the smoke wire method and the surface oil flow pattern method ozgoren et al 2013a experimentally investigated flow structures around a sphere located in a turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate using piv technique for re 5x103 based on the sphere diameter and free stream velocity the boundary layer thickness with a value of 63 mm was higher than the sphere diameter of d 42 5 mm and the sphere was embedded into the turbulent boundary layer they reported that the wake flow structure of the sphere in the boundary layer was highly deformed because of interaction between the gap flow and the boundary layer flow turbulent flow structures behind a sphere and circular cylinder were experimentally compared by ozgoren et al 2011 visualization of flow around a sphere at re 320 to observe periodic shedding of counter rotating of vortex filaments was performed by leweke et al 1999 leweke et al 2006 studied physical aspects of instability of the flow around an impacting sphere normal to a solid wall flow characteristics of wake of a sphere at subcritical reynolds number were measured by jang and lee 2008 to describe recirculating vortices recirculation length and spatial distributions of turbulence statistics the insights gained from this study could lead the revealing of vortical flow structure and shear layer instability inside the near wake of a single sphere kiya et al 2001 and sakamoto and haniu 1990 categorized wake of a sphere with respect to strouhal number st for 300 re 4 104 achenbach 1972 1974 conducted experiments to qualitatively and quantitatively understand vortical structure of a sphere wake at various reynolds numbers moradian et al 2009 performed drag measurements of a sphere in a closed circuit wind tunnel for 2 2 x104 re 8x104 to reveal effects of free stream turbulence intensity and integral length scale as free stream turbulent parameters on the drag coefficient patnaik et al 1992 also measured drag force of a smooth stationary sphere located within a boundary layer for 3 62x103 re 6 45x104 tyagi et al 2006 reported that vortex shedding and largely organized motions of a flow in the downstream of a sphere could be suppressed by the effect of free stream turbulence simulations using the large eddy simulation model les were also utilized to investigate flow characteristics hassanzadeh et al 2011 and shear layer instability yun et al 2006 in the near wake of a sphere two frequency modes in the wake of a sphere which were arisen from the small scale instability of the separating shear layers and the large scale instability of the wake were detected by kim and durbin 1988 recently several control methods were utilized to reduce flow structure interactions and wake instability of a sphere such as passive jet roughened surface and o ring ozgoren et al 2012a 2012b and 2013b shaafi et al 2017 used a second order accurate immersed boundary method to investigate laminar flow past a rotating cylinder near a plane wall they classified the flow patterns based on the vortex shedding patterns which are regular karman vortex shedding irregular vortex shedding and complete vortex suppression surface modifications are used frequently for the passive control of the wakes of bluff bodies canpolat 2015 choi et al 2006 investigated influence of dimples on drag reduction of a sphere it is revealed that the dimples cause local flow separation reattachment that increases the turbulence level of the boundary layer and flow overcomes a strong adverse pressure delaying main flow separation and reducing form drag wang et al 2003 developed an empirical model to estimate the broadband unsteady force spectrum induced on a rigid sphere in a nominally steady and uniform flow they measured flow induced unsteady lift and drag forces independently of each other in a towing tank suryanarayana and meier 1995 and suryanarayana and prabhu 2000 investigated ventilation effects on flow characteristics in the wake of a sphere in a uniform flow they recorded that in the subcritical range of reynolds number for less than 2 105 ventilation caused a marginal downstream shift in the location of laminar boundary layer separation there was only a small change in the vortex shedding frequency higuchi and kiura 2012 studied the knuckleball effect that is due to asymmetric flow separation around a baseball they found that the seam triggers the boundary layer transition and delays the flow separation or causes separation itself depending on the position of the seam asai and kamemoto 2011 analyzed characteristics of the vortex structure of a soccer ball subjected to the knuckling effect knuckleball using high speed video images and smoke generating agents they brought an explanation to the phenomenon of large scale undulations of the vortex trail by relating the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the knuckleball with fluctuation frequency of the lift and side forces zhang and shi 2016 investigated flow past a circular cylinder with a splitter plate above a moving wall for various reynolds numbers and gap values between the cylinder and the wall they concluded that the splitter plate reduces the drag and lift coefficients compared with the near wall case which is without a splitter plate in this study the flow structure interaction between separated shear flow from the sphere and the flat plate forming a boundary layer flow was investigated via particle image velocimetry piv and rhodamine 6g dye flow visualization techniques in the influence of a passive jet flow through a hole with various diameters on the sphere center conventional flow visualization techniques may offer important information and have made a significant contribution to the studies of vortical structures in turbulence however these results are sometimes confusing and even misleading due to the fact that the image shows streak lines or timelines etc instead of streamlines or velocity vectors the complicated interaction of boundary layer bluff body and passive jet wake flow must be understood to determine how the flow structure can be controlled fortunately recent developments in piv have revealed much more information in turbulent flows and made more detailed data about a flow structure the experimental data obtained by piv will lead to clearly understand these kinds of fluid structure interactions while it will give remarkable results to validate numerical simulations 2 experimental facility and parameters particle image velocimetry experiments were conducted in a water channel with a test section of 8000 mm 1000 mm 750 mm length width height at the department of mechanical engineering in cukurova university turkey the water circulating throughout the channel using a centrifugal pump has surface open to the air an overview of the experimental system of the sphere is shown in fig 1 a flat plate with dimensions of 2000 mm 980 mm 10 mm having a sharp leading edge was located over the bottom surface of the water channel and the boundary layer flow was triggered via a circular trip wire the diameter of the trip wire and the distance from the leading edge have been determined experimentally the diameter of the trip wire wire that is used for this study is 5 mm and the trip wire is located 80 mm downstream of the leading edge of the plate the thickness of the boundary layer was δ 63 mm at the center of the sphere for re 5000 at a distance of 1400 mm from the leading edge of the plate the nominal thickness of the boundary layer was estimated from the velocity profile using the definition of one percent defect of the free stream velocity in the absence of the sphere displacement and momentum thickness ratios according to the boundary layer thickness were calculated as δ δ 0 18 and θ δ 0 13 respectively the boundary layer shape factor h δ θ is 1 42 this value is very close to the range of 1 2 h 1 4 for the consideration of fully developed turbulent flow the plot in fig 2 leads that agreement between the experimental results and the power law expression of u u y δ 1 n for n 7 is excellent the sphere with a diameter of 42 5 mm was constructed from plexiglas material letting the laser light to pass through the sphere easily all the sphere models were manufactured using a high precision cnc machine and the surfaces of sphere models were highly polished preventing effects of surface roughness the diameters of the holes in the sphere centerline are 4 250 mm 6 375 mm 8 500 mm and 10 625 mm corresponding to ratios of d d 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively the sphere was held freely in the water channel using a circular bar with a diameter of 5 mm to avoid vibration the bar was connected to the sphere at the backward stagnation point for minimizing disturbance within the measuring plane the results acquired from the dye visualization experiments were compared to the literature for revealing the degree of disturbance of the support bar on the experiments as a result the effects of the support bar are negligible on the current study the gap between the lower point of the sphere and the surface of the flat plate was changed from 0 to 63 75 mm for the cases investigating the effect of gap ratio and normalized with sphere diameter as g d the solid blockage ratio of the sphere support was 1 3 while the sphere was far away from free surface effects for satisfying the nyquist criterion an overlap of 50 was utilized for the interrogation process totally 700 image pairs which included two successive 350 image pairs acquired in one continuous run were used in post processing the images were taken at a rate of 15 hz in the experiments 700 instantaneous

instantaneous flow features fig 3 shows the instantaneous flow fields of dye visualization and vorticity ω which are obtained using the rhodamine dye under laser light and the piv measurements respectively in fig 3 successively arisen vortices are marked by letters from a to g for revealing development of the small scale vortices for the first sight the top side of the wake has wavy form which is due to the flow separation from the surface of the sphere the difference among the velocity magnitudes within the interface of the free stream flow and the wake creates these small scale vortices leading to kelvin helmholtz instability the rapid velocity rise in the close field of the border of the wake creates a considerable disturbance ozgoren et al 2013a the dark colored region close to the back the sphere demonstrates the existence of the jet flow it is clearly seen that the amount of fresh fluid supplied to the wake region increases with increasing hole diameter this passively created jet flow limits the interaction between the upper and lower shear layers the images related to the instantaneous vorticity ω exhibit patterns of vorticity rotating clockwise and counterclockwise directions for all cases of a passive jet a pair of vorticity contours are seen immediately in the downstream region of the sphere in the absence of the passive jet at g d 0 when the sphere touches the flat plate small scale vorticity layers pile down upon the flat plate in the vicinity of the sphere surface however the passive jet sweeps the great number of vorticity layers within this field namely the passive jet induces the fluid velocity in this field magnitudes of the pair of the instantaneous vorticity due to the passive jet increase with enlarging the diameter of the hole however another free stream with high velocity coming from the clearance between the flat plate and the sphere at g d 0 10 lifts the fluid to the upper side in the near field of the sphere and the flat plate therefore the passive jet cannot penetrate too deep of the wake similar to the case of g d 0 for g d 0 10 larger hole diameter can provide the passive jet ability to move inward of the wake easily when the gap ratio is increased further to g d 0 25 and 0 5 stable vorticity layers of the flat plate are clearly identifiable similar to the vorticity field shed from the lower side of the sphere it can be inferred that the interaction between the flat plate and the sphere weakens compared to the cases with lower gap ratios in these cases kelvin helmholtz small scale vortices are also evident for the lower side of the sphere particularly for g d 0 5 the whole structure of the wake is deflected to the upward direction but the deflected wake tends to be parallel to the horizontal axis when the gap ratio increases when the gap ratio is set to g d 1 50 it can be considered that the sphere is out of the boundary layer of the flat plate and the jet like behavior of the gap flow is wholly lost similar structures to well known karman vortex streets begin to occur in the downstream region of the smooth sphere without a hole when the hole diameter ratio is increased from d d 0 10 to 0 25 the well known kelvin helmholtz vortices appear to be highly suppressed due to the effect of the jet flow since magnitudes of the vorticity of the separated shear layer around the sphere decrease more jet flow injection inward of the sphere wake increases magnitudes of instantaneous vorticity 3 2 time averaged flow features the recirculation zone and reverse flow are occurred due to low pressure within the wake which forces the separated flow to reattach the focus point of this recirculation region is represented by f1 for the smooth sphere case without a hole for g d 0 on the first column of fig 4 for the same gap ratio the focus point f1 moves in the downstream direction when the hole exists another focus point f2 arises in the case of larger hole ratio starting from d d 0 200 in addition a slight variation is observed in the spatial location of the focus f2 since the gap ratio is increased to at g d 0 10 for the sphere without a hole a jet like flow coming from the gap travels around nearly half of periphery of the sphere and sweeps the fluid to the upward direction and merges with the separated flow on the top side of the sphere a saddle point s1 which is the separation point for the wake and the jet like flow is occurred moreover this flow nature forces the focus point f1 to move towards the flat wall which also causes another saddle point indicated by s2 when the hole exists firstly a focus f2 appears then another focus indicated by f3 is clearly seen in the second column of fig 4 with increasing hole diameter namely a larger hole diameter causes a secondary circulation zone with a relatively small size for the gap ratio g d 0 25 the size of this secondary circulation zone enlarges compared to the cases at g d 0 10 moreover a focus f4 which is a unique nature for this gap ratio appears on the flat wall the horizontal extent of the secondary circulation zone increases with increasing the gap ratio the size of focus f2 increases and its spatial location shifts downward in the absence of the effect of the flat wall at g d 1 50 this movement allows the occurrence of small size focus f4 for g d 1 50 when the hole diameter ratio is set to its largest value of d d 0 250 the time averaged vorticity contours which show severity of the flow separation are represented in fig 5 the vorticity region shown by p represents the flow separation from the upper side of the sphere while a and b are the vorticity region resulting from the passive jet the small scale eddies with positive and negative signs which cover entire wake in the images of instantaneous vorticity suppress each other and only large scale vortices are observed in the upper and lower shear layers and exit regions of the sphere hole the magnitudes of vorticities increase and their occupied area in the wake region enlarges with increasing the hole diameter the patterns of vorticity caused by the jet like flow are presented with q and r and shown in fig 5 for the smooth sphere case the vorticity region represented with q reaches up to the top free shear layer however it is blocked by the effect of the passive jet coming from the hole for g d 0 10 in the presence of the gap between the sphere and the flat wall negative vorticity layer of the passive jet interacts with the vorticity patterns of the sphere and the flat wall moreover the vorticity of the passive jet merges with the patterns of vorticity over the flat wall and encapsulates the vorticity patterns of the sphere in the vicinity of its bottom surface at g d 0 10 the time averaged streamwise velocity results are demonstrated in fig 6 the spatial locations of the saddle points are indicated with red dots for better comparison non dimensional maximum streamwise velocity magnitudes of the passive jets are 0 43 0 72 0 83 and 0 95 for the hole diameter ratios of d d 0 100 0 150 0 200 and 0 250 respectively at g d 0 since the hole diameter successively rises a significant increment occurs proportional to the hole diameter and streamwise velocity of the passive jet increase as well as the passive jet horizontally extends in the wake region the gap ratio has a slight capability of control in maximum magnitudes of the streamwise velocity contours of the passive jet the time averaged velocity patterns have ability to merge with surrounding patterns when their length in the horizontal direction is sufficient the streamwise velocity contours tend to move the upward due to the presence of the flat plate however this tendency of the jet flow changes with increasing the hole diameter and the results in fig 6 are also affected by this flow nature namely fluid pressure within the zone in the junction of the sphere and the flat plate is attenuated using the passive jet the sphere which touches to the flat plate blocks development of the boundary layer above the flat plate the blocked boundary layer flow follows the sphere surface and then contributes to the flow separation on the upper side of the sphere as a result of coando effect which is tendency of fluid flow to stay attached to a convex surface the separated flow reattaches to the surface of the flat plate the distance between the reattachment point of the separated flow on the flat plate and the sphere center is determined as 2d 85 mm for the smooth sphere in the absence of the hole and the spheres with a hole for all hole diameters when the gap ratio is increased to g d 0 10 as seen from the crossstream velocity contours fig 7 there are fluid flow regions moving to the upwards the maximum crossstream velocity magnitude of these regions is about 48 of the free stream velocity as seen from fig 7 the time averaged streamline patterns of the jet like flow between the sphere and the flat plate and the separated shear flow from the upper side of the sphere interact each other and hence create an unsteady recirculation region with focus point f1 in the wake region time averaged streamlines show that the passive jet pushes the jet like flow coming from downward between the sphere and the flat plate as the hole diameter of the sphere increases the passive jet from the hole pushes the jet like flow and cause higher velocity magnitudes in the y direction close to the region of flow separation thus this type of variation in crossstream velocity causes significant changes in the flow structure of the sphere wake entirely in the presence of the gap the flow in y direction dominates the wake of the sphere and limits the development patterns of the crossstream velocity caused by the flow separation on the upper side of the sphere however the maximum magnitudes of the crossstream velocity on the gap side for each sphere model attenuate with increasing the hole diameter even for g d 1 5 where effects of the flat plate almost disappear 3 3 turbulence statistics the boundary layer flow and the sphere interaction creates complex turbulent and unsteady flow features the efficiency of a flow control method depends on controlling turbulence characteristics as well as mean flow characteristics because the dynamic loading of fluid flow on structures is related to degree of turbulence the turbulence characteristics such as streamwise velocity fluctuations crossstream velocity fluctuations reynolds stress correlations and turbulence kinetic energy are discussed in this section fig 8 depicts distributions of the time averaged streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms for various gap and diameter ratios when the sphere and the flat wall are in contact g d 0 the streamwise velocity fluctuations contours take maximum values on the top shear layer for the smooth sphere with no hole however the presence of the passive jet creates much stronger streamwise velocity fluctuations than that on the top shear layer in other words the magnitudes of streamwise velocity fluctuations on the top shear layer are reduced by injecting passive jet inside to the wake region the peak values of the streamwise velocity fluctuations in the jet flow decrease when hole sphere diameter ratio is changed from d d 0 10 to 0 15 for g d 0 the flow passing through the gap gives rise to the peak magnitude of u rms on the top free shear layer when the hole is not present since the hole supplies fluid flow to the wake of the sphere it creates fluctuations more than the vortices shed from both sides of the sphere when the gap ratio is increased from g d 0 10 to 0 25 the magnitudes of u rms on the upper shear layer of the sphere models continue to increase the peak value of the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms of the top shear layer is about 0 321 for the sphere with no hole and decreases to 0 254 by 21 for the case of the sphere with the hole having d d 0 25 the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms of the bottom shear layer increase with increasing the hole diameter and takes its maximum magnitude for d d 0 25 when the gap ratio is set to g d 0 50 the distance between the sphere and the flat plate is too high to block the flow hence the gap flow loses its contribution to distributions of u rms for g d 0 5 the peak magnitudes of the streamwise velocity fluctuations occurring in the close region of the flat plate significantly decrease by 28 19 36 19 and 18 for the cases of the sphere with hole diameter ratios of d d 0 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively these ratios of decreasing change to 20 18 26 and 37 for g d 1 5 in the cases of the sphere with the hole diameter ratios of d d 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively distributions of the time averaged crossstream velocity fluctuations v rms are demonstrated in fig 9 the maximum fluctuation levels of the crossstream velocities increase with increasing the hole diameter the crossstream velocity fluctuations are significantly lessened due to the effect of the jet flow discharged into the wake region the peak magnitudes of v rms contours decrease by 16 compared to the sphere without hole case while their locations get closer to the sphere base to the upstream direction for g d 0 and d d 0 25 for g d 0 5 a single peak occurs for all cases of d d however the location of the peak magnitude is doubled in some cases of other values of g d and d d the maximum reduction on these values occurs for the case of the sphere with a hole of d d 0 20 and it is about 32 comparing to the absence of passive jet for g d 1 5 however the jet flow emanating from the sphere hole with a diameter ratio of d d 0 25 prevents the separated jet flows from the periphery of the sphere to get interaction by reattaching to each other the time averaged reynolds stress correlations u v shown in fig 10 have main patterns with the negative sign of notation within the entire wake of the sphere without jet flow for g d 0 the reynolds stresses with the positive sign of notation are produced when the passive jet is present for the same gap ratio moreover the region where the positive reynolds stresses cover is expanded for the sphere with the hole especially for larger diameter ratios of d d for the sphere without the passive jet the contours of the reynolds stress correlations take peak values of 0 021 and 0 017 for g d 0 the maximum reynolds stress values of the main positive and negative contours do not change considerably when the passive jet is discharged into the wake region for all g d and d d no significant variation is observed in the maximum magnitudes of the main patterns of the reynolds stress correlations u v moreover the peak magnitudes of the reynolds stress correlations of the passive jet increase with increasing the gap ratio of g d whereas that of the main patterns of u v decrease namely the presence of the hole plays a role of attenuating the maximum magnitudes of the main positive and negative contours further increase in the hole diameter ratio of d d results in lower the maximum magnitudes of these contours it can be inferred that the hole also plays a role of controlling the flow past the sphere located within the boundary layer of the flat plate for larger hole diameters the jet flow produces reynolds stress correlations with positive and negative values together and almost symmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis passing through the center of the hole except for g d 0 1 in this case the jet like flow coming from the gap alters the symmetry of the wake the turbulence level of the wake flow is a measure of the flow instability therefore distribution of tke patterns shown in fig 11 has crucial importance in the understanding of the turbulence level for g d 0 the maximum magnitude of tke is detected on the bottom side of the shear layer passing through the top side of the sphere and at a distance of nearly l d 1 5 however the location of this maximum point moves to the upstream direction in the presence of the hole for gap ratio of g d 0 the maximum values of tke contours are 0 028 0 048 0 051 and 0 051 for d d 0 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively the peak magnitude of tke of the passive jet rises for larger hole diameters whereas increasing the hole diameter has no significant role on the maximum magnitudes of the main tke patterns for all d d ratios the maximum magnitude of tke increases as the gap ratio g d increases presence of the gap allows forming tke patterns due to the flow passing through the gap but tke levels of these contours are always lower than that of the top side of the sphere even for g d 1 5 in which effects of the flat plate are limited when compared to the other cases for g d 0 it can be stated that the jet discharging from the hole with the diameter ratio of d d 0 25 is the best for controlling the flow because tke and u rms contours have fewer magnitudes particularly for the case of g d 0 25 magnitudes of tke distributions int the wake significantly decrease due to the passive jet for the upper shear layer without jet effect tke contours take the maximum peak value of 0 084 while it decreases by 33 3 and take its minimum peak value of 0 056 for the case d d 0 25 distributions of the time averaged streamwise velocity u and the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms along the vertical lines which are in the wake of the sphere with various spatial locations are given in figs 12 and 13 respectively the velocity magnitude of the jet flow of the sphere model of d d 0 250 is larger than that of the boundary layer flow over the flat plate in the absence of the sphere for g d 0 at l d 0 5 and 1 the strength of the jet flow for the all sphere models weakens for the locations further away from the sphere since the streamwise velocity u magnitudes are the highest at l d 0 5 the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms values take larger values at l d 1 and 1 5 because the jet flow mixes with the wake and induces the fluctuations for the small gap ratios when the sphere is located at g d 0 1 the jet flow diminishes its strength in an earlier distance as seen from the streamwise velocity u values in fig 12 the situation is inferred from the distributions of the streamlines on the flow field where the gap flow is moved upward in the wake of the sphere pushing up the jet flow therefore the jet flow could not penetrate into the deep of the wake at the upper shear layer of all the sphere models the magnitudes of the streamwise velocity fluctuation u rms are larger than that of the lower shear layer at g d 0 25 the gap flow is stronger than the jet flow at l d 1 5 and 2 in terms of streamwise velocity the gap flow could not occur at g d 1 5 where the sphere is out of the boundary layer at l d 2 the jet flows are fully mixed into the wake which in turn causes lower influence with the gap flow for d d 0 10 and 0 15 the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms magnitudes are always smaller for the cases of the passive jet than that of the smooth sphere 4 conclusions in this study a passive flow control method via a jet flow has been applied on the flow around a sphere which is immersed in a boundary layer flow the jet flow has been generated passively via a hole drilled from forward stagnation point to the rear of the sphere the hole diameters are determined as 10 15 20 and 25 of the smooth sphere diameter of 42 5 mm the experiments have been carried out in an open water channel for reynolds number of 5000 based on the sphere diameter and the free stream velocity it is demonstrated that the gap ratio and the hole sphere diameter ratio have substantial influence on the flow structure of the wake boundary layer interaction the boundary layer flow with a non uniform velocity profile creates a difference in the strength of the vortex shedding from the periphery of the sphere the gap flow changes the characteristics of the sphere wake significantly especially for g d 0 10 for the gap ratio of g d 0 5 the gap flow loses its jet like effect however the non uniform velocity profile still modifies the wake region as seen from the streamline results the passive jet generates a ring vortex close to the rear side of the sphere which increases the pressure on the rear surface of the sphere resulting in reducing unsteadiness in the wake and possibly the drag force presence of the hole attenuates the magnitudes of the turbulence characteristics furthermore these characteristics decrease with increasing the hole diameter however a larger hole diameter results in higher turbulence values in the passive jet the obtained results can be helpful to control flow induced vibrations damages and for numerical validations not only for the spherical structure but also for other bodies exposed to a turbulent flow in many engineering

22631,in the present investigation interactions between the vortices shedding from a single sphere and the boundary layer flow over a flat plate with various gap ratios have been investigated at re 5000 using the techniques of dye visualization and particle image velocimetry a passive jet has been created to control the flow past the sphere by a hole drilled into the sphere from the forward stagnation point to the rear of the sphere with various diameters the results show that the complex flow downstream of the sphere which is occurred from the combination of karman vortex street and the boundary layer over the flat plate can be controlled by a passive jet because the jet flow interrupts periodicity of the vortices shedding from the sphere by supplying fluid flow into the wake with relatively high velocity presence of the hole significantly attenuates the magnitudes of the turbulence characteristics furthermore the magnitudes of the turbulence characteristics decrease with increasing the hole diameter depending on the location of the sphere in the boundary layer however a larger hole diameter can result in higher turbulence levels in the region of the passive jet hence the effectiveness of the each case the diameter of the hole changes with the location of the sphere over the flat plate keywords flow control passive jet piv sphere turbulence 1 introduction flow around a sphere which is an ideal three dimensional bluff body has been gathering attractions in many engineering applications of single and two phase flows for various industries such as gas tanks artistic structures sports balls unmanned underwater vehicles etc interaction between atmospheric boundary layer flow of winds and buildings conveying of particles along pipes and underwater piping systems are obvious examples of these types of flows it is known that boundary layer flow causes vorticity flux which makes wake of a solid body more complicated than the wake of a solid body in a uniform flow by altering vortex shedding characteristics moreover a jet like flow also called gap flow has the ability to occur between a body and a wall flat plate when the body is in the close region of the wall distributions of vorticity generated by pressure and velocity gradients of the bluff body and gap flow create force and velocity fluctuations leading to vortex induced vibrations and scouring effects on the whole structure therefore experimental data about these types of flows could help engineers and scientists to eliminate possible errors that can cause irrevocable results wake characteristics and aerodynamic forces of a sphere contacting a stationary wall were investigated by okamoto 1980 an experimental study was conducted by tsutsui 2008 to explore qualitatively flow past a sphere positioned at various heights above a turbulent boundary layer using the smoke wire method and the surface oil flow pattern method ozgoren et al 2013a experimentally investigated flow structures around a sphere located in a turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate using piv technique for re 5x103 based on the sphere diameter and free stream velocity the boundary layer thickness with a value of 63 mm was higher than the sphere diameter of d 42 5 mm and the sphere was embedded into the turbulent boundary layer they reported that the wake flow structure of the sphere in the boundary layer was highly deformed because of interaction between the gap flow and the boundary layer flow turbulent flow structures behind a sphere and circular cylinder were experimentally compared by ozgoren et al 2011 visualization of flow around a sphere at re 320 to observe periodic shedding of counter rotating of vortex filaments was performed by leweke et al 1999 leweke et al 2006 studied physical aspects of instability of the flow around an impacting sphere normal to a solid wall flow characteristics of wake of a sphere at subcritical reynolds number were measured by jang and lee 2008 to describe recirculating vortices recirculation length and spatial distributions of turbulence statistics the insights gained from this study could lead the revealing of vortical flow structure and shear layer instability inside the near wake of a single sphere kiya et al 2001 and sakamoto and haniu 1990 categorized wake of a sphere with respect to strouhal number st for 300 re 4 104 achenbach 1972 1974 conducted experiments to qualitatively and quantitatively understand vortical structure of a sphere wake at various reynolds numbers moradian et al 2009 performed drag measurements of a sphere in a closed circuit wind tunnel for 2 2 x104 re 8x104 to reveal effects of free stream turbulence intensity and integral length scale as free stream turbulent parameters on the drag coefficient patnaik et al 1992 also measured drag force of a smooth stationary sphere located within a boundary layer for 3 62x103 re 6 45x104 tyagi et al 2006 reported that vortex shedding and largely organized motions of a flow in the downstream of a sphere could be suppressed by the effect of free stream turbulence simulations using the large eddy simulation model les were also utilized to investigate flow characteristics hassanzadeh et al 2011 and shear layer instability yun et al 2006 in the near wake of a sphere two frequency modes in the wake of a sphere which were arisen from the small scale instability of the separating shear layers and the large scale instability of the wake were detected by kim and durbin 1988 recently several control methods were utilized to reduce flow structure interactions and wake instability of a sphere such as passive jet roughened surface and o ring ozgoren et al 2012a 2012b and 2013b shaafi et al 2017 used a second order accurate immersed boundary method to investigate laminar flow past a rotating cylinder near a plane wall they classified the flow patterns based on the vortex shedding patterns which are regular karman vortex shedding irregular vortex shedding and complete vortex suppression surface modifications are used frequently for the passive control of the wakes of bluff bodies canpolat 2015 choi et al 2006 investigated influence of dimples on drag reduction of a sphere it is revealed that the dimples cause local flow separation reattachment that increases the turbulence level of the boundary layer and flow overcomes a strong adverse pressure delaying main flow separation and reducing form drag wang et al 2003 developed an empirical model to estimate the broadband unsteady force spectrum induced on a rigid sphere in a nominally steady and uniform flow they measured flow induced unsteady lift and drag forces independently of each other in a towing tank suryanarayana and meier 1995 and suryanarayana and prabhu 2000 investigated ventilation effects on flow characteristics in the wake of a sphere in a uniform flow they recorded that in the subcritical range of reynolds number for less than 2 105 ventilation caused a marginal downstream shift in the location of laminar boundary layer separation there was only a small change in the vortex shedding frequency higuchi and kiura 2012 studied the knuckleball effect that is due to asymmetric flow separation around a baseball they found that the seam triggers the boundary layer transition and delays the flow separation or causes separation itself depending on the position of the seam asai and kamemoto 2011 analyzed characteristics of the vortex structure of a soccer ball subjected to the knuckling effect knuckleball using high speed video images and smoke generating agents they brought an explanation to the phenomenon of large scale undulations of the vortex trail by relating the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the knuckleball with fluctuation frequency of the lift and side forces zhang and shi 2016 investigated flow past a circular cylinder with a splitter plate above a moving wall for various reynolds numbers and gap values between the cylinder and the wall they concluded that the splitter plate reduces the drag and lift coefficients compared with the near wall case which is without a splitter plate in this study the flow structure interaction between separated shear flow from the sphere and the flat plate forming a boundary layer flow was investigated via particle image velocimetry piv and rhodamine 6g dye flow visualization techniques in the influence of a passive jet flow through a hole with various diameters on the sphere center conventional flow visualization techniques may offer important information and have made a significant contribution to the studies of vortical structures in turbulence however these results are sometimes confusing and even misleading due to the fact that the image shows streak lines or timelines etc instead of streamlines or velocity vectors the complicated interaction of boundary layer bluff body and passive jet wake flow must be understood to determine how the flow structure can be controlled fortunately recent developments in piv have revealed much more information in turbulent flows and made more detailed data about a flow structure the experimental data obtained by piv will lead to clearly understand these kinds of fluid structure interactions while it will give remarkable results to validate numerical simulations 2 experimental facility and parameters particle image velocimetry experiments were conducted in a water channel with a test section of 8000 mm 1000 mm 750 mm length width height at the department of mechanical engineering in cukurova university turkey the water circulating throughout the channel using a centrifugal pump has surface open to the air an overview of the experimental system of the sphere is shown in fig 1 a flat plate with dimensions of 2000 mm 980 mm 10 mm having a sharp leading edge was located over the bottom surface of the water channel and the boundary layer flow was triggered via a circular trip wire the diameter of the trip wire and the distance from the leading edge have been determined experimentally the diameter of the trip wire wire that is used for this study is 5 mm and the trip wire is located 80 mm downstream of the leading edge of the plate the thickness of the boundary layer was δ 63 mm at the center of the sphere for re 5000 at a distance of 1400 mm from the leading edge of the plate the nominal thickness of the boundary layer was estimated from the velocity profile using the definition of one percent defect of the free stream velocity in the absence of the sphere displacement and momentum thickness ratios according to the boundary layer thickness were calculated as δ δ 0 18 and θ δ 0 13 respectively the boundary layer shape factor h δ θ is 1 42 this value is very close to the range of 1 2 h 1 4 for the consideration of fully developed turbulent flow the plot in fig 2 leads that agreement between the experimental results and the power law expression of u u y δ 1 n for n 7 is excellent the sphere with a diameter of 42 5 mm was constructed from plexiglas material letting the laser light to pass through the sphere easily all the sphere models were manufactured using a high precision cnc machine and the surfaces of sphere models were highly polished preventing effects of surface roughness the diameters of the holes in the sphere centerline are 4 250 mm 6 375 mm 8 500 mm and 10 625 mm corresponding to ratios of d d 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively the sphere was held freely in the water channel using a circular bar with a diameter of 5 mm to avoid vibration the bar was connected to the sphere at the backward stagnation point for minimizing disturbance within the measuring plane the results acquired from the dye visualization experiments were compared to the literature for revealing the degree of disturbance of the support bar on the experiments as a result the effects of the support bar are negligible on the current study the gap between the lower point of the sphere and the surface of the flat plate was changed from 0 to 63 75 mm for the cases investigating the effect of gap ratio and normalized with sphere diameter as g d the solid blockage ratio of the sphere support was 1 3 while the sphere was far away from free surface effects for satisfying the nyquist criterion an overlap of 50 was utilized for the interrogation process totally 700 image pairs which included two successive 350 image pairs acquired in one continuous run were used in post processing the images were taken at a rate of 15 hz in the experiments 700 instantaneous

instantaneous flow features fig 3 shows the instantaneous flow fields of dye visualization and vorticity ω which are obtained using the rhodamine dye under laser light and the piv measurements respectively in fig 3 successively arisen vortices are marked by letters from a to g for revealing development of the small scale vortices for the first sight the top side of the wake has wavy form which is due to the flow separation from the surface of the sphere the difference among the velocity magnitudes within the interface of the free stream flow and the wake creates these small scale vortices leading to kelvin helmholtz instability the rapid velocity rise in the close field of the border of the wake creates a considerable disturbance ozgoren et al 2013a the dark colored region close to the back the sphere demonstrates the existence of the jet flow it is clearly seen that the amount of fresh fluid supplied to the wake region increases with increasing hole diameter this passively created jet flow limits the interaction between the upper and lower shear layers the images related to the instantaneous vorticity ω exhibit patterns of vorticity rotating clockwise and counterclockwise directions for all cases of a passive jet a pair of vorticity contours are seen immediately in the downstream region of the sphere in the absence of the passive jet at g d 0 when the sphere touches the flat plate small scale vorticity layers pile down upon the flat plate in the vicinity of the sphere surface however the passive jet sweeps the great number of vorticity layers within this field namely the passive jet induces the fluid velocity in this field magnitudes of the pair of the instantaneous vorticity due to the passive jet increase with enlarging the diameter of the hole however another free stream with high velocity coming from the clearance between the flat plate and the sphere at g d 0 10 lifts the fluid to the upper side in the near field of the sphere and the flat plate therefore the passive jet cannot penetrate too deep of the wake similar to the case of g d 0 for g d 0 10 larger hole diameter can provide the passive jet ability to move inward of the wake easily when the gap ratio is increased further to g d 0 25 and 0 5 stable vorticity layers of the flat plate are clearly identifiable similar to the vorticity field shed from the lower side of the sphere it can be inferred that the interaction between the flat plate and the sphere weakens compared to the cases with lower gap ratios in these cases kelvin helmholtz small scale vortices are also evident for the lower side of the sphere particularly for g d 0 5 the whole structure of the wake is deflected to the upward direction but the deflected wake tends to be parallel to the horizontal axis when the gap ratio increases when the gap ratio is set to g d 1 50 it can be considered that the sphere is out of the boundary layer of the flat plate and the jet like behavior of the gap flow is wholly lost similar structures to well known karman vortex streets begin to occur in the downstream region of the smooth sphere without a hole when the hole diameter ratio is increased from d d 0 10 to 0 25 the well known kelvin helmholtz vortices appear to be highly suppressed due to the effect of the jet flow since magnitudes of the vorticity of the separated shear layer around the sphere decrease more jet flow injection inward of the sphere wake increases magnitudes of instantaneous vorticity 3 2 time averaged flow features the recirculation zone and reverse flow are occurred due to low pressure within the wake which forces the separated flow to reattach the focus point of this recirculation region is represented by f1 for the smooth sphere case without a hole for g d 0 on the first column of fig 4 for the same gap ratio the focus point f1 moves in the downstream direction when the hole exists another focus point f2 arises in the case of larger hole ratio starting from d d 0 200 in addition a slight variation is observed in the spatial location of the focus f2 since the gap ratio is increased to at g d 0 10 for the sphere without a hole a jet like flow coming from the gap travels around nearly half of periphery of the sphere and sweeps the fluid to the upward direction and merges with the separated flow on the top side of the sphere a saddle point s1 which is the separation point for the wake and the jet like flow is occurred moreover this flow nature forces the focus point f1 to move towards the flat wall which also causes another saddle point indicated by s2 when the hole exists firstly a focus f2 appears then another focus indicated by f3 is clearly seen in the second column of fig 4 with increasing hole diameter namely a larger hole diameter causes a secondary circulation zone with a relatively small size for the gap ratio g d 0 25 the size of this secondary circulation zone enlarges compared to the cases at g d 0 10 moreover a focus f4 which is a unique nature for this gap ratio appears on the flat wall the horizontal extent of the secondary circulation zone increases with increasing the gap ratio the size of focus f2 increases and its spatial location shifts downward in the absence of the effect of the flat wall at g d 1 50 this movement allows the occurrence of small size focus f4 for g d 1 50 when the hole diameter ratio is set to its largest value of d d 0 250 the time averaged vorticity contours which show severity of the flow separation are represented in fig 5 the vorticity region shown by p represents the flow separation from the upper side of the sphere while a and b are the vorticity region resulting from the passive jet the small scale eddies with positive and negative signs which cover entire wake in the images of instantaneous vorticity suppress each other and only large scale vortices are observed in the upper and lower shear layers and exit regions of the sphere hole the magnitudes of vorticities increase and their occupied area in the wake region enlarges with increasing the hole diameter the patterns of vorticity caused by the jet like flow are presented with q and r and shown in fig 5 for the smooth sphere case the vorticity region represented with q reaches up to the top free shear layer however it is blocked by the effect of the passive jet coming from the hole for g d 0 10 in the presence of the gap between the sphere and the flat wall negative vorticity layer of the passive jet interacts with the vorticity patterns of the sphere and the flat wall moreover the vorticity of the passive jet merges with the patterns of vorticity over the flat wall and encapsulates the vorticity patterns of the sphere in the vicinity of its bottom surface at g d 0 10 the time averaged streamwise velocity results are demonstrated in fig 6 the spatial locations of the saddle points are indicated with red dots for better comparison non dimensional maximum streamwise velocity magnitudes of the passive jets are 0 43 0 72 0 83 and 0 95 for the hole diameter ratios of d d 0 100 0 150 0 200 and 0 250 respectively at g d 0 since the hole diameter successively rises a significant increment occurs proportional to the hole diameter and streamwise velocity of the passive jet increase as well as the passive jet horizontally extends in the wake region the gap ratio has a slight capability of control in maximum magnitudes of the streamwise velocity contours of the passive jet the time averaged velocity patterns have ability to merge with surrounding patterns when their length in the horizontal direction is sufficient the streamwise velocity contours tend to move the upward due to the presence of the flat plate however this tendency of the jet flow changes with increasing the hole diameter and the results in fig 6 are also affected by this flow nature namely fluid pressure within the zone in the junction of the sphere and the flat plate is attenuated using the passive jet the sphere which touches to the flat plate blocks development of the boundary layer above the flat plate the blocked boundary layer flow follows the sphere surface and then contributes to the flow separation on the upper side of the sphere as a result of coando effect which is tendency of fluid flow to stay attached to a convex surface the separated flow reattaches to the surface of the flat plate the distance between the reattachment point of the separated flow on the flat plate and the sphere center is determined as 2d 85 mm for the smooth sphere in the absence of the hole and the spheres with a hole for all hole diameters when the gap ratio is increased to g d 0 10 as seen from the crossstream velocity contours fig 7 there are fluid flow regions moving to the upwards the maximum crossstream velocity magnitude of these regions is about 48 of the free stream velocity as seen from fig 7 the time averaged streamline patterns of the jet like flow between the sphere and the flat plate and the separated shear flow from the upper side of the sphere interact each other and hence create an unsteady recirculation region with focus point f1 in the wake region time averaged streamlines show that the passive jet pushes the jet like flow coming from downward between the sphere and the flat plate as the hole diameter of the sphere increases the passive jet from the hole pushes the jet like flow and cause higher velocity magnitudes in the y direction close to the region of flow separation thus this type of variation in crossstream velocity causes significant changes in the flow structure of the sphere wake entirely in the presence of the gap the flow in y direction dominates the wake of the sphere and limits the development patterns of the crossstream velocity caused by the flow separation on the upper side of the sphere however the maximum magnitudes of the crossstream velocity on the gap side for each sphere model attenuate with increasing the hole diameter even for g d 1 5 where effects of the flat plate almost disappear 3 3 turbulence statistics the boundary layer flow and the sphere interaction creates complex turbulent and unsteady flow features the efficiency of a flow control method depends on controlling turbulence characteristics as well as mean flow characteristics because the dynamic loading of fluid flow on structures is related to degree of turbulence the turbulence characteristics such as streamwise velocity fluctuations crossstream velocity fluctuations reynolds stress correlations and turbulence kinetic energy are discussed in this section fig 8 depicts distributions of the time averaged streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms for various gap and diameter ratios when the sphere and the flat wall are in contact g d 0 the streamwise velocity fluctuations contours take maximum values on the top shear layer for the smooth sphere with no hole however the presence of the passive jet creates much stronger streamwise velocity fluctuations than that on the top shear layer in other words the magnitudes of streamwise velocity fluctuations on the top shear layer are reduced by injecting passive jet inside to the wake region the peak values of the streamwise velocity fluctuations in the jet flow decrease when hole sphere diameter ratio is changed from d d 0 10 to 0 15 for g d 0 the flow passing through the gap gives rise to the peak magnitude of u rms on the top free shear layer when the hole is not present since the hole supplies fluid flow to the wake of the sphere it creates fluctuations more than the vortices shed from both sides of the sphere when the gap ratio is increased from g d 0 10 to 0 25 the magnitudes of u rms on the upper shear layer of the sphere models continue to increase the peak value of the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms of the top shear layer is about 0 321 for the sphere with no hole and decreases to 0 254 by 21 for the case of the sphere with the hole having d d 0 25 the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms of the bottom shear layer increase with increasing the hole diameter and takes its maximum magnitude for d d 0 25 when the gap ratio is set to g d 0 50 the distance between the sphere and the flat plate is too high to block the flow hence the gap flow loses its contribution to distributions of u rms for g d 0 5 the peak magnitudes of the streamwise velocity fluctuations occurring in the close region of the flat plate significantly decrease by 28 19 36 19 and 18 for the cases of the sphere with hole diameter ratios of d d 0 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively these ratios of decreasing change to 20 18 26 and 37 for g d 1 5 in the cases of the sphere with the hole diameter ratios of d d 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively distributions of the time averaged crossstream velocity fluctuations v rms are demonstrated in fig 9 the maximum fluctuation levels of the crossstream velocities increase with increasing the hole diameter the crossstream velocity fluctuations are significantly lessened due to the effect of the jet flow discharged into the wake region the peak magnitudes of v rms contours decrease by 16 compared to the sphere without hole case while their locations get closer to the sphere base to the upstream direction for g d 0 and d d 0 25 for g d 0 5 a single peak occurs for all cases of d d however the location of the peak magnitude is doubled in some cases of other values of g d and d d the maximum reduction on these values occurs for the case of the sphere with a hole of d d 0 20 and it is about 32 comparing to the absence of passive jet for g d 1 5 however the jet flow emanating from the sphere hole with a diameter ratio of d d 0 25 prevents the separated jet flows from the periphery of the sphere to get interaction by reattaching to each other the time averaged reynolds stress correlations u v shown in fig 10 have main patterns with the negative sign of notation within the entire wake of the sphere without jet flow for g d 0 the reynolds stresses with the positive sign of notation are produced when the passive jet is present for the same gap ratio moreover the region where the positive reynolds stresses cover is expanded for the sphere with the hole especially for larger diameter ratios of d d for the sphere without the passive jet the contours of the reynolds stress correlations take peak values of 0 021 and 0 017 for g d 0 the maximum reynolds stress values of the main positive and negative contours do not change considerably when the passive jet is discharged into the wake region for all g d and d d no significant variation is observed in the maximum magnitudes of the main patterns of the reynolds stress correlations u v moreover the peak magnitudes of the reynolds stress correlations of the passive jet increase with increasing the gap ratio of g d whereas that of the main patterns of u v decrease namely the presence of the hole plays a role of attenuating the maximum magnitudes of the main positive and negative contours further increase in the hole diameter ratio of d d results in lower the maximum magnitudes of these contours it can be inferred that the hole also plays a role of controlling the flow past the sphere located within the boundary layer of the flat plate for larger hole diameters the jet flow produces reynolds stress correlations with positive and negative values together and almost symmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis passing through the center of the hole except for g d 0 1 in this case the jet like flow coming from the gap alters the symmetry of the wake the turbulence level of the wake flow is a measure of the flow instability therefore distribution of tke patterns shown in fig 11 has crucial importance in the understanding of the turbulence level for g d 0 the maximum magnitude of tke is detected on the bottom side of the shear layer passing through the top side of the sphere and at a distance of nearly l d 1 5 however the location of this maximum point moves to the upstream direction in the presence of the hole for gap ratio of g d 0 the maximum values of tke contours are 0 028 0 048 0 051 and 0 051 for d d 0 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively the peak magnitude of tke of the passive jet rises for larger hole diameters whereas increasing the hole diameter has no significant role on the maximum magnitudes of the main tke patterns for all d d ratios the maximum magnitude of tke increases as the gap ratio g d increases presence of the gap allows forming tke patterns due to the flow passing through the gap but tke levels of these contours are always lower than that of the top side of the sphere even for g d 1 5 in which effects of the flat plate are limited when compared to the other cases for g d 0 it can be stated that the jet discharging from the hole with the diameter ratio of d d 0 25 is the best for controlling the flow because tke and u rms contours have fewer magnitudes particularly for the case of g d 0 25 magnitudes of tke distributions int the wake significantly decrease due to the passive jet for the upper shear layer without jet effect tke contours take the maximum peak value of 0 084 while it decreases by 33 3 and take its minimum peak value of 0 056 for the case d d 0 25 distributions of the time averaged streamwise velocity u and the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms along the vertical lines which are in the wake of the sphere with various spatial locations are given in figs 12 and 13 respectively the velocity magnitude of the jet flow of the sphere model of d d 0 250 is larger than that of the boundary layer flow over the flat plate in the absence of the sphere for g d 0 at l d 0 5 and 1 the strength of the jet flow for the all sphere models weakens for the locations further away from the sphere since the streamwise velocity u magnitudes are the highest at l d 0 5 the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms values take larger values at l d 1 and 1 5 because the jet flow mixes with the wake and induces the fluctuations for the small gap ratios when the sphere is located at g d 0 1 the jet flow diminishes its strength in an earlier distance as seen from the streamwise velocity u values in fig 12 the situation is inferred from the distributions of the streamlines on the flow field where the gap flow is moved upward in the wake of the sphere pushing up the jet flow therefore the jet flow could not penetrate into the deep of the wake at the upper shear layer of all the sphere models the magnitudes of the streamwise velocity fluctuation u rms are larger than that of the lower shear layer at g d 0 25 the gap flow is stronger than the jet flow at l d 1 5 and 2 in terms of streamwise velocity the gap flow could not occur at g d 1 5 where the sphere is out of the boundary layer at l d 2 the jet flows are fully mixed into the wake which in turn causes lower influence with the gap flow for d d 0 10 and 0 15 the streamwise velocity fluctuations u rms magnitudes are always smaller for the cases of the passive jet than that of the smooth sphere 4 conclusions in this study a passive flow control method via a jet flow has been applied on the flow around a sphere which is immersed in a boundary layer flow the jet flow has been generated passively via a hole drilled from forward stagnation point to the rear of the sphere the hole diameters are determined as 10 15 20 and 25 of the smooth sphere diameter of 42 5 mm the experiments have been carried out in an open water channel for reynolds number of 5000 based on the sphere diameter and the free stream velocity it is demonstrated that the gap ratio and the hole sphere diameter ratio have substantial influence on the flow structure of the wake boundary layer interaction the boundary layer flow with a non uniform velocity profile creates a difference in the strength of the vortex shedding from the periphery of the sphere the gap flow changes the characteristics of the sphere wake significantly especially for g d 0 10 for the gap ratio of g d 0 5 the gap flow loses its jet like effect however the non uniform velocity profile still modifies the wake region as seen from the streamline results the passive jet generates a ring vortex close to the rear side of the sphere which increases the pressure on the rear surface of the sphere resulting in reducing unsteadiness in the wake and possibly the drag force presence of the hole attenuates the magnitudes of the turbulence characteristics furthermore these characteristics decrease with increasing the hole diameter however a larger hole diameter results in higher turbulence values in the passive jet the obtained results can be helpful to control flow induced vibrations damages and for numerical validations not only for the spherical structure but also for other bodies exposed to a turbulent flow in many engineering

22632,experiments show that the behavior of dropped cylindrical objects may be stochastic if small disturbances exist at the initial moment an envelope of various trajectories can be obtained from experimental tests in addition numerical results also indicate that small changes of initial states e g drop angle rolling frequency and the selection of drag coefficient affect the trajectory greatly if the initial state follows the gaussian distribution it can be considered as a nonlinear prediction problem then the unscented transformation ut method as a deterministic sampling method can be used to predict the trajectory in this paper we firstly present a systematic formulation of the cylinder s three degree of freedom 3dof of motions as a state space model secondly the ut method and the interval estimation method are employed to solve this prediction problem finally the predicted trajectories will be compared with the experimental data meanwhile two performance parameters are first proposed to evaluate the accuracy of predicted trajectory both parameters can be directly applied to the salvage and recovery of dropped objects in the offshore operations in addition the numerical results also show that the ut method is an efficient way to predict the trajectory of cylinders freely dropped into water keywords trajectory prediction dropped cylinders state space model offshore operations unscented transformation 1 introduction in the risk assessment of pipeline protection the probability of object excursions on the seabed is assumed to follow the gaussian distribution dnv 2010 in addition specialized techniques are required to predict the trajectories of dropped objects and the subsequent likelihood of striking additional structure and equipment as well as predicting the consequences of such impacts abs 2013 therefore the motion dynamics of objects falling into the water their landing points and a risk free zone on the seabed layouts are of great interest for oil companies to protect the oil and gas production equipment installed on the seabed aanesland numerically and experimentally investigated falling drilling pipes aanesland 1987 they observed six fall patterns for dropped pipe joints in their model tests those patterns have been adopted by dnv and included in the recommended practice dnv 2010 from the model tests it was found that the most important parameter is the angle of attack after water entry other then the falling height etc small differences in the drop angle gave some spreading touchdowns in the numerical simulation two dimensional 2d maneuvering equations were used to describe the motion of drilling pipes in which the trailing edge effect for a long slender body has been considered and further corrected due to the viscous effects newman 1977 it has been pointed out that the neglect of three dimensional effects may cause some errors for the motion in the vertical plane therefore an axial rotation of the cylinder should be considered overall the numerical results can be validated by model tests luo and davis also simulated the 2d motion of falling objects by solving the differential equations of motion luo and davis 1992 illustrative parametric studies are carried out in a computer program called delta it was found that the horizontal excursion at the seabed level is greatly affected by the drop angle in addition the maximum horizontal velocity of the object is dependent on both the drop height and the drop angle also the tangential drag coefficient seemed to have little impact on the trajectory meanwhile colwill and ahilan performed multiple numerical studies of trajectories of two dropped drill casings by using the same computer program delta these studies confirmed that the drop height above waterline and the initial drop angle were key parameters influencing the horizontal velocity reliability based impact analysis successfully established the relationship between the impact velocity and the probability of its exceedance colwill and ahilan 1992 katteland and øygarden evaluated the risk related to the dropped objects in offshore oil and the gas industry katteland and øygarden 1995 they established four distributions to describe the spreading of dropped objects from an offshore installation at deep water in the proposed example the effect of the wind the waves and the currents have also been studied after the bp oil spill in 2010 the research related to the safety and risk assessment of subsea pipelines have become hot yasseri experimentally investigated the falling of model scale cylinders through the calm water with the low initial entry velocity and concluded that the error of the landing location of free falling cylinders is no more than 10 20 30 40 and 50 of the water depth with the probability confidence 50 80 90 and 95 respectively yasseri 2014 awotahegn performed a series of model tests to investigate the trajectory and seabed distribution of two drill pipes 8 and 12 falling from defined heights above the water surface into the calm water awotahegn 2014 he plotted and statistically analyzed the distribution of landing points on the seabed for the drop angles from 0 to 90 after comparing them with the results from a simplified method in dnv 2010 he concluded that this simplified method is generally conservative in addition the most recent numerical analysis of dropped cylindrical objects may include xiang et al 2016 xiang et al 2017a xiang et al 2017b and xiang et al 2019 in this paper the three degree of freedom 3dof equations of motion that is the surge the sway and the pitch are used to describe a cylinder s dynamics in two dimensions the calculation of hydrodynamics forces on the cylinder is based on the boundary layer theory and the morison equation then its state space model is constructed in order to easily investigate the effects of various factors such as the drop angle the rolling frequency etc both previous numerical studies and experimental tests have shown that its falling trajectory highly depends on those factors e g xiang et al 2016 xiang et al 2017a and xiang et al 2017b the landing point distribution of dropped cylinders seems random therefore the random disturbance will be tentatively added and considered at the initial state in the prediction of its trajectory the ut method is used to statistically calculate its trajectory corresponding to the different drop angles the calculated drop envelope is compared with the experimental envelope in 2d published in dnv 2010 two performance parameters have been proposed for the first time to evaluate how accurately the predicted trajectory compared with the experimental results finally some recommendations about how to apply both measures in practice are provided 2 problem formulation 2 1 equations of motion eom for dropped cylinders in two dimensions 2d two coordinate systems are involved in the two dimensional 2d theory as shown in fig 1 let o x z denote the global coordinate system where the x axis points to the north along the calm water surface and the z axis points upwards vertically the local coordinate system which is denoted by o x z is fixed on the cylinder and the x axis is aligned with the cylinder s axis the origin o of the coordinate system o x z is assumed to be located at the center of the gravity of the cylinder both coordinate systems o x z and o x z coincide when the cylinder is horizontally situated on the water surface at the beginning in this paper the cylinder is assumed to be rigid and slender and its mass is uniformly distributed therefore the mass center and the geometric center coincide aanesland simplified the problem as a 2d problem where only motion in the x z plane are considered aanesland 1987 the velocity components are u 1 surge u 3 heave and ω 2 pitch the equations of the motion are given in 1 m ρ g sin β f d x m u 1 2 m ρ g cos β f d z u 1 m t u 3 u 1 x t m t ω 2 m 33 u 3 m u 3 u 1 ω 2 3 m d y u 1 m 33 x t m t u 3 u 1 x t 2 m t ω 2 m 55 ω 2 m 55 ω 2 where β the instantaneous rotational angle between the x axis and the x axis m the mass of the cylinder m 55 the moment of inertia in the pitch direction m 33 the added mass in heave direction from the strip theory m 55 the added mass in pitch direction from the strip theory m t the 2d added mass in heave direction at the trailing edge x t the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge g the acceleration of the gravity ρ the density of the water the volume of the cylinder it should be noted that the motion in 1 3 are stated in the body fixed coordinate system o x z the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge x t is introduced because the ends of the cylinder are not pointed the slender body theory assumes smoothly varying geometries but the abrupt end of the cylinder does not satisfy this condition an additional force component is included to consider this trailing edge effect for a long slender body as shown in curly brackets on the right side of 2 3 newman 1977 the rest terms are the inertial forces and the moments in addition the viscous forces and moment f d x f d z and m d y are evaluated in the following way 4 f d x 0 664 π d v ρ 2 l u 1 u 1 1 8 ρ π c d x d 2 u 1 u 1 5 f d z 0 5 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ c d z d u z x u z x d x 6 m d y 0 5 0 5 l 0 5 l ρ c d z d u z x u

component hoerner 1965 the morison equation is used in 5 and 6 and the unknown parameter u z x is the local relative velocity in the z axis direction between the cylinder and the water it may be represented as 7 u z x u 3 ω 2 x 0 5 l x 0 5 l substitute 7 into 5 6 we obtain 8 f d z 0 5 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l u 3 ω 2 x u 3 ω 2 x d x 9 m d y 0 5 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l x u 3 ω 2 x u 3 ω 2 x d x where d the diameter of the cylinder v the kinematic viscosity of the water l the length of the cylinder c d x the drag coefficient in the x direction c d z the drag coefficient in the z direction in the numerical simulation after solving u 1 u 3 and ω 2 at each time step the motion in the local coordinate system can be transformed to the motion in the global system by using the following relationship 10 x y cos β sin β sin β cos β u 1 u 3 where the initial value x 0 y 0 0 0 and β ω 2 because the axis y and the axis y are parallel and thus the rotation speed of the dropped cylinder around the axis y and the axis y coincide 2 2 the state space model the equations of the motion for dropped cylinder in two dimensions can be well formulated into a state based nonlinear dynamic

3 k the pitch ω 2 k and the angle β k at each time k 2 3 the state point prediction and unscented transformation in reality the state space model described in sec 2 2 can be generally summarized as 12 x k f k x k or the discretized state based model e g using euler method with small time instance d t which is the basic framework used in the nonlinear state prediction problem mendel and oppenheim 1995 13 x k 1 f k d x k x k d t f k x k due to the disturbance of the initial state x 0 the state x k can be viewed as a stochastic process the nonlinear state point prediction is forecasting the information about x k λ for some λ 0 at time k i e to obtain information about what x k λ will be like subsequent to the time k at which the information is produced in obtaining the information the state space model 13 and measurements up till time k can be used anderson and moore 1979 in the statistical point of view the information refers to the probability density function pdf or at least the statistics of interest e g the mean and covariance of the state x k at each time k the unscented transformation ut method which is first proposed by julier and uhlman julier and uhlmann 1997 and widely used for the parameter estimation and the state estimation e g der merwe and wan 2001 wan and merwe 2000 is a mathematical tool to solve the nonlinear point prediction problems the ut method addresses the problem by using a deterministic sampling approach and the statistics of the state are encoded by using a set of carefully chosen sample points these sample points which completely capture the prior mean and covariance of the state x k guarantee to capture the posterior mean and the posterior covariance of x k 1 accurately to the 3rd order when propagated through the nonlinear system f k d consider the following transformation 14 y h x the random variable y which is required to be estimated is related to the random variable x x p x through the nonlinear transformation h here x x p x denotes the random variable x with mean x and covariance p x the problem is to calculate a consistent estimate of y with mean y and covariance p y the approach of the ut fully utilizes the set of sigma points s which consists of 2 n x 1 predesigned vectors and their associated weights to estimating the mean y and covariance p y of y the set of sigma points s is supposed to constructed in a way that it captures the information e g the mean and covariance of the input random variable x julier et al 2000 one way of constructing the set of sigma points s is in the following 15 x 0 x w 0 w 0 x i x n x 1 w 0 p x i w i 1 w 0 2 n x x i n x x n x 1 w 0 p x i w i n x 1 w 0 2 n x where n x is the dimension of the random variable x w 0 the weight on the mean points is a tuning parameter and the operator is the cholesky decomposition and i denotes the i th column of the decomposed matrix i 1 2 n x the estimate of y y p y is as follows 16 y j h x j y j 0 2 n x 1 w j y j p y j 0 2 n x 1 w j y j y y j y alternative ways of constructing the set of the sigma points s are summarized in menegaz et al 2015 furthermore other numerical integration methods that are akin to ut method can be found in ito and xiong 2000 and meng et al 2018 2 4 the interval estimation the problem of the point estimation is to find a point to estimate the unknown parameters of interest however in many cases it seems to be desirable that a point estimate should be accompanied by some interval about the point estimate together with some measure of assurance that the true value of the parameter lies within the interval instead of estimating the true value to be a point we might make the inference of estimating that the true value of the parameter is contained in some interval that is the interval estimation mood et al 1974 in practice estimates are often given in the form of the estimate plused or minused by a certain amount for a gaussian density the estimate x is approximated by a gaussian random variable with given the first two moments that is x n x σ and the interval estimate is 17 p x σ z 1 α 2 x x σ z 1 α 2 α α 0 1 which means the probability that the random interval x σ z 1 α 2 x σ z 1 α 2 which is called confidence interval covers the unknown true estimate x is 100 α and α is called the confidence coefficient for state estimation problems the unscented transformation described in sec 2 3 is applied to estimation the state x k x k p k under the gaussian assumption that the state x k n x k p k the confidence interval of each elements of the state x k is 18 x ˆ i k p i i k z 1 α 2 x ˆ i k p i i k z 1 α 2 where x i k and p i i k denote the i th element of the state x k and the i th diagonal element of the error covariance p k respectively and z 1 α 2 is obtained by the two tail table of gaussian distribution once α is determined in our simulation the exact value of x i k and p i i k i 1 2 3 4 at each time step k can be obtained by ut method substitute the values in 18 and then the coordinate transformation 10 can be applied to calculate the envelope of the trajectory prediction 2 5 ideal truth and practical truth when people simulate the trajectory of the dropped cylinder usually two different types of the true trajectories are often encountered i e the ideal truth and the practical truth the ideal truth is generated by 1 3 with knowing the exact initial state without any error of the dropping cylinder so the trajectory under such condition is a deterministic process rather than a stochastic one however in practice we are unable to know the exact initial state but a range that covers the exact initial state under such situations the initial state is modeled as a random variable with some known distribution and naturally the primary choice of the distribution is the gaussian distribution of which the mean is the most likely initial state we believe and the covariance is the error from the disturbance respectively note that the ut method provides a suboptimal way to predict the practical truth which has been widely used in electrical engineering wan and merwe 2000 in this paper we simulate both the ideal truth and the practical truth at each scenario and compare our predicted trajectory with both truths to help people understand the difference directly for instance under the scenario of the drop angle 45 the initial state of ideal truth is x 0 it 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s π 4 rad and the initial state of practical truth is one realization of the following gaussian distribution x 0 pt n x 0 p 0 where x 0 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s π 4 rad p 0 diag 10 4 m 2 s 2 10 4 m 2 s 2 π 90 2 rad 2 s 2 π 90 2 rad 2 the propagation of two differernt initial states is goverened by the dynamic model 11 this can result in the trajectories of ideal truth and practical truth respectively 3 case study 3 1 properties of dropped cylinders the properties of dropped cylinders are given in table 1 they were freely dropped from the calm water surface in the experimental tests aanesland 1987 in the numerical analysis they are also assumed to fall into water freely more details about the experimental tests can be found in aanesland 1987 3 2 two performance parameters and the results for drop angle 45 the state space model of dropped cylinders was successfully constructed in sec 2 2 as stated before the whole state process is stochastic and the model provides us a convenient way to consider the effects of the disturbance the ut method is a statistical tool to predict the trajectory based on the model to begin with consider the drop angle 45 in fig 2 the black the red and the green solid line represent the ideal truth the practical truth and the predicted trajectory from the ut method respectively the green dash line and the dash dot line represent the upper limit ul and the lower limit ll from the ut method respectively the blue dash line and the dash dot line represent the upper limit ul and the lower limit ll from experimental tests respectively the case shown in fig 2 corresponds to α 0 5 with the drop angle 45 similar figures can be obtained corresponding to different α s please refer to the appendix for other figures in which α is from 0 1 to 0 9 with increment 0 1 overall the predicted trajectory by ut method green line is very close to both the ideal truth black line and practical truth red line in fig 3 the shadow area in color cyan is the overlap area a o l p between the predicted drop range from ut method and the one from the experimental envelope and the area covered by experimental envelope can be defined as a e e here a new performance parameter which is the ratio between overlap area a o l p and the area of experimental envelope a e e is proposed as following 19 r a a o l p a e e it can be used to measure the quality of numerical results compared with the experimental data usually when r a is greater than 0 5 it is considered that the area of coincidence is large and the probability of occurrence is also large further the other performance parameter which is the ratio between the overlap length l o l p and the experimental envelope l e e at the bottom can be proposed in a similar way 20 r l l o l p l e e it also indicates the accuracy of predicted length on the bottom if compared with the possible range from experimental tests for the case with drop angle 45 the calculated r a and r l have been summarized in table 2 corresponding to various confidence coefficient α as shown in this table both r a and r l monotonically increase w r t the confidence coefficient the first occurrence for r a greater than 0 5 corresponds to α 0 5 the calculated r a and r l are 0 51 and 0 23 respectively this means that about 58 of the estimated area overlaps with the measured area and the confidence level is at least 50 these results can fully provide the confidence for the engineers or on site operators that we can start searching for the falling cylinders from the touch point derived from ut estimate in addition the other parameter r l may provide some reference information about the coincidence of the calculated length and the measured length on the bottom consider that this is a two dimensional problem in reality it may give the remote operated vehicles rovs command to search for the target whether to start from the left or right various cases considering different confidence coefficients α from 0 1 to 0 9 with increment 0 1 have been carried out and analyzed the ratios are all summaried in table 2 3 3 trajectory prediction with the drop angle 30 and 60 the numerical results are compared with the experimental envelope for the drop angle 30 as shown in the 4th column and the 5th column of table 2 similarly both r a and r l monotonically increase with the increase of the confidence coefficient the first occurrence for r a greater than 0 5 corresponds to α 0 5 the calculated r a and r l are 0 58 and 0 65 respectively this means that about 58 of the estimated area overlaps with the measured area and the confidence level is 60 the trajectory prediction using the ut method corresponding to the confidence coefficient α 0 5 has been shown in fig 4 consequently the overlap is shown in fig 5 for the case with the drop angle 60 both r a and r l monotonically increase with the increase of the confidence coefficient α as indicated by the data in 6th column and 7th column of table 2 the first occurrence for r a greater than 0 5 corresponds to α 0 7 the calculated r a and r l are 0 58 and 0 51 respectively this means that about 58 of the estimated area overlaps with the measured area and the confidence level is 70 the trajectory prediction using the ut method corresponding to confidence coefficient α 0 7 has been shown in fig 6 consequently the overlap is shown in fig 7 3 4 measures of performance evaluation the state based model and the prediction algorithm for parameter signal and state estimation are widely used in science and engineering no matter how solid such a model or algorithm is in theory its performance and characteristics must be evaluated in practice to serve a number of purposes such as verification of its validity demonstration of its performance and comparison with other algorithms as stated before two performance parameters r a and r l have been proposed to evaluate the validity of the model in 1 3 and also the algorithm of the prediction method r a listed in table 2 can be further plotted in fig 8 the curves of r a vs α for all the three drop angles seem roughly linear overall a greater confidence level α always results a larger performance ratio r a this indicates that the estimated area from ut method can always cover the experimental envelope further r l in table 2 can be also plotted in fig 9 the curves of r l vs α show more obvious nonlinearity than the curves r a vs α in fact the ratio r l only conveys the information at the last moment which is different from r a it seems that the locations of drop point at the bottom may be more isolated uncertain or even random therefore the performance ratio r a may be more valuable however r l can still be used as an auxiliary parameter with a certain reference value in addition mse p the mean squared error mse between ut and the practical truth and mse i the mse between ut and the ideal truth can be easily calculated given each drop angle that is 21 mse p 1 n i 0 n x ut z ut i x pt z pt i x ut z ut i x pt z pt i 22 mse i 1 n i 0 n x ut z ut i x it z it i x ut z ut i x it z it i where x ut z ut i x pt z pt i and x it z it i are the position of ut prediction the practical truth and the ideal truth in the global system 10 at time step i respectively and n is the total time steps note that the two diagonal terms of mse p and mse i as shown in 21 and 22 represent the mse of position along x axis and z axis respectively and they are summarized in table 3 it should be addressed that the ut method provides a sub optimized solution statistically this indicates that the mse p should be small as shown by it values in 3 further a smaller value of mse i means that the ut method also provides a precise solution approaching more closely to the ideal truth 4 conclusions in this paper the state space model has been successfully constructed to investigate the stochastic behavior of the cylinders falling into water in two dimensions in fact such stochastic process has been observed in numerous experimental tests based on the state space model the random disturbance at the initial state can be easily added and studied in addition the ut method is utilized to statistically predict its trajectory corresponding to different drop angles the mean position of calculated trajectory has been compared with the idea truth and the practical truth and they reach agreement very well then the interval estimate based on ut can be compared with the experimental envelope two performance ratios r a and r l have been first proposed in this paper to meet the requirement from the offshore engineering industry both ratios can be used to evaluate the accuracy of numerical predictions by comparing them with the experimental results they both could be directly adopted by industry to the salvage and recover the dropped objects in operations therefore they can be a reasonable criteria which can be accepted by both academia and industry based on the research results obtained in this paper the trajectory prediction corresponding to the confidence coefficient α equal or greater than 0 7 should be considered to be reliable and applicable future work may focus on investigating the stochastic behavior in three dimensions by extending the research work mentioned in this paper appendix fig 10 trajectory prediction with the

22632,experiments show that the behavior of dropped cylindrical objects may be stochastic if small disturbances exist at the initial moment an envelope of various trajectories can be obtained from experimental tests in addition numerical results also indicate that small changes of initial states e g drop angle rolling frequency and the selection of drag coefficient affect the trajectory greatly if the initial state follows the gaussian distribution it can be considered as a nonlinear prediction problem then the unscented transformation ut method as a deterministic sampling method can be used to predict the trajectory in this paper we firstly present a systematic formulation of the cylinder s three degree of freedom 3dof of motions as a state space model secondly the ut method and the interval estimation method are employed to solve this prediction problem finally the predicted trajectories will be compared with the experimental data meanwhile two performance parameters are first proposed to evaluate the accuracy of predicted trajectory both parameters can be directly applied to the salvage and recovery of dropped objects in the offshore operations in addition the numerical results also show that the ut method is an efficient way to predict the trajectory of cylinders freely dropped into water keywords trajectory prediction dropped cylinders state space model offshore operations unscented transformation 1 introduction in the risk assessment of pipeline protection the probability of object excursions on the seabed is assumed to follow the gaussian distribution dnv 2010 in addition specialized techniques are required to predict the trajectories of dropped objects and the subsequent likelihood of striking additional structure and equipment as well as predicting the consequences of such impacts abs 2013 therefore the motion dynamics of objects falling into the water their landing points and a risk free zone on the seabed layouts are of great interest for oil companies to protect the oil and gas production equipment installed on the seabed aanesland numerically and experimentally investigated falling drilling pipes aanesland 1987 they observed six fall patterns for dropped pipe joints in their model tests those patterns have been adopted by dnv and included in the recommended practice dnv 2010 from the model tests it was found that the most important parameter is the angle of attack after water entry other then the falling height etc small differences in the drop angle gave some spreading touchdowns in the numerical simulation two dimensional 2d maneuvering equations were used to describe the motion of drilling pipes in which the trailing edge effect for a long slender body has been considered and further corrected due to the viscous effects newman 1977 it has been pointed out that the neglect of three dimensional effects may cause some errors for the motion in the vertical plane therefore an axial rotation of the cylinder should be considered overall the numerical results can be validated by model tests luo and davis also simulated the 2d motion of falling objects by solving the differential equations of motion luo and davis 1992 illustrative parametric studies are carried out in a computer program called delta it was found that the horizontal excursion at the seabed level is greatly affected by the drop angle in addition the maximum horizontal velocity of the object is dependent on both the drop height and the drop angle also the tangential drag coefficient seemed to have little impact on the trajectory meanwhile colwill and ahilan performed multiple numerical studies of trajectories of two dropped drill casings by using the same computer program delta these studies confirmed that the drop height above waterline and the initial drop angle were key parameters influencing the horizontal velocity reliability based impact analysis successfully established the relationship between the impact velocity and the probability of its exceedance colwill and ahilan 1992 katteland and øygarden evaluated the risk related to the dropped objects in offshore oil and the gas industry katteland and øygarden 1995 they established four distributions to describe the spreading of dropped objects from an offshore installation at deep water in the proposed example the effect of the wind the waves and the currents have also been studied after the bp oil spill in 2010 the research related to the safety and risk assessment of subsea pipelines have become hot yasseri experimentally investigated the falling of model scale cylinders through the calm water with the low initial entry velocity and concluded that the error of the landing location of free falling cylinders is no more than 10 20 30 40 and 50 of the water depth with the probability confidence 50 80 90 and 95 respectively yasseri 2014 awotahegn performed a series of model tests to investigate the trajectory and seabed distribution of two drill pipes 8 and 12 falling from defined heights above the water surface into the calm water awotahegn 2014 he plotted and statistically analyzed the distribution of landing points on the seabed for the drop angles from 0 to 90 after comparing them with the results from a simplified method in dnv 2010 he concluded that this simplified method is generally conservative in addition the most recent numerical analysis of dropped cylindrical objects may include xiang et al 2016 xiang et al 2017a xiang et al 2017b and xiang et al 2019 in this paper the three degree of freedom 3dof equations of motion that is the surge the sway and the pitch are used to describe a cylinder s dynamics in two dimensions the calculation of hydrodynamics forces on the cylinder is based on the boundary layer theory and the morison equation then its state space model is constructed in order to easily investigate the effects of various factors such as the drop angle the rolling frequency etc both previous numerical studies and experimental tests have shown that its falling trajectory highly depends on those factors e g xiang et al 2016 xiang et al 2017a and xiang et al 2017b the landing point distribution of dropped cylinders seems random therefore the random disturbance will be tentatively added and considered at the initial state in the prediction of its trajectory the ut method is used to statistically calculate its trajectory corresponding to the different drop angles the calculated drop envelope is compared with the experimental envelope in 2d published in dnv 2010 two performance parameters have been proposed for the first time to evaluate how accurately the predicted trajectory compared with the experimental results finally some recommendations about how to apply both measures in practice are provided 2 problem formulation 2 1 equations of motion eom for dropped cylinders in two dimensions 2d two coordinate systems are involved in the two dimensional 2d theory as shown in fig 1 let o x z denote the global coordinate system where the x axis points to the north along the calm water surface and the z axis points upwards vertically the local coordinate system which is denoted by o x z is fixed on the cylinder and the x axis is aligned with the cylinder s axis the origin o of the coordinate system o x z is assumed to be located at the center of the gravity of the cylinder both coordinate systems o x z and o x z coincide when the cylinder is horizontally situated on the water surface at the beginning in this paper the cylinder is assumed to be rigid and slender and its mass is uniformly distributed therefore the mass center and the geometric center coincide aanesland simplified the problem as a 2d problem where only motion in the x z plane are considered aanesland 1987 the velocity components are u 1 surge u 3 heave and ω 2 pitch the equations of the motion are given in 1 m ρ g sin β f d x m u 1 2 m ρ g cos β f d z u 1 m t u 3 u 1 x t m t ω

the moment of inertia in the pitch direction m 33 the added mass in heave direction from the strip theory m 55 the added mass in pitch direction from the strip theory m t the 2d added mass in heave direction at the trailing edge x t the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge g the acceleration of the gravity ρ the density of the water the volume of the cylinder it should be noted that the motion in 1 3 are stated in the body fixed coordinate system o x z the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge x t is introduced because the ends of the cylinder are not pointed the slender body theory assumes smoothly varying geometries but the abrupt end of the cylinder does not satisfy this condition an additional force component is included to consider this trailing edge effect for a long slender body as shown in curly brackets on the right side of 2 3 newman 1977 the rest terms are the inertial forces and the moments in addition the viscous forces and moment f d x f

component hoerner 1965 the morison equation is used in 5 and 6 and the unknown parameter u z x is the local relative velocity in the z axis direction between the cylinder and the water it may be represented as 7 u z x u 3 ω 2 x 0 5 l x 0 5 l substitute 7 into 5 6 we obtain 8 f d z 0 5 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l u 3 ω 2 x u 3 ω 2 x d x 9 m d y 0 5 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l x u 3 ω 2 x u 3 ω 2 x d x where d the diameter of the cylinder v the kinematic viscosity of the water l the length of the cylinder c d x the drag coefficient in the x direction c d z the drag coefficient in the z direction in the numerical simulation after solving u 1 u 3 and ω 2 at each time step the motion in the local coordinate system can be transformed to the motion in the global system by using the following relationship 10 x y cos β sin β sin β cos β u 1 u 3 where the initial value x 0 y 0 0 0 and β ω 2 because the axis y and the axis y are parallel and thus the rotation speed of the dropped cylinder around the axis y and the axis y coincide 2 2 the state space model the equations of the motion for dropped cylinder in two dimensions can be well formulated into a state based nonlinear dynamic

3 k the pitch ω 2 k and the angle β k at each time k 2 3 the state point prediction and unscented transformation in reality the state space model described in sec 2 2 can be generally summarized as 12 x k f k x k or the discretized state based model e g using euler method with small time instance d t which is the basic framework used in the nonlinear state prediction problem mendel and oppenheim 1995 13 x k 1 f k d x k x k d t f k x k due to the disturbance of the initial state x 0 the state x k can be viewed as a stochastic process the nonlinear state point prediction is forecasting the information about x k λ for some λ 0 at time k i e to obtain information about what x k λ will be like subsequent to the time k at which the information is produced in obtaining the information the state space model 13 and measurements up till time k can be used anderson and moore 1979 in the statistical point of view the information refers to the probability density function pdf or at least the statistics of interest e g the mean and covariance of the state x k at each time k the unscented transformation ut method which is first proposed by julier and uhlman julier and uhlmann 1997 and widely used for the parameter estimation and the state estimation e g der merwe and wan 2001 wan and merwe 2000 is a mathematical tool to solve the nonlinear point prediction problems the ut method addresses the problem by using a deterministic sampling approach and the statistics of the state are encoded by using a set of carefully chosen sample points these sample points which completely capture the prior mean and covariance of the state x k guarantee to capture the posterior mean and the posterior covariance of x k 1 accurately to the 3rd order when propagated through the nonlinear system f k d consider the following transformation 14 y h x the random variable y which is required to be estimated is related to the random variable x x p x through the nonlinear transformation h here x x p x denotes the random variable x with mean x and covariance p x the problem is to calculate a consistent estimate of y with mean y and covariance p y the approach of the ut fully utilizes the set of sigma points s which consists of 2 n x 1 predesigned vectors and their associated weights to estimating the mean y and covariance p y of y the set of sigma points s is supposed to constructed in a way that it captures the information e g the mean and covariance of the input random variable x julier et al 2000 one way of constructing the set of sigma points s is in the following 15 x 0 x w 0 w 0 x i x n x 1 w 0 p x i w i 1 w 0 2 n x x i n x x n x 1 w 0 p x i w i n x 1 w 0 2 n x where n x is the dimension of the random variable x w 0 the weight on the mean points is a tuning parameter and the operator is the cholesky decomposition and i denotes the i th column of the decomposed matrix i 1 2 n x the estimate of y y p y is as follows 16 y j h x j y j 0 2 n x 1 w j y j p y j 0 2 n x 1 w j y j y y j y alternative ways of constructing the set of the sigma points s are summarized in menegaz et al 2015 furthermore other numerical integration methods that are akin to ut method can be found in ito and xiong 2000 and meng et al 2018 2 4 the interval estimation the problem of the point estimation is to find a point to estimate the unknown parameters of interest however in many cases it seems to be desirable that a point estimate should be accompanied by some interval about the point estimate together with some measure of assurance that the true value of the parameter lies within the interval instead of estimating the true value to be a point we might make the inference of estimating that the true value of the parameter is contained in some interval that is the interval estimation mood et al 1974 in practice estimates are often given in the form of the estimate plused or minused by a certain amount for a gaussian density the estimate x is approximated by a gaussian random variable with given the first two moments that is x n x σ and the interval estimate is 17 p x σ z 1 α 2 x x σ z 1 α 2 α α 0 1 which means the probability that the random interval x σ z 1 α 2 x σ z 1 α 2 which is called confidence interval covers the unknown true estimate x is 100 α and α is called the confidence coefficient for state estimation problems the unscented transformation described in sec 2 3 is applied to estimation the state x k x k p k under the gaussian assumption that the state x k n x k p k the confidence interval of each elements of the state x k is 18 x ˆ i k p i i k z 1 α 2 x ˆ i k p i i k z 1 α 2 where x i k and p i i k denote the i th element of the state x k and the i th diagonal element of the error covariance p k respectively and z 1 α 2 is obtained by the two tail table of gaussian distribution once α is determined in our simulation the exact value of x i k and p i i k i 1 2 3 4 at each time step k can be obtained by ut method substitute the values in 18 and then the coordinate transformation 10 can be applied to calculate the envelope of the trajectory prediction 2 5 ideal truth and practical truth when people simulate the trajectory of the dropped cylinder usually two different types of the true trajectories are often encountered i e the ideal truth and the practical truth the ideal truth is generated by 1 3 with knowing the exact initial state without any error of the dropping cylinder so the trajectory under such condition is a deterministic process rather than a stochastic one however in practice we are unable to know the exact initial state but a range that covers the exact initial state under such situations the initial state is modeled as a random variable with some known distribution and naturally the primary choice of the distribution is the gaussian distribution of which the mean is the most likely initial state we believe and the covariance is the error from the disturbance respectively note that the ut method provides a suboptimal way to predict the practical truth which has been widely used in electrical engineering wan and merwe 2000 in this paper we simulate both the ideal truth and the practical truth at each scenario and compare our predicted trajectory with both truths to help people understand the difference directly for instance under the scenario of the drop angle 45 the initial state of ideal truth is x 0 it 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s π 4 rad and the initial state of practical truth is one realization of the following gaussian distribution x 0 pt n x 0 p 0 where x 0 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s π 4 rad p 0 diag 10 4 m 2 s 2 10 4 m 2 s 2 π 90 2 rad 2 s 2 π 90 2 rad 2 the propagation of two differernt initial states is goverened by the dynamic model 11 this can result in the trajectories of ideal truth and practical truth respectively 3 case study 3 1 properties of dropped cylinders the properties of dropped cylinders are given in table 1 they were freely dropped from the calm water surface in the experimental tests aanesland 1987 in the numerical analysis they are also assumed to fall into water freely more details about the experimental tests can be found in aanesland 1987 3 2 two performance parameters and the results for drop angle 45 the state space model of dropped cylinders was successfully constructed in sec 2 2 as stated before the whole state process is stochastic and the model provides us a convenient way to consider the effects of the disturbance the ut method is a statistical tool to predict the trajectory based on the model to begin with consider the drop angle 45 in fig 2 the black the red and the green solid line represent the ideal truth the practical truth and the predicted trajectory from the ut method respectively the green dash line and the dash dot line represent the upper limit ul and the lower limit ll from the ut method respectively the blue dash line and the dash dot line represent the upper limit ul and the lower limit ll from experimental tests respectively the case shown in fig 2 corresponds to α 0 5 with the drop angle 45 similar figures can be obtained corresponding to different α s please refer to the appendix for other figures in which α is from 0 1 to 0 9 with increment 0 1 overall the predicted trajectory by ut method green line is very close to both the ideal truth black line and practical truth red line in fig 3 the shadow area in color cyan is the overlap area a o l p between the predicted drop range from ut method and the one from the experimental envelope and the area covered by experimental envelope can be defined as a e e here a new performance parameter which is the ratio between overlap area a o l p and the area of experimental envelope a e e is proposed as following 19 r a a o l p a e e it can be used to measure the quality of numerical results compared with the experimental data usually when r a is greater than 0 5 it is considered that the area of coincidence is large and the probability of occurrence is also large further the other performance parameter which is the ratio between the overlap length l o l p and the experimental envelope l e e at the bottom can be proposed in a similar way 20 r l l o l p l e e it also indicates the accuracy of predicted length on the bottom if compared with the possible range from experimental tests for the case with drop angle 45 the calculated r a and r l have been summarized in table 2 corresponding to various confidence coefficient α as shown in this table both r a and r l monotonically increase w r t the confidence coefficient the first occurrence for r a greater than 0 5 corresponds to α 0 5 the calculated r a and r l are 0 51 and 0 23 respectively this means that about 58 of the estimated area overlaps with the measured area and the confidence level is at least 50 these results can fully provide the confidence for the engineers or on site operators that we can start searching for the falling cylinders from the touch point derived from ut estimate in addition the other parameter r l may provide some reference information about the coincidence of the calculated length and the measured length on the bottom consider that this is a two dimensional problem in reality it may give the remote operated vehicles rovs command to search for the target whether to start from the left or right various cases considering different confidence coefficients α from 0 1 to 0 9 with increment 0 1 have been carried out and analyzed the ratios are all summaried in table 2 3 3 trajectory prediction with the drop angle 30 and 60 the numerical results are compared with the experimental envelope for the drop angle 30 as shown in the 4th column and the 5th column of table 2 similarly both r a and r l monotonically increase with the increase of the confidence coefficient the first occurrence for r a greater than 0 5 corresponds to α 0 5 the calculated r a and r l are 0 58 and 0 65 respectively this means that about 58 of the estimated area overlaps with the measured area and the confidence level is 60 the trajectory prediction using the ut method corresponding to the confidence coefficient α 0 5 has been shown in fig 4 consequently the overlap is shown in fig 5 for the case with the drop angle 60 both r a and r l monotonically increase with the increase of the confidence coefficient α as indicated by the data in 6th column and 7th column of table 2 the first occurrence for r a greater than 0 5 corresponds to α 0 7 the calculated r a and r l are 0 58 and 0 51 respectively this means that about 58 of the estimated area overlaps with the measured area and the confidence level is 70 the trajectory prediction using the ut method corresponding to confidence coefficient α 0 7 has been shown in fig 6 consequently the overlap is shown in fig 7 3 4 measures of performance evaluation the state based model and the prediction algorithm for parameter signal and state estimation are widely used in science and engineering no matter how solid such a model or algorithm is in theory its performance and characteristics must be evaluated in practice to serve a number of purposes such as verification of its validity demonstration of its performance and comparison with other algorithms as stated before two performance parameters r a and r l have been proposed to evaluate the validity of the model in 1 3 and also the algorithm of the prediction method r a listed in table 2 can be further plotted in fig 8 the curves of r a vs α for all the three drop angles seem roughly linear overall a greater confidence level α always results a larger performance ratio r a this indicates that the estimated area from ut method can always cover the experimental envelope further r l in table 2 can be also plotted in fig 9 the curves of r l vs α show more obvious nonlinearity than the curves r a vs α in fact the ratio r l only conveys the information at the last moment which is different from r a it seems that the locations of drop point at the bottom may be more isolated uncertain or even random therefore the performance ratio r a may be more valuable however r l can still be used as an auxiliary parameter with a certain reference value in addition mse p the mean squared error mse between ut and the practical truth and mse i the mse between ut and the ideal truth can be easily calculated given each drop angle that is 21 mse p 1 n i 0 n x ut z ut i x pt z pt i x ut z ut i x pt z pt i 22 mse i 1 n i 0 n x ut z ut i x it z it i x ut z ut i x it z it i where x ut z ut i x pt z pt i and x it z it i are the position of ut prediction the practical truth and the ideal truth in the global system 10 at time step i respectively and n is the total time steps note that the two diagonal terms of mse p and mse i as shown in 21 and 22 represent the mse of position along x axis and z axis respectively and they are summarized in table 3 it should be addressed that the ut method provides a sub optimized solution statistically this indicates that the mse p should be small as shown by it values in 3 further a smaller value of mse i means that the ut method also provides a precise solution approaching more closely to the ideal truth 4 conclusions in this paper the state space model has been successfully constructed to investigate the stochastic behavior of the cylinders falling into water in two dimensions in fact such stochastic process has been observed in numerous experimental tests based on the state space model the random disturbance at the initial state can be easily added and studied in addition the ut method is utilized to statistically predict its trajectory corresponding to different drop angles the mean position of calculated trajectory has been compared with the idea truth and the practical truth and they reach agreement very well then the interval estimate based on ut can be compared with the experimental envelope two performance ratios r a and r l have been first proposed in this paper to meet the requirement from the offshore engineering industry both ratios can be used to evaluate the accuracy of numerical predictions by comparing them with the experimental results they both could be directly adopted by industry to the salvage and recover the dropped objects in operations therefore they can be a reasonable criteria which can be accepted by both academia and industry based on the research results obtained in this paper the trajectory prediction corresponding to the confidence coefficient α equal or greater than 0 7 should be considered to be reliable and applicable future work may focus on investigating the stochastic behavior in three dimensions by extending the research work mentioned in this paper appendix fig 10 trajectory prediction with the

required to measure moreover the fluid domain is presumed compressible inviscid and irrotational in order to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the presented method two completely and partially fluid filled tanks with different cases of damages are analyzed it is shown that the proposed strategy is capable of identifying the location and severity of damages with high accuracies

system 1 introduction damage detection has considerably been an interesting field in civil engineering in the last two decades due to avoiding the damage propagation in existing structures the importance of this field originates from the reality that most structures are subjected to inevitable and undesirable damages owing to various environmental forces on this basis different methods have been presented to identify the site and severity of damages in various structures including skeletal and plate like ones it is worth mentioning that the vast majority of proposed techniques are related to structures in contact with air on the other hand fluid structure systems have been widely employed in major industries and many fields of engineering which are exposed to unpredictable loads arch dams gravity dams and storage tanks can be remarked as the most well known kinds of these systems as far as tanks are concerned they have been applied to store water and different liquid in the gas and oil industry in this regard health monitoring and damage detection of storage tanks could be a necessary field to study with regard to some reported damages in some literature rammerstorfer et al 1990 ghaemmaghami and kianoush 2010 one of the most efficient damage identification techniques is to take advantage of model updating approach in order to derive a set of damage detection equations model updating strategies modify the physical characteristics of a finite element model of a system so that the difference between the finite element model and the real structure would minimize during this process unknown structural parameters are determined mottershead et al 2011 moreover model updating techniques based on sensitivity analysis are categorized to successful ones in which the relation between modal parameters and physical properties is examined jang and smyth 2017 in this regard some researches have been conducted to identify unknown parameters in structures jaishi and ren 2006 proposed a damage detection method by minimizing modal flexibility residual regarding model updating method li et al 2013 employed modal strain energy and distinct eigenvalues to introduce a useful sensitivity formulation entezami et al 2017 presented an improved sensitivity function with regard to modal strain energy in which the sensitivity matrix was extracted by lagrange multipliers method an innovative sensitivity based model updating strategy utilizing incomplete modal data was introduced by esfandiari 2017 then esfandiari and vahedi 2018 applied changes in modal data to compute the sensitivity matrix vibration measurements have been extensively used to form sensitivity equations recently parloo et al 2003 koh and dyke 2007 yin et al 2007 moaveni et al 2009 it is important to mention that measurement of entire modal parameters is difficult and impossible due to economic and practical matters especially rotational degrees of freedom dofs li et al 2008 consequently the dofs of a system can be divided into measured master and unmeasured slave ones entezami et al 2017 on the other hand in existent formulations for damage detection problems complete mode shapes are required to obtain highly accurate results chen 2008 to address this issue some strategies have been expressed including the modal expansion approach and the model reduction concept li et al 2008 the most popular methods are static condensation guyan 1965 and system equivalent reduction expansion process serep method o callahan 1989 in which a transformation matrix is used to relate slave dofs to master ones in the present work the serep transformation matrix is utilized in an adaptive way to compute complete mode shapes with respect to incomplete ones it means that the transformation matrix will be updated in each iteration according to model responses in the next section of the literature review of this paper we review the dynamic behavior and free vibration of fluid structure systems generally dynamic analysis of fluid structure systems can be performed in both time and frequency domains the analysis in frequency domain can be accomplished either by direct methods or modal technique in which the corresponding coupled asymmetric eigenvalue problem is needed to solve there are two kinds of methods in order to solve the coupled eigenvalue problems aftabi sani and lotfi 2007 1 basic methods that tend to compute modal data considering the coupled non symmetric eigenvalue problem morand and ohayon 1979 olson and bathe 1985 and 2 some approaches have been conducted to switch the coupled problem to decoupled one on this basis a method based on decoupled mode shapes is proposed by lotfi 2005 then aftabi sani and lotfi 2010 introduced the ideal coupled modal analysis to solve the mentioned eigenvalue problem the method was more accurate than the decoupled one furthermore quadratic ideal coupled approach to compute an approximation of frequencies of concrete dams is developed by rezaiee pajand et al 2018 the result of the quadratic ideal coupled method is more reliable than the former ones from geometrical point of view storage tanks can be categorized as several types such as cylindrical rectangular and spherical tanks the analysis of these kinds of systems has been studied by some researchers the free vibration of horizontal cylindrical tanks is discussed by kashani and aftabi sani 2016 regarding polar finite element technique kim et al 1996 suggested an analytic solution method in order to assess the dynamic response of a rectangular fluid container with respect to fluid structure interaction amabili et al 1998 studied the dynamics of a flexible cylindrical tank considering the influence of free surface waves some research has been carried out by chen and kianoush 2005 2006 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the responses of tanks with flexible walls they surveyed the effect of wall flexibility on hydrodynamic pressures of concrete tanks moreover the effect of tank parameters on seismic behavior was discussed including the height and width of the tank s walls besides deploying added mass and sequential concepts the dynamic response of concrete rectangular tank subjected to vertical ground acceleration was investigated by them ghaemmaghami and kianoush 2010 took advantage of finite element method to evaluate the seismic behavior of liquid tanks considering wall flexibility and fluid damping characteristics rezaiee pajand et al 2016 propounded an analytical formulation to solve the eigenvalue problem of two dimensional tanks the fluid domain was considered compressible inviscid and irrotational and the walls were modeled as flexible beams implementation of finite element method was accomplished by the classical two node eular bernoulli beam element consisting of four dofs for the structural part and four sided elements for the fluid domain in another work menaa and lakis 2015 applied a hybrid finite element method to analyze the free vibration of spherical fluid filled shells there have been some researches in which damage identification of structures in contact with water was investigated li et al 2008 pérez et al 2017 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 it is worthwhile to mention that in these studies the effects of the liquid on the presented formulation are not considered in another study zhou et al 2010 proposed a damage detection algorithm in which the effect of the fluid was not considered consequently the system was presumed a single linear dynamic system whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors could be computed by the standard eigenvalue problem that is to say the governing equations were attained with respect to a questionable assumption that presumed the system to be in contact with air it is obvious considering the fluid structure interaction could have a considerable influence on the damage detection process for instance a simple and decoupled eigenvalue problem will become asymmetric and coupled by applying the effects of fluid consequently the fluid structure interaction should be included as an important factor to derive the damage detection equations as well as according to authors knowledge the damage detection of structures in contact with fluid considering rigorous fluid structure interaction has not been studied as a result it seems valuable to develop efficient methods for damage detection of these kinds of systems with respect to fluid structure interaction it means the fluid parameters should be thoroughly included in the new formulation in the present paper for the first time a new method is expressed for damage identification of fluid structure systems based on model updating approach in section 3 the formulation is directly extracted from the coupled eigenvalue problem with respect to the fluid structure interaction moreover the incomplete structural modal data of the first mode are deployed to form the sensitivity equations without the requirement to fluid s part of mode shapes then an adaptive serep transformation matrix is used to calculate the slave dofs with regard to master dofs in section 5 two completely full and partially fluid filled tanks are employed to indicate the accuracy and performance of the presented strategy in addition the effect of water level on the damage detection process is investigated by considering two water levels and different damage scenarios including wetted and dry structural elements 2 fluid structure system in this section the dynamics and free vibration of the fluid structure systems are briefly reviewed at first the governing equations are discussed in both time and frequency domain afterwards in the second section the coupled eigenvalue problem of these systems is explained 2 1 governing equations in fluid structure interaction traditionally the coupled equations of the fluid structure system can be formed by finite element method as follows aftabi sani and lotfi 2007 1 m 0 b g r p c 0 0 l r p k b t 0 h r p m j a g b j a g where stiffness damping and mass matrices related to the structural part are denoted by k ℜ n s n s c ℜ n s n s and m ℜ n s n s respectively n s is the number of structural degrees of freedom moreover h ℜ n f n f l ℜ n f n f and g ℜ n f n f represent the pseudo stiffness pseudo damping and pseudo mass matrices of the fluid domain furthermore n f is the number of fluid s degrees of freedom the unknown vectors are shown by r and p which are referred to the vectors of nodal displacements and nodal pressures respectively furthermore j ℜ 3 3 is an identity matrix in which its columns are associated with a unit rigid body motion in cross canyon up stream and vertical directions in addition the interaction matrix is defined by b ℜ n f n s and a g is the vector of ground accelerations considering a g a g ω e i ω t as harmonic ground accelerations with frequency ω in which displacements and pressures will be harmonic the eq 1 can be re expressed in the frequency domain as below aftabi sani and lotfi 2007 2 ω 2 m k 1 2 β d i b t ω 2 b ω 2 g i ω l h r p m j a g b j a g in this equation i denotes the imaginary unit it is worthwhile to mention that the hysteretic damping matrix is utilized such that 3 c 2 β d ω k in which β d refers to the constant hysteretic factor of the structural part of the system 2 2 free vibration analysis the coupled eigenvalue problem of the undamped system can be easily extracted from eq 2 by eliminating c l and a g with the subsequent appearance rezaiee pajand et al 2018 4 k b t 0 h ω 2 m 0 b g r p 0 0 it should be noticed that eq 4 is linear and asymmetric to solve the above set of equations some researches have been conducted to present efficient methods rather than standard eigenvalue solution approach in this paper one which tends to calculate mode shapes with regard to the coupled equation eq 4 is utilized moreover it is worth mentioning that mode shapes will be normalized with regard to euclidean norm for the sake of simplicity eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 k s y s ω 2 m s y s ϕ s y s 0 herein k s y s ℜ n s n f n s n f and m s y s ℜ n s n f n s n f are correspondingly the stiffness and mass matrices of the entire system with respect to the fluid structure interaction moreover ϕ s y s is the vector of nodal displacements and pressures and ω refers to frequency of fluid structure system 3 damage detection formulation in our work damage detection problem is viewed as a system of equations whose unknowns refer to the location and severity of damages in this section the set of equations of damage identification problem is established considering model updating method and the coupled eigenvalue problem of a fluid structure system damage detection strategies have been extensively proposed for structures in contact with air nevertheless in the fluid structure interaction systems the damage identification problem will encounter two problems 1 a complicated system owing to the coupled eq 4 and 2 requirement of nodal pressures in this work to tackle these problems a new formulation is presented according to eq 4 expanding eq 4 yields 6 k r b t p ω 2 m r 0 7 h p ω 2 b r ω 2 g p 0 using eq 7 p can be calculated as 8 p h ω 2 g 1 ω 2 b r by substituting eq 8 into eq 6 the result which eliminates the unknown vector of the fluid domain from the formulation is 9 k r b t h ω 2 g 1 ω 2 b r ω 2 m r 0 the above equation for the ith mode shape has the coming shape 10 k r i b t h ω i 2 g 1 ω i 2 b r i ω i 2 m r i 0 herein the ith mode shape of the structural part and eigenvalue of the fluid structure system are denoted by r i and ω i respectively it is assumed that damages disturb the stiffness parameters of structural elements consequently the stiffness matrix of the damaged structure will change moreover the mass matrix of the damaged structure is presumed the same as the healthy structure entezami et al 2017 jaishi and ren 2006 entezami et al 2017 in other words we modeled damages by a reduction in young s modulus e as a result there are no changes in the geometry of the system hence eq 10 for the damaged system is rewritten as 11 k d r i d b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b r i d ω i d 2 m r i d 0 throughout this paper the subscript d is used to demonstrate the characteristics of the damaged structure the stiffness matrix of the damaged structure the ith structural mode shape and the frequency of the ith mode related to the damaged fluid structure system are shown by k d r i d and ω i d respectively with help of the stiffness matrix of healthy structure k d can be expressed as follows 12 k d k j 1 n e α j k j e where k j e and α j are referred to the stiffness and the damage severity of jth structural element respectively furthermore n e is equal to the number of structural elements by substituting eq 12 into eq 11 the following relation will be obtained 13 k r i d j 1 n e α j k j e r i d b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b r i d ω i d 2 m r i d 0 rearranging eq 13 yields 14 j 1 n e α j k j e r i d b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b ω i d 2 m k r i d for the sake of simplicity a i is considered as 15 a i b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b ω i d 2 m k r i d note that by eliminating the effect of fluid structure interaction matrix a i will change with the following form 16 a i ω i d 2 m k r i d deploying eq 16 in the damage detection process rather than eq 15 leads to a structure only problem substituting eq 15 into eq 14 and rearranging it one can obtain 17 r i d a i 1 j 1 n e α j k j e r i d expanding the above relation for all elements of the structure yields 18 r i d a i 1 α 1 k 1 e r i d a i 1 α 2 k 2 e r i d a i 1 α n e k n e e r i d the matrix form of eq 18 is written in eq 19 19 r i d a i 1 k 1 e r i d a i 1 k 2 e r i d a i 1 k n e e r i d α 1 α 2 α n e assuming that m structural mode shapes of the damaged fluid structure system are measured i 1 2 m the eq 19 can be shown as 20 r 1 d r 2 d r m d a 1 1 k 1 e r 1 d a 1 1 k 2 e r 1 d a 1 1 k n e e r 1 d a 2 1 k 1 e r i d a 2 1 k 2 e r 2 d a 2 1 k n e e r 2 d a m 1 k 1 e r m d a m 1 k 2 e r m d a m 1 k n e e r m d α 1 α 2 α n e in practice measurement of a complete structural mode shape is difficult especially in rotational dofs li et al 2008 in this regard the degrees of freedom are divided into measured master dofs and unmeasured slave dofs 21 r i d r i d m r i d s where r i d m and r i d s are referred to master and slave dofs respectively it is worthwhile to mention that the calculation of the coefficient matrix in the right side of eq 20 requires complete structural mode shapes to surmount this obstacle in the damage detection process a reasonable approximation can be utilized as an alternative to the exact one some researches have been carried out to introduce a transformation matrix between master and slave dofs li et al 2008 guyan 1965 o callahan 1989 the two well known ones are guyan and serep transformation matrix in the present paper the latter one is utilized to calculate a complete structural mode shape to defeat the numerical errors due to the aforesaid approximation the model updating method is employed consequently the analytical model will be updated until the solution converges now the right side of eq 20 for each iteration during the model updating process is calculable the vector in the left side of eq 20 can be reduced with respect to slave dofs in other words the rows of eq 20 associated with slave dofs are omitted from both sides of the equation eventually the proposed formulation for damage identification of a fluid structure system can be expressed as follows 22 r 1 d m r i d m r m d m s 1 s i s m α 1 α 2 α n e herein r i d m is the master part of the ith structural mode shape s i is referred to the sensitivity matrix considering the ith structural mode shape whose jth column has the subsequent shape 23 s i j a i 1 k j e r i in which r i is the approximate structural mode shape of the fluid structure system the method of computing r i is discussed in the next section 4 serep transformation matrix serep method links the slave part of an eigenvector to its master one utilizing a transformation matrix o callahan 1989 it means 24 r m r s t s e r e p r m where t s e r e p is the transformation matrix the transformation matrix of this method is written as 25 t s e r e p r m r s r m t r m 1 r m t as can be seen from eq 25 the slave dofs are requisite to calculate matrix t s e r e p hence matrix t s e r e p can be computed for the model of the healthy structure with complete mode shape not for the damaged one now for the first iteration of the damage detection process matrix t d s e r e p the transformation matrix of the damaged structure will be considered identical to matrix t s e r e p which is computed from the data of the healthy structure in the next iterations matrix t s e r e p will be recalculated based on the updated model with these definitions the approximation of r can be expressed as 26 r r m r s t d s e r e p r m in which r m and r s are the approximations of r m and r s respectively to summarize the formulation of damage detection was presented using the coupled eigenvalue problem in fluid structure systems the nodal pressures were replaced by eq 8 so that it was not needed to measure them moreover the damage detection process was implemented by the construction of eq 22 and computing the unknown vector in each iteration afterwards the system s model would be updated and a new transformation matrix would be calculated this process would be carried on until the convergence is achieved 5 numerical study in order to assess the accuracy and performance of the presented strategy for damage identification of the fluid structure interaction system a flexible two dimensional 2d tank is analyzed as shown in fig 1 this numerical example has been thoroughly investigated in the reference rezaiee pajand et al 2016 the finite element method is employed to analyze this tank and set the system of damage detection equations eq 22 5 1 finite element method the finite element model of the aforesaid two dimensional tank consists of two parts the structural part of the system and the fluid domain to discretize the structural section the classical 2 node eular bernoulli beam element is utilized consequently the stiffness and mass matrices of each structural element can be written as follows 27 k e 2 e i l e 3 6 3 l e 6 3 l e 3 l e 2 l e 2 3 l e l e 2 6 3 l e 6 3 l e 3 l e l e 2 3 l e 2 l e 2 28 m e ρ a l e 420 156 22 l e 54 13 l e 22 l e 4 l e 2 13 l e 3 l e 2 54 13 l e 156 22 l e 13 l e 3 l e 2 22 l e 4 l e 2 in these equations the length cross section area mass density young s modulus and the second moment of area for each element are shown by l e a ρ e and i respectively in this paper the fluid is considered to be compressible inviscid and irrotational and there are no surface waves in the fluid domain the fluid is modeled by four sided elements fig 2 which their generalized characteristic matrices have the following appearance 29 h e a 2 b 2 3 a b a 6 b b 3 a a 2 b 2 6 a b a 3 b b 6 a a 6 b b 3 a a 2 b 2 3 a b a 3 b b 6 a a 2 b 2 6 a b a 2 b 2 6 a b a 3 b b 6 a a 2 b 2 3 a b a 6 b b 3 a a 3 b b 6 a a 2 b 2 6 a b a 6 b b 3 a a 2 b 2

sound respectively lastly the interaction matrix of the system considering the same length for structural and fluid elements can be expressed as 31 b e 0 0 0 0 7 l e 20 l e 2 20 3 l e 20 l e 2 30 3 l e 20 l e 2 30 7 l e 20 l e 2 20 0 0 0 0 5 2 verification of the presented method in this section the validity of the proposed method is verified by comparing the damage detection results of the presented method with reference jaishi and ren 2006 they identified the severity and location of damages in a simply supported concrete beam shown in fig 3 the physical properties in this beam including young s modulus and density are 3 2 104 mpa and 2500 kg m3 moreover the length cross section area and second moment of area of the beam are identical to 6 m 0 05 m2 and 1 66 10 4 m4 respectively 15 beam elements were utilized to construct the finite element model the damaged beam was modeled by decreasing in young s modulus of elements 3 8 and 10 we used the classical 2 node eular bernoulli beam to model the beam the first three natural frequencies of the damaged and undamaged beam are compared with reference jaishi and ren 2006 in table 1 findings reveal the correctness of the finite element model employed in the present paper the results for damage detection of the beam are shown in fig 4 it is worthwhile to mention that the first ten modes were utilized to implement the damage detection process in reference jaishi and ren 2006 whereas in the present paper the modal data of the first mode are employed the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method are proven with respect to the results depicted in fig 4 5 3 damage detection of the tank to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method a flexible 2d tank is deployed which is extensively discussed in the reference rezaiee pajand et al 2016 to construct the finite element model they used classical 2 node eular bernoulli beam elements for the structural part and four sided elements for the fluid domain the density and young s modulus of the concrete walls are 2400 kg m3 and 2 1 104 mpa respectively the height and thickness of the walls are assumed 10 m and 1 m respectively moreover the width of the tank is 20 m it is presumed that the tank is filled by water with the density 1000 kg m3 the constant speed of sound in water is considered 1440 m s the convergence test is carried out in order to examine the correctness of the finite element model and identify the minimum number of elements it can be concluded from fig 5 that employing over 10 elements leads to highly precise results in the first three natural frequencies of the tank two various fluid levels are utilized to assess the influence of the rigorous fluid structure interaction on damage detection problem nevertheless at first damage detection of the empty tank is conducted to examine the correctness of the proposed method it is worthwhile to mention that to measure modal responses of damaged systems the finite element model is employed to simulate the experimental data li et al 2008 esfandiari and vahedi 2018 entezami et al 2017 in fact in the absence of experimental studies a reliable finite element method can be a proper alternative in practice measurement of all modal data is impossible especially in rotational dofs li et al 2008 besides it is valuable to decrease the number of sensors due to economic and practical problems because of these reasons in this work the structural data in translational dofs of the first mode shape and its related frequency are used to execute the damage detection process 5 3 1 empty tank in this case the tank can be considered as a structure in contact with air as shown in fig 6 consequently executing the damage detection process is carried out using eqs 16 and 22 a damaged finite element model of the tank is constructed using 30 classical eular bernoulli elements including five damaged elements r 2 r 11 r 15 l 4 and l 13 the amount of damages in these elements is assumed to be equal to 10 reduction in the stiffness of the elements the first mode shape of the empty damaged and undamaged tanks are depicted in fig 7 it is obvious that the changes in the nodal displacement are not considerable as well as to provide a better comparison the numerical outcomes for translational degrees of freedom are shown in fig 7 herein the important issue is whether the proposed method is sensitive enough to these small changes in what follows the answer to this question is given the results of damage detection for the empty tank are shown and compared with the actual damages in fig 8 from this figure it can be concluded that the proposed method is able to identify the location and extent of damages with high precision while the changes in numerical results of the damaged structure compared to the undamaged structure are low with regard to fig 7 as a result the sensitivity of the method to the modal data s changes is proven 5 3 2 completely fluid filled tank to implement the finite element model of the completely full tank 30 beam elements are used to model the structural part see fig 9 elements r 1 to r 15 are deployed to discretize the right wall as well as elements l 1 to l 15 for the left wall furthermore the water domain is modeled by 15 30 four sided meshes in this case to verify the results of the finite element method the natural frequencies of the first three modes are compared with those of others in table 2 it is clear from the comparison of the results of the empty and fully filled tank that considering the fluid structure interaction has had a considerable influence on the frequencies of the tank the frequencies of the completely filled system are significantly lower than the empty one therefore this difference must be included in the formulation of damage detection by reduction in e for target elements three scenarios of damages sf 1 to sf 3 are modeled to gain the simulated responses of the damage system as presented in table 3 different kinds of damages are considered to display the sensitivity of the proposed formulation to various damages several separate damages in the right wall a reduction of stiffness in throughout the right wall and some separate damages in both left and right walls are considered as the three scenarios sf 1 sf 2 and sf 3 respectively at first the changes in the first mode shapes of the damaged systems for scenarios sf 1 sf 2 and sf 3 are investigated in fig 10 the outstanding point is the remarkable changes in the mode shapes of the damaged systems compared with the undamaged ones which are indicated in fig 10 a c especially for scenarios sf 1 and sf 2 it is clear that imposing the effect of fluid structure interaction on damage detection formulation has two advantages 1 the results of damage detection process would be more reliable since the modeling errors decrease and there are fewer discrepancies between the finite element model and real system and 2 the modal data would provide more local information about location and severity of damages the results of damage detection for the fully filled tank are compared with the actual damages in the simulated damaged models in figs 11 13 as can be seen from these figures the location and severity of the damages are obtained with high accuracy for scenario sf 1 fig 11 all of the damages are in the right wall as a result the dispersion of damage places is not required to reach the precise outcomes a throughout damage in the right wall with the amount of 10 is considered to exist in scenario sf 2 fig 12 shows that the satisfactory results are attained from damage localization and quantification of the fully filled tank for scenario sf 2 it means that a large number of damages do not cause a destructive effect on damage detection process utilizing the proposed method moreover it is worth noting that the estimated and the actual damages are almost identical for scenario sf 3 as illustrated in fig 13 for a better comparative process and to display the errors of the presented method compared to actual data the findings of damage detection are tabulated in table 4 from this table one can realize that the errors the differences between the severities of exact and estimated damages are overwhelmingly low and could be acceptable for instance the highest error in the scenarios of the fully filled tanks is 0 0028 stiffness reduction in element l 15 to evaluate the convergence of the damage detection process a convergence criterion must be defined for this purpose the response of each iteration is compared with its former one as follows 32 e x i x i 1 2 herein x i and x i 1 are the damage vectors of the ith and i 1 th iterations of the damage detection process respectively furthermore 2 applies to the second norm the convergence path of damage detection problem is demonstrated in fig 14 it can be clearly seen from fig 14 that for the three scenarios sf 1 to sf 3 the damage identification process converges really fast and smoothly 5 3 3 partially fluid filled tank in this section to assess the influence of the water level on the damage detection process the tank is assumed to be half filled 14 28 meshes are used to model the fluid domain fig 15 note that the sloshing effect is not considered in this work three cases of damages are considered for the partially filled tank using both wetted and dry elements presented in table 5 in scenario sp 1 some dry elements in both left and right walls are assumed to be damaged a single damage is induced in wetted element l 7 for scenario sp 2 furthermore scenario sp 3 consists of both dry and wetted elements in the right and left walls the results of damage detection problem for the partially filled tank are summarized and compared with the actual damages in figs 16 18 the observations in these figures reveal that the accuracy of the results is high nevertheless compared to the completely full tank s results the precision is rather lower especially for scenarios sp 2 and sp 3 see figs 17 and 18 this occurrence may be related to matrix b and eq 8 as a matter of fact matrix b is the interaction matrix between the structural part and the fluid domain of the system with decline in the level of liquid the number of zero arrays in this matrix will increase and the fluid structure interaction will disappear in the dry part of the system therefore the connection between nodal displacements and nodal pressures in eq 8 will eliminate in these parts this phenomenon could be the most important reason for slightly numerical errors mentioned earlier fig 16 shows the high accuracy in the results of detecting damages for scenario sp 1 one wetted element is considered to be damaged in scenario sp 2 the findings of this scenario depicted in fig 17 indicate that the errors are acceptable the results of scenario sp 3 which embodies both dry and wetted elements are shown in fig 18 as can be seen the maximum error occurs in r 14 and this element is wrongly estimated as a damaged element with 0 023 severity see table 6 the convergence diagrams of the three cases for the half filled tank are demonstrated in fig 19 the findings prove that the damage detection process converges for all cases comparing to the results of the completely full tank the outcomes of the partially filled tank converges less fast and smoothly especially for sp 3 the convergence diagrams for scenarios sf 2 and sp 3 are compared in fig 20 as this figure reveals the convergence is achieved in 8 and 14 iterations for sf 2 and sp 3 respectively therefore it can be concluded that the high level of water accelerates the process of damage detection 6 conclusions this paper has been devoted to proposing a new damage detection method for the fluid structure interaction systems using model updating strategy the coupled eigenvalue problem is employed to consider the interaction effect in the damage identification furthermore an incomplete modal data of the first mode is applied along with the serep method in order to derive the damage detection equations structural part of mode shape is just utilized it means the measurement of nodal pressures of the damaged system is not required damages are modeled as a reduction in the stiffness of the walls consequently the stiffness matrix will change and the mass matrix will remain constant a two dimensional storage tank is investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the presented method to evaluate the influence of the fluid level two completely and partially full tanks are modeled by comparison the modal results of undamaged and damaged models it was shown that not only can considering the fluid structure interaction increase the accuracy of the finite element model but also the modal data provide valuable information about damages the findings prove that the proposed method is capable of damage localization and quantification with high precision in addition the results of several cases show that the author s approach has a satisfactory sensitivity to different dispersion of damaged elements and is able to detect small damages such as a 5 reduction in stiffness as well as it is concluded that the decrease in the liquid level has no considerable influence on the outcomes of the damage detection process appendix the fluid s free vibration differential equation in frequency domain can be expressed as a1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 ω 2 c 2 p 0 eq a1 can be solved by weighted residual

system 1 introduction damage detection has considerably been an interesting field in civil engineering in the last two decades due to avoiding the damage propagation in existing structures the importance of this field originates from the reality that most structures are subjected to inevitable and undesirable damages owing to various environmental forces on this basis different methods have been presented to identify the site and severity of damages in various structures including skeletal and plate like ones it is worth mentioning that the vast majority of proposed techniques are related to structures in contact with air on the other hand fluid structure systems have been widely employed in major industries and many fields of engineering which are exposed to unpredictable loads arch dams gravity dams and storage tanks can be remarked as the most well known kinds of these systems as far as tanks are concerned they have been applied to store water and different liquid in the gas and oil industry in this regard health monitoring and damage detection of storage tanks could be a necessary field to study with regard to some reported damages in some literature rammerstorfer et al 1990 ghaemmaghami and kianoush 2010 one of the most efficient damage identification techniques is to take advantage of model updating approach in order to derive a set of damage detection equations model updating strategies modify the physical characteristics of a finite element model of a system so that the difference between the finite element model and the real structure would minimize during this process unknown structural parameters are determined mottershead et al 2011 moreover model updating techniques based on sensitivity analysis are categorized to successful ones in which the relation between modal parameters and physical properties is examined jang and smyth 2017 in this regard some researches have been conducted to identify unknown parameters in structures jaishi and ren 2006 proposed a damage detection method by minimizing modal flexibility residual regarding model updating method li et al 2013 employed modal strain energy and distinct eigenvalues to introduce a useful sensitivity formulation entezami et al 2017 presented an improved sensitivity function with regard to modal strain energy in which the sensitivity matrix was extracted by lagrange multipliers method an innovative sensitivity based model updating strategy utilizing incomplete modal data was introduced by esfandiari 2017 then esfandiari and vahedi 2018 applied changes in modal data to compute the sensitivity matrix vibration measurements have been extensively used to form sensitivity equations recently parloo et al 2003 koh and dyke 2007 yin et al 2007 moaveni et al 2009 it is important to mention that measurement of entire modal parameters is difficult and impossible due to economic and practical matters especially rotational degrees of freedom dofs li et al 2008 consequently the dofs of a system can be divided into measured master and unmeasured slave ones entezami et al 2017 on the other hand in existent formulations for damage detection problems complete mode shapes are required to obtain highly accurate results chen 2008 to address this issue some strategies have been expressed including the modal expansion approach and the model reduction concept li et al 2008 the most popular methods are static condensation guyan 1965 and system equivalent reduction expansion process serep method o callahan 1989 in which a transformation matrix is used to relate slave dofs to master ones in the present work the serep transformation matrix is utilized in an adaptive way to compute complete mode shapes with respect to incomplete ones it means that the transformation matrix will be updated in each iteration according to model responses in the next section of the literature review of this paper we review the dynamic behavior and free vibration of fluid structure systems generally dynamic analysis of fluid structure systems can be performed in both time and frequency domains the analysis in frequency domain can be accomplished either by direct methods or modal technique in which the corresponding coupled asymmetric eigenvalue problem is needed to solve there are two kinds of methods in order to solve the coupled eigenvalue problems aftabi sani and lotfi 2007 1 basic methods that tend to compute modal data considering the coupled non symmetric eigenvalue problem morand and ohayon 1979 olson and bathe 1985 and 2 some approaches have been conducted to switch the coupled problem to decoupled one on this basis a method based on decoupled mode shapes is proposed by lotfi 2005 then aftabi sani and lotfi 2010 introduced the ideal coupled modal analysis to solve the mentioned eigenvalue problem the method was more accurate than the decoupled one furthermore quadratic ideal coupled approach to compute an approximation of frequencies of concrete dams is developed by rezaiee pajand et al 2018 the result of the quadratic ideal coupled method is more reliable than the former ones from geometrical point of view storage tanks can be categorized as several types such as cylindrical rectangular and spherical tanks the analysis of these kinds of systems has been studied by some researchers the free vibration of horizontal cylindrical tanks is discussed by kashani and aftabi sani 2016 regarding polar finite element technique kim et al 1996 suggested an analytic solution method in order to assess the dynamic response of a rectangular fluid container with respect to fluid structure interaction amabili et al 1998 studied the dynamics of a flexible cylindrical tank considering the influence of free surface waves some research has been carried out by chen and kianoush 2005 2006 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the responses of tanks with flexible walls they surveyed the effect of wall flexibility on hydrodynamic pressures of concrete tanks moreover the effect of tank parameters on seismic behavior was discussed including the height and width of the tank s walls besides deploying added mass and sequential concepts the dynamic response of concrete rectangular tank subjected to vertical ground acceleration was investigated by them ghaemmaghami and kianoush 2010 took advantage of finite element method to evaluate the seismic behavior of liquid tanks considering wall flexibility and fluid damping characteristics rezaiee pajand et al 2016 propounded an analytical formulation to solve the eigenvalue problem of two dimensional tanks the fluid domain was considered compressible inviscid and irrotational and the walls were modeled as flexible beams implementation of finite element method was accomplished by the classical two node eular bernoulli beam element consisting of four dofs for the structural part and four sided elements for the fluid domain in another work menaa and lakis 2015 applied a hybrid finite element method to analyze the free vibration of spherical fluid filled shells there have been some researches in which damage identification of structures in contact with water was investigated li et al 2008 pérez et al 2017 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 it is worthwhile to mention that in these studies the effects of the liquid on the presented formulation are not considered in another study zhou et al 2010 proposed a damage detection algorithm in which the effect of the fluid was not considered consequently the system was presumed a single linear dynamic system whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors could be computed by the standard eigenvalue problem that is to say the governing equations were attained with respect to a questionable assumption that presumed the system to be in contact with air it is obvious considering the fluid structure interaction could have a considerable influence on the damage detection process for instance a simple and decoupled eigenvalue problem will become asymmetric and coupled by applying the effects of fluid consequently the fluid structure interaction should be included as an important factor to derive the damage detection equations as well as according to authors knowledge the damage detection of structures in contact with fluid considering rigorous fluid structure interaction has not been studied as a result it seems valuable to develop efficient methods for damage detection of these kinds of systems with respect to fluid structure interaction it means the fluid parameters should be thoroughly included in the new formulation in the present paper for the first time a new method is expressed for damage identification of fluid structure systems based on model updating approach in section 3 the formulation is directly extracted from the coupled eigenvalue problem with respect to the fluid structure interaction moreover the incomplete structural modal data of the first mode are deployed to form the sensitivity equations without the requirement to fluid s part of mode shapes then an adaptive serep transformation matrix is used to calculate the slave dofs with regard to master dofs in section 5 two completely full and partially fluid filled tanks are employed to indicate the accuracy and performance of the presented strategy in addition the effect of water level on the damage detection process is investigated by considering two water levels and different damage scenarios including wetted and dry structural elements 2 fluid structure system in this section the dynamics and free vibration of the fluid structure systems are briefly reviewed at first the governing equations are discussed in both time and frequency domain afterwards in the second section the coupled eigenvalue problem of these systems is explained 2 1 governing equations in fluid structure interaction traditionally the coupled equations of the fluid structure system can be formed by finite element method as follows aftabi sani and lotfi 2007 1 m 0 b g r p c 0 0 l r p k b t 0 h r p m j a g b j a g where stiffness damping and mass matrices related to the structural part are denoted by k ℜ n s n s c ℜ n s n s and m ℜ n s n s respectively n s is the number of structural degrees of freedom moreover h ℜ n f n f l ℜ n f n f and g ℜ n f n f represent the pseudo stiffness pseudo damping and pseudo mass matrices of the fluid domain furthermore n f is the number of fluid s degrees of freedom the unknown vectors are shown by r and p which are referred to the vectors of nodal displacements and nodal pressures respectively furthermore j ℜ 3 3 is an identity matrix in which its columns are associated with a unit rigid body motion in cross canyon up stream and vertical directions in addition the interaction matrix is defined by b ℜ n f n s and a g is the vector of ground accelerations considering a g a g ω e i ω t as harmonic ground accelerations with frequency ω in which displacements and pressures will be harmonic the eq 1 can be re expressed in the frequency domain as below aftabi sani and lotfi 2007 2 ω 2 m k 1 2 β d i b t ω 2 b ω 2 g i ω l h r p m j a g b j a g in this equation i denotes the imaginary unit it is worthwhile to mention that the hysteretic damping matrix is utilized such that 3 c 2 β d ω k in which β d refers to the constant hysteretic factor of the structural part of the system 2 2 free vibration analysis the coupled eigenvalue problem of the undamped system can be easily extracted from eq 2 by eliminating c l and a g with the subsequent appearance rezaiee pajand et al 2018 4 k b t 0 h ω 2 m 0 b g r p 0 0 it should be noticed that eq 4 is linear and asymmetric to solve the above set of equations some researches have been conducted to present efficient methods rather than standard eigenvalue solution approach in this paper one which tends to calculate mode shapes with regard to the coupled equation eq 4 is utilized moreover it is worth mentioning that mode shapes will be normalized with regard to euclidean norm for the sake of simplicity eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 k s y s ω 2 m s y s ϕ s y s 0 herein k s y s ℜ n s n f n s n f and m s y s ℜ n s n f n s n f are correspondingly the stiffness and mass matrices of the entire system with respect to the fluid structure interaction moreover ϕ s y s is the vector of nodal displacements and pressures and ω refers to frequency of fluid structure system 3 damage detection formulation in our work damage detection problem is viewed as a system of equations whose unknowns refer to the location and severity of damages in this section the set of equations of damage identification problem is established considering model updating method and the coupled eigenvalue problem of a fluid structure system damage detection strategies have been extensively proposed for structures in contact with air nevertheless in the fluid structure interaction systems the damage identification problem will encounter two problems 1 a complicated system owing to the coupled eq 4 and 2 requirement of nodal pressures in this work to tackle these problems a new formulation is presented according to eq 4 expanding eq 4 yields 6 k r b t p ω 2 m r 0 7 h p ω 2 b r ω 2 g p 0 using eq 7 p can be calculated as 8 p h ω 2 g 1 ω 2 b r by substituting eq 8 into eq 6 the result which eliminates the unknown vector of the fluid domain from the formulation is 9 k r b t h ω 2 g 1 ω 2 b r ω 2 m r 0 the above equation for the ith mode shape has the coming shape 10 k r i b t h ω i 2 g 1 ω i 2 b r i ω i 2 m r i 0 herein the ith mode shape of the structural part and eigenvalue of the fluid structure system are denoted by r i and ω i respectively it is assumed that damages disturb the stiffness parameters of structural elements consequently the stiffness matrix of the damaged structure will change moreover the mass matrix of the damaged structure is presumed the same as the healthy structure entezami et al 2017 jaishi and ren 2006 entezami et al 2017 in other words we modeled damages by a reduction in young s modulus e as a result there are no changes in the geometry of the system hence eq 10 for the damaged system is rewritten as 11 k d r i d b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b r i d ω i d 2 m r i d 0 throughout this paper the subscript d is used to demonstrate the characteristics of the damaged structure the stiffness matrix of the damaged structure the ith structural mode shape and the frequency of the ith mode related to the damaged fluid structure system are shown by k d r i d and ω i d respectively with help of the stiffness matrix of healthy structure k d can be expressed as follows 12 k d k j 1 n e α j k j e where k j e and α j are referred to the stiffness and the damage severity of jth structural element respectively furthermore n e is equal to the number of structural elements by substituting eq 12 into eq 11 the following relation will be obtained 13 k r i d j 1 n e α j k j e r i d b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b r i d ω i d 2 m r i d 0 rearranging eq 13 yields 14 j 1 n e α j k j e r i d b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b ω i d 2 m k r i d for the sake of simplicity a i is considered as 15 a i b t h ω i d 2 g 1 ω i d 2 b ω i d 2 m k r i d note that by eliminating the effect of fluid structure interaction matrix a i will change with the following form 16 a i ω i d 2 m k r i d deploying eq 16 in the damage detection process rather than eq 15 leads to a structure only problem substituting eq 15 into eq 14 and rearranging it one can obtain 17 r i d a i 1 j 1 n e α j k j e r i d expanding the above relation for all elements of the structure yields 18 r i d a i 1 α 1 k 1 e r i d a i 1 α 2 k 2 e r i d a i 1 α n e k n e e r i d the matrix form of eq 18 is written in eq 19 19 r i d a i 1 k 1 e r i d a i 1 k 2 e r i d a i 1 k n e e r i d α 1 α 2 α n e assuming that m structural mode shapes of the damaged fluid structure system are measured i 1 2 m the eq 19 can be shown as 20 r 1 d r 2 d r m d a 1 1 k 1 e r 1 d a 1 1 k 2 e r 1 d a 1 1 k n e e r 1 d a 2 1 k 1 e r i d a 2 1 k 2 e r 2 d a 2 1 k n e e r 2 d a m 1 k 1 e r m d a m 1 k 2 e r m d a m 1 k n e e r m d α 1 α 2 α n e in practice measurement of a complete structural mode shape is difficult especially in rotational dofs li et al 2008 in this regard the degrees of freedom are divided into measured master dofs and unmeasured slave dofs 21 r i d r i d m r i d s where r i d m and r i d s are referred to master and slave dofs respectively it is worthwhile to mention that the calculation of the coefficient matrix in the right side of eq 20 requires complete structural mode shapes to surmount this obstacle in the damage detection process a reasonable approximation can be utilized as an alternative to the exact one some researches have been carried out to introduce a transformation matrix between master and slave dofs li et al 2008 guyan 1965 o callahan 1989 the two well known ones are guyan and serep transformation matrix in the present paper the latter one is utilized to calculate a complete structural mode shape to defeat the numerical errors due to the aforesaid approximation the model updating method is employed consequently the analytical model will be updated until the solution converges now the right side of eq 20 for each iteration during the model updating process is calculable the vector in the left side of eq 20 can be reduced with respect to slave dofs in other words the rows of eq 20 associated with slave dofs are omitted from both sides of the equation eventually the proposed formulation for damage identification of a fluid structure system can be expressed as follows 22 r 1 d m r i d m r m d m s 1 s i s m α 1 α 2 α n e herein r i d m is the master part of the ith structural mode shape s i is referred to the sensitivity matrix considering the ith structural mode shape whose jth column has the subsequent shape 23 s i j a i 1 k j e r i in which r i is the approximate structural mode shape of the fluid structure system the method of computing r i is discussed in the next section 4 serep transformation matrix serep method links the slave part of an eigenvector to its master one utilizing a transformation matrix o callahan 1989 it means 24 r m r s t s e r e p r m where t s e r e p is the transformation matrix the transformation matrix of this method is written as 25 t s e r e p r m r s r m t r m 1 r m t as can be seen from eq 25 the slave dofs are requisite to calculate matrix t s e r e p hence matrix t s e r e p can be computed for the model of the healthy structure with complete mode shape not for the damaged one now for the first iteration of the damage detection process matrix t d s e r e p the transformation matrix of the damaged structure will be considered identical to matrix t s e r e p which is computed from the data of the healthy structure in the next iterations matrix t s e r e p will be recalculated based on the updated model with these definitions the approximation of r can be expressed as 26 r r m r s t d s e r e p r m in which r m and r s are the approximations of r m and r s respectively to summarize the formulation of damage detection was presented using the coupled eigenvalue problem in fluid structure systems the nodal pressures were replaced by eq 8 so that it was not needed to measure them moreover the damage detection process was implemented by the construction of eq 22 and computing the unknown vector in each iteration afterwards the system s model would be updated and a new transformation matrix would be calculated this process would be carried on until the convergence is achieved 5 numerical study in order to assess the accuracy and performance of the presented strategy for damage identification of the fluid structure interaction system a flexible two dimensional 2d tank is analyzed as shown in fig 1 this numerical example has been thoroughly investigated in the reference rezaiee pajand et al 2016 the finite element method is employed to analyze this tank and set the system of damage detection equations eq 22 5 1 finite element method the finite element model of the aforesaid two dimensional tank consists of two parts the structural part of the system and the fluid domain to discretize the structural section the classical 2 node eular bernoulli beam element is utilized consequently the stiffness and mass matrices of each structural element can be written as follows 27 k e 2 e i l e 3 6 3 l e 6 3 l e 3 l e 2 l e 2 3 l e l e 2 6 3 l

area mass density young s modulus and the second moment of area for each element are shown by l e a ρ e and i respectively in this paper the fluid is considered to be compressible inviscid and irrotational and there are no surface waves in the fluid domain the fluid is modeled by four sided elements fig 2 which their generalized characteristic matrices have the following appearance 29 h e a

presented method with reference jaishi and ren 2006 they identified the severity and location of damages in a simply supported concrete beam shown in fig 3 the physical properties in this beam including young s modulus and density are 3 2 104 mpa and 2500 kg m3 moreover the length cross section area and second moment of area of the beam are identical to 6 m 0 05 m2 and 1 66 10 4 m4 respectively 15 beam elements were utilized to construct the finite element model the damaged beam was modeled by decreasing in young s modulus of elements 3 8 and 10 we used the classical 2 node eular bernoulli beam to model the beam the first three natural frequencies of the damaged and undamaged beam are compared with reference jaishi and ren 2006 in table 1 findings reveal the correctness of the finite element model employed in the present paper the results for damage detection of the beam are shown in fig 4 it is worthwhile to mention that the first ten modes were utilized to implement the damage detection process in reference jaishi and ren 2006 whereas in the present paper the modal data of the first mode are employed the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method are proven with respect to the results depicted in fig 4 5 3 damage detection of the tank to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method a flexible 2d tank is deployed which is extensively discussed in the reference rezaiee pajand et al 2016 to construct the finite element model they used classical 2 node eular bernoulli beam elements for the structural part and four sided elements for the fluid domain the density and young s modulus of the concrete walls are 2400 kg m3 and 2 1 104 mpa respectively the height and thickness of the walls are assumed 10 m and 1 m respectively moreover the width of the tank is 20 m it is presumed that the tank is filled by water with the density 1000 kg m3 the constant speed of sound in water is considered 1440 m s the convergence test is carried out in order to examine the correctness of the finite element model and identify the minimum number of elements it can be concluded from fig 5 that employing over 10 elements leads to highly precise results in the first three natural frequencies of the tank two various fluid levels are utilized to assess the influence of the rigorous fluid structure interaction on damage detection problem nevertheless at first damage detection of the empty tank is conducted to examine the correctness of the proposed method it is worthwhile to mention that to measure modal responses of damaged systems the finite element model is employed to simulate the experimental data li et al 2008 esfandiari and vahedi 2018 entezami et al 2017 in fact in the absence of experimental studies a reliable finite element method can be a proper alternative in practice measurement of all modal data is impossible especially in rotational dofs li et al 2008 besides it is valuable to decrease the number of sensors due to economic and practical problems because of these reasons in this work the structural data in translational dofs of the first mode shape and its related frequency are used to execute the damage detection process 5 3 1 empty tank in this case the tank can be considered as a structure in contact with air as shown in fig 6 consequently executing the damage detection process is carried out using eqs 16 and 22 a damaged finite element model of the tank is constructed using 30 classical eular bernoulli elements including five damaged elements r 2 r 11 r 15 l 4 and l 13 the amount of damages in these elements is assumed to be equal to 10 reduction in the stiffness of the elements the first mode shape of the empty damaged and undamaged tanks are depicted in fig 7 it is obvious that the changes in the nodal displacement are not considerable as well as to provide a better comparison the numerical outcomes for translational degrees of freedom are shown in fig 7 herein the important issue is whether the proposed method is sensitive enough to these small changes in what follows the answer to this question is given the results of damage detection for the empty tank are shown and compared with the actual damages in fig 8 from this figure it can be concluded that the proposed method is able to identify the location and extent of damages with high precision while the changes in numerical results of the damaged structure compared to the undamaged structure are low with regard to fig 7 as a result the sensitivity of the method to the modal data s changes is proven 5 3 2 completely fluid filled tank to implement the finite element model of the completely full tank 30 beam elements are used to model the structural part see fig 9 elements r 1 to r 15 are deployed to discretize the right wall as well as elements l 1 to l 15 for the left wall furthermore the water domain is modeled by 15 30 four sided meshes in this case to verify the results of the finite element method the natural frequencies of the first three modes are compared with those of others in table 2 it is clear from the comparison of the results of the empty and fully filled tank that considering the fluid structure interaction has had a considerable influence on the frequencies of the tank the frequencies of the completely filled system are significantly lower than the empty one therefore this difference must be included in the formulation of damage detection by reduction in e for target elements three scenarios of damages sf 1 to sf 3 are modeled to gain the simulated responses of the damage system as presented in table 3 different kinds of damages are considered to display the sensitivity of the proposed formulation to various damages several separate damages in the right wall a reduction of stiffness in throughout the right wall and some separate damages in both left and right walls are considered as the three scenarios sf 1 sf 2 and sf 3 respectively at first the changes in the first mode shapes of the damaged systems for scenarios sf 1 sf 2 and sf 3 are investigated in fig 10 the outstanding point is the remarkable changes in the mode shapes of the damaged systems compared with the undamaged ones which are indicated in fig 10 a c especially for scenarios sf 1 and sf 2 it is clear that imposing the effect of fluid structure interaction on damage detection formulation has two advantages 1 the results of damage detection process would be more reliable since the modeling errors decrease and there are fewer discrepancies between the finite element model and real system and 2 the modal data would provide more local information about location and severity of damages the results of damage detection for the fully filled tank are compared with the actual damages in the simulated damaged models in figs 11 13 as can be seen from these figures the location and severity of the damages are obtained with high accuracy for scenario sf 1 fig 11 all of the damages are in the right wall as a result the dispersion of damage places is not required to reach the precise outcomes a throughout damage in the right wall with the amount of 10 is considered to exist in scenario sf 2 fig 12 shows that the satisfactory results are attained from damage localization and quantification of the fully filled tank for scenario sf 2 it means that a large number of damages do not cause a destructive effect on damage detection process utilizing the proposed method moreover it is worth noting that the estimated and the actual damages are almost identical for scenario sf 3 as illustrated in fig 13 for a better comparative process and to display the errors of the presented method compared to actual data the findings of damage detection are tabulated in table 4 from this table one can realize that the errors the differences between the severities of exact and estimated damages are overwhelmingly low and could be acceptable for instance the highest error in the scenarios of the fully filled tanks is 0 0028 stiffness reduction in element l 15 to evaluate the convergence of the damage detection process a convergence criterion must be defined for this purpose the response of each iteration is compared with its former one as follows 32 e x i x i 1 2 herein x i and x i 1 are the damage vectors of the ith and i 1 th iterations of the damage detection process respectively furthermore 2 applies to the second norm the convergence path of damage detection problem is demonstrated in fig 14 it can be clearly seen from fig 14 that for the three scenarios sf 1 to sf 3 the damage identification process converges really fast and smoothly 5 3 3 partially fluid filled tank in this section to assess the influence of the water level on the damage detection process the tank is assumed to be half filled 14 28 meshes are used to model the fluid domain fig 15 note that the sloshing effect is not considered in this work three cases of damages are considered for the partially filled tank using both wetted and dry elements presented in table 5 in scenario sp 1 some dry elements in both left and right walls are assumed to be damaged a single damage is induced in wetted element l 7 for scenario sp 2 furthermore scenario sp 3 consists of both dry and wetted elements in the right and left walls the results of damage detection problem for the partially filled tank are summarized and compared with the actual damages in figs 16 18 the observations in these figures reveal that the accuracy of the results is high nevertheless compared to the completely full tank s results the precision is rather lower especially for scenarios sp 2 and sp 3 see figs 17 and 18 this occurrence may be related to matrix b and eq 8 as a matter of fact matrix b is the interaction matrix between the structural part and the fluid domain of the system with decline in the level of liquid the number of zero arrays in this matrix will increase and the fluid structure interaction will disappear in the dry part of the system therefore the connection between nodal displacements and nodal pressures in eq 8 will eliminate in these parts this phenomenon could be the most important reason for slightly numerical errors mentioned earlier fig 16 shows the high accuracy in the results of detecting damages for scenario sp 1 one wetted element is considered to be damaged in scenario sp 2 the findings of this scenario depicted in fig 17 indicate that the errors are acceptable the results of scenario sp 3 which embodies both dry and wetted elements are shown in fig 18 as can be seen the maximum error occurs in r 14 and this element is wrongly estimated as a damaged element with 0 023 severity see table 6 the convergence diagrams of the three cases for the half filled tank are demonstrated in fig 19 the findings prove that the damage detection process converges for all cases comparing to the results of the completely full tank the outcomes of the partially filled tank converges less fast and smoothly especially for sp 3 the convergence diagrams for scenarios sf 2 and sp 3 are compared in fig 20 as this figure reveals the convergence is achieved in 8 and 14 iterations for sf 2 and sp 3 respectively therefore it can be concluded that the high level of water accelerates the process of damage detection 6 conclusions this paper has been devoted to proposing a new damage detection method for the fluid structure interaction systems using model updating strategy the coupled eigenvalue problem is employed to consider the interaction effect in the damage identification furthermore an incomplete modal data of the first mode is applied along with the serep method in order to derive the damage detection equations structural part of mode shape is just utilized it means the measurement of nodal pressures of the damaged system is not required damages are modeled as a reduction in the stiffness of the walls consequently the stiffness matrix will change and the mass matrix will remain constant a two dimensional storage tank is investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the presented method to evaluate the influence of the fluid level two completely and partially full tanks are modeled by comparison the modal results of undamaged and damaged models it was shown that not only can considering the fluid structure interaction increase the accuracy of the finite element model but also the modal data provide valuable information about damages the findings prove that the proposed method is capable of damage localization and quantification with high precision in addition the results of several cases show that the author s approach has a satisfactory sensitivity to different dispersion of damaged elements and is able to detect small damages such as a 5 reduction in stiffness as well as it is concluded that the decrease in the liquid level has no considerable influence on the outcomes of the damage detection process appendix the fluid s free vibration differential equation in frequency domain can be expressed as a1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 ω 2 c 2 p 0 eq a1 can be solved by weighted residual approach and galerkin s method for this purpose the unknown pressure function weight function and the displacement function of structural part are defined as below a2 p n f p u n s r w n f w w t n f t

22634,this paper deals with the resilient control of a permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine subjected to magnet failures in this context a magnetic equivalent circuit method is used to model the synchronous generator magnet failures a fault resilient controller is therefore derived for magnet failure resilience purposes in fact high order sliding modes have been adopted to address the robustness problems faced by conventional techniques such as pi controllers the proposed fault resilient controller is evaluated and tested based on extensive simulations using real tidal

is highly predictable and is considered as a promising solution to lower co2 emissions melikoglu 2018 horizontal axis tidal turbines typically harness this kind of renewable energy fig 1 benbouzid et al 2017 these systems are unfortunately not yet massively deployed as they are facing reliability and availability challenges mainly due the harsh immersion conditions benbouzid et al 2011 in touimi et al 2018 it has been shown how the adopted drivetrain and generator options affect the availability in particular the direct drive option is typically adopted to minimize maintenance issues by removing the gearbox and using an unconventional low speed and high diameter permanent magnet synchronous generator fig 2 benelghali et al 2012 this unconventional generator type apart from being subject to the same type of failures as conventional machines can be subjected to magnet failures as it typically uses a relatively high number of permanent magnets fig 2 permanent magnets can experience demagnetization moosavi et al 2015 faiz and mazaheri tehrani 2017 indeed their magnetic force can weaken locally or uniformly eriksson et al 2009 the demagnetization process illustrated by fig 3 hong et al 2010 is mainly due to temperature variations high stator windings opposing magnetomotive forces fault current fig 3a high torque during transients and magnets aging kim et al 2009 xu et al 2016 sjökvist et al 2016 moreover when partial demagnetization occurs the same load torque will be generated at the expense of a higher current than in the healthy case this will consequently increase the temperature constraint accelerating therefore the demagnetization process fig 3b the demagnetization issue has been investigated in the literature where it was first studied in terms of modeling and simulation in permanent magnet synchronous generators indeed the finite element method has been investigated in kim et al 2009 where its accuracy has been highlighted while being time consuming for dynamic simulation wang et al 2008 as previously investigated for faulty induction machines modeling the magnetic equivalent circuit method has been used for demagnetization modeling farooq et al 2008 urresty et al 2013 even if in guo et al 2018 it is criticized in terms of building complexity this method is quite sufficient as a model for control purposes specific issues such as the rotor movement and saturation have been further taken into consideration leading to more accurate modeling raminosoa et al 2009 it should also be mentioned that to improve permanent magnet generators fault resilience capability and torque density fractional slot concentrated windings has been proposed for wind turbines chen et al 2015 magnetomotive forces rich harmonics however make demagnetization characteristics different from that of generators with distributed windings needing therefore further investigations to avoid demagnetization a specific design of the generator can be targeted with a specific control as recently proposed in farrok et al 2018 in the sensitive context of an immersed system as a tidal turbine a resilient control is a key feature aiming to increase the availability tidal turbine control issue has been increasingly explored in the literature where classical pi controllers have been shown to be very sensitive to faulty conditions pham et al 2018a toumi et al 2017 this comparative study clearly highlights the need for robust fault resilient control a critical state of the art review specifically shows that two control techniques seem having the lead namely model predictive control pham et al 2018b and high order sliding modes mekri et al 2013 the main objective of this paper is therefore proposing a fault resilient control approach for a tidal turbine system experiencing permanent magnet failures typically demagnetization toumi et al 2016 for that purpose the magnetic equivalent circuit method will be firstly used for magnet failures modeling conventional pi controllers resiliency limitations are then illustrated finally a second order sliding mode control strategy is proposed and demonstrated to be robust and efficient for tidal turbine resilience under magnet failures this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the tidal turbine system modeling where the resource the turbine rotor and the generator modeling approaches are described in section 3 the magnetic equivalent circuit method is used for magnets failure analysis section 4 highlights pi controllers limitations and therefore proposes a fault resilient strategy for the tidal turbine control section 5 comes with the simulation results and their discussion finally section 4 concludes the paper 2 tidal turbine modeling fig 4 illustrates the basic parts of a tidal turbine system it mainly consists of the turbine rotor the permanent magnet synchronous generator coupled to a dc bus via a three phase converter the connection to the grid is achieved based on a three phase converter inverter the generator side converter rectifier is controlled based on the maximum power point tracking mppt method since the considered turbine rotor system is non pitchable the mppt is achieved by adjusting the turbine power coefficient at its optimal value c pmax by adjusting the tip speed ratio at its optimal value λ o p t the grid side converter is controlled to maintain the dc link voltage constant assuming it operates with a unity power factor in this paper we will only focus on the generator side converter 2 1 resource modeling resource modeling has been previously investigated in benelghali et al 2007 therefore knowing the tide coefficient for a specific site it is easy to derive the following first order model for tidal current velocities v t 1 v t v n t c 45 v s t v n t 95 45 where c corresponds to the tide coefficient v st and v nt are the spring and neap tide current velocities respectively the tidal current velocity could however be disturbed by long length oceanic waves which have a narrow spectrum and much energy swell effect zhou et al 2013 this study will not consider the swell effect and uses the first order model in 1 to calculate the tidal velocity for each second indeed when using a low speed permanent magnet generator direct drive option the rotor speed variation in a sampling period is very small compared to other variables therefore the rotor speed is assumed unchanged at the next sampling instant pham et al 2018b 2 2 tidal turbine rotor modeling a tidal turbine harnessed power is expressed by benbouzid et al 2011 2 p m 1 2 c p λ β ρ π r 2 v t 3 where c p λ β corresponds to the power coefficient for typical tidal turbines the maximum value of c p for normal operation is estimated to be in the range of 0 35 0 5 as for wind turbines the c p can be approximated by an equation depending on the tip speed ratio λ rω v t and the blade pitch angle β benbouzid et al 2011 in this paper a non pitchable tidal turbine has been adopted as it is the case of some industrial projects openhydro and voith hydro touimi et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 indeed fixed blades enable avoiding an additional relative movement in water therefore increasing reliability zhou et al 2015 in this context the c p is supposed to be only depending on λ where fig 5 illustrates the c p curve used for simulations for the mppt strategy implementation purposes the grid side converter must be controlled in order to keep the c p at its maximum value c pmax 0 45 which corresponds to the optimal tip speed ratio λ opt 6 3 fig 6 illustrates the extractable power for different tidal speeds while showing two different operating zones the mppt zone where the extractable power is maximized and remains below the generator rated power the second zone corresponds to the one where the extractable power is limited to the generator rated one several approaches can be used to limit the extractable power as described in zhou et al 2015 fig 7 illustrates the permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine electromechanical torque for different tidal speed in the following the extractable power will be supposed to be always below the rated one therefore only the mppt zone is investigated 2 3 permanent magnet synchronous generator modeling the generator dynamic model in the abc frame is given as follows 3 v s

flux farooq et al 2008 magnet failure effects will consequently impact the emf it could therefore be considered as an interesting mean for the generator magnet failures analysis the emf is given by 11 e d ψ m d t d θ e d t d ψ m d θ e ω d ψ m d θ e where θ e pθ m for the purpose of magnet demagnetization analysis each magnet of one coil emf is calculated using fourier series faiz and mazaheri

of phase a and e n is the amplitude the z th coil emf given by 13 is calculated by summing all emfs due to each magnet using the superposition rule 13 e a z n i 1 p 1 i 1 k e j n i 1 360 p e j n θ c z e n e j n θ m where the demagnetization effect is introduced by means of the k coefficient and θ cz is phase a z th coil angle given by farooq et al 2008 14 θ c z z 1 c n s 360 with n s is the stator slots number and c is its coil pitch given by 15 c n s p after the z th coil emf calculation a one phase emf is then calculated by the summation of the emf in all coils consequently phase a emf is given by 16 e a n i 1 p 1 i 1 k e j n i 1 360 p z 1 n c o i l 1 z 1 e j n θ c z e n e j n θ m it can be rewritten as follows 17 e a n k n k s a n e n e j n θ m where e n e j n θ m represents the emf due to one magnet in one coil and k n is given by 18 k n i 1 p 1 i 1 k e j n i 1 360 p this term known as magnet factor expresses the magnet failure percentage by the k index typically in healthy conditions k is equal to 1 and for all values of the n in 18 k n will be equal to zero except when the number of pole pairs is odd it should be mentioned that at failure occurrence all the mechanical frequency multiples can appear in the emf waveform guo et al 2018 the coil factor k san in each phase given by 19 k s a n z 1 n c o i l 1 z 1 e j n θ c z expresses the location and the number of coils for other phases the amplitude of this factor is the same however the phase shift is equal to 120 the other phases will have an identical emf but with a different coil factor as follows 20 e b n k n k

oriented control it mainly consists in an mppt control a pi speed controller and two current pi controllers fig 9 summarizes the control scheme the control system is defined in the s domain as follows 22 i s d 1 r s l s s v s d ω ψ s q i s q 1 r s l s s v s q ω ψ s d where 23 ψ s d l s i s d φ a ψ s q l s i s q the electromagnetic torque is given by 24 t e m 3 2 p φ a i s q an mppt based variable speed technique has been adopted in this context the tidal turbine tip speed ratio λ is maintained at it optimal value to allow extracting the maximum power the turbine speed reference is given by zhou et al 2015 benelghali et al 2011 25 ω r e f v t λ o p t r the rotational speed control loop reference is adjusted so that the tidal turbine will operate around the maximum power for a given tidal velocity if this velocity exceeds 3 2 m sec the extracted power will be limited to 1 5 mw zhou et al 2015 the d axis current reference is maintained equal to zero in order to minimize the copper losses therefore minimizing currents for a given torque mekri et al 2013 in this case the generator torque can be directly controlled through the q axis current the quadratic current reference is calculated by the speed loop controller the converter voltage vector required d q components are derived from two pi current controllers a decoupling block is then added to compensate some terms to improve the dynamic response finally the pwm block is used to generate the control signals to implement the generator vector control fig 9 3 2 magnet failure resilient control high order sliding modes namely the second order ones are adopted for resilient control of the permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine experiencing demagnetization indeed such kind of robust control approach has been extensively used for wind and tidal systems where it has been demonstrated their ability to achieve simple control algorithms and chattering free phenomenon in a finite time mekri et al 2013 benelghali et al 2011 beltran et al 2012 in conventional sliding mode control design the control target is to move and maintain the system state variables into sliding surfaces s 0 second order sliding mode control aims for s s 0 where the system states converge to zero at the intersection of s and s in the state space the proposed control approach is designed using the super twisting algorithm levant and alelishvili 2007 this algorithm is divided into several steps first the speed reference is given by the mppt strategy and the optimal electromagnetic torque ensuring the rotor speed convergence to ω ref is computed using 26 t e m r e f t m α ω ω r e f j t ω r e f f ω r e f where α is a positive constant the current references are then deduced as follows 27 i s d r e f 0 i s q r e f 2 3 p φ a t e m r e f the second order sliding mode algorithm is afterward used to ensure the currents convergence to their references the sliding surfaces are chosen as follows 28 s d i s d i s d r e f s q i s q i s q r e f the control inputs v s d and v s q consist of the sum of two parts 29 v s d v s d e q v s d v s q v s q e q v s q where v s d e q and v s q e q are the equivalent control for d and q axis given by 30 v s d e q r s i s d p l s ω i s q l s d i s d r e f d t v s q e q r s i s q p ω l s i s q φ a l s d i s q r e f d t 3 3 the derivate of 28 gives 31 s d i s d i s d r e f s d ϕ 1 t x γ 1 t x v s d and s q i s q i s q r e f s q ϕ 2 t x γ 2 t x v s q 32 where ϕ1 t x ϕ2 t x γ1 t x and γ2 t x are uncertain bounded functions that satisfy 33 ϕ 1 0 ϕ 1 φ 1 0 γ m 1 γ 1 γ m 1 ϕ 2 0 ϕ 2 φ 2 0 γ m 2 γ 2 γ m 2 the proposed second order sliding mode control law contains two continuous components as follows 34 v s d u 1 u 2 v s q w 1 w 2 where 35 u 1 α 1 s i g n s d u 2 β 1 s 1 ξ s i g n s d and 36 w 1 α 2 s i g n s q w 2 β 2 s 2 ξ s i g n s q this control law does not depend upon the first time derivative of the sliding surface to ensure the convergence of the sliding manifolds to zero in finite time the gains can be chosen as follows 37 α i φ i γ m i β i 2 4 φ i γ m i 2 γ m i γ m i α i φ i α i φ i i 1 2 0 ξ 0 5 the derived sliding mode control allows imposing a reduced order dynamics and leads the tidal turbine to operate at its maximum power point while being fault resilient finally the control inputs for both d axis and q axis currents are given by 38 v s d v s d e q β 1 s d ξ s i g n s d α 1 s i g n s d d t v s q v s q e q β 2 s q ξ s i g n s q α 2 s i g n s q d t it should be mentioned that sliding modes main drawback is chattering due to the usage of the sign switching function as shown in 38 the chattering issue is greatly attenuated by the use of higher sliding modes based on the super twisting algorithm indeed this is due to two simultaneous actions 38 1 the integral action that filters high frequencies of the chattering phenomena and 2 the multiplying terms α and β that become small close to zero this is clearly shown in fridman and levant 2002 davila et al 2005 and experimentally validated in benelghali et al 2011 beltran et al 2012 the stability proof has not been explicitly considered in this application oriented paper indeed it has been already considered in details by fridman et al in fridman and levant 2002 in this relevant work fridman has clearly proved that stability is guaranteed for second order sliding modes this is the reason that led us to use this order in this study and the previous ones benelghali et al 2011 beltran et al 2012 4 simulation results fig 10 shows the overall control system based on the second order sliding mode control the simulated permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine parameters are given in the appendix table 1 fig 11 represents an example of tidal velocity for a day each second represents an hour for a specific location at the raz de sein in bretagne france fig 12 benelghali et al 2007 it can be seen that a 2 3 m sec tidal speed peak can be reached the tidal turbine simulation under magnets failure has been first carried out using pi controllers where the failure has been introduced at t 2sec in this context figs 13 and 14 depict the generator rotor speed under different values of the coefficient k 5 and 10 in order to evaluate the impact of magnets failure severity on the tidal turbine behavior it can be clearly noticed speed ripples as soon as the magnet failure appears these ripples obviously increase with the demagnetization factor k increases at this stage it seems that a classical pi control is unfortunately not able to efficiently

is highly predictable and is considered as a promising solution to lower co2 emissions melikoglu 2018 horizontal axis tidal turbines typically harness this kind of renewable energy fig 1 benbouzid et al 2017 these systems are unfortunately not yet massively deployed as they are facing reliability and availability challenges mainly due the harsh immersion conditions benbouzid et al 2011 in touimi et al 2018 it has been shown how the adopted drivetrain and generator options affect the availability in particular the direct drive option is typically adopted to minimize maintenance issues by removing the gearbox and using an unconventional low speed and high diameter permanent magnet synchronous generator fig 2 benelghali et al 2012 this unconventional generator type apart from being subject to the same type of failures as conventional machines can be subjected to magnet failures as it typically uses a relatively high number of permanent magnets fig 2 permanent magnets can experience demagnetization moosavi et al 2015 faiz and mazaheri tehrani 2017 indeed their magnetic force can weaken locally or uniformly eriksson et al 2009 the demagnetization process illustrated by fig 3 hong et al 2010 is mainly due to temperature variations high stator windings opposing magnetomotive forces fault current fig 3a high torque during transients and magnets aging kim et al 2009 xu et al 2016 sjökvist et al 2016 moreover when partial demagnetization occurs the same load torque will be generated at the expense of a higher current than in the healthy case this will consequently increase the temperature constraint accelerating therefore the demagnetization process fig 3b the demagnetization issue has been investigated in the literature where it was first studied in terms of modeling and simulation in permanent magnet synchronous generators indeed the finite element method has been investigated in kim et al 2009 where its accuracy has been highlighted while being time consuming for dynamic simulation wang et al 2008 as previously investigated for faulty induction machines modeling the magnetic equivalent circuit method has been used for demagnetization modeling farooq et al 2008 urresty et al 2013 even if in guo et al 2018 it is criticized in terms of building complexity this method is quite sufficient as a model for control purposes specific issues such as the rotor movement and saturation have been further taken into consideration leading to more accurate modeling raminosoa et al 2009 it should also be mentioned that to improve permanent magnet generators fault resilience capability and torque density fractional slot concentrated windings has been proposed for wind turbines chen et al 2015 magnetomotive forces rich harmonics however make demagnetization characteristics different from that of generators with distributed windings needing therefore further investigations to avoid demagnetization a specific design of the generator can be targeted with a specific control as recently proposed in farrok et al 2018 in the sensitive context of an immersed system as a tidal turbine a resilient control is a key feature aiming to increase the availability tidal turbine control issue has been increasingly explored in the literature where classical pi controllers have been shown to be very sensitive to faulty conditions pham et al 2018a toumi et al 2017 this comparative study clearly highlights the need for robust fault resilient control a critical state of the art review specifically shows that two control techniques seem having the lead namely model predictive control pham et al 2018b and high order sliding modes mekri et al 2013 the main objective of this paper is therefore proposing a fault resilient control approach for a tidal turbine system experiencing permanent magnet failures typically demagnetization toumi et al 2016 for that purpose the magnetic equivalent circuit method will be firstly used for magnet failures modeling conventional pi controllers resiliency limitations are then illustrated finally a second order sliding mode control strategy is proposed and demonstrated to be robust and efficient for tidal turbine resilience under magnet failures this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the tidal turbine system modeling where the resource the turbine rotor and the generator modeling approaches are described in section 3 the magnetic equivalent circuit method is used for magnets failure analysis section 4 highlights pi controllers limitations and therefore proposes a fault resilient strategy for the tidal turbine control section 5 comes with the simulation results and their discussion finally section 4 concludes the paper 2 tidal turbine modeling fig 4 illustrates the basic parts of a tidal turbine system it mainly consists of the turbine rotor the permanent magnet synchronous generator coupled to a dc bus via a three phase converter the connection to the grid is achieved based on a three phase converter inverter the generator side converter rectifier is controlled based on the maximum power point tracking mppt method since the considered turbine rotor system is non pitchable the mppt is achieved by adjusting the turbine power coefficient at its optimal value c pmax by adjusting the tip speed ratio at its optimal value λ o p t the grid side converter is controlled to maintain the dc link voltage constant assuming it operates with a unity power factor in this paper we will only focus on the generator side converter 2 1 resource modeling resource modeling has been previously investigated in benelghali et al 2007 therefore knowing the tide coefficient for a specific site it is easy to derive the following first order model for tidal current velocities v t 1 v t v n t c 45 v s t v n t 95 45 where c corresponds to the tide coefficient v st and v nt are the spring and neap tide current velocities respectively the tidal current velocity could however be disturbed by long length oceanic waves which have a narrow spectrum and much energy swell effect zhou et al 2013 this study will not consider the swell effect and uses the first order model in 1 to calculate the tidal velocity for each second indeed when using a low speed permanent magnet generator direct drive option the rotor speed variation in a sampling period is very small compared to other variables therefore the rotor speed is assumed unchanged at the next sampling instant pham et al 2018b 2 2 tidal turbine rotor modeling a tidal turbine harnessed power is expressed by benbouzid et al 2011 2 p m 1 2 c p λ β ρ π r 2 v t 3 where c p λ β corresponds to the power coefficient for typical tidal turbines the maximum value of c p for normal operation is estimated to be in the range of 0 35 0 5 as for wind turbines the c p can be approximated by an equation depending on the tip speed ratio λ rω v t and the blade pitch angle β benbouzid et al 2011 in this paper a non pitchable tidal turbine has been adopted as it is the case of some industrial projects openhydro and voith hydro touimi et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 indeed fixed blades enable avoiding an additional relative movement in water therefore increasing reliability zhou et al 2015 in this context the c p is supposed to be only depending on λ where fig 5 illustrates the c p curve used for simulations for the mppt strategy implementation purposes the grid side converter must be controlled in order to keep the c p at its maximum value c pmax 0 45 which corresponds to the optimal tip speed ratio λ opt 6 3 fig 6 illustrates the extractable power for different tidal speeds while showing two different operating zones the mppt zone where the extractable power is maximized and remains below the generator rated power the second zone corresponds to the one where the extractable power is limited to the generator rated one several approaches can be used to limit the extractable power as described in zhou et al 2015 fig 7 illustrates the permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine electromechanical torque for different tidal speed in the following the extractable power will be supposed to be always below the rated one therefore only the mppt zone is investigated 2 3 permanent magnet synchronous generator modeling the generator dynamic model in the abc frame is given as follows 3 v s

flux farooq et al 2008 magnet failure effects will consequently impact the emf it could therefore be considered as an interesting mean for the generator magnet failures analysis the emf is given by 11 e d ψ m d t d θ e d t d ψ m d θ e ω d ψ m d θ e where θ e pθ m for the purpose of magnet demagnetization analysis each magnet of one coil emf is calculated using fourier series faiz and mazaheri tehrani 2017 12 e a 1 p m 1 n e n e j n θ m e a 1 p m 2 n e n e j n 360 p e j n θ m e a 1 p m p n e n e j n p 1 360 p e j n θ m where e a z p m m is the emf due to the magnet number m in the z th coil of phase a and e n is the amplitude the z th coil emf given by 13 is calculated by summing all emfs due to each magnet using the superposition rule 13 e a z n i 1 p 1 i 1 k e j n i 1 360 p e j n θ c z e n e j n θ m where the demagnetization effect is introduced by means of the k coefficient and θ cz is phase a z th coil angle given by farooq et al 2008 14 θ c z z 1 c n s 360 with n s is the stator slots number and c is its coil pitch given by 15 c n s p after the z th coil emf calculation a one phase emf is then calculated by the summation of the emf in all coils consequently phase a emf is given by 16 e a n i 1 p 1 i 1 k e j n i 1 360 p z 1 n c o i l 1 z 1 e j n θ c z e n e j n θ m it can be rewritten as follows 17 e a n k n k s a n e n e j n θ m where e n e j n θ m represents the emf due to one magnet in one coil and k n is given by 18 k n i 1 p 1 i 1 k e j n i 1 360 p this term known as magnet factor expresses the magnet failure percentage by the k index typically in healthy conditions k is equal to 1 and for all values of the n in 18 k n will be equal to zero except when the number of pole pairs is odd it should be mentioned that at failure occurrence all the mechanical frequency multiples can appear in the emf waveform guo et al 2018 the coil factor k san in each phase given by 19 k s a n z 1 n c o i l 1 z 1 e j n θ c z expresses the location and the number of coils for other phases the amplitude of this factor is the same however the phase shift is equal to 120 the other phases will have an identical emf but with a different coil factor as follows 20 e b n k n k

oriented control it mainly consists in an mppt control a pi speed controller and two current pi controllers fig 9 summarizes the control scheme the control system is defined in the s domain as follows 22 i s d 1 r s l s s v s d ω ψ s q i s q 1 r s l s s v s q ω ψ s d where 23 ψ s d l s i s d φ a ψ s q l s i s q the electromagnetic torque is given by 24 t e m 3 2 p φ a i s q an mppt based variable speed technique has been adopted in this context the tidal turbine tip speed ratio λ is maintained at it optimal value to allow extracting the maximum power the turbine speed reference is given by zhou et al 2015 benelghali et al 2011 25 ω r e f v t λ o p t r the rotational speed control loop reference is adjusted so that the tidal turbine will operate around the maximum power for a given tidal velocity if this velocity exceeds 3 2 m sec the extracted power will be limited to 1 5 mw zhou et al 2015 the d axis current reference is maintained equal to zero in order to minimize the copper losses therefore minimizing currents for a given torque mekri et al 2013 in this case the generator torque can be directly controlled through the q axis current the quadratic current reference is calculated by the speed loop controller the converter voltage vector required d q components are derived from two pi current controllers a decoupling block is then added to compensate some terms to improve the dynamic response finally the pwm block is used to generate the control signals to implement the generator vector control fig 9 3 2 magnet failure resilient control high order sliding modes namely the second order ones are adopted for resilient control of the permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine experiencing demagnetization indeed such kind of robust control approach has been extensively used for wind and tidal systems where it has been demonstrated their ability to achieve simple control algorithms and chattering free phenomenon in a finite time mekri et al 2013 benelghali et al 2011 beltran et al 2012 in conventional sliding mode control design the control target is to move and maintain the system state variables into sliding surfaces s 0 second order sliding mode control aims for s s 0 where the system states converge to zero at the intersection of s and s in the state space the proposed control approach is designed using the super twisting algorithm levant and alelishvili 2007 this algorithm is divided into several steps first the speed reference is given by the mppt strategy and the optimal electromagnetic torque ensuring the rotor speed convergence to ω ref is computed using 26 t e m r e f t m α ω ω r e f j t ω r e f f ω r e f where α is a positive constant the current references are then deduced as follows 27 i s d r e f 0 i s q r e f 2 3 p φ a t e m r e f the second order sliding mode algorithm is afterward used to ensure the currents convergence to their references the sliding surfaces are chosen as follows 28 s d i s d i s d r e f s q i s q i s q r e f the control inputs v s d and v s q consist of the sum of two parts 29 v s d v s d e q v s d v s q v s q e q v s q where v s d e q and v s q e q are the equivalent control for d and q axis given by 30 v s d e q r s i s d p l s ω i s q l s d i s d r e f d t v s q e q r s i s q p ω l s i s q φ a l s d i s q r e f d t 3 3 the derivate of 28 gives 31 s d i s d i s d r e f s d ϕ 1 t x γ 1 t x v s d and s q i s q i s q r e f s q ϕ 2 t x γ 2 t x v s q 32 where ϕ1 t x ϕ2 t x γ1 t x and γ2 t x are uncertain bounded functions that satisfy 33 ϕ 1 0 ϕ 1 φ 1 0 γ m 1 γ 1 γ m 1 ϕ 2 0 ϕ 2 φ 2 0 γ m 2 γ 2 γ m 2 the proposed second order sliding mode control law contains two continuous components as follows 34 v s d u 1 u 2 v s q w 1 w 2 where 35 u 1 α 1 s i g n s d u 2 β 1 s 1 ξ s i g n s d and 36 w 1 α 2 s i g n s q w 2 β 2 s 2 ξ s i g n s q this control law does not depend upon the first time derivative of the sliding surface to ensure the convergence of the sliding manifolds to zero in finite time the gains can be chosen as follows 37 α i φ i γ m i β i 2 4 φ i γ m i 2 γ m i γ m i α i φ i α i φ i i 1 2 0 ξ 0 5 the derived sliding mode control allows imposing a reduced order dynamics and leads the tidal turbine to operate at its maximum power point while being fault resilient finally the control inputs for both d axis and q axis currents are given by 38 v s d v s d e q β 1 s d ξ s i g n s d α 1 s i g n s d d t v s q v s q e q β 2 s q ξ s i g n s q α 2 s i g n s q d t it should be mentioned that sliding modes main drawback is chattering due to the usage of the sign switching function as shown in 38 the chattering issue is greatly attenuated by the use of higher sliding modes based on the super twisting algorithm indeed this is due to two simultaneous actions 38 1 the integral action that filters high frequencies of the chattering phenomena and 2 the multiplying terms α and β that become small close to zero this is clearly shown in fridman and levant 2002 davila et al 2005 and experimentally validated in benelghali et al 2011 beltran et al 2012 the stability proof has not been explicitly considered in this application oriented paper indeed it has been already considered in details by fridman et al in fridman and levant 2002 in this relevant work fridman has clearly proved that stability is guaranteed for second order sliding modes this is the reason that led us to use this order in this study and the previous ones benelghali et al 2011 beltran et al 2012 4 simulation results fig 10 shows the overall control system based on the second order sliding mode control the simulated permanent magnet synchronous generator based tidal turbine parameters are given in the appendix table 1 fig 11 represents an example of tidal velocity for a day each second represents an hour for a specific location at the raz de sein in bretagne france fig 12 benelghali et al 2007 it can be seen that a 2 3 m sec tidal speed peak can be reached the tidal turbine simulation under magnets failure has been first carried out using pi controllers where the failure has been introduced at t 2sec in this context figs 13 and 14 depict the generator rotor speed under different values of the coefficient k 5 and 10 in order to evaluate the impact of magnets failure severity on the tidal turbine behavior it can be clearly noticed speed ripples as soon as the magnet failure appears these ripples obviously increase with the demagnetization factor k increases at this stage it seems that a classical pi control is unfortunately not able to efficiently
