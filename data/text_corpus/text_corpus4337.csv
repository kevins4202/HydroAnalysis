21685,recent accidents caused by wave impact loads have attracted increasing concerns from academia and industry an experimental study was carried out to investigate the local wave impact loads on a semi submersible exposed to various sea states focusing on the spatial distributions and interference among the fore column aft column deck bottom and deck side a versatile tool based on the conditional probability is proposed and used along with correlation analyses to evaluate the interference among different components the results show that the wave impact loads on the semi submersible are of high nonlinearity and the aft column is the worst hit component where wave impacts occur most frequently the transition region between the fore column and deck side is the most dangerous area for extremely large waves while the connection corner deserves particular concerns for the aft column and the deck bottom the horizontal variation of wave impact loads is not significant on the fore column but is remarkable within the width of the deck side the interference examination reveals that wave impact loads on different components are correlated at varying levels under different wave impact scenarios the in depth analysis improves the understanding of wave impact events on multi column floating structures keywords wave impact load semi submersible interference spatial distribution experiment 1 introduction the large volume offshore structures such as semi submersibles are required to withstand various environmental loads the wave induced force is one of the most important concerns and there has been numerous studies in this field among all kinds of wave induced forces the wave impact load from extreme waves such as freak waves or breaking waves could be the most dangerous one in recent years reports on offshore structures damaged by wave impact loads are not rare szalewski et al 2017 kaiser et al 2009 buchner and voogt 2004 therefore the thorough understanding and further accurate determination of the wave impact load are indispensable to the design of offshore structures although there have been some theoretical works baarholm and faltinsen 2004 kaplan et al 1992 wagner 1932 and increasingly numerical simulations hu et al 2017 rudman and cleary 2013 pakozdi et al 2011 model tests are still the most trusted approach to estimate the wave impact load due to the complexity and high nonlinearity of the wave impact process huang et al 2015 scharnke et al 2014 kapsenberg 2011 apart from offshore platforms the problem of wave impact has attracted extensive attentions in many fields dias and ghidaglia 2018 such as the design of breakwaters ships wave energy converters and offshore wind turbine foundations with regard to the wave impact load plenty of researches have focused on cylinders plates or boxes which are treated as simplifications of these marine structures or some of their structural components chan and melville 1988 and zhou et al 1991 conducted laboratory measurements of wave impact pressures on surface piercing vertical plane walls and cylinders respectively it is found that the characteristics of wave impact pressures vary significantly due to the randomness of wave breaking and trapped air and the relative position between the structure and the wave breaking point has an important effect on the wave impact process wienke and oumeraci 2005 investigated the breaking wave forces on a slender cylinder with a large scale model test a theoretical description was developed based on the wagner theory wagner 1932 and compared with the experimental results also the effect of the yaw angle between the cylinder and the wave direction on the wave impact force was investigated compared to simple structures like cylinders large volume offshore structures are far more complex there are various hydrodynamic interactions among different components of the offshore structures with critical effects on the wave impact load such as wave run up along columns nielsen 2003 wave trapping of multi column platforms shan et al 2012 and shoaling effect of the submerged pontoon iwata et al 1997 marine accidents in recent years have attracted increasing concerns from academia and industry for column stabilized units with negative airgaps dnv gl proposed the technical guidance otg 14 to evaluate the local horizontal wave impact loads otg 14 2017 to document the structural integrity model test campaigns concerning the wave impact load were carried out vestbøstad et al 2017 huang et al 2017 lim et al 2015 these reported works put efforts into establishing probability distributions of the maximum wave impact loads and then estimating the q probability design load from the perspective of probability and statistics such systematical experimental results including distributions of local wave impact loads on different parts of structures are usually not available due to the limitation of project confidentiality requirements to provide data to validate numerical simulations abdussamie et al 2017b experimentally investigated the wave in deck impact events on a rigidly mounted tension leg platform tlp subjected to extreme wave events while the same tlp model was moored with four tendons in abdussamie et al 2017a regarding the distribution on the deck high wave in deck impact pressures were found on the forward part of the deck and on the deck column intersection areas when severe wave impacts occur on complex offshore structures wave impact loads on different components are inevitable to correlate and interfere mutually among few studies kisacik et al 2012 investigated violent wave impacts on a fixed vertical structure and attached horizontal cantilever slab it was found that the presence of a horizontal structural part increases the vulnerability of the vertical structures against violent wave impacts to the authors knowledge limited open literatures to date have been reported to focus on the interference of wave impact loads among different components especially for large floating structures the main objective of this study is to investigate the local wave impact loads on different structural components of a semi submersible including the fore column the aft column the deck bottom and the deck side to accomplish the objective an experiment of a semi submersible under a series of irregular waves was purposely carried out in deepwater offshore basin based on the experimental results comprehensive analyses of wave impact loads are conducted focusing on the effect of sea state severity the comparison between different structural components and corresponding spatial distributions in horizontal and vertical directions furthermore a method utilizing the conditional probability is proposed and used along with correlation analyses to examine the mutual interference of wave impact loads among different components 2 description of the experiment the experiment was conducted in the deep water offshore basin at shanghai jiao tong university in china the basin is 50 m in length 40 m in width and has the maximum effective water depth of 10 m with a movable false bottom to simulate different water depth various ocean environments including waves currents and winds can be simulated by using two multi flap wave generators a deepwater global current generation system and an axial wind fan matrix respectively 2 1 test model a semi submersible model composed of two pontoons four rectangular columns four circular bracings and one deck box was fabricated and installed in the basin for wave tests as shown in fig 1 the main objectives of the model test campaign are to investigate the air gap performance and the wave impact load in harsh ocean environments therefore only the survival loading condition was considered table 1 lists the main particulars and mass properties where the vertical position of the center of gravity is above base line and the reference point of the radius of gyration is the center of gravity the platform model was made of wood glass fiber and steel to satisfy the requirements of strength and was fabricated with sufficient accuracy the linear scale ratio between the model and the prototype was 1 60 during the wave tests the platform model was moored in the wave basin with a horizontal mooring system as shown in fig 2 four lines of the horizontal mooring system composed of springs and wire ropes were configured along the diagonal lines of the platform and the stiffness of each line was 64 5 n m in model scale which was considered to be soft enough to avoid influencing the wave frequency motion responses before wave tests decay tests were conducted in still water for verifying the modeling the obtained natural periods are listed in table 2 2 2 test cases the water depth is 1500 m in prototype and was set to 9 8 m in the experiment wave tests were carried out using long crest irregular waves under three wave headings namely head quartering and beam seas extensive test cases were implemented to evaluate the wave impact load on the semi submersible in order to include the governing sea state 6 sea states were chosen around the steepness limited flank of the h s t p contour as given in table 3 where h s is the significant wave height t p is the peak period γ is the peakness factor and a seed of a sea state represents an independent test the irregular waves were simulated with typical jonswap spectrum which can be written as 1 s f α h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 2 σ 0 09 for f f p 0 07 for f f p 3 α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ where f p denotes the peak frequency and σ is the spectral width parameter another recent study of the authors guo et al 2020 has investigated the effects of wave direction on wave impact loads and found that the wave impact on the semi submersible is more severe under beam seas and head seas than that in oblique seas whereas this study aims to investigate the interference of wave impact loads among different structural components of the semi submersible and this can achieved more appropriately under head seas therefore the measuring slam panels were specifically installed on the model see fig 1 and only the 23 wave test runs under head sea conditions are analyzed in the paper the duration of each irregular wave test is equivalent to 3 h in prototype excluding a run up time of 12 min in prototype before placing the platform model in the wave basin the specified wave parameters and spectrum were calibrated using a wave gauge placed at the static equilibrium position of the platform model to provide high quality input to wave tests and an example is shown in fig 3 for all the input irregular waves used in the experiment the errors in terms of hs and tp between the target and measured spectrum do not exceed 5 and 3 respectively 2 3 measuring system to measure the wave impact load the semi submersible model was instrumented with a total of 43 slam panels whose performance and reliability were demonstrated in another study by the wedge drop test guo et al 2017 they were arranged on the fore column the deck side the aft column and the deck bottom in this paper we only focus on part of them as shown in fig 1 b d fig 4 depicts the detailed locations of the concerned slam panels at full scale all the slam panels were above the still water level swl in height direction there were 5 rows of slam panels on the fore column and the aft column specially there were 3 slam panels at the third row on the fore column to check the horizontal variation of the wave impact load in addition two columns of slam panels were installed on the left edge and centerline of the deck side both of which were composed of 3 evenly distributed panels the two lowest slam panels on the deck side were 4 05 m above the highest one of the fore column to measure wave in deck impact loads due to waves exceeding the available freeboard or wave run up along the aft column 5 slam panels were installed on the deck bottom along the length direction the spacing between adjacent slam panels on the columns and the deck side was 2 7 m center to center while it was 3 3 m for the deck bottom each slam panel consisted of a strain gauge force transducer kyowa lux b 100n id and a sensing plate made of acrylic glass which was 2 0 cm 2 0 cm in model scale and was enough light to minimize the panel dynamic effects the force transducer has the rated capacity of 100 n and the natural frequency of about 11 khz the measurement of wave impact loads by force transducers has been successfully attempted by a few published works kim et al 2019 vestbøstad et al 2017 huang et al 2015 to reduce hydro elastic effects steel base plates were buried into the test model on which slam panels were installed after being installed on the semi model the slam panels were attached with watertight films for waterproofing fig 5 presents the prepared model hammer tests were conducted to check the effect of noise and to qualify the slam panels the natural frequencies of the slam panels were found to be around 4000 hz and the noise was negligible due to the short duration of the wave impact load a high speed data acquisition system hbm gen3i was employed to record wave impact loads with a sampling frequency of 20 000 hz and an anti alias filter of 5000 hz was used before sampling 3 results and discussion to present the experimental results several notations associated with wave impact pressures within a wave impact event are introduced and explained as following p the peak pressure recorded by each slam panel p m a x the largest peak pressure among all slam panels on the whole platform p m a x f o r e p m a x a f t p m a x b o t t o m p m a x s i d e the largest peak pressure among slam panels on the fore column aft column deck bottom and deck side respectively 3 1 uncertainty analyses to check the repeatability of the test and assess the uncertainty a realization of sea state w6 was run repeatedly two times fig 6 a c present the time histories of the wave mooring force and surge motion of the repeated tests around a wave impact event it can be seen that the incident wave and global responses have a good repeatability for instance the variation of the maximum values between two repeats does not exceed 3 for all of three signals presented in fig 6 compared with global responses the wave impact load is characterized by its highly random and localized nature fig 7 presents the wave impact pressures at three different elevations clear variations can be seen between the impact pressures of the two repeated test runs especially at slam fore4 which locates in the severest impact area of this event the variations of the peak pressure at three locations are 6 116 and 8 respectively away from the severest impact point the variation decreases the non repeatability of measuring wave impact pressures is also reported in other works huang et al 2017 did 15 times repeatability tests and found a factor of 2 5 difference in the measured wave impact loads recently guidelines for evaluation of wave impact loads on column stabilized units have been developed by classification societies like the american bureau of shipping abs abs 2018 the abs guideline proposes a model for the peak impact pressure p as follows 4 p 65 5 f a f e f s h s where f a is the design factor and equals to 1 25 f e is the elevation factor f s is the shape and size factor h s is the significant wave height the value of f e can refer to the abs guideline and depends on the ratio of the vertical distance above the still water line z to the maximum relative wave elevation r m a x z r m a x the shape and size factor f s have four values for different types of structural member with the maximum being 1 and the minimum being 0 492 the quality of the experiment is checked against the abs model fig 8 compares the wave impact pressures of the event presented in figs 6 and 7 with the abs model where the lower abs prediction abs low and upper abs prediction abs up are corresponding to the maximum and the minimum f s it can be seen that the severest impact zone in this event is consistent with that predicted by the abs model 0 5 z r m a x 0 85 and the maximum peak pressure drops into the band between the lower and the upper abs predictions but at locations away from the severest impact point the abs model seems to be some conservative 3 2 typical wave impact pressures and wave profiles taking a severe wave impact event under sea state w6 as instance the snapshots and time histories of wave impact pressures are presented for better understanding the problem the snapshots shown in figs 9 and 10 give the evolution of wave profiles during the wave impact on the fore column deck side aft column and deck bottom respectively due to the curved surface of wave profile shown in fig 9 a a large air pocket was enclosed between the wave and the structure which influences the impact process significantly the whole wave impact process of this event starts from the hitting by the tongue of the breaker on the transition region between the fore column and the deck side first fig 9 b then the breaker advances leading more areas suffered from wave impact loads an obvious feature of such violent wave impact is the water jets and sprays which raise parallel to the column surface with large velocities fig 9 c and can threaten the helicopter deck a quantity of energy is taken away by this part of water turbulence dissipation during wave breaking also causes energy loss therefore the wave becomes relatively moderate and propagates forward with turbulent bores and white water exists on the foamy surface fig 10 a finally the broken wave encounters the aft column and exerts a severe impact on the corner between the aft column and the deck bottom after nonlinear wave run up fig 10 b fig 11 presents the time histories of wave impact pressures of this event at different locations the impact pressure is first detected by the lowest slam panel on the edge of the deck side slam side1 and then by the highest slam panel on the fore column slam fore5 in addition the largest wave impact pressures are also measured at these two locations from these two locations the impact pressure propagates and decreases rapidly upwards and downwards as indicated by the evolution of wave profiles during wave impact on the fore part a large volume of air is trapped the effects of the trapped air are reflected very straightforward by the damped oscillations in the pressure curves which are caused by the alternate compression and expansion of the trapped air pocket the air pocket exists over a large vertical extent since wave impact pressures on all slam panels on the fore column varies in phase the oscillation frequency in this event is about 25 hz which is consistent with experiments of similar structures in previous studies kisacik et al 2012 vestbøstad et al 2017 from fig 11 c it can be seen that the impact pressures on the edge of the deck side behave in phase to those on the fore column as shown by the sequence of time instants t1 t2 t3 t6 because they locate closely and are covered by the same air pocket the impact pressure measured by slam side1 shows arresting irregularity it is mainly because that the slam panel is hit by the tongue tip of breaker which is unstable the impact pressure on slam side4 which is on the centerline of the deck side is much smaller and emerge later than that on slam side1 due to the energy loss within the fore column impact the wave impact pressures on the aft column and the deck bottom decline a lot compared to those on the fore part but have longer duration time see fig 11 b and d the largest pressures on the aft column and the deck bottom are measured around the connection corner 3 3 probability distribution of wave impact loads on the platform the wave impact process is of high nonlinearity and is very sensitive to environmental factors such as initial water calmness trapped air shape of the wave front and so on therefore the resulting impact load shows greatly random behaviors statistical analysis is necessary to get comprehensive insights into the wave impact load and provide guidance for engineering applications fig 12 is the probability distribution of wave impact loads for all 6 sea states in terms of exceedance probability where p m a x as defined earlier is normalized by the static equivalent pressure ρ g h s the exceedance probability is defined as follows 5 p x x 1 f x x where f x x is the cumulative distribution function it can be seen that the severest wave impact event occurs under sea state w6 with the largest h s following w6 sea states w1 and w2 whose h s are the smallest ones also exert rather large wave impact loads on the semi submersible under other sea states the wave impact loads are relatively moderate especially for sea state w5 the wave height is second only to w6 and 1 76 times of that of w1 but the largest wave impact load is just about 4 3 ρ g h s only 0 31 times of 13 9 ρ g h s for w1 all of these characteristics demonstrate the highly nonlinearity of the wave impact load the frequency of wave impacts also reflects the same conclusion fig 13 shows the average number of wave impact events of 3 different intensities for each sea state firstly the largest number of wave impact events takes place under sea state w6 except w3 the numbers of wave impacts under other sea states are roughly the same and are about 40 less than w6 while for intensities p m a x 1 0 ρ g h s and p m a x 3 0 ρ g h s the trends are some different w1 and w2 are more likely to induce wave impact loads exceeding these two intensities and the numbers of wave impacts are even larger than that under w6 for sea states with wave heights between those of w2 and w6 the frequency of wave impact is lower both figs 12 and 13 indicate that the intensity and the frequency of wave impacts are not proportional to the significant wave height 3 4 overall distribution of wave impact loads among different components under head seas waves would encounter the fore column the pontoon and the aft column of the semi submersible successively furthermore it is quite possible that waves run up along the column and impact the deck bottom due to the retardation of the aft column all the fore column the deck side the aft column and the deck bottom are possible to suffer from severe wave impacts fig 14 shows the probability distribution of wave impact loads for all 6 sea states on different components of the semi submersible as the most critical among all tested sea states w6 gives rise to the largest wave impact pressures on all components except sea state w6 w1 and w2 are also responsible for severe wave impacts on the fore column and the aft column on the whole it can be seen that wave impacts on the aft column are more violent than those on the fore column for the deck bottom the wave impact loads are smaller than those on the fore column and the aft column with an exception which reaches up to 19 ρ g h s this outlier and all other wave impact loads over 5 ρ g h s are resulted from sea state w6 for the deck side the leading role of sea state w6 is more prominent from the perspective of wave impact loads and wave impact loads from other sea states are all below 2 ρ g h s it is worth noting that the wave impact loads on the deck side from w6 are of the same order of magnitude of those on the columns but the structural strength of the deck side is usually weaker therefore special care should be given to this zone in case of the occurrence of negative air gaps fig 15 presents the average number of wave impact events of 3 different intensities for each sea state on different components here the number of wave impact events on a specific component will only be counted when the wave impact loads on this component is the largest over the whole semi submersible platform sea states w1 and w2 exert numerous wave impacts on the fore column for other sea states the number of wave impacts on the fore column increases with the increase of significant wave height much different from the fore column the numbers of wave impacts on the aft column are roughly the same for all 6 sea states except w3 where the number of impacts is relatively smaller for the deck bottom a clear trend is shown that higher sea states result in larger number of wave impacts fig 15 d shows that wave impact events which exert the largest loads on the deck side come from sea state w6 entirely while those under lower sea states mainly impact other components it indicates that the largest wave impact load of a wave impact event will be detected on the deck side only when the wave height is too high to result in the occurrence of negative air gaps at the fore column nevertheless it is not excluded that wave impact events which mainly impact other components could generate rather large impact loads on the deck side further the proportion of wave impact events on different components leading to the largest loads on the semi submersible are compared in fig 16 it is clear that the proportion of wave impacts occurring on the aft column is the highest under all sea states followed by that on the fore column the deck bottom and the deck side in sequence with the increase of the significant wave height the proportion of wave impacts occurring on the aft column increases first then decreases and reaches its minimum at w6 on the contrary the proportion of wave impacts occurring on the fore column decreases first and then increases the proportion of the wave impact load on the deck bottom shows a general upward trend with increasing wave heights while the largest impact pressures are measured on the deck side only under w6 3 5 spatial variations of wave impact loads identifying the spatial distribution is an important issue in evaluating the wave impact load it helps to build the load model such as what is proposed in the otg 14 otg 14 2017 and is necessary for structural evaluation as pointed out in the instrumentation section a lot of slam panels are employed for such a purpose in this study in this section the vertical and horizontal variations of wave impact loads on different components of the semi submersible will be discussed in detail giving more attentions on severe wave impacts only wave impact pressures larger than 0 5 ρ g h s are taken into consideration except where noted to figure out the spatial variations of wave impact loads the probability distributions at different slam panels are developed first then the largest peak pressure for each slam panel is extracted to build horizontal and vertical pressure profiles on different components 3 5 1 variations on the fore column figs 17 and 18 display the probability distributions at different vertical positions and the vertical profile of wave impact loads on the fore column respectively from the probability distributions it can be seen that there exist several distinct populations e g slam fore1 under w2 and slam fore4 under w6 which may result from different physical phenomena such as breaking impact and non breaking impact johannessen et al 2017 together with the vertical pressure profile it can be revealed that wave impacts from relatively lower sea states like w1 w3 mainly focus on lower slam panels which are closer to the swl with the increase of the significant wave height the most serious impact point shifts upwards gradually a noticeable difference can be found between sea state w6 and w1 for a large floating structure the incident waves are diffracted and the structure moves under various wave loads resulting in different relative wave elevations around the structure therefore the wave impact loads could differ a lot even at the same vertical positions figs 19 and 20 present the horizontal variations of wave impact loads on the fore column for increasing sea state severity a lot of wave impact events were measured by the three slam panels located at the same height on the fore column except sea state w3 clear difference can be seen among these 3 slam panels indicating the existence of the three dimensional effect which results from diffraction motions and so on it seems that the center panel receives the severest wave impact whereas the variations of impact loads are not significant within the width of the fore column 3 5 2 variations on the aft column fig 21 shows the probability distributions of wave impact loads on the slam panels on the aft column by contrast with fig 17 it can be seen that the spatial distributions of wave impact loads on the fore column and the aft column are much different under most sea states the wave impact loads on the aft column tend to be larger in the upper part from the middle slam panel to the deck bottom it is also indicated by the vertical profile of the wave impact pressures as shown in fig 22 several reasons may contribute to the increased vulnerability of the upper part of the aft column first the submerged part of the semi submersible has important influences on the wave impact process such as wave run up along the column and the shoaling effect of the pontoon second the presence of the attached deck bottom limits the free propagation of extreme waves and water jets leading to higher impact loads at the corner between the column and the deck bottom finally the impact point is also influenced by the vertical platform motions which are mainly heave and pitch motions under the 180 wave heading 3 5 3 variations on the deck bottom furthermore the variations of wave impact loads on the deck bottom are shown in figs 23 and 24 it is very obvious that the junction of the lower deck and the aft column was hit heavily by waves with the wave impact pressures on the deck bottom peaking at slam deck1 which is closest to the aft column this slam panel stands out from the rest panels and the impact loads decline rapidly with the increasing distance between the slam panel and the aft column taking a closer look at figs 23 and 24 however it can be seen that slam deck4 which is rather far away from the aft column and is closer to the midship also receives large impact loads under some circumstances it may be from the second impact caused by accelerated water jets or due to the wave amplification caused by interactions between the fore column and the aft column 3 5 4 variations on the deck side lastly fig 25 displays the spatial distributions of wave impact loads on the deck side horizontally and vertically known from section 3 4 wave impacts on the deck side are mostly from sea state w6 and are relatively scarcer than those on columns and deck bottom therefore all wave impact loads under w6 are utilized here instead of those over 0 5 ρ g h s vertically the wave impact loads decrease with the increase of the elevation whether on the left edge or the centerline of the deck side combined with the vertical distribution on the fore column it can be concluded that the transition region between the fore column and deck side is the most dangerous area when facing very large waves leading to negative air gaps horizontally the variation within the width of the deck side is more remarkable than that within the width of the fore column wave impact loads on the left edge are almost two times larger than those on the centerline of deck side it is reasonable that the larger wave amplification due to the column and the pontoon leads to this difference 3 6 interference among different components for the tested semi submersible the overhanging part of the deck box is very small therefore the left edge of deck side can be regarded as the extension of the fore column wave impact loads on the extended fore column simply denoted by fore column below the aft column and the deck bottom are inevitable to correlate and interfere mutually to figure out the interference of wave impact loads among different components is helpful to identify the severely afflicted area and dangerous scenarios in the sense of wave impacts and further meaningful to design safer and more economical platforms it is also significant to deepen the understanding of the complex interactions between the semi submersible and extreme waves when one component encounters the maximum wave impact load the distribution of wave impact loads on other two components during the same event is a useful measure to check their interactive interference and correlation as shown in fig 26 fig 26 a and b present the distribution of wave impact loads on the aft column and the deck bottom given that the maximum load is measured on the fore column respectively it can be found that for most fore column dominating wave impact events the loads on the aft column and the deck bottom are much lower than those on the fore column but there are still some severe wave impacts occurring on the aft column and the deck bottom severe wave impacts on the aft column could be either from lower sea states w1 or higher sea states w6 while those on the deck bottom mainly come from higher sea state w6 fig 26 c and d present the results for the aft column dominating wave impact events under such circumstances wave impact loads measured on the fore column are rather small with few exceptions from sea state w6 but wave impact events from sea state w6 are certainly possible to be accompanied by severe wave impacts on the deck bottom the deck bottom dominating wave impact events are plotted in fig 26 e and f and the results are really characteristic when the maximum load is measured on the deck bottom during a wave impact event wave impact loads on the fore column and the aft column are usually significant especially wave impact loads on the aft column and those on the deck bottom form a belt around a straight line exhibiting a strong correlation also presented in fig 26 are the correlation coefficients between wave impact loads on every two components in accordance with the discussion about deck bottom dominating wave impact events the correlation coefficient between the aft column and the deck bottom is the maximum therefore for the sake of convenience the deck bottom dominating wave impact events can be reasonably regarded as a subset of the aft column dominating events the correlation coefficients for the fore column dominating wave impacts are also significant indicating these waves tend to exert impact loads on the 3 components successively in spite of intensities the smallest correlation coefficient between the fore column and the aft column under the aft column dominating wave impacts reflects that there are many waves which impact the aft column but do not impact the fore column furthermore the conditional probability p a b is evaluated to check the interference more clearly which is defined as 6 p a b p a b p b where event a denotes that the wave impact load on the non dominating component exceeds the threshold value t h 1 ρ g h s while event b denotes that the wave impact load on the dominating component does not exceed the threshold value t h 2 ρ g h s fig 27 displays the conditional probabilities p a b corresponding to the scenarios in fig 26 and exhibits several obvious features firstly the conditional probabilities p a b for all levels of t h 1 increase gradually and tend to be stable around a fixed value with the increase of t h 2 and this characteristic of the developing trend is the same for all curves in fig 27 this feature reveals that as the sample size of wave impacts on the dominating component grows the occurrence probabilities of all levels of wave impact loads on the non dominating components are convergent which guarantees the usability of the conditional probability figure in evaluating the interference secondly if we regard the threshold of a specified level of t h 1 such as 0 5 chosen in this paper as considerable wave impacts then the occurrence probability of considerable wave impacts on non dominating components can be evaluated thirdly the density of the contour line is an efficient indicator to measure the distribution of wave impact loads on non dominating components the sparsely distributed contour lines mean that the wave impact load distributes heavily there while dense contour lines indicate rapid variations and uniformly distributed contour lines correspond to uniform distribution of wave impact loads of different levels concretely it can be found that for the fore column dominating wave impacts the aft column still has a certain probability to experience considerable wave impact loads after violent wave impacts occur on the fore column while the probabilities of wave impacts on the deck bottom are much lower in addition it can be seen that most wave impacts on the aft column distribute heavily around 0 5 ρ g h s and the occurrence probability of higher wave impact loads decreases rapidly which implies that the wave energy has dissipated a lot after impacting the fore column for the aft column dominating wave impacts the conditional probabilities of suffering considerable wave impacts on both the fore column and the deck bottom are rather low it can be assumed that the incident waves for these impacts are relatively small and do not generate severe wave impacts on the fore column when passing it the sparsely distributed contour lines with small values give supplementary materials for this assumption the slightly larger probabilities for the deck bottom may be due to the wave run up effect along the aft column for the deck bottom dominating wave impacts the probability of generating considerable wave impacts on the aft column is over 80 and the roughly uniformly distributed contour lines mean that the probabilities of other levels are also large furthermore it can be deduced that waves corresponding to deck bottom dominating wave impacts are possibly rather large and steep at the fore column known from the large occurrence probabilities on the fore column 4 concluding remarks from the present experimental study the wave impact loads on a semi submersible are investigated systematically including the effect of sea state severity the comparison between different structural components and corresponding spatial distributions furthermore the interference of wave impact loads among the fore column the aft column and the deck bottom is studied in detail the wave impact loads on the semi submersible is of high nonlinearity both the intensity and impact frequency are not proportional to the sea state severity whether it is for the whole platform or a local component overall the aft column is the worst hit component followed by the fore column which encounters less wave impacts the wave impacts on the deck bottom and the deck side are relatively moderate but can be very destructive under extreme sea state especially for the deck side large waves leading to negative air gaps exert horizontal wave impact loads which are of the same order of magnitude of those on the columns vertically the severest wave impact point on the fore column shifts upwards gradually with the increase of the sea state severity while the wave impact loads on the deck side decrease with the increase of the elevation therefore the transition region between the fore column and deck side is the most dangerous area for waves impacting both the fore column and the deck side severely on the whole the upper half of the aft column experiences higher wave impact loads and deserves more attentions horizontally the variation of wave impact loads is not significant on the fore column but is remarkable within the width of deck side with impact loads on the edge of deck side larger than those on the centerline a specific conditional probability is proposed and proved to be a versatile tool for the evaluation of the interference among different components when the largest wave impact loads occur on the extended fore column the fore column and the edge of the deck side the same waves tend to exert impact events on the aft column and the deck bottom in sequence but the loads are much smaller indicating extensive loss of wave energy the aft column dominating wave impacts are mainly from relatively small waves and the impact loads among different components are weakly correlated on the contrary the wave impact loads on the aft column and the deck bottom are strongly correlated under the deck bottom dominating wave impacts and thus they can be regarded as a subset of the aft column dominating wave impact events credit authorship contribution statement yinghao guo conceptualization methodology software validation

21685,recent accidents caused by wave impact loads have attracted increasing concerns from academia and industry an experimental study was carried out to investigate the local wave impact loads on a semi submersible exposed to various sea states focusing on the spatial distributions and interference among the fore column aft column deck bottom and deck side a versatile tool based on the conditional probability is proposed and used along with correlation analyses to evaluate the interference among different components the results show that the wave impact loads on the semi submersible are of high nonlinearity and the aft column is the worst hit component where wave impacts occur most frequently the transition region between the fore column and deck side is the most dangerous area for extremely large waves while the connection corner deserves particular concerns for the aft column and the deck bottom the horizontal variation of wave impact loads is not significant on the fore column but is remarkable within the width of the deck side the interference examination reveals that wave impact loads on different components are correlated at varying levels under different wave impact scenarios the in depth analysis improves the understanding of wave impact events on multi column floating structures keywords wave impact load semi submersible interference spatial distribution experiment 1 introduction the large volume offshore structures such as semi submersibles are required to withstand various environmental loads the wave induced force is one of the most important concerns and there has been numerous studies in this field among all kinds of wave induced forces the wave impact load from extreme waves such as freak waves or breaking waves could be the most dangerous one in recent years reports on offshore structures damaged by wave impact loads are not rare szalewski et al 2017 kaiser et al 2009 buchner and voogt 2004 therefore the thorough understanding and further accurate determination of the wave impact load are indispensable to the design of offshore structures although there have been some theoretical works baarholm and faltinsen 2004 kaplan et al 1992 wagner 1932 and increasingly numerical simulations hu et al 2017 rudman and cleary 2013 pakozdi et al 2011 model tests are still the most trusted approach to estimate the wave impact load due to the complexity and high nonlinearity of the wave impact process huang et al 2015 scharnke et al 2014 kapsenberg 2011 apart from offshore platforms the problem of wave impact has attracted extensive attentions in many fields dias and ghidaglia 2018 such as the design of breakwaters ships wave energy converters and offshore wind turbine foundations with regard to the wave impact load plenty of researches have focused on cylinders plates or boxes which are treated as simplifications of these marine structures or some of their structural components chan and melville 1988 and zhou et al 1991 conducted laboratory measurements of wave impact pressures on surface piercing vertical plane walls and cylinders respectively it is found that the characteristics of wave impact pressures vary significantly due to the randomness of wave breaking and trapped air and the relative position between the structure and the wave breaking point has an important effect on the wave impact process wienke and oumeraci 2005 investigated the breaking wave forces on a slender cylinder with a large scale model test a theoretical description was developed based on the wagner theory wagner 1932 and compared with the experimental results also the effect of the yaw angle between the cylinder and the wave direction on the wave impact force was investigated compared to simple structures like cylinders large volume offshore structures are far more complex there are various hydrodynamic interactions among different components of the offshore structures with critical effects on the wave impact load such as wave run up along columns nielsen 2003 wave trapping of multi column platforms shan et al 2012 and shoaling effect of the submerged pontoon iwata et al 1997 marine accidents in recent years have attracted increasing concerns from academia and industry for column stabilized units with negative airgaps dnv gl proposed the technical guidance otg 14 to evaluate the local horizontal wave impact loads otg 14 2017 to document the structural integrity model test campaigns concerning the wave impact load were carried out vestbøstad et al 2017 huang et al 2017 lim et al 2015 these reported works put efforts into establishing probability distributions of the maximum wave impact loads and then estimating the q probability design load from the perspective of probability and statistics such systematical experimental results including distributions of local wave impact loads on different parts of structures are usually not available due to the limitation of project confidentiality requirements to provide data to validate numerical simulations abdussamie et al 2017b experimentally investigated the wave in deck impact events on a rigidly mounted tension leg platform tlp subjected to extreme wave events while the same tlp model was moored with four tendons in abdussamie et al 2017a regarding the distribution on the deck high wave in deck impact pressures were found on the forward part of the deck and on the deck column intersection areas when severe wave impacts occur on complex offshore structures wave impact loads on different components are inevitable to correlate and interfere mutually among few studies kisacik et al 2012 investigated violent wave impacts on a fixed vertical structure and attached horizontal cantilever slab it was found that the presence of a horizontal structural part increases the vulnerability of the vertical structures against violent wave impacts to the authors knowledge limited open literatures to date have been reported to focus on the interference of wave impact loads among different components especially for large floating structures the main objective of this study is to investigate the local wave impact loads on different structural components of a semi submersible including the fore column the aft column the deck bottom and the deck side to accomplish the objective an experiment of a semi submersible under a series of irregular waves was purposely carried out in deepwater offshore basin based on the experimental results comprehensive analyses of wave impact loads are conducted focusing on the effect of sea state severity the comparison between different structural components and corresponding spatial distributions in horizontal and vertical directions furthermore a method utilizing the conditional probability is proposed and used along with correlation analyses to examine the mutual interference of wave impact loads among different components 2 description of the experiment the experiment was conducted in the deep water offshore basin at shanghai jiao tong university in china the basin is 50 m in length 40 m in width and has the maximum effective water depth of 10 m with a movable false bottom to simulate different water depth various ocean environments including waves currents and winds can be simulated by using two multi flap wave generators a deepwater global current generation system and an axial wind fan matrix respectively 2 1 test model a semi submersible model composed of two pontoons four rectangular columns four circular bracings and one deck box was fabricated and installed in the basin for wave tests as shown in fig 1 the main objectives of the model test campaign are to investigate the air gap performance and the wave impact load in harsh ocean environments therefore only the survival loading condition was considered table 1 lists the main particulars and mass properties where the vertical position of the center of gravity is above base line and the reference point of the radius of gyration is the center of gravity the platform model was made of wood glass fiber and steel to satisfy the requirements of strength and was fabricated with sufficient accuracy the linear scale ratio between the model and the prototype was 1 60 during the wave tests the platform model was moored in the wave basin with a horizontal mooring system as shown in fig 2 four lines of the horizontal mooring system composed of springs and wire ropes were configured along the diagonal lines of the platform and the stiffness of each line was 64 5 n m in model scale which was considered to be soft enough to avoid influencing the wave frequency motion responses before wave tests decay tests were conducted in still water for verifying the modeling the obtained natural periods are listed in table 2 2 2 test cases the water depth is 1500 m in prototype and was set to 9 8 m in the experiment wave tests were carried out using long crest irregular waves under three wave headings namely head quartering and beam seas extensive test cases were implemented to evaluate the wave impact load on the semi submersible in order to include the governing sea state 6 sea states were chosen around the steepness limited flank of the h s t p contour as given in table 3 where h s is the significant wave height t p is the peak period γ is the peakness factor and a seed of a sea state represents an independent test the irregular waves were simulated with typical jonswap spectrum which can be written as 1 s f α h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 2 σ 0 09 for f f p 0 07 for f f p 3 α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ where f p denotes the peak frequency and σ is the spectral width parameter another recent study of the authors guo et al 2020 has investigated the effects of wave direction on wave impact loads and found that the wave impact on the semi submersible is more severe under beam seas and head seas than that in oblique seas whereas this study aims to investigate the interference of wave impact loads among different structural components of the semi submersible and this can achieved more appropriately under head seas therefore the measuring slam panels were specifically installed on the model see fig 1 and only the 23 wave test runs under head sea conditions are analyzed in the paper the duration of each irregular wave test is equivalent to 3 h in prototype excluding a run up time of 12 min in prototype before placing the platform model in the wave basin the specified wave parameters and spectrum were calibrated using a wave gauge placed at the static equilibrium position of the platform model to provide high quality input to wave tests and an example is shown in fig 3 for all the input irregular waves used in the experiment the errors in terms of hs and tp between the target and measured spectrum do not exceed 5 and 3 respectively 2 3 measuring system to measure the wave impact load the semi submersible model was instrumented with a total of 43 slam panels whose performance and reliability were demonstrated in another study by the wedge drop test guo et al 2017 they were arranged on the fore column the deck side the aft column and the deck bottom in this paper we only focus on part of them as shown in fig 1 b d fig 4 depicts the detailed locations of the concerned slam panels at full scale all the slam panels were above the still water level swl in height direction there were 5 rows of slam panels on the fore column and the aft column specially there were 3 slam panels at the third row on the fore column to check the horizontal variation of the wave impact load in addition two columns of slam panels were installed on the left edge and centerline of the deck side both of which were composed of 3 evenly distributed panels the two lowest slam panels on the deck side were 4 05 m above the highest one of the fore column to measure wave in deck impact loads due to waves exceeding the available freeboard or wave run up along the aft column 5 slam panels were installed on the deck bottom along the length direction the spacing between adjacent slam panels on the columns and the deck side was 2 7 m center to center while it was 3 3 m for the deck bottom each slam panel consisted of a strain gauge force transducer kyowa lux b 100n id and a sensing plate made of acrylic glass which was 2 0 cm 2 0 cm in model scale and was enough light to minimize the panel dynamic effects the force transducer has the rated capacity of 100 n and the natural frequency of about 11 khz the measurement of wave impact loads by force transducers has been successfully attempted by a few published works kim et al 2019 vestbøstad et al 2017 huang et al 2015 to reduce hydro elastic effects steel base plates were buried into the test model on which slam panels were installed after being installed on the semi model the slam panels were attached with watertight films for waterproofing fig 5 presents the prepared model hammer tests were conducted to check the effect of noise and to qualify the slam panels the natural frequencies of the slam panels were found to be around 4000 hz and the noise was negligible due to the short duration of the wave impact load a high speed data acquisition system hbm gen3i was employed to record wave impact loads with a sampling frequency of 20 000 hz and an anti alias filter of 5000 hz was used before sampling 3 results and discussion to present the experimental results several notations associated with wave impact pressures within a wave impact event are introduced and explained as following p the peak pressure recorded by each slam panel p m a x the largest peak pressure among all slam panels on the whole platform p m a x f o r e p m a x a f t p m a x b o t t o m p m a x s i d e the largest peak pressure among slam panels on the fore column aft column deck bottom and deck side respectively 3 1 uncertainty analyses to check the repeatability of the test and assess the uncertainty a realization of sea state w6 was run repeatedly two times fig 6 a c present the time histories of the wave mooring force and surge motion of the repeated tests around a wave impact event it can be seen that the incident wave and global responses have a good repeatability for instance the variation of the maximum values between two repeats does not exceed 3 for all of three signals presented in fig 6 compared with global responses the wave impact load is characterized by its highly random and localized nature fig 7 presents the wave impact pressures at three different elevations clear variations can be seen between the impact pressures of the two repeated test runs especially at slam fore4 which locates in the severest impact area of this event the variations of the peak pressure at three locations are 6 116 and 8 respectively away from the severest impact point the variation decreases the non repeatability of measuring wave impact pressures is also reported in other works huang et al 2017 did 15 times repeatability tests and found a factor of 2 5 difference in the measured wave impact loads recently guidelines for evaluation of wave impact loads on column stabilized units have been developed by classification societies like the american bureau of shipping abs abs 2018 the abs guideline proposes a model for the peak impact pressure p as follows 4 p 65 5 f a f e f s h s where f a is the design factor and equals to 1 25 f e is the elevation factor f s is the shape and size factor h s is the significant wave height the value of f e can refer to the abs guideline and depends on the ratio of the vertical distance above the still water line z to the maximum relative wave elevation r m a x z r m a x the shape and size factor f s have four values for different types of structural member with the maximum being 1 and the minimum being 0 492 the quality of the experiment is checked against the abs model fig 8 compares the wave impact pressures of the event presented in figs 6 and 7 with the abs model where the lower abs prediction abs low and upper abs prediction abs up are corresponding to the maximum and the minimum f s it can be seen that the severest impact zone in this event is consistent with that predicted by the abs model 0 5 z r m a x 0 85 and the maximum peak pressure drops into the band between the lower and the upper abs predictions but at locations away from the severest impact point the abs model seems to be some conservative 3 2 typical wave impact pressures and wave profiles taking a severe wave impact event under sea state w6 as instance the snapshots and time histories of wave impact pressures are presented for better understanding the problem the snapshots shown in figs 9 and 10 give the evolution of wave profiles during the wave impact on the fore column deck side aft column and deck bottom respectively due to the curved surface of wave profile shown in fig 9 a a large air pocket was enclosed between the wave and the structure which influences the impact process significantly the whole wave impact process of this event starts from the hitting by the tongue of the breaker on the transition region between the fore column and the deck side first fig 9 b then the breaker advances leading more areas suffered from wave impact loads an obvious feature of such violent wave impact is the water jets and sprays which raise parallel to the column surface with large velocities fig 9 c and can threaten the helicopter deck a quantity of energy is taken away by this part of water turbulence dissipation during wave breaking also causes energy loss therefore the wave becomes relatively moderate and propagates forward with turbulent bores and white water exists on the foamy surface fig 10 a finally the broken wave encounters the aft column and exerts a severe impact on the corner between the aft column and the deck bottom after nonlinear wave run up fig 10 b fig 11 presents the time histories of wave impact pressures of this event at different locations the impact pressure is first detected by the lowest slam panel on the edge of the deck side slam side1 and then by the highest slam panel on the fore column slam fore5 in addition the largest wave impact pressures are also measured at these two locations from these two locations the impact pressure propagates and decreases rapidly upwards and downwards as indicated by the evolution of wave profiles during wave impact on the fore part a large volume of air is trapped the effects of the trapped air are reflected very straightforward by the damped oscillations in the pressure curves which are caused by the alternate compression and expansion of the trapped air pocket the air pocket exists over a large vertical extent since wave impact pressures on all slam panels on the fore column varies in phase the oscillation frequency in this event is about 25 hz which is consistent with experiments of similar structures in previous studies kisacik et al 2012 vestbøstad et al 2017 from fig 11 c it can be seen that the impact pressures on the edge of the deck side behave in phase to those on the fore column as shown by the sequence of time instants t1 t2 t3 t6 because they locate closely and are covered by the same air pocket the impact pressure measured by slam side1 shows arresting irregularity it is mainly because that the slam panel is hit by the tongue tip of breaker which is unstable the impact pressure on slam side4 which is on the centerline of the deck side is much smaller and emerge later than that on slam side1 due to the energy loss within the fore column impact the wave impact pressures on the aft column and the deck bottom decline a lot compared to those on the fore part but have longer duration time see fig 11 b and d the largest pressures on the aft column and the deck bottom are measured around the connection corner 3 3 probability distribution of wave impact loads on the platform the wave impact process is of high nonlinearity and is very sensitive to environmental factors such as initial water calmness trapped air shape of the wave front and so on therefore the resulting impact load shows greatly random behaviors statistical analysis is necessary to get comprehensive insights into the wave impact load and provide guidance for engineering applications fig 12 is the probability distribution of wave impact loads for all 6 sea states in terms of exceedance probability where p m a x as defined earlier is normalized by the static equivalent pressure ρ g h s the exceedance probability is defined as follows 5 p x x 1 f x x where f x x is the cumulative distribution function it can be seen that the severest wave impact event occurs under sea state w6 with the largest h s following w6 sea states w1 and w2 whose h s are the smallest ones also exert rather large wave impact loads on the semi submersible under other sea states the wave impact loads are relatively moderate especially for sea state w5 the wave height is second only to w6 and 1 76 times of that of w1 but the largest wave impact load is just about 4 3 ρ g h s only 0 31 times of 13 9 ρ g h s for w1 all of these characteristics demonstrate the highly nonlinearity of the wave impact load the frequency of wave impacts also reflects the same conclusion fig 13 shows the average number of wave impact events of 3 different intensities for each sea state firstly the largest number of wave impact events takes place under sea state w6 except w3 the numbers of wave impacts under other sea states are roughly the same and are about 40 less than w6 while for intensities p m a x 1 0 ρ g h s and p m a x 3 0 ρ g h s the trends are some different w1 and w2 are more likely to induce wave impact loads exceeding these two intensities and the numbers of wave impacts are even larger than that under w6 for sea states with wave heights between those of w2 and w6 the frequency of wave impact is lower both figs 12 and 13 indicate that the intensity and the frequency of wave impacts are not proportional to the significant wave height 3 4 overall distribution of wave impact loads among different components under head seas waves would encounter the fore column the pontoon and the aft column of the semi submersible successively furthermore it is quite possible that waves run up along the column and impact the deck bottom due to the retardation of the aft column all the fore column the deck side the aft column and the deck bottom are possible to suffer from severe wave impacts fig 14 shows the probability distribution of wave impact loads for all 6 sea states on different components of the semi submersible as the most critical among all tested sea states w6 gives rise to the largest wave impact pressures on all components except sea state w6 w1 and w2 are also responsible for severe wave impacts on the fore column and the aft column on the whole it can be seen that wave impacts on the aft column are more violent than those on the fore column for the deck bottom the wave impact loads are smaller than those on the fore column and the aft column with an exception which reaches up to 19 ρ g h s this outlier and all other wave impact loads over 5 ρ g h s are resulted from sea state w6 for the deck side the leading role of sea state w6 is more prominent from the perspective of wave impact loads and wave impact loads from other sea states are all below 2 ρ g h s it is worth noting that the wave impact loads on the deck side from w6 are of the same order of magnitude of those on the columns but the structural strength of the deck side is usually weaker therefore special care should be given to this zone in case of the occurrence of negative air gaps fig 15 presents the average number of wave impact events of 3 different intensities for each sea state on different components here the number of wave impact events on a specific component will only be counted when the wave impact loads on this component is the largest over the whole semi submersible platform sea states w1 and w2 exert numerous wave impacts on the fore column for other sea states the number of wave impacts on the fore column increases with the increase of significant wave height much different from the fore column the numbers of wave impacts on the aft column are roughly the same for all 6 sea states except w3 where the number of impacts is relatively smaller for the deck bottom a clear trend is shown that higher sea states result in larger number of wave impacts fig 15 d shows that wave impact events which exert the largest loads on the deck side come from sea state w6 entirely while those under lower sea states mainly impact other components it indicates that the largest wave impact load of a wave impact event will be detected on the deck side only when the wave height is too high to result in the occurrence of negative air gaps at the fore column nevertheless it is not excluded that wave impact events which mainly impact other components could generate rather large impact loads on the deck side further the proportion of wave impact events on different components leading to the largest loads on the semi submersible are compared in fig 16 it is clear that the proportion of wave impacts occurring on the aft column is the highest under all sea states followed by that on the fore column the deck bottom and the deck side in sequence with the increase of the significant wave height the proportion of wave impacts occurring on the aft column increases first then decreases and reaches its minimum at w6 on the contrary the proportion of wave impacts occurring on the fore column decreases first and then increases the proportion of the wave impact load on the deck bottom shows a general upward trend with increasing wave heights while the largest impact pressures are measured on the deck side only under w6 3 5 spatial variations of wave impact loads identifying the spatial distribution is an important issue in evaluating the wave impact load it helps to build the load model such as what is proposed in the otg 14 otg 14 2017 and is necessary for structural evaluation as pointed out in the instrumentation section a lot of slam panels are employed for such a purpose in this study in this section the vertical and horizontal variations of wave impact loads on different components of the semi submersible will be discussed in detail giving more attentions on severe wave impacts only wave impact pressures larger than 0 5 ρ g h s are taken into consideration except where noted to figure out the spatial variations of wave impact loads the probability distributions at different slam panels are developed first then the largest peak pressure for each slam panel is extracted to build horizontal and vertical pressure profiles on different components 3 5 1 variations on the fore column figs 17 and 18 display the probability distributions at different vertical positions and the vertical profile of wave impact loads on the fore column respectively from the probability distributions it can be seen that there exist several distinct populations e g slam fore1 under w2 and slam fore4 under w6 which may result from different physical phenomena such as breaking impact and non breaking impact johannessen et al 2017 together with the vertical pressure profile it can be revealed that wave impacts from relatively lower sea states like w1 w3 mainly focus on lower slam panels which are closer to the swl with the increase of the significant wave height the most serious impact point shifts upwards gradually a noticeable difference can be found between sea state w6 and w1 for a large floating structure the incident waves are diffracted and the structure moves under various wave loads resulting in different relative wave elevations around the structure therefore the wave impact loads could differ a lot even at the same vertical positions figs 19 and 20 present the horizontal variations of wave impact loads on the fore column for increasing sea state severity a lot of wave impact events were measured by the three slam panels located at the same height on the fore column except sea state w3 clear difference can be seen among these 3 slam panels indicating the existence of the three dimensional effect which results from diffraction motions and so on it seems that the center panel receives the severest wave impact whereas the variations of impact loads are not significant within the width of the fore column 3 5 2 variations on the aft column fig 21 shows the probability distributions of wave impact loads on the slam panels on the aft column by contrast with fig 17 it can be seen that the spatial distributions of wave impact loads on the fore column and the aft column are much different under most sea states the wave impact loads on the aft column tend to be larger in the upper part from the middle slam panel to the deck bottom it is also indicated by the vertical profile of the wave impact pressures as shown in fig 22 several reasons may contribute to the increased vulnerability of the upper part of the aft column first the submerged part of the semi submersible has important influences on the wave impact process such as wave run up along the column and the shoaling effect of the pontoon second the presence of the attached deck bottom limits the free propagation of extreme waves and water jets leading to higher impact loads at the corner between the column and the deck bottom finally the impact point is also influenced by the vertical platform motions which are mainly heave and pitch motions under the 180 wave heading 3 5 3 variations on the deck bottom furthermore the variations of wave impact loads on the deck bottom are shown in figs 23 and 24 it is very obvious that the junction of the lower deck and the aft column was hit heavily by waves with the wave impact pressures on the deck bottom peaking at slam deck1 which is closest to the aft column this slam panel stands out from the rest panels and the impact loads decline rapidly with the increasing distance between the slam panel and the aft column taking a closer look at figs 23 and 24 however it can be seen that slam deck4 which is rather far away from the aft column and is closer to the midship also receives large impact loads under some circumstances it may be from the second impact caused by accelerated water jets or due to the wave amplification caused by interactions between the fore column and the aft column 3 5 4 variations on the deck side lastly fig 25 displays the spatial distributions of wave impact loads on the deck side horizontally and vertically known from section 3 4 wave impacts on the deck side are mostly from sea state w6 and are relatively scarcer than those on columns and deck bottom therefore all wave impact loads under w6 are utilized here instead of those over 0 5 ρ g h s vertically the wave impact loads decrease with the increase of the elevation whether on the left edge or the centerline of the deck side combined with the vertical distribution on the fore column it can be concluded that the transition region between the fore column and deck side is the most dangerous area when facing very large waves leading to negative air gaps horizontally the variation within the width of the deck side is more remarkable than that within the width of the fore column wave impact loads on the left edge are almost two times larger than those on the centerline of deck side it is reasonable that the larger wave amplification due to the column and the pontoon leads to this difference 3 6 interference among different components for the tested semi submersible the overhanging part of the deck box is very small therefore the left edge of deck side can be regarded as the extension of the fore column wave impact loads on the extended fore column simply denoted by fore column below the aft column and the deck bottom are inevitable to correlate and interfere mutually to figure out the interference of wave impact loads among different components is helpful to identify the severely afflicted area and dangerous scenarios in the sense of wave impacts and further meaningful to design safer and more economical platforms it is also significant to deepen the understanding of the complex interactions between the semi submersible and extreme waves when one component encounters the maximum wave impact load the distribution of wave impact loads on other two components during the same event is a useful measure to check their interactive interference and correlation as shown in fig 26 fig 26 a and b present the distribution of wave impact loads on the aft column and the deck bottom given that the maximum load is measured on the fore column respectively it can be found that for most fore column dominating wave impact events the loads on the aft column and the deck bottom are much lower than those on the fore column but there are still some severe wave impacts occurring on the aft column and the deck bottom severe wave impacts on the aft column could be either from lower sea states w1 or higher sea states w6 while those on the deck bottom mainly come from higher sea state w6 fig 26 c and d present the results for the aft column dominating wave impact events under such circumstances wave impact loads measured on the fore column are rather small with few exceptions from sea state w6 but wave impact events from sea state w6 are certainly possible to be accompanied by severe wave impacts on the deck bottom the deck bottom dominating wave impact events are plotted in fig 26 e and f and the results are really characteristic when the maximum load is measured on the deck bottom during a wave impact event wave impact loads on the fore column and the aft column are usually significant especially wave impact loads on the aft column and those on the deck bottom form a belt around a straight line exhibiting a strong correlation also presented in fig 26 are the correlation coefficients between wave impact loads on every two components in accordance with the discussion about deck bottom dominating wave impact events the correlation coefficient between the aft column and the deck bottom is the maximum therefore for the sake of convenience the deck bottom dominating wave impact events can be reasonably regarded as a subset of the aft column dominating events the correlation coefficients for the fore column dominating wave impacts are also significant indicating these waves tend to exert impact loads on the 3 components successively in spite of intensities the smallest correlation coefficient between the fore column and the aft column under the aft column dominating wave impacts reflects that there are many waves which impact the aft column but do not impact the fore column furthermore the conditional probability p a b is evaluated to check the interference more clearly which is defined as 6 p a b p a b p b where event a denotes that the wave impact load on the non dominating component exceeds the threshold value t h 1 ρ g h s while event b denotes that the wave impact load on the dominating component does not exceed the threshold value t h 2 ρ g h s fig 27 displays the conditional probabilities p a b corresponding to the scenarios in fig 26 and exhibits several obvious features firstly the conditional probabilities p a b for all levels of t h 1 increase gradually and tend to be stable around a fixed value with the increase of t h 2 and this characteristic of the developing trend is the same for all curves in fig 27 this feature reveals that as the sample size of wave impacts on the dominating component grows the occurrence probabilities of all levels of wave impact loads on the non dominating components are convergent which guarantees the usability of the conditional probability figure in evaluating the interference secondly if we regard the threshold of a specified level of t h 1 such as 0 5 chosen in this paper as considerable wave impacts then the occurrence probability of considerable wave impacts on non dominating components can be evaluated thirdly the density of the contour line is an efficient indicator to measure the distribution of wave impact loads on non dominating components the sparsely distributed contour lines mean that the wave impact load distributes heavily there while dense contour lines indicate rapid variations and uniformly distributed contour lines correspond to uniform distribution of wave impact loads of different levels concretely it can be found that for the fore column dominating wave impacts the aft column still has a certain probability to experience considerable wave impact loads after violent wave impacts occur on the fore column while the probabilities of wave impacts on the deck bottom are much lower in addition it can be seen that most wave impacts on the aft column distribute heavily around 0 5 ρ g h s and the occurrence probability of higher wave impact loads decreases rapidly which implies that the wave energy has dissipated a lot after impacting the fore column for the aft column dominating wave impacts the conditional probabilities of suffering considerable wave impacts on both the fore column and the deck bottom are rather low it can be assumed that the incident waves for these impacts are relatively small and do not generate severe wave impacts on the fore column when passing it the sparsely distributed contour lines with small values give supplementary materials for this assumption the slightly larger probabilities for the deck bottom may be due to the wave run up effect along the aft column for the deck bottom dominating wave impacts the probability of generating considerable wave impacts on the aft column is over 80 and the roughly uniformly distributed contour lines mean that the probabilities of other levels are also large furthermore it can be deduced that waves corresponding to deck bottom dominating wave impacts are possibly rather large and steep at the fore column known from the large occurrence probabilities on the fore column 4 concluding remarks from the present experimental study the wave impact loads on a semi submersible are investigated systematically including the effect of sea state severity the comparison between different structural components and corresponding spatial distributions furthermore the interference of wave impact loads among the fore column the aft column and the deck bottom is studied in detail the wave impact loads on the semi submersible is of high nonlinearity both the intensity and impact frequency are not proportional to the sea state severity whether it is for the whole platform or a local component overall the aft column is the worst hit component followed by the fore column which encounters less wave impacts the wave impacts on the deck bottom and the deck side are relatively moderate but can be very destructive under extreme sea state especially for the deck side large waves leading to negative air gaps exert horizontal wave impact loads which are of the same order of magnitude of those on the columns vertically the severest wave impact point on the fore column shifts upwards gradually with the increase of the sea state severity while the wave impact loads on the deck side decrease with the increase of the elevation therefore the transition region between the fore column and deck side is the most dangerous area for waves impacting both the fore column and the deck side severely on the whole the upper half of the aft column experiences higher wave impact loads and deserves more attentions horizontally the variation of wave impact loads is not significant on the fore column but is remarkable within the width of deck side with impact loads on the edge of deck side larger than those on the centerline a specific conditional probability is proposed and proved to be a versatile tool for the evaluation of the interference among different components when the largest wave impact loads occur on the extended fore column the fore column and the edge of the deck side the same waves tend to exert impact events on the aft column and the deck bottom in sequence but the loads are much smaller indicating extensive loss of wave energy the aft column dominating wave impacts are mainly from relatively small waves and the impact loads among different components are weakly correlated on the contrary the wave impact loads on the aft column and the deck bottom are strongly correlated under the deck bottom dominating wave impacts and thus they can be regarded as a subset of the aft column dominating wave impact events credit authorship contribution statement yinghao guo conceptualization methodology software validation

21686,thanks to high lift to drag ratios hydrofoils are of great interest for high speed vessels modern sailing yachts fitted with foils have thus reached impressively high speeds on the water but this hydrodynamic efficiency is achieved at the expense of stability accurate tradeoffs are therefore needed to ensure both performance and safety while usual velocity prediction programs vpps are inadequate to assess dynamic stability the varying nature of the offshore racing environment further complicates the task dynamic simulation in the time domain is thus necessary to help architects assess their designs this paper presents a system based numerical tool which aims at predicting the dynamic behavior of offshore sailing yachts a 6 degrees of freedom dof algorithm is used calculating loads as a superposition of several components hull appendage sails part of them are computed at runtime while the others use pre computed dataset allowing a good compromise between efficiency and flexibility three 6dof simulations of an existing offshore trimaran a maneuver unsteady wind conditions and quartering seas are presented they underline the interest of dynamic studies demonstrating how important the yacht state history is to the understanding of her instantaneous behavior and showing that dynamic simulations open a different field of optimization than vpps graphical abstract

twa true wind angle twd true wind direction relative to north tws true wind speed vpp velocity prediction program 1 introduction the need for dynamic simulation is growing in many fields of engineering as it allows to test and compare prototypes and processes at much lower costs than actual full scale tests naval architecture is no exception nowadays it widely relies on velocity prediction programs vpps to help architects and engineers in the design process of sailing yachts however vpps have proved inadequate to optimize all of the design parameters originally introduced by kerwin 1978 vpps are constrained non linear steady state optimizers which based on experimental numerical or empirical data enable boat settings optimization to derive the reachable speeds in given steady conditions unlike inshore yachts such as the ac45 or the ac75 where class rules limit the acceptable wind and waves conditions offshore vessels may encounter rough sea and wind conditions with short characteristic time of evolution in such unsteady environments racing yachts may be compelled to sail at much lower speed than the steady state optimized values assessing the boat real performance and her ability to safely maintain high average speeds in varying conditions is therefore a key measure of her racing efficiency and should be included in the design trade offs in addition recent years have seen a substantial growth of foiling technologies leading to fully flying yachts and introducing specific stability issues with direct impact on average speed a better knowledge of the dynamic response of flying yachts is paramount for safe and sustained offshore flight non linear couplings between the different degrees of freedom further complicate the study and traditional vpps have proven inadequate to handle these matters with the accuracy required for high performance sailing in this context numerical tools enabling time domain analysis and including unsteady environment often called dynamic velocity prediction programs dvpps have become a major research topic this paper is interested in such a simulation tool handling variable wind and waves as well as mode transition between archimedean and fully flying conditions section 2 presents a literature review on yacht dynamic simulation the mathematical modeling is given in section 3 section 4 presents and analyzes three examples of dynamic simulation performed with the developed numerical tool 2 sailing yacht dynamic simulation the ability to simulate maneuvers and especially tacking has long been the main subject of sailing dynamic studies masuyama et al 1995 keuning et al 2005 gerhardt et al 2009 in match racing maneuvers are critical and simulations provide an efficient way for designers as well as crew to improve the on water results binns et al 2008 as match racing competitions are generally run inshore sheltered from the deep water waves and due to the complexity of waves effect the first numerical tools considered flat water conditions most of these works are based on the usual maneuvering approach abkowitz 1964 in which loads are described using hydrodynamic derivatives a taylor series expansion of the forces with respect to all the involved parameters attitudes sinkage speed components such models allowed the study of the three or four degrees of freedom dofs boat motion surge sway yaw and sometimes roll nevertheless foiling greatly enhances the need to factor in the two other degrees of freedom as heave flight height and trim appendages angles of attack are now at the core of boat stability heppel 2015 full 6 degrees of freedom modeling is therefore needed introduction of time domain studies in the design of racing yachts occurred for the victorious 26th america s cup challenger stars and stripes see oliver et al 1987 using a quasi steady approach velocity prediction program results were combined with wind statistics and game theory to simulate match races between several candidates and isolate the best performing design based on the widely used steady state models of the ims vpp claughton 1999 the four degrees of freedom program of larsson 1990 included a first account of wave effects by computing added resistance through strip theory masuyama et al 1993 1995 developed a numerical tool based on hydrodynamic derivatives computed from tank tests and aerodynamic coefficients derived from wind tunnel measurements comparison of their 4 degrees of freedom results with full scale measurements proved successful in the second paper masuyama et al 1995 reported on the substantial role of sails in roll damping and proposed a strip theory model ignoring three dimensional effects keuning et al 2005 enlarged the possibilities and modularity of such tools by introducing the use of delft systematic yacht hull series dsyhs to compute the hydrodynamic coefficients while comparison with full scale tests showed good agreement the weaknesses of the aerodynamic model based on the ims vpp is nevertheless underlined by the authors to the author s knowledge day et al 2002 were the first to report on a 6 degrees of freedom time domain simulation tool the program used the delft systematic yacht hull series for the hydrodynamic loads and the ims vpp quasi steady approach for sail forces comparison with full scale data showed good trends although the author underlined some discrepancies a few years later harris 2005 proposed another numerical tool to simulate the upwind behavior of sailing yachts maneuvering loads were computed through a panel code while radiation and diffraction loads were expressed from strip theory a strip theory approach was also used for the aerodynamic loads on the other hand constant improvements of computational power have opened the possibility to use cfd for time domain simulation by directly coupling the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes flow solvers with rigid body dynamic solvers jacquin et al 2005 roux et al 2008 lindstrand levin and larsson 2017 such approaches enable great accuracy while eliminating the need for empirical data or numerical pre computations the use of cfd as numerical vpp was achieved and work is now undertaken to add unsteady environment nevertheless the computational time and costs of such techniques make them currently unavailable for naval architects when the comparison of several designs and configurations is needed system based approaches on the contrary use empirical and theoretical models experimental results or pre computed numerical data to derive the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads and model the boat global behavior horel 2016 2019 with a computational efficiency that enables systematic studies of appendages shapes and configurations for instance this paper presents therefore a system based approach to the time domain simulation of sailing yachts see fig 1 due to the importance of the sea state on offshore yachts performance the model was built to account for wave loads and thus enables the improvement of the yacht response besides to allow an accurate optimization of foiling yachts the numerical tool handles motion in the six degrees of freedom unlike most of the cited papers it has been chosen to handle maneuvering loads not by taylor expansions or semi empirical formula but using interpolated computational fluid dynamics cfd data to increase accuracy the numerical models are presented in the following section 3 mathematical modeling this section presents the models implemented in the simulation tool to compute the loads of each yacht component and derive the ship motion 3 1 dynamics the developed numerical tool is based on the time domain integration of the 6 degrees of freedom rigid body motion equations derived from the conservation of linear and angular momentum in the non inertial ship fixed reference frame 1 m v ω og ω v ω og f i ω m og v ω i ω m og ω v m where v and ω are the ship linear and angular velocity vectors and v ω their time derivatives f m are the external forces and moments acting on the yacht and m i her mass and inertia at the origin o of the ship reference frame g is the body s center of gravity unlike conventional boats sailing yachts loading conditions are generally asymmetric to increase the righting moment water ballast canting keel equipment windward stacking therefore no assumption is made hereafter on the values of the products of inertia of i or on the transverse coordinate of og the ship fixed reference frame r b x b y b z b is defined with x b positive direction forwards y b to port and z b upwards see fig 2 its orientation with respect to the earth fixed inertial reference frame r 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is expressed using the usual gimbal angles φ θ ψ roll pitch and yaw the rotation matrix from the ship fixed reference frame r b to the earth fixed one r 0 is given by 2 r r b r 0 cos ψ cos θ cos ψ sin θ sin φ sin ψ cos φ cos ψ sin θ cos φ sin ψ sin φ sin ψ cos θ sin ψ sin θ sin φ cos ψ cos φ sin ψ sin θ cos φ cos ψ sin φ sin θ cos θ sin φ cos θ cos φ thus vectors x b expressed in the body reference frame are transformed into the earth fixed frame using x 0 r r b r 0 x b the angular velocity vector ω in r b are linked to the derivatives of the gimbal angles by the following expression 3 1 sin φ tan θ cos ϕ tan θ 0 cos φ sin φ 0 sin φ cos θ cos φ cos θ ω φ θ ψ which presents a singularity for θ π 2 this is however not an issue in normal sailing conditions several explicit numerical integration schemes with various orders are available as well as adaptive time stepping methods which enable computational time optimization in practice with a small enough time step we experienced that the choice of integration scheme had no or very limited impact on the result external loads are expressed as a superposition of all boat loaded components and can be divided in three main groups hull loads h appendage loads ap and aerodynamic loads ae 4 f f h f ap f ae i j h a p a e f i j r r 0 r b m g with g the gravity vector the three main components are detailed in the following sections f i j is the interaction term of component i over component j as in the majority of system based models most of those interactions are neglected however depending on the setups chosen by the user in the pre computation steps some of them may be accounted for such as the interaction between hull and appendages forces f ap h for instance 3 2 hull loads hydrodynamic loads on the hull can be split in low frequency maneuvering and high frequency seakeeping radiation and waves loads 3 2 1 maneuvering loads instead of the usual hydrodynamic derivatives approach abkowitz 1964 for the maneuvering forces the dynamic simulation tool uses polynomial response surfaces based on numerical viscous computations rans which allow to decrease the computation burden the response surfaces are built on steady state calculations over an appropriate range of hull attitude sinkage leeway angle and speed which are then the input variables to the polynomial fit the computations are carried out in flat water conditions and the hydrostatic components of the loads are removed so that they are only accounted once when integrating over the wetted surface due to the incoming wave field it enables a full modeling of the six components of the hydrodynamic loads on each hull including dependency to the boat possible changes of attitude and displacement due to the effect of appendages 3 2 2 radiation force the higher frequency loads are based on the classical distinction between radiation diffraction and froude krylov forces the former considers damping and added mass effects due to radiated waves generated by ship oscillations at the free surface they are computed in the frequency domain using the boundary element method bem code aquaplus delhommeau 1987 developed at the ecole centrale de nantes transformation of these frequency domain coefficients to the time domain is carried out through cummins equation cummins 1962 convolving the impulse response function k with the hull velocity 5 f rd a u ξ b u ξ 0 t k t τ u ξ τ d τ where f rd is the radiation force a u and b u the added mass and damping at infinite frequency and mean speed u and ξ the ship perturbation vector k is given by the inverse fourier transform of the frequency dependent damping component 6 k t u 2 π 0 b ω u b u cos ω t d ω with ω the frequency domain variable 3 2 3 wave loads as this simulation model is concerned with offshore yachts only deep water waves are considered diffraction loads are the first wave excitation force component they originate in the reflection of the incident waves on the ship surface similarly they are linearly modeled through the seakeeping code outputs but directly using the frequency domain expression 7 f df a f d ω e cos k x ω t φ d ω e where f df is the diffraction force f d and φ d its modulus and phase x the ship abscissa along the wave propagation axis k the wave number and a its amplitude ω e is the frequency of encounter which for linear waves is given by 8 ω e ω ω 2 g u cos μ with μ the angle between the ship track and the wave propagation and u the yacht speed finally froude krylov force f fk gathers the loads of the incident wave pressure field p i on the instantaneous ship wetted surface s w 9 f fk s w p i n d s where n is the outward unit normal vector to the body surface p i is expressed through potential flow theory of gravity waves 10 p i ρ φ i t 1 2 φ i 2 with ρ the fluid density and φ i the incident waves potential while computing froude krylov force a correction of the hydrostatic loads is also performed to account for the deformation of the free surface 3 3 appendage loads appendage loads are in a first approach modeled using a vortex lattice method vlm see for instance katz and plotkin 2001 with correction for viscous effects this provides a numerically efficient way to compute the spanwise distribution of lift for lifting surfaces of any aspect ratio dihedral and sweep assuming that the appendages are not located in the wake of one another their interaction is currently neglected velocity induced by the yacht angular motion wave velocity field and appendage trimming angles are accounted for by computing effective angles between the appendage and the incoming flow following the quasi steady theory qst approach to compute the apparent flow velocity vector 11 v x flow v ω x v w a v e where x is the coordinate vector of the considered location and v w a v e is the wave orbital velocity vector the vortex lattice method provides the full 6 components load tensor of each appendages also the forces and moments generated by the appendages are accounted for loads are computed for each appendage without assuming any symmetry in the setup so that asymmetric attitudes are reflected in the computed forces and moments and that windward and leeward appendages can be tuned differently the reduced frequency f r provides an interesting measure of the importance of dynamic effects on a hydrofoil it may be expressed as 12 f r c v x flow t where c is the foil characteristic chord length and t the characteristic period of the oscillations in waves it is typically the period of encounter according to fossati and muggiasca 2011 who cite previous references the unsteadiness of the flow must be accounted for when reduced frequencies are larger than 0 05 in such cases the temporal variations of the generated vortices and the added mass effects become non negligible specific behaviors such as hysteresis loops are observed in the considered situation the reduced frequency encountered by the appendages are expected to be smaller especially because of their relatively small chord length 3 4 aerodynamic loads similarly the aerodynamic models are based on the usual quasi steady theory assumption see richardt et al 2005 keuning et al 2005 specifically steady state sail polars ranse calculations including the three dimensional position of the center of effort are used while the apparent wind calculation accounts for the heel angle effective angle theory see e g kerwin 1978 and the induced velocity due to the yacht angular motion sail forces are assumed to lie in a plane perpendicular to the mast at the height and longitudinal position given by the position of the center of effort c thus in the boat reference frame the sails force vector is given by 13 f sails 1 2 ρ a i r s sails aws 2 c d cos awa c l sin awa c l cos awa c d sin awa 0 where c l and c d are the three dimensional lift and drag coefficients of the sails given by the polar ρ air the air density and s sails the sails total area aws and awa are respectively the apparent wind speed and angle the force vector is then displaced to the yacht center of gravity g to express the aerodynamic moments 14 m sails g gc f sails the sail polars are built by finding the optimum sail parameters that maximize the driving force possibly under heeling moment or side force constraints the de powering of this optimally trimmed sail plan is modeled through the ims vpp approach claughton 1999 jackson 2001 using the flat sail lift reduction and twist center of effort lowering parameters there is no need for a reef parameter as different polars are used when the sail configuration is altered change of head sail or reef seakeeping studies of sailing yachts have shown that the transverse aerodynamic inertia provided by the sailplan has a substantial impact on the yacht response especially in roll in order to account for this phenomenon the method described in gerhardt et al 2009 is implemented the sails added mass is approximated using a strip theory approach and integrating the potential flow expression of the added mass of a flat plate along the sail surface the work of tuckerman 1926 is used to derive a three dimensional effect factor that proved rather consistent when compared to experimental measurements on a model sail by gerhardt et al 2009 as was shown by fossati and muggiasca 2011 gerhardt et al 2011 and augier et al 2014 such simple models do not fully reproduce the unsteady aerodynamic behavior of sails and especially hysteresis phenomena further work still needs to be carried out to integrate such aspects in dvpps if higher relative frequencies are to be considered finally windage is modeled using reference drag areas in a similar manner as the ims vpp 3 5 control systems class rules on yacht control systems are a key issue in the future of high performance sailing especially offshore sportsmanship human safety energy consumption financial costs are intimately linked to the decision to authorize them on board or not for the time being the ultim class 32 23 does not allow control system other than the helm autopilot as this paper is concerned with the simulation of an offshore trimaran complying with these class rules no control system of foils or centerboard is enabled and therefore no control of heel pitch or ride height unlike dinghies moths or america s cup catamarans ultim trimarans take advantage of their substantial inertia which enables them to go through limited changes of the environmental conditions wind gusts for instance without immediate capsize the autopilot is an usual proportional derivative controller 15 δ r k p ψ ψ t k p t d ψ where δ r rudder angle ψ t targeted heading ψ ψ yacht heading and its first order derivative k p controller proportional coefficient t d controller derivative coefficient in addition the controlled parameter here the rudder angle is bounded by saturation values to ensure that it remains in a realistic range the coefficients used in this paper have been manually tuned on a one degree of freedom yaw test simulation to this end t d is first set to zero and k p adjusted by finding a compromise between the system s stability and settling time second t d is increased to reduce oscillations while avoiding excessive overshoots and instability 4 offshore trimaran simulations this section presents three application cases of dynamic simulations a maneuver a case with unsteady wind on flat water and one in waves 4 1 considered yacht this section presents three simulation examples which underline specificities and interests of dynamic studies compared to steady ones the simulated yacht is macif 100 an offshore trimaran of the ultim class skippered by françois gabart she has been the holder of the single handed sailing around the world record since 2017 in 42 days 16 h 40 min 35 s her main particulars are given in tables 1 and 2 the first two simulations consider the appendage package that was used for the circumnavigation fig 3a two small l foils one centerboard and three t rudders one on each hull in the last simulation a second set of appendages is used fig 3b with a larger foil and an elevator on the centerboard the windward foil is raised to the upper position in all examples 4 2 simple maneuver as known by vpp engineers a given configuration the parameters of the vpp appendage tunings ballast sail trim etc may lead to different equilibrium states and thus different boat speeds especially when the yacht has the ability to sail in different modes archimedean fully flying hybrid the aim of this first simulation is to illustrate this specificity by comparing two sail trimming strategies while adapting to new sailing conditions and showing that even though the final configuration is the same in both cases the final state largely differs with a substantial speed delta flat water conditions are considered the yacht initially sails upwind in 19knots of wind at 50 true wind angle on port tack the simulation is carried out in six degrees of freedom with no active control system other than an autopilot for the rudder angle at t 50 s the target heading is increased by sixty degrees so that the yacht bears away see fig 4 no change of sail is allowed as explained in section 3 4 the sail polars give the sail forces at the considered steady apparent wind angle awa for an optimal trim in dynamic conditions such an approach is an idealization as it means that the sails are trimmed for maximum driving force at the same rate as the apparent wind angle varies however the maximum driving force may not be the tuning that allows the maximal speed vpp studies carried out to optimize initial and final states configurations board extension rudder rake flat and twist etc show that the sails must be de powered twisted after the bearing away maneuver the sail twist enables to lower the center of effort which decreases the heeling moment at the cost of an increased drag coefficient the compared strategies focus on the timing of this specific action in the first one twist is operated progressively but directly after the rudder action while in the second one the sails are twisted only after the main hull is lifted out of the water with the second strategy the yacht maintains a strong heeling moment which makes her heel and decreases the wetted area of the main hull the yacht can then accelerate increasing thus the lift force of the foil in a virtuous circle that sees the hulls dynamic buoyancy and drag replaced by the foil action finally the sails need to be twisted to enable the heeling moment to be balanced as the boat accelerates the aerodynamic heeling moment keeps on increasing otherwise acting too soon as in the first strategy prevents the yacht under powered from lifting the main hull figs 5c and 5g with an implicated lack of speed of more than 4 5 knots fig 5a pushed by the inertial forces after the start of the turn the yacht keeps briefly a non negligible speed component in the direction of her initial motion that is to windward this explains the negative leeway peak shown in fig 5b the ratio of the main hull wetted surface area to its nominal value is shown in fig 5e its evolution is close to the heel angle behavior and while it saturates at about 25 when using the first strategy it indeed tends to zero in the second case which corresponds to flying the main hull the pitch angle evolution is visible in fig 5f its evolution is driven by three main phenomena first the appendage tuning is changed during the maneuver altering the pitching moment generated initially the tuning history being similar in both strategies this does not cause the difference between their final state second after the maneuver speeds are higher in both strategies and as the speed increases the aerodynamic bow down moment increases leading to a greater pitch angle finally a last factor is at stake in the second strategy the main hull leaves the water and its pitching moment component vanishes that is why the second strategy shows a lower pitch angle than the first one while the timing of the sail twist varies between both strategies other parameters are altered when bearing away but with identical timing in both cases it is for instance necessary to partially lift up the centerboard and to change the rake angle of foils and rudders this modifies the balance of the boat and explains the perturbations seen on the time series fig 6 shows the time evolution of the distribution of vertical forces aligned with acceleration of gravity as a percentage of the yacht displacement on both strategies the load transfer from the float to the foil as the speed increases is visible allowing to accelerate even more as the foil has a substantially better lift to drag ratio at such speeds as previously shown in the second strategy the main hull is lifted out of the water by the sails heeling moment and the displacement is transferred to the foil and to a lesser extent to the float finally the foil carries 50 of the yacht in the first strategy while in the second strategy this percentage reaches 70 this simulation highlights an interesting aspect verified in full scale one must build up speed before setting on the final configuration and track this is very important as especially for foiling yachts which can evolve in very different modes one given configuration does not lead to a unique equilibrium dynamic simulation allows to work on the strategy necessary to reach the vpp optimized steady speed and to optimize those transient phases 4 3 behavior in unsteady wind conditions this second simulation case aims at showing the interest of dynamic studies to predict potentially critical situations when evolving in unsteady conditions the consequences on the yacht behavior of an irregular wind are studied for this example unsteadiness is modeled by adding sinusoidal components to the mean true wind direction twd 0 while the true wind speed is kept constant at 18knots 16 twd t twd 0 1 i k i sin 2 π t i t the periods t i and the intensity factors k i of the five sinusoidal components are chosen arbitrarily they are given in table 3 periods are chosen so that they are not multiples of each other in order to increase the time necessary to observe a periodic behavior time evolution of the true wind direction is visible in fig 7 over the time range of the simulation those variations impact both the apparent wind speed and the apparent wind angle flat water conditions are considered at t 0 the simulation is launched from a vpp optimized equilibrium corresponding to twa 110 tws 18kn so that the unsteady wind acts as a perturbation to this situation it is interesting to notice that in such a configuration the boat speed is about 30knots and therefore a major component of the apparent wind the fluctuations of the apparent wind are thus much smaller than the true wind variations during the 400 s simulation the standard deviation of the true wind direction is 4 3 and the amplitude between extrema is 19 5 while the corresponding values for the apparent wind angle are respectively 1 4 and 6 1 some of the simulation outputs are shown in figs 8 and 9 the yacht is free to move in 6 degrees of freedom while an autopilot with a constant heading target ψ t 0 controls the rudders as can be seen from fig 8 the yacht evolves in hybrid mode with in average 50 of the yacht displacement sustained by the foil one can notice three peaks where the heel angle almost reaches 12 at t equals 200 280 and 320s see fig 9c consistently fig 7 shows that they correspond to situations where the wind heads twd maxima as the yacht heads north on port tack however such values of the true wind angle are reached several times without resulting in such heel angle peaks this demonstrates how the wind sequence has a strong impact on the yacht instantaneous behavior and proves how necessary time domain simulations are for the complete understanding of the yacht behavior similarly fig 9 shows in green the limits reached in a steady vpp when the yacht configuration is kept constant and the true wind angle ranges from 100 up to 120 the minimal and maximal values of fig 7 the heel variations are highly correlated to the wind direction signal but very high peaks occur incidentally this shows as could be expected that steady state analysis can miss critical situations on the contrary the simulated boat speed is well contained within the vpp limits as the wind oscillates too quickly for the speed to settle to the steady equilibrium values seen in vpp the average speed during the simulated sequence is 29 3knots which is slightly below the speed reached in steady wind 29 5knots unlike the other outputs the boat speed presents a low frequency component strongly dominating the high frequency ones this low pass filtering can be explained by the loads dependency to the boat speed that tends to damp the response as well as unlike heel or heave the absence of a strong hydrodynamic stiffness this can be verified by comparing the power spectral densities of the output signals with the input one fig 10 which consistently shows that the first component of the speed psd is largely dominant over the other components on the contrary the signals of angular position show a spectrum that is relatively close to the input one with some additional very small harmonics the fourth component being rather weak and close to the third one it is hardly distinguishable in the shown spectra another difference between the yacht attitudes and her horizontal velocity components is the delay with which they respond to the wind perturbation this can be shown by computing the normalized cross correlation function between input and output signals see fig 11 the first peak height gives the strength of the correlation while the abscissa indicates the phase shift as expected the heel angle is highly correlated to the true wind direction maximum correlation coefficient of 0 90 with a very short 0 85s lag on the contrary the boat speed which is also well correlated maximum correlation coefficient of 0 71 presents a much higher delay of 7 22s this simulation case has shown that a vpp is unable to predict the critical phases that can occur in unsteady conditions and that may be detrimental to the yacht safety and performance dvpps allow to study these critical situations furthermore they enable to study and improve the ship tuning parameters to optimize the speed in unsteady conditions and smooth even more the output signal besides in such situations the tuning of the autopilot coefficients may have significant impact on the response dvpps thus allow to study the effects of given coefficients and may be used within the tuning loop to optimize the behavior of on board control systems 4 4 downwind sailing in waves finally this third simulation case aims at modeling a sequence in the southern oceans indian or pacific which are generally almost totally sailed downwind in westerly winds southern ocean properties corresponding to the period december january have been chosen based on young 1999 the sea state is constructed by superposition of three wave components table 4 representing respectively the low medium and high frequency parts of a fully developed spectrum of about 4 5m significant wave height and 12 0s peak period all three components propagate in the same direction as the wind the pilot target is set at 140 of the wind direction results are shown in figs 12 and 13 while the phase velocities of the three wave components are respectively 16 3 10 8 and 6 5 m s fig 12a the yacht speed projected along the wave propagation axis ranges between 9 7 and 15 0 m s when caught up by the largest wave component the yacht almost reaches its velocity on the contrary the smaller components are mostly overtaken by the yacht fig 12c shows the free surface elevation at the horizontal coordinates of the yacht center of gravity the correspondence with the boat speed evolution fig 12b is clearly visible when the crests of the largest wave component arrives at the ship fig 14a she is pushed forward and surfs between t 25 s and 40 s for instance see fig 14b the yacht mean speed is 30 knots but it undergoes very large variations ranging from 25 up to 35 knots during the surfing phases as the yacht surfs in front of the coming wave the orbital velocities further increase the appendage lift by increasing the angle of attack consequence of the wave vertical velocity component especially of the foils and the yacht may reach a flying mode fig 13 she remains however slightly slower than the wave and is progressively overtaken as it happens the effect of orbital velocities on the rear appendages is inverted the wave vertical velocity becomes negative and their lift decreases as well as the efficiency of their pitch stabilizing effect the pitch angle is reduced figs 12d and 14c and the bow gains altitude over the free surface consequently the immersed surface of the foil shaft decreases leading to a drop in the side force making the yacht bear away and drift see figs 12e 12f for instance at t 40 s and fig 14d drifting and not pushed anymore by the wave the yacht slows down and reenters the water fig 14e it may reach negative heel angles fig 12g due to the coupled effect of decreased aerodynamic heeling moment less apparent wind speed and buoyancy on the leeward float bow that may touch the wave the yacht finally realigns with her heading target as the pilot acts on the rudder fig 12h and the sequence starts again when another large wave arrives in fig 12c one can notice the presence of higher harmonics when elevation is positive and smoother behavior otherwise a possible explanation would be that the appendages that carry the boat when elevation is large are more sensitive to small changes in the free surface elevation due to the high frequency waves than the hulls for which free surface variations are averaged along a larger length this is however not clearly visible from the vertical loads time series fig 13 a second more convincing possible explanation is that the platform stability is higher when in archimedean or hybrid mode than in flying mode so that the high frequency perturbations are better filtered out it is interesting to note that the proportional coefficient of the heading autopilot 1 5 here has a critical impact on the yacht behavior with a too stiff autopilot the rudder corrections are too abrupt and the yacht drifts largely while with a too small coefficient the yacht slaloms slowly making very wide turns with substantial impacts on the velocity made to mark the wave spectrum being fully developed and having a tight resonance peak the first wave component is largely predominant over the others a quasi periodic behavior with frequency corresponding to the encounter frequency of this component can thus be observed on the provided time series a pilot that would be aware of the position of the waves would be able to anticipate the yacht motion while she is overtaken an autopilot algorithm with learning abilities would be able to recognize such a repeating pattern and determine an action to prevent it dynamic simulation allows to develop train and test such controllers 5 conclusion this paper describes the development and models of a numerical tool for sailing yacht dynamic behavior analysis example simulations are presented to demonstrate the dvpp abilities especially to study dynamic situations in which the yacht attitudes heavily differ from the corresponding steady state ones in particular it is shown how for identical values of the wind angle it is possible to observe highly different boat speed and attitudes depending on the recent history of the yacht and her environment examples of dynamic simulation show how the simulator can resolve the dynamic response of the yacht in unsteady wind and in waves as well as the sensibility of the yacht behavior to the tuning strategies and the necessity for the user to find a tuning path to the vpp optimized boat speed this second design configuration proves to be closer to a flying mode which is consistent with the increased size of the lifting surfaces with a foil that carries in average 60 of the yacht displacement 30 for the hulls see fig 13 while for the first configuration in the unsteady wind simulation the distribution was respectively 50 and 40 fig 8 the last 10 are mainly distributed between the t rudders the lifting board of design 2 has a small averaged contribution as due to the large trim variations it regularly exerts a negative lift force its main interest resides here in a stabilizing effect such a numerical tool therefore brings a relevant help to yacht designers and sailors in order to predict and identify critical situations where the dynamic stability and performance of the yacht can be affected furthermore from such a non linear model it is possible to derive simpler models for specific use one may for instance compute the load derivatives to perform stability analysis around given equilibrium points and derive the eigenvectors and natural modes of the system heppel 2015 which can then be compared to actual time domain simulation deriving linear models from the initial non linear one is also of great help for control systems tuning legursky 2013 to further study the motion stability deriving dedicated criteria and quantities based on dynamic simulations should help assess the quality of given appendages design further work is however still needed especially regarding appendages and aerodynamic loads to handle a wider range of dynamic situations for instance to model imperfectly trimmed sails credit authorship contribution statement paul

21686,thanks to high lift to drag ratios hydrofoils are of great interest for high speed vessels modern sailing yachts fitted with foils have thus reached impressively high speeds on the water but this hydrodynamic efficiency is achieved at the expense of stability accurate tradeoffs are therefore needed to ensure both performance and safety while usual velocity prediction programs vpps are inadequate to assess dynamic stability the varying nature of the offshore racing environment further complicates the task dynamic simulation in the time domain is thus necessary to help architects assess their designs this paper presents a system based numerical tool which aims at predicting the dynamic behavior of offshore sailing yachts a 6 degrees of freedom dof algorithm is used calculating loads as a superposition of several components hull appendage sails part of them are computed at runtime while the others use pre computed dataset allowing a good compromise between efficiency and flexibility three 6dof simulations of an existing offshore trimaran a maneuver unsteady wind conditions and quartering seas are presented they underline the interest of dynamic studies demonstrating how important the yacht state history is to the understanding of her instantaneous behavior and showing that dynamic simulations open a different field of optimization than vpps graphical abstract

twa true wind angle twd true wind direction relative to north tws true wind speed vpp velocity prediction program 1 introduction the need for dynamic simulation is growing in many fields of engineering as it allows to test and compare prototypes and processes at much lower costs than actual full scale tests naval architecture is no exception nowadays it widely relies on velocity prediction programs vpps to help architects and engineers in the design process of sailing yachts however vpps have proved inadequate to optimize all of the design parameters originally introduced by kerwin 1978 vpps are constrained non linear steady state optimizers which based on experimental numerical or empirical data enable boat settings optimization to derive the reachable speeds in given steady conditions unlike inshore yachts such as the ac45 or the ac75 where class rules limit the acceptable wind and waves conditions offshore vessels may encounter rough sea and wind conditions with short characteristic time of evolution in such unsteady environments racing yachts may be compelled to sail at much lower speed than the steady state optimized values assessing the boat real performance and her ability to safely maintain high average speeds in varying conditions is therefore a key measure of her racing efficiency and should be included in the design trade offs in addition recent years have seen a substantial growth of foiling technologies leading to fully flying yachts and introducing specific stability issues with direct impact on average speed a better knowledge of the dynamic response of flying yachts is paramount for safe and sustained offshore flight non linear couplings between the different degrees of freedom further complicate the study and traditional vpps have proven inadequate to handle these matters with the accuracy required for high performance sailing in this context numerical tools enabling time domain analysis and including unsteady environment often called dynamic velocity prediction programs dvpps have become a major research topic this paper is interested in such a simulation tool handling variable wind and waves as well as mode transition between archimedean and fully flying conditions section 2 presents a literature review on yacht dynamic simulation the mathematical modeling is given in section 3 section 4 presents and analyzes three examples of dynamic simulation performed with the developed numerical tool 2 sailing yacht dynamic simulation the ability to simulate maneuvers and especially tacking has long been the main subject of sailing dynamic studies masuyama et al 1995 keuning et al 2005 gerhardt et al 2009 in match racing maneuvers are critical and simulations provide an efficient way for designers as well as crew to improve the on water results binns et al 2008 as match racing competitions are generally run inshore sheltered from the deep water waves and due to the complexity of waves effect the first numerical tools considered flat water conditions most of these works are based on the usual maneuvering approach abkowitz 1964 in which loads are described using hydrodynamic derivatives a taylor series expansion of the forces with respect to all the involved parameters attitudes sinkage speed components such models allowed the study of the three or four degrees of freedom dofs boat motion surge sway yaw and sometimes roll nevertheless foiling greatly enhances the need to factor in the two other degrees of freedom as heave flight height and trim appendages angles of attack are now at the core of boat stability heppel 2015 full 6 degrees of freedom modeling is therefore needed introduction of time domain studies in the design of racing yachts occurred for the victorious 26th america s cup challenger stars and stripes see oliver et al 1987 using a quasi steady approach velocity prediction program results were combined with wind statistics and game theory to simulate match races between several candidates and isolate the best performing design based on the widely used steady state models of the ims vpp claughton 1999 the four degrees of freedom program of larsson 1990 included a first account of wave effects by computing added resistance through strip theory masuyama et al 1993 1995 developed a numerical tool based on hydrodynamic derivatives computed from tank tests and aerodynamic coefficients derived from wind tunnel measurements comparison of their 4 degrees of freedom results with full scale measurements proved successful in the second paper masuyama et al 1995 reported on the substantial role of sails in roll damping and proposed a strip theory model ignoring three dimensional effects keuning et al 2005 enlarged the possibilities and modularity of such tools by introducing the use of delft systematic yacht hull series dsyhs to compute the hydrodynamic coefficients while comparison with full scale tests showed good agreement the weaknesses of the aerodynamic model based on the ims vpp is nevertheless underlined by the authors to the author s knowledge day et al 2002 were the first to report on a 6 degrees of freedom time domain simulation tool the program used the delft systematic yacht hull series for the hydrodynamic loads and the ims vpp quasi steady approach for sail forces comparison with full scale data showed good trends although the author underlined some discrepancies a few years later harris 2005 proposed another numerical tool to simulate the upwind behavior of sailing yachts maneuvering loads were computed through a panel code while radiation and diffraction loads were expressed from strip theory a strip theory approach was also used for the aerodynamic loads on the other hand constant improvements of computational power have opened the possibility to use cfd for time domain simulation by directly coupling the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes flow solvers with rigid body dynamic solvers jacquin et al 2005 roux et al 2008 lindstrand levin and larsson 2017 such approaches enable great accuracy while eliminating the need for empirical data or numerical pre computations the use of cfd as numerical vpp was achieved and work is now undertaken to add unsteady environment nevertheless the computational time and costs of such techniques make them currently unavailable for naval architects when the comparison of several designs and configurations is needed system based approaches on the contrary use empirical and theoretical models experimental results or pre computed numerical data to derive the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads and model the boat global behavior horel 2016 2019 with a computational efficiency that enables systematic studies of appendages shapes and configurations for instance this paper presents therefore a system based approach to the time domain simulation of sailing yachts see fig 1 due to the importance of the sea state on offshore yachts performance the model was built to account for wave loads and thus enables the improvement of the yacht response besides to allow an accurate optimization of foiling yachts the numerical tool handles motion in the six degrees of freedom unlike most of the cited papers it has been chosen to handle maneuvering loads not by taylor expansions or semi empirical formula but using interpolated computational fluid dynamics cfd data to increase accuracy the numerical models are presented in the following section 3 mathematical modeling this section presents the models implemented in the simulation tool to compute the loads of each yacht component and derive the ship motion 3 1 dynamics the developed numerical tool is based on the time domain integration of the 6 degrees of freedom rigid body motion equations derived from the conservation of linear and angular momentum in the non inertial ship fixed reference frame 1 m v ω og ω v ω og f i ω m og v ω i ω m og ω v m where v and ω are the ship linear and angular velocity vectors and v ω their time derivatives f m are the external forces and moments acting on the yacht and m i her mass and inertia at the origin o of the ship reference frame g is the body s center of gravity unlike conventional boats sailing yachts loading conditions are generally asymmetric to increase the righting moment water ballast canting keel equipment windward stacking therefore no assumption is made hereafter on the values of the products of inertia of i or on the transverse coordinate of og the ship fixed reference frame r b x b y b z b is defined with x b positive direction forwards y b to port and z b upwards see fig 2 its orientation with respect to the earth fixed inertial reference frame r 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is expressed using the usual gimbal angles φ θ ψ roll pitch and yaw the rotation matrix from the ship fixed reference frame r b to the earth fixed one r 0 is given by 2 r r b r 0 cos ψ cos θ cos ψ sin θ sin φ sin ψ cos φ cos ψ sin θ cos φ sin ψ sin φ sin ψ cos θ sin ψ sin θ sin φ cos ψ cos φ sin ψ sin θ cos φ cos ψ sin φ sin θ cos θ sin φ cos θ cos φ thus vectors x b expressed in the body reference frame are transformed into the earth fixed frame using x 0 r r b r 0 x b the angular velocity vector ω in r b are linked to the derivatives of the gimbal angles by the following expression 3 1 sin φ tan θ cos ϕ tan θ 0 cos φ sin φ 0 sin φ cos θ cos φ cos θ ω φ θ ψ which presents a singularity for θ π 2 this is however not an issue in normal sailing conditions several explicit numerical integration schemes with various orders are available as well as adaptive time stepping methods which enable computational time optimization in practice with a small enough time step we experienced that the choice of integration scheme had no or very limited impact on the result external loads are expressed as a superposition of all boat loaded components and can be divided in three main groups hull loads h appendage loads ap and aerodynamic loads ae 4 f f h f ap f ae i j h a p a e f i j r r 0 r b m g with g the gravity vector the three main components are detailed in the following sections f i j is the interaction term of component i over component j as in the majority of system based models most of those interactions are neglected however depending on the setups chosen by the user in the pre computation steps some of them may be accounted for such as the interaction between hull and appendages forces f ap h for instance 3 2 hull loads hydrodynamic loads on the hull can be split in low frequency maneuvering and high frequency seakeeping radiation and waves loads 3 2 1 maneuvering loads instead of the usual hydrodynamic derivatives approach abkowitz 1964 for the maneuvering forces the dynamic simulation tool uses polynomial response surfaces based on numerical viscous computations rans which allow to decrease the computation burden the response surfaces are built on steady state calculations over an appropriate range of hull attitude sinkage leeway angle and speed which are then the input variables to the polynomial fit the computations are carried out in flat water conditions and the hydrostatic components of the loads are removed so that they are only accounted once when integrating over the wetted surface due to the incoming wave field it enables a full modeling of the six components of the hydrodynamic loads on each hull including dependency to the boat possible changes of attitude and displacement due to the effect of appendages 3 2 2 radiation force the higher frequency loads are based on the classical distinction between radiation diffraction and froude krylov forces the former considers damping and added mass effects due to radiated waves generated by ship oscillations at the free surface they are computed in the frequency domain using the boundary element method bem code aquaplus delhommeau 1987 developed at the ecole centrale de nantes transformation of these frequency domain coefficients to the time domain is carried out through cummins equation cummins 1962 convolving the impulse response function k with the hull velocity 5 f rd a u ξ b u ξ 0 t k t τ u ξ τ d τ where f rd is the radiation force a u and b u the added mass and damping at infinite frequency and mean speed u and ξ the ship perturbation vector k is given by the inverse fourier transform of the frequency dependent damping component 6 k t u 2 π 0 b ω u b u cos ω t d ω with ω the frequency domain variable 3 2 3 wave loads as this simulation model is concerned with offshore yachts only deep water waves are considered diffraction loads are the first wave excitation force component they originate in the reflection of the incident waves on the ship surface similarly they are linearly modeled through the seakeeping code outputs but directly using the frequency domain expression 7 f df a f d ω e cos k x ω t φ d ω e where f df is the diffraction force f d and φ d its modulus and phase x the ship abscissa along the wave propagation axis k the wave number and a its amplitude ω e is the frequency of encounter which for linear waves is given by 8 ω e ω ω 2 g u cos μ with μ the angle between the ship track and the wave propagation and u the yacht speed finally froude krylov force f fk gathers the loads of the incident wave pressure field p i on the instantaneous ship wetted surface s w 9 f fk s w p i n d s where n is the outward unit normal vector to the body surface p i is expressed through potential flow theory of gravity waves 10 p i ρ φ i t 1 2 φ i 2 with ρ the fluid density and φ i the incident waves potential while computing froude krylov force a correction of the hydrostatic loads is also performed to account for the deformation of the free surface 3 3 appendage loads appendage loads are in a first approach modeled using a vortex lattice method vlm see for instance katz and plotkin 2001 with correction for viscous effects this provides a numerically efficient way to compute the spanwise distribution of lift for lifting surfaces of any aspect ratio dihedral and sweep assuming that the appendages are not located in the wake of one another their interaction is currently neglected velocity induced by the yacht angular motion wave velocity field and appendage trimming angles are accounted for by computing effective angles between the appendage and the incoming flow following the quasi steady theory qst approach to compute the apparent flow velocity vector 11 v x flow v ω x v w a v e where x is the coordinate vector of the considered location and v w a v e is the wave orbital velocity vector the vortex lattice method provides the full 6 components load tensor of each appendages also the forces and moments generated by the appendages are accounted for loads are computed for each appendage without assuming any symmetry in the setup so that asymmetric attitudes are reflected in the computed forces and moments and that windward and leeward appendages can be tuned differently the reduced frequency f r provides an interesting measure of the importance of dynamic effects on a hydrofoil it may be expressed as 12 f r c v x flow t where c is the foil characteristic chord length and t the characteristic period of the oscillations in waves it is typically the period of encounter according to fossati and muggiasca 2011 who cite previous references the unsteadiness of the flow must be accounted for when reduced frequencies are larger than 0 05 in such cases the temporal variations of the generated vortices and the added mass effects become non negligible specific behaviors such as hysteresis loops are observed in the considered situation the reduced frequency encountered by the appendages are expected to be smaller especially because of their relatively small chord length 3 4 aerodynamic loads similarly the aerodynamic models are based on the usual quasi steady theory assumption see richardt et al 2005 keuning et al 2005 specifically steady state sail polars ranse calculations including the three dimensional position of the center of effort are used while the apparent wind calculation accounts for the heel angle effective angle theory see e g kerwin 1978 and the induced velocity due to the yacht angular motion sail forces are assumed to lie in a plane perpendicular to the mast at the height and longitudinal position given by the position of the center of effort c thus in the boat reference frame the sails force vector is given by 13 f sails 1 2 ρ a i r s sails aws 2 c d cos awa c l sin awa c l cos awa c d sin awa 0 where c l and c d are the three dimensional lift and drag coefficients of the sails given by the polar ρ air the air density and s sails the sails total area aws and awa are respectively the apparent wind speed and angle the force vector is then displaced to the yacht center of gravity g to express the aerodynamic moments 14 m sails g gc f sails the sail polars are built by finding the optimum sail parameters that maximize the driving force possibly under heeling moment or side force constraints the de powering of this optimally trimmed sail plan is modeled through the ims vpp approach claughton 1999 jackson 2001 using the flat sail lift reduction and twist center of effort lowering parameters there is no need for a reef parameter as different polars are used when the sail configuration is altered change of head sail or reef seakeeping studies of sailing yachts have shown that the transverse aerodynamic inertia provided by the sailplan has a substantial impact on the yacht response especially in roll in order to account for this phenomenon the method described in gerhardt et al 2009 is implemented the sails added mass is approximated using a strip theory approach and integrating the potential flow expression of the added mass of a flat plate along the sail surface the work of tuckerman 1926 is used to derive a three dimensional effect factor that proved rather consistent when compared to experimental measurements on a model sail by gerhardt et al 2009 as was shown by fossati and muggiasca 2011 gerhardt et al 2011 and augier et al 2014 such simple models do not fully reproduce the unsteady aerodynamic behavior of sails and especially hysteresis phenomena further work still needs to be carried out to integrate such aspects in dvpps if higher relative frequencies are to be considered finally windage is modeled using reference drag areas in a similar manner as the ims vpp 3 5 control systems class rules on yacht control systems are a key issue in the future of high performance sailing especially offshore sportsmanship human safety energy consumption financial costs are intimately linked to the decision to authorize them on board or not for the time being the ultim class 32 23 does not allow control system other than the helm autopilot as this paper is concerned with the simulation of an offshore trimaran complying with these class rules no control system of foils or centerboard is enabled and therefore no control of heel pitch or ride height unlike dinghies moths or america s cup catamarans ultim trimarans take advantage of their substantial inertia which enables them to go through limited changes of the environmental conditions wind gusts for instance without immediate capsize the autopilot is an usual proportional derivative controller 15 δ r k p ψ ψ t k p t d ψ where δ r rudder angle ψ t targeted heading ψ ψ yacht heading and its first order derivative k p controller proportional coefficient t d controller derivative coefficient in addition the controlled parameter here the rudder angle is bounded by saturation values to ensure that it remains in a realistic range the coefficients used in this paper have been manually tuned on a one degree of freedom yaw test simulation to this end t d is first set to zero and k p adjusted by finding a compromise between the system s stability and settling time second t d is increased to reduce oscillations while avoiding excessive overshoots and instability 4 offshore trimaran simulations this section presents three application cases of dynamic simulations a maneuver a case with unsteady wind on flat water and one in waves 4 1 considered yacht this section presents three simulation examples which underline specificities and interests of dynamic studies compared to steady ones the simulated yacht is macif 100 an offshore trimaran of the ultim class skippered by françois gabart she has been the holder of the single handed sailing around the world record since 2017 in 42 days 16 h 40 min 35 s her main particulars are given in tables 1 and 2 the first two simulations consider the appendage package that was used for the circumnavigation fig 3a two small l foils one centerboard and three t rudders one on each hull in the last simulation a second set of appendages is used fig 3b with a larger foil and an elevator on the centerboard the windward foil is raised to the upper position in all examples 4 2 simple maneuver as known by vpp engineers a given configuration the parameters of the vpp appendage tunings ballast sail trim etc may lead to different equilibrium states and thus different boat speeds especially when the yacht has the ability to sail in different modes archimedean fully flying hybrid the aim of this first simulation is to illustrate this specificity by comparing two sail trimming strategies while adapting to new sailing conditions and showing that even though the final configuration is the same in both cases the final state largely differs with a substantial speed delta flat water conditions are considered the yacht initially sails upwind in 19knots of wind at 50 true wind angle on port tack the simulation is carried out in six degrees of freedom with no active control system other than an autopilot for the rudder angle at t 50 s the target heading is increased by sixty degrees so that the yacht bears away see fig 4 no change of sail is allowed as explained in section 3 4 the sail polars give the sail forces at the considered steady apparent wind angle awa for an optimal trim in dynamic conditions such an approach is an idealization as it means that the sails are trimmed for maximum driving force at the same rate as the apparent wind angle varies however the maximum driving force may not be the tuning that allows the maximal speed vpp studies carried out to optimize initial and final states configurations board extension rudder rake flat and twist etc show that the sails must be de powered twisted after the bearing away maneuver the sail twist enables to lower the center of effort which decreases the heeling moment at the cost of an increased drag coefficient the compared strategies focus on the timing of this specific action in the first one twist is operated progressively but directly after the rudder action while in the second one the sails are twisted only after the main hull is lifted out of the water with the second strategy the yacht maintains a strong heeling moment which makes her heel and decreases the wetted area of the main hull the yacht can then accelerate increasing thus the lift force of the foil in a virtuous circle that sees the hulls dynamic buoyancy and drag replaced by the foil action finally the sails need to be twisted to enable the heeling moment to be balanced as the boat accelerates the aerodynamic heeling moment keeps on increasing otherwise acting too soon as in the first strategy prevents the yacht under powered from lifting the main hull figs 5c and 5g with an implicated lack of speed of more than 4 5 knots fig 5a pushed by the inertial forces after the start of the turn the yacht keeps briefly a non negligible speed component in the direction of her initial motion that is to windward this explains the negative leeway peak shown in fig 5b the ratio of the main hull wetted surface area to its nominal value is shown in fig 5e its evolution is close to the heel angle behavior and while it saturates at about 25 when using the first strategy it indeed tends to zero in the second case which corresponds to flying the main hull the pitch angle evolution is visible in fig 5f its evolution is driven by three main phenomena first the appendage tuning is changed during the maneuver altering the pitching moment generated initially the tuning history being similar in both strategies this does not cause the difference between their final state second after the maneuver speeds are higher in both strategies and as the speed increases the aerodynamic bow down moment increases leading to a greater pitch angle finally a last factor is at stake in the second strategy the main hull leaves the water and its pitching moment component vanishes that is why the second strategy shows a lower pitch angle than the first one while the timing of the sail twist varies between both strategies other parameters are altered when bearing away but with identical timing in both cases it is for instance necessary to partially lift up the centerboard and to change the rake angle of foils and rudders this modifies the balance of the boat and explains the perturbations seen on the time series fig 6 shows the time evolution of the distribution of vertical forces aligned with acceleration of gravity as a percentage of the yacht displacement on both strategies the load transfer from the float to the foil as the speed increases is visible allowing to accelerate even more as the foil has a substantially better lift to drag ratio at such speeds as previously shown in the second strategy the main hull is lifted out of the water by the sails heeling moment and the displacement is transferred to the foil and to a lesser extent to the float finally the foil carries 50 of the yacht in the first strategy while in the second strategy this percentage reaches 70 this simulation highlights an interesting aspect verified in full scale one must build up speed before setting on the final configuration and track this is very important as especially for foiling yachts which can evolve in very different modes one given configuration does not lead to a unique equilibrium dynamic simulation allows to work on the strategy necessary to reach the vpp optimized steady speed and to optimize those transient phases 4 3 behavior in unsteady wind conditions this second simulation case aims at showing the interest of dynamic studies to predict potentially critical situations when evolving in unsteady conditions the consequences on the yacht behavior of an irregular wind are studied for this example unsteadiness is modeled by adding sinusoidal components to the mean true wind direction twd 0 while the true wind speed is kept constant at 18knots 16 twd t twd 0 1 i k i sin 2 π t i t the periods t i and the intensity factors k i of the five sinusoidal components are chosen arbitrarily they are given in table 3 periods are chosen so that they are not multiples of each other in order to increase the time necessary to observe a periodic behavior time evolution of the true wind direction is visible in fig 7 over the time range of the simulation those variations impact both the apparent wind speed and the apparent wind angle flat water conditions are considered at t 0 the simulation is launched from a vpp optimized equilibrium corresponding to twa 110 tws 18kn so that the unsteady wind acts as a perturbation to this situation it is interesting to notice that in such a configuration the boat speed is about 30knots and therefore a major component of the apparent wind the fluctuations of the apparent wind are thus much smaller than the true wind variations during the 400 s simulation the standard deviation of the true wind direction is 4 3 and the amplitude between extrema is 19 5 while the corresponding values for the apparent wind angle are respectively 1 4 and 6 1 some of the simulation outputs are shown in figs 8 and 9 the yacht is free to move in 6 degrees of freedom while an autopilot with a constant heading target ψ t 0 controls the rudders as can be seen from fig 8 the yacht evolves in hybrid mode with in average 50 of the yacht displacement sustained by the foil one can notice three peaks where the heel angle almost reaches 12 at t equals 200 280 and 320s see fig 9c consistently fig 7 shows that they correspond to situations where the wind heads twd maxima as the yacht heads north on port tack however such values of the true wind angle are reached several times without resulting in such heel angle peaks this demonstrates how the wind sequence has a strong impact on the yacht instantaneous behavior and proves how necessary time domain simulations are for the complete understanding of the yacht behavior similarly fig 9 shows in green the limits reached in a steady vpp when the yacht configuration is kept constant and the true wind angle ranges from 100 up to 120 the minimal and maximal values of fig 7 the heel variations are highly correlated to the wind direction signal but very high peaks occur incidentally this shows as could be expected that steady state analysis can miss critical situations on the contrary the simulated boat speed is well contained within the vpp limits as the wind oscillates too quickly for the speed to settle to the steady equilibrium values seen in vpp the average speed during the simulated sequence is 29 3knots which is slightly below the speed reached in steady wind 29 5knots unlike the other outputs the boat speed presents a low frequency component strongly dominating the high frequency ones this low pass filtering can be explained by the loads dependency to the boat speed that tends to damp the response as well as unlike heel or heave the absence of a strong hydrodynamic stiffness this can be verified by comparing the power spectral densities of the output signals with the input one fig 10 which consistently shows that the first component of the speed psd is largely dominant over the other components on the contrary the signals of angular position show a spectrum that is relatively close to the input one with some additional very small harmonics the fourth component being rather weak and close to the third one it is hardly distinguishable in the shown spectra another difference between the yacht attitudes and her horizontal velocity components is the delay with which they respond to the wind perturbation this can be shown by computing the normalized cross correlation function between input and output signals see fig 11 the first peak height gives the strength of the correlation while the abscissa indicates the phase shift as expected the heel angle is highly correlated to the true wind direction maximum correlation coefficient of 0 90 with a very short 0 85s lag on the contrary the boat speed which is also well correlated maximum correlation coefficient of 0 71 presents a much higher delay of 7 22s this simulation case has shown that a vpp is unable to predict the critical phases that can occur in unsteady conditions and that may be detrimental to the yacht safety and performance dvpps allow to study these critical situations furthermore they enable to study and improve the ship tuning parameters to optimize the speed in unsteady conditions and smooth even more the output signal besides in such situations the tuning of the autopilot coefficients may have significant impact on the response dvpps thus allow to study the effects of given coefficients and may be used within the tuning loop to optimize the behavior of on board control systems 4 4 downwind sailing in waves finally this third simulation case aims at modeling a sequence in the southern oceans indian or pacific which are generally almost totally sailed downwind in westerly winds southern ocean properties corresponding to the period december january have been chosen based on young 1999 the sea state is constructed by superposition of three wave components table 4 representing respectively the low medium and high frequency parts of a fully developed spectrum of about 4 5m significant wave height and 12 0s peak period all three components propagate in the same direction as the wind the pilot target is set at 140 of the wind direction results are shown in figs 12 and 13 while the phase velocities of the three wave components are respectively 16 3 10 8 and 6 5 m s fig 12a the yacht speed projected along the wave propagation axis ranges between 9 7 and 15 0 m s when caught up by the largest wave component the yacht almost reaches its velocity on the contrary the smaller components are mostly overtaken by the yacht fig 12c shows the free surface elevation at the horizontal coordinates of the yacht center of gravity the correspondence with the boat speed evolution fig 12b is clearly visible when the crests of the largest wave component arrives at the ship fig 14a she is pushed forward and surfs between t 25 s and 40 s for instance see fig 14b the yacht mean speed is 30 knots but it undergoes very large variations ranging from 25 up to 35 knots during the surfing phases as the yacht surfs in front of the coming wave the orbital velocities further increase the appendage lift by increasing the angle of attack consequence of the wave vertical velocity component especially of the foils and the yacht may reach a flying mode fig 13 she remains however slightly slower than the wave and is progressively overtaken as it happens the effect of orbital velocities on the rear appendages is inverted the wave vertical velocity becomes negative and their lift decreases as well as the efficiency of their pitch stabilizing effect the pitch angle is reduced figs 12d and 14c and the bow gains altitude over the free surface consequently the immersed surface of the foil shaft decreases leading to a drop in the side force making the yacht bear away and drift see figs 12e 12f for instance at t 40 s and fig 14d drifting and not pushed anymore by the wave the yacht slows down and reenters the water fig 14e it may reach negative heel angles fig 12g due to the coupled effect of decreased aerodynamic heeling moment less apparent wind speed and buoyancy on the leeward float bow that may touch the wave the yacht finally realigns with her heading target as the pilot acts on the rudder fig 12h and the sequence starts again when another large wave arrives in fig 12c one can notice the presence of higher harmonics when elevation is positive and smoother behavior otherwise a possible explanation would be that the appendages that carry the boat when elevation is large are more sensitive to small changes in the free surface elevation due to the high frequency waves than the hulls for which free surface variations are averaged along a larger length this is however not clearly visible from the vertical loads time series fig 13 a second more convincing possible explanation is that the platform stability is higher when in archimedean or hybrid mode than in flying mode so that the high frequency perturbations are better filtered out it is interesting to note that the proportional coefficient of the heading autopilot 1 5 here has a critical impact on the yacht behavior with a too stiff autopilot the rudder corrections are too abrupt and the yacht drifts largely while with a too small coefficient the yacht slaloms slowly making very wide turns with substantial impacts on the velocity made to mark the wave spectrum being fully developed and having a tight resonance peak the first wave component is largely predominant over the others a quasi periodic behavior with frequency corresponding to the encounter frequency of this component can thus be observed on the provided time series a pilot that would be aware of the position of the waves would be able to anticipate the yacht motion while she is overtaken an autopilot algorithm with learning abilities would be able to recognize such a repeating pattern and determine an action to prevent it dynamic simulation allows to develop train and test such controllers 5 conclusion this paper describes the development and models of a numerical tool for sailing yacht dynamic behavior analysis example simulations are presented to demonstrate the dvpp abilities especially to study dynamic situations in which the yacht attitudes heavily differ from the corresponding steady state ones in particular it is shown how for identical values of the wind angle it is possible to observe highly different boat speed and attitudes depending on the recent history of the yacht and her environment examples of dynamic simulation show how the simulator can resolve the dynamic response of the yacht in unsteady wind and in waves as well as the sensibility of the yacht behavior to the tuning strategies and the necessity for the user to find a tuning path to the vpp optimized boat speed this second design configuration proves to be closer to a flying mode which is consistent with the increased size of the lifting surfaces with a foil that carries in average 60 of the yacht displacement 30 for the hulls see fig 13 while for the first configuration in the unsteady wind simulation the distribution was respectively 50 and 40 fig 8 the last 10 are mainly distributed between the t rudders the lifting board of design 2 has a small averaged contribution as due to the large trim variations it regularly exerts a negative lift force its main interest resides here in a stabilizing effect such a numerical tool therefore brings a relevant help to yacht designers and sailors in order to predict and identify critical situations where the dynamic stability and performance of the yacht can be affected furthermore from such a non linear model it is possible to derive simpler models for specific use one may for instance compute the load derivatives to perform stability analysis around given equilibrium points and derive the eigenvectors and natural modes of the system heppel 2015 which can then be compared to actual time domain simulation deriving linear models from the initial non linear one is also of great help for control systems tuning legursky 2013 to further study the motion stability deriving dedicated criteria and quantities based on dynamic simulations should help assess the quality of given appendages design further work is however still needed especially regarding appendages and aerodynamic loads to handle a wider range of dynamic situations for instance to model imperfectly trimmed sails credit authorship contribution statement paul

21687,we assess the capability of fast wave models to deterministically predict nonlinear ocean surface waves from non uniformly distributed data such as sampled from an optical ocean sensor linear and weakly nonlinear prediction algorithms are applied to long crested irregular waves based on a set of laboratory experiments and corresponding numerical simulations an array of wave gauges is used for data acquisition representing the typical spatial sampling an optical sensor e g lidar would make at grazing incidence predictions of the weakly nonlinear improved choppy wave model are compared to those of the linear wave theory with and without a nonlinear dispersion relationship correction wave models are first inverted based on gauge data which provides the initial model parameters then propagated to issue a prediction we find that the wave prediction accuracy converges with the amount of input data used in the inversion when waves are propagated in the models correctly modeling the nonlinear wave phase velocity provides the main improvement in accuracy while including nonlinear wave shape effects only improves surface elevation representation in the spatio temporal region where input data are acquired surface slope prediction accuracy however strongly depends on the appropriate nonlinear wave shape modeling keywords ocean waves nonlinear waves deterministic prediction wave tank experiments 1 introduction the availability of real time phase resolved wave fields is key for the optimization of a vast range of marine applications the prediction and control of the wave induced motion is crucially important to extend the operational envelope and optimal maneuvering of many surface vessels such as to stabilize aircraft or helicopter carriers during takeoff landing manoeuvres ships during ship to ship transfer or to perform installation and maintenance operations on marine structures for ocean renewable energy harvesting systems advance knowledge of incoming waves conditions the performances of control strategies for instance it is shown that the optimal control of wave energy converters relying on wave to wave predictions significantly improves their efficiency li et al 2012 also the life time of floating wind turbines could be increased by mitigating fatigue loads through appropriate control of the structure motions induced by wave loads ma et al 2018 the deterministic prediction of ocean wave fields requires inverting a model describing the wave dynamics based on a set of observations i e measurements that contain information about the wave geometry and kinematics e g nouguier et al 2014 based on such an inversion i e nowcast the properly parameterized wave model can then be used to propagate the wave field forward in time i e forecast to the area of interest note that the later can itself be in motion e g a moving ship x band radars such as wamos ii developed by oceanwaves gmbh hilmer and thornhill 2015 the prediction systems of next ocean naaijen et al 2018 or futurewaves kusters et al 2016 have been used to generate large spatio temporal data sets of wave elevations surrounding the structure upon which they are mounted such radars make use of the backscattered signal resulting from the bragg resonance between the radar microwaves 3 cm wavelength and short wavelength capillary gravity waves 1 5 cm wavelength covering the ocean surface due to wind generation hydrodynamic and tilt modulations of such short ripples by longer gravity waves carrying them that affect the backscattered signal allow inverting for surface elevations by means of a modulation transfer function mtf nieto borge et al 2004 provided that a calibration is enabling a retrofit on this mtf in the measurement chain this technology has been successfully implemented in commercial products hilmer and thornhill 2015 kusters et al 2016 naaijen et al 2018 similar data sets can be obtained by the way of lidar light detection and ranging cameras belmont et al 2007 grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 kabel et al 2019 which operate in the visible light e g green 532 nm wavelength instead of using modulation properties of bragg waves to estimate gravity waves characteristics lidar cameras provide direct geo referenced measurements of free surface elevations computed based on laser beam travel times one advantage of this technique as compared to x band radars is the higher spatial resolution resulting from the smaller divergence of the laser beams compared to the microwave beams sviridov 1993 providing a more accurate phase resolved instantaneous measurement of the ocean surface when mounted on an ocean structure or surface vessel to remotely measure ocean surface elevations both x band radar and lidar camera have limitations resulting from the grazing incidence angles of the beams first it will cause wave shadowing effects leading data sets acquired by these systems to exhibit spatial gaps behind illuminated wave fronts which have an area increasing with the distance from the sensor second assuming a uniform distribution of beams over the sensor s aperture angles the density of the measurement points geometrically decreases with the distance from the sensor in the case of x band radars shadowing effects are used to generate a shadowing mask that is implemented in the mtf used for wave inversion nieto borge et al 2004 for lidar cameras the lack of information in the shadowed area can be compensated for by using spatio temporal data sets i e at a slightly later time shadowed areas without measurement points can become illuminated due to wave motion this however also requires performing a spatio temporal wave field inversion grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 desmars et al 2018 in addition to generating spatial gaps shadowing effects cause laser beams to hit the ocean surface at unknown horizontal locations leading the measurement points to be distributed over an a priori unknown unstructured grid these properties together with the non periodicity of observations prevent using standard signal processing techniques based on fourier decomposition in the wave inversion unless a pre or post processing method is used e g interpolation end matching filtering due to real time constraints i e sufficient computational efficiency existing deterministic wave prediction systems have typically used models based on linear wave theory lwt hilmer and thornhill 2015 kusters et al 2016 naaijen et al 2018 however this limits their applicability to sea states with a small characteristic steepness and further assumes that i bound waves i e harmonic waves that do not obey the dispersion relation can be neglected and ii the space and time scales of observations and the prediction horizon do not allow time dependent nonlinear wave wave interactions e g nonlinear phase shift to significantly affect wave dynamics whenever these limitations are not met the accurate prediction of ocean surface waves will require modeling weakly or fully nonlinear wave properties weakly nonlinear models have been developed and used for wave simulation and prediction based on expanding eulerian wave properties up to the second order in wave steepness e g zhang et al 1996 1999 which for instance allows separating free and bound wave components in wave measurements a model based on the modified nonlinear schrödinger mnls equation which simulates third order wave properties such as phase speed was used to predict bichromatic waves trulsen and stansberg 2001 then extended to both one directional and directional irregular seas simanesew et al 2017 the latter study showed that the mnls equation is able to provide satisfactory predictions of long crested irregular waves but the lack of directional input data prevented properly estimating its prediction performance for short crested waves with increasing directional spread higher order wave models based on the high order spectral hos method were also applied for nonlinear prediction of ocean surfaces e g wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 qi et al 2018a based on a pseudo spectral approach this method solves the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions to an arbitrary order for a velocity potential and allows to simulate the propagation of any wave fields over large space and time scales with a high accuracy predictions of long crested irregular waves using both hos lwt and nonlinear schrödinger approaches were recently compared klein et al 2020 showing that the appropriate modeling of nonlinear dispersion effects plays a significant role from moderate to high wave steepness with hos being the most accurate prediction model the main counterpoint of hos is its initialization process that necessitates a high number of operations exponentially increasing with its order of nonlinearity recent works have been carried out on improved assimilation methods for hos to be adequate for real time prediction köllisch et al 2018 fujimoto and waseda 2020 in this study we apply and experimentally validate a wave reconstruction and prediction algorithm based on the recently developed improved choppy wave model icwm guérin et al 2019 which extends with higher order corrections the weakly nonlinear lagrangian choppy wave model nouguier et al 2009 which was used in our earlier work on ocean wave reconstruction algorithms based on lidar camera data grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the wave models that are used in this study namely the lwt the icwm and a linear wave model corrected with a nonlinear dispersion relation section 3 details the data assimilation procedure that is employed here as well as key aspects relative to the determination of the accessible prediction zone section 4 describes the experimental and numerical modeling setups used in our applications together with an analysis of the experimental data perturbations followed by definitions of the prediction misfit indicators used in this study section 5 investigates the sensitivity of the proposed prediction algorithms to assimilation parameters their accuracy is finally discussed in section 6 2 wave models while it is desirable to account for the nonlinearity of ocean waves the development of fast methods for the real time reconstruction and prediction of nonlinear sea states cannot be easily or efficiently achieved using complex i e highly nonlinear wave models such as based on a hos method e g wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 qi et al 2018a instead the wave model used to this effect should be able to properly account for salient nonlinear effects in the propagation of the considered wave fields while being sufficiently efficient for providing real time predictions here we consider and compare two wave models one based on linear wave theory lwt and a weakly nonlinear wave model referred to as choppy wave model cwm derived in an explicit efficient lagrangian formalism the improved form of cwm referred to as improved choppy wave model icwm guérin et al 2019 is used in the present applications both models provide an analytical expression of the free surface elevation which can be efficiently initiated the assimilation procedure is detailed in section 3 1 and propagated forward in time to forecast the future state of a given wave field the latter being simply obtained by increasing the value of time in the formulation we limit our developments to the deep water assumption but the extension to intermediate depth is straightforward 2 1 linear wave theory lwt refers here to the equations derived from the classical eulerian approach for an inviscid incompressible fluid with an irrotational motion linearized with respect to the wave steepness let us consider a cartesian coordinate system x y z with the x and y horizontal axes located at the mean water surface and the z axis being vertical and positive upward under lwt a generic irregular ocean surface wave field is simply represented as the superposition of n 1 n individual harmonic wave components propagating in the horizontal plane r x y in direction θ n with respect to the x axis of amplitude a n and angular frequency ω n following 1 η lin r t n 1 n a n cos k n r ω n t φ n where t is time φ n are phases and k n k n k ˆ n k n cos θ n k n sin θ n and k n 2 π λ n k n are wavenumber vectors and wavenumbers respectively with λ n the wavelength with the latter found as k n ω n 2 g based on the deep water dispersion relationship and g the acceleration of gravity to simplify later mathematical developments the free surface will be equivalently described as 2 η lin r t n 1 n a n cos ψ n b n sin ψ n in which ψ n k n r ω n t are spatio temporal phases and a n b n a n cos φ n a n sin φ n are wave parameters describing the ocean surface 2 2 improved choppy wave model the cwm was derived based on a first order lagrangian description of water particle motions on the free surface nouguier et al 2009 and thus corresponds for a periodic wave to the classical gerstner wave model gerstner 1809 the cwm provides results that include features from a higher order eulerian wave theory e g second order stokes theory but the wave phase speed is still that given by lwt a recent improvement of the cwm was proposed to account for higher order nonlinear effects in particular on the wave phase speed without requiring a full second order lagrangian description guérin et al 2019 the resulting wave model icwm is used in the present work using a formalism similar to that introduced in the previous section icwm represents the free surface elevation z r 0 t as a function of time for water particles initially located at r 0 on the still water level at rest as 3 r r 0 t r 0 n 1 n k ˆ n a n sin ψ n b n cos ψ n u s 0 t a z r 0 t n 1 n a n cos ψ n b n sin ψ n n 1 n 1 2 a n 2 b n 2 k n b where ψ n k n r 0 ω n t denote phases of wave components ω n ω n 1 2 k n u s 0 modified angular frequencies and u s 0 n 1 n a n 2 b n 2 ω n k n the free surface stokes drift vector the last term in eq 3a and in the modified angular frequency equation are nonlinear corrections added to the standard cwm which account for stokes drift effects on the free surface the last term in eq 3b accounts for a correction of the mean surface level typical measurements of ocean surfaces such as with an optical system are made at irregularly distributed locations defined in a reference coordinate system hence these are eulerian measurements the wave model used to reconstruct the ocean surface must thus be able to use similar information which makes the above lagrangian form of icwm not directly usable hence an approximate eulerian model equivalent to icwm is derived in the following introducing an approximation similar to that made of the cwm nouguier et al 2009 for which an efficient algorithm was developed based on computing horizontal displacements of a reference linear surface using efficient riesz and spatial fourier transforms an explicit relationship between r and z in eqs 3a and 3b could be derived by performing a taylor series expansion of particle vertical locations z around their instantaneous horizontal location r thus providing z r in this case however successive eulerian orders of expansion lose the lagrangian formulation s simplicity which makes the model inefficient here we first modify eqs 3a and 3b by implicitly incorporating the particle horizontal shift into a modified angular frequency ϕ n thus replacing r 0 by r 0 r 0 u s 0 t leading to 4 r r 0 t r r 0 t r 0 d r 0 r 0 n 1 n k ˆ n a n sin ϕ n b n cos ϕ n z r 0 t z r 0 t n 1 n a n cos ϕ n b n sin ϕ n n 1 n 1 2 a n 2 b n 2 k n where ϕ n k n r 0 ω l n t and ω l n ω n 1 2 k n u s 0 then as for the cwm nouguier et al 2009 a simple method for numerically evaluating icwm surface elevation at any spatial point is derived by computing the particle vertical displacement at its instantaneous rather than its reference location earlier work has shown grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 that errors due to this approximation are on the order of the mean square surface slope i e the second order moment of the wave spectrum 0 k 2 s η k d k which is expected to be small compared to other sources of error in the ocean surface reconstruction process hence assuming 5 z r 0 z r d r 0 z r d r η nl r eq 4 yields an explicit approximate nonlinear free surface elevation η nl at any spatial point r as 6 η nl r t n 1 n a n cos ψ n b n sin ψ n 1 2 a n 2 b n 2 k n ψ n k n r i 1 n k ˆ i a i sin ϕ i b i cos ϕ i ω l n t where the modified phases are now computed as ϕ i k i r ω l i t 2 3 linear wave theory with corrected dispersion relation to quantify effects of nonlinear wave phase corrections on our wave prediction results independently of the wave shape asymmetry represented in the icwm we will evaluate the performance of a third wave model referred to as lwt cdr which is based on lwt eq 2 but uses a dispersion relationship corrected by stokes drift as for the icwm i e the linear angular frequency ω n k is replaced by its nonlinear equivalent ω l n k this yields the corrected linear free surface elevation 7 η cl r t n 1 n a n cos ϕ n b n sin ϕ n 3 methods model based predictions rely on the model inversion from observations measured data for parameters specifying the initial conditions prior to model propagation this model initialization step referred to as the assimilation procedure is detailed in this section for the three wave models presented previously we then explain the method to determine theoretically the accessible spatio temporal prediction zone from the assimilated data 3 1 data assimilation procedure a standard method for assimilating wave elevation data is the variational approach blondel 2009 in which a cost function f representing the error between the measured wave field and its representation with a wave model is minimized here we assume that an a priori estimate of the solution is not available and statistical parameters of the aleatory error in observations or free surface elevation measurements are stationary i e they are not functions of time or space accordingly similar to earlier work grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 the cost function is expressed as the mean square of the difference between spatio temporal ocean observations and their model representation as 8 f p 1 2 k 1 k j 1 j η j k p η j k 2 1 2 ℓ 1 l η ℓ p η ℓ 2 in which p a n b n n 1 n is the control vector of 2 n unknown model parameters j and k are the number of spatial observations made at each observation time and the number of observation times respectively hence the total number of assimilated spatio temporal observations is j k l η j k or η ℓ are free surface elevations measured at spatial locations r j j 1 j and times t k k 1 k and η j k or η ℓ are estimates of these computed with the wave model i e with eq 2 for lwt eq 7 for lwt cdr or eq 6 for icwm model parameters are obtained next by minimizing the cost function with respect to these parameters and solving the system of equations 9 f a m 0 f b m 0 a m n p n b m where n m 1 n 2 and p n a n p n n b n constitute the unknown vector of 2 n model parameters associated to wave components of predefined wavenumbers k n the set of wavenumbers k n is distributed in k min k max following a decreasing logarithmic law with k min max defining the bandwidth of the reconstructed wave field see section 3 3 for details about how to choose k min max since the considered wave models have analytical formulations the system of eq 9 can be explicitly expressed note that in practice and to increase the accuracy of the parameter estimation the number of observations used l is larger than the number of wave components n used to perform the wave model inversion hence the optimal solution of an overdetermined system of equations is computed to assimilate data in the model which can be done using a least squares method accordingly to obtain an accurate solution the larger the spatio temporal region covered by the observations the larger the number of degrees of freedom required in the wave model in each application considered in the following n will be adequately selected to satisfy this constraint 3 1 1 linear assimilation linear wave fields are reconstructed by computing the cost function eq 8 using the linear wave model eq 2 thus in the minimization eq 9 we get a m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ cos ψ m ℓ a m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ cos ψ m ℓ 10 a n m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ sin ψ m ℓ a n m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ sin ψ m ℓ and 11 b m ℓ 1 l η ℓ cos ψ m ℓ b n m ℓ 1 l η ℓ sin ψ m ℓ where ψ m ℓ k m r ℓ ω m t ℓ 3 1 2 nonlinear assimilation nonlinear wave fields are reconstructed by computing the cost function eq 8 using the icwm eq 6 thus in the minimization eq 9 we now obtain a m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ 1 2 a n k n p m ℓ a m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ 1 2 b n k n p m ℓ 12 a n m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ 1 2 a n k n q m ℓ a n m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ 1 2 b n k n q m ℓ and 13 b m ℓ 1 l η ℓ p m ℓ b n m ℓ 1 l η ℓ q m ℓ in which 14 p m ℓ cos ψ m ℓ k m a m sin ψ m ℓ b m cos ψ m ℓ sin ϕ m ℓ k m a m cos ϕ m ℓ b m sin ϕ m ℓ 1 a m ω m k m t ℓ a m k m q m ℓ sin ψ m ℓ k m a m sin ψ m ℓ b m cos ψ m ℓ cos ϕ m ℓ k m a m cos ϕ m ℓ b m sin ϕ m ℓ 1 b m ω m k m t ℓ b m k m since both a m n and b m now depend on model parameters a n b n the system of eq 9 must be solved iteratively following nouguier et al 2014 when solving for p n q 1 at iteration q 1 a m n q and b m q are computed based on wave parameters obtained at the previous iteration q the solution is initialized at q 0 by computing a m n 0 and b m 0 as for the linear reconstruction using eqs 10 and 11 based on a relative error between p n q and p n q 1 evaluated at each iteration q 1 convergence of the solution is typically achieved within a few to a few dozens iterations depending on the wave steepness this ensures a very efficient assimilation procedure in this nonlinear context as indicated above a third system of equations is solved for wave parameters corresponding to the lwt cdr eq 7 this formulation is not detailed here for the sake of conciseness 3 1 3 regularization of the inverse problem in operative applications the ocean reconstruction problem may become ill conditioned due to practical constraints such as the heterogeneous distribution of spatial observation points the limited ocean area observed by the optical sensor and the frequency and direction bandwidth cutoffs in the reconstructed wave field nevertheless consistent results can be achieved independently of the conditioning of the system matrix to invert i e a m n by applying a tikhonov regularization in which the matrix inversion is replaced by the following minimization problem 15 min a m n p n b m 2 ξ 2 p n 2 where ξ denotes the regularization parameter an optimal value of the regularization parameter can be found using the l curve method which consists in finding the ξ value corresponding to the point of maximal curvature i e corner of the parametric curve log a m n p n b m log p n this method provides an optimal compromise between minimizing the residual error of the assimilation system and ensuring that the norm of the solution does not become too large the l curve corner can be determined analytically through solving a singular value decomposition problem calvetti et al 2004 hansen 2000 note that this procedure is equivalent to adding a constraint to the minimization problem physically representing the total energy of the reconstructed wave spectrum since the latter is proportional to the squared norm of p n in this case ξ 2 can simply be interpreted as a lagrangian multiplier 3 2 accessible prediction zone from non uniform observations earlier work has shown that the spatio temporal region over which wave dynamics can be predicted based on a set of free surface measurements is bounded wu 2004 naaijen et al 2014 qi et al 2018b when measurements are made using an optical system at a specific sampling rate and over a given observation zone this limits the amount of data that can be assimilated and used in the wave reconstruction process yielding a reconstructed surface in space time defined with finite frequency and direction bandwidths in light of this the sea state prediction obtained by propagating the assimilated information is similarly limited to a spatio temporal region referred to as prediction zone in the following we show how the latter can be estimated for a set of fixed surface observations of a one directional wave field the accurate description of a wave field is limited to the knowledge of its wave components energy which propagates at the wave group velocity further sea states that are of interest in our study such as described by a jonswap wave spectrum yield a fairly concentrated energy around their peak frequency this allows using a finite frequency bandwidth to describe the evolution of such sea states hence the intersection of the slowest and fastest wave components in the finite frequency bandwidth of the wave field determine the boundary of the spatio temporal region within which an amount of information sufficient to issue a prediction is available consequently as time increases the accessible prediction region shrinks to eventually disappear when the assimilated information is completely dispersed fig 1 illustrates this phenomenon for a one directional wave field propagating in the x direction the latest time used in data assimilation corresponds to the reconstruction time t r t k k when only spatial data are used in the assimilation i e k 1 see fig 1a the prediction zone at reconstruction time p t r is the spatial area where observations were made however when spatio temporal data sets are acquired over an assimilation time t a see fig 1b p t r expands due to the advection of wave information during t a therefore a point x t t r is included in the prediction zone if 16 x b c g 1 t t r x x e c g 2 t t r where c g 1 and c g 2 are the fastest and slowest group velocities respectively and x b and x e define the beginning and the end of p t r fig 1 as 17 x b min j x j x e max j x j c g 2 t a where x j are spatial locations of the observations although future applications could rely on observations with spatial location variations i e x j functions of time the presented investigations are restricted to fixed measurement locations 3 3 bandwidths of the reconstructed wave field as mentioned above the accurate representation of the wave field dynamics can be ensured by selecting a finite wavenumber bandwidth having relevant cutoff limits k min max however the spatio temporal characteristics of the observation grid limit the wave information that is accessible for reconstruction thus imposing constraints on these cutoffs for instance the smallest wavenumber that is measurable in a given grid k min 2 π l o is function of the largest distance l o x e x b between two observation points at reconstruction time t r fig 1b at the same time x e is a function of the chosen minimum group velocity c g 2 of individual wave components in the wave field when reconstructing a wave field over a uniformly sampled observation grid i e one with constant spatial sampling the maximum high cutoff wavenumber must satisfy shannon s condition i e k max 2 π 2 ℓ o where ℓ o is the distance between two observation points however using an optical sensing method the observation grid is highly non uniform and k max must be set such that the spectral energy truncated at higher frequencies be negligible for the dynamic description of the wave field in later applications we use k max 20 k p min δ x 2 π 2 δ x with δ x the distance between two consecutive observation points and k p the wavenumber of the peak spectral energy 3 4 group velocities for the determination of the prediction zone in applications the cutoff frequencies calculated as discussed above may be too restrictive to estimate the evolution of the prediction zone i e due to the asymptotic behavior of the wave spectrum as the wavenumber goes to infinity the high cutoff wavenumber tends to be larger than necessary instead the group velocities c g 1 2 governing the evolution of the prediction zone boundaries are defined on the basis of angular frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 corresponding to a low and high minimum energy threshold respectively in the wave energy density spectrum as 18 s η ω 1 s η ω 2 μ s η ω p where s η ω is the wave energy density spectrum ω p is the peak angular frequency and μ 1 is a small fraction of the peak spectral energy μ 0 05 is used throughout the paper in the following the linear deep water dispersion relationship is used to estimate the group velocities from ω 1 2 i e c g g 2 ω 4 experimental and numerical frameworks applications presented hereafter are based on surface elevations measured in laboratory experiments and computed in corresponding numerical simulations both data sets are referred to full scale wave parameters but they are both performed at a ℓ 1 50 geometric scale corresponding time scale is t ℓ 7 06 under froude scaling for long crested wave trains generated in the oceanic 3d tank of école centrale de nantes ecn which is 50 m long 30 m wide and d 5 m deep waves are generated at one side of the tank by 48 individual rotating flaps and absorbed by a beach at the other extremity numerical simulations are performed using the open source code hos nwt 1 1 https github com lheea hos nwt developed at ecn it makes use of the hos method to simulate a numerical wave tank and has been extensively used and validated against real wave tank experiments bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2012 based on a pseudo spectral approach the hos method solves to an arbitrary order m in wave steepness the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions for a velocity potential a converged estimate of the potential for which a value of m 7 is used hereafter gives access to the fully nonlinear solution in section 6 this numerical model is used to improve the analysis pertaining to the experimental results as waves of characteristic wave steepness larger than h s λ p 0 035 where λ p 2 π k p is the peak wavelength will start breaking a wave breaking model allowing to both detect impending breaking and absorb wave energy is used in hos nwt seiffert et al 2017 seiffert and ducrozet 2018 the same wavemaker motion is specified in both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations which ensures a consistent comparison between experimental and numerical results in the following we first detail the experimental and numerical setups used to acquire compute surface elevation data an analysis of experimental measurements is then performed through the characterization of noisy perturbations finally we present relevant indicators of the quality of free surface prediction and the procedure implemented to reliably evaluate them 4 1 description of the experimental modeling setups as shown in fig 2 spatial sampling of a free surface elevation by an optical sensor exhibits gaps due to shadowing effects from the illuminated wave fronts and assuming a uniform distribution of beams over the sensor s aperture angles measurement points density geometrically decreases with the distance from the sensor in experiments simulations free surface elevations are measured computed at 22 wave gauges resistive probes in experiments irregularly distributed along the wave direction of propagation consistent with an optical sensor facing the wavemaker side of the tank the first 20 measurement points have a decreasing density away from it corresponding to the intersection with a surface of uniformly angularly spaced beams propagating away from a point source e g lidar camera we consider the illumination of a flat surface which allowed us to position the gauges vertically into the water this way wave shadowing effects are not reproduced but only the geometrically decreasing density of observations which is the prominent source of irregularity in the measurement points locations the virtual sensor is located at an elevation z c 30 m 0 6 m in tank scale z c λ p 0 19 and aimed at the water surface with an angle α 7 6 and 20 virtual beams which are uniformly spread over an aperture angle of α a 2 0 see fig 2 for a representation of α and α a the resulting geometrical distribution of the wave gauge locations is depicted in fig 3 two additional gauges measure downstream elevations for comparison with predictions every gauge is labeled according to its x location from 1 for that closest to the wavemaker to 22 for that furthest away wave gauges provide observations that are used as input to the surface reconstruction and prediction algorithms the number of spatial observations is thus constant at j 20 and the number of observation times k depends on the assimilation time duration t a and data acquisition time step τ as k t a τ in both experiments and numerical simulations we consider a full scale one directional wave field extracted from a jonswap spectrum with a t p 10 s peak period 1 41 s in tank scale and a γ 3 3 peakedness parameter eight sea states were generated using the same set of wave phases table 1 with their significant wave height h s h m 0 4 m 0 where m 0 0 s η f d f selected such that the characteristic steepness h s λ p varies between 0 6 and 5 with λ p 156 m 3 12 m in tank scale in tank scale we have λ p d which confirms that the deep water approximation is applicable a theoretical wavemaker motion is deduced by applying a transfer function based on the one directional finite depth linear wavemaker theory and on the wavemaker geometry which is for both experiments and simulations a rotating flap that is hinged three meters below the mean surface level the amplitude of the wavemaker deflection is adjusted according to the target h s values without further consideration the obtained theoretical motion serves as input for our physical and numerical wavemakers we notice differences between the target and generated significant wave heights refer to section 4 2 for the explicit formulation eq for the calculation of h s in experiments h s values are found consistently lower than target values for sea states of small to moderate steepness cases a to d this is mainly explained by the wavemaker transfer function leading the physical wavemaker to generate waves of lower amplitude than according to the input in contrast simulations yield h s values that are slightly higher than the targets by an amount that is of the same order of magnitude as the expected effect pertaining to the wave reflection on the beach i e lower than 1 since the numerical beach is set such that its reflection rate corresponds to the physical one wave reflection is expected to have a similar effect on the experimental results i e very limited for high steepness i e h s λ p 3 5 cases e to h wave breaking events appear dissipating energy and reducing our estimates of h s wave breaking dissipation is encountered in both experiments and simulations due to the wave breaking modeling in the numerical model 4 2 analysis of experimental data fig 4 shows a typical time series of surface elevation measured at a resistive probe in laboratory experiments time t 0 corresponds to the start of the wavemaker motion i e the beginning of wave generation at time t a it is estimated based on a truncation of the prescribed wave energy spectrum similar to section 3 4 that all the energetic wave components generated at the wavemaker have been seen by all gauges at time t b the wavemaker is shutdown and waves generation is interrupted finally similar to the determination of t a at time t c it is estimated that all the generated energetic wave components have propagated past all gauges based on this the data used for the wave field prediction study is restricted to the time interval t a t b with t b t a 173 t p it is desirable to analyze and quantify the influence of the perturbations pertaining to the limitations of our experimental setup referred to as noise throughout this work on the recorded wave signal this is done by considering that the rest of the data acquired at wave gauges for a few dozen peak wave periods beyond t t c provides a representation of noise during the entire data acquisition duration based on this data a noise to signal ratio nsr h n h s is computed as a function of characteristic heights for both the primary wave t t a t b and noise t t c signals following 19 h s 1 n p j 1 n p 4 σ η x j t a t t b a h n 1 n p j 1 n p 4 σ η x j t t c b respectively where σ η x t denotes the standard deviation of the free surface elevation η x t and n p 22 wave gauges the nsr is computed for each case a to h in table 1 and plotted in fig 5a as a function of the corresponding characteristic wave steepness we see that the nsr decreases as a function of wave steepness with the largest value being about 25 for the smallest steepness and the smallest value being about 11 5 for the largest steepness it thus appears that the geometry of our experimental set up in a 3d wave tank allowing the generation of directional wave fields may have significantly affected the targeted one directional wave fields as will be detailed in section 6 3 this potentially large nsr may affect the performance of the wave prediction algorithm to better quantify noise effects on the desired experimental data and relate the generated noise to a physical process we computed the power spectral density s n of the noisy part of the signal t t c for each steepness the spectrum was averaged over results obtained at the 22 wave gauges and normalized as s n s n f p m 0 where m 0 h n 2 16 is the zeroth order moment of the spectrum these normalized noise spectra were found to be nearly identical for each steepness fig 5b shows their average which is composed of a narrow banded peak centered on 1 1 f p and a broad banded high frequency part of much lower amplitude the wave spectrum calculated on t a t b is given on the same figure as a visual help for interpretation fig 6 shows normalized surface elevations of the noise signal η h n in which frequencies f 1 4 f p have been removed by filtering i e these correspond to the dominant part of the noise signal it shows that elevations for case a at wave gauges 1 to 22 which are aligned along the x direction are mostly in phase suggesting that the dominant experimental noise may be caused by resonant excitations of transverse modes in the 3d wave tank this hypothesis is confirmed by our visual observations of these waves during calm down times between measurements and is explained by the presence of small interstices between the wavemaker flaps locally generating transverse disturbances the much less energetic noisy components of the signal with frequencies f 1 4 f p were not found to be in phase indicating that they result from aleatory processes 4 3 misfit indicators definitions the misfit indicator used to quantify the accuracy of the predicted wave field is defined as 20 e x t 1 n s i 1 n s η i x t η r i x t h s where η is the predicted surface elevation and η r is the reference surface measured or calculated depending on whether experimental or numerical data is used to better assess its overall behavior the misfit is averaged over n s surface samples denoted by index i an unbiased estimate can only be obtained for a large number of samples from independent wave field realizations i e of different sets of random wave phases with to the limit n s instead we elected to generate one single surface realization per sea state but to record or compute wave gauge data over a long time so that the signals can be split into a sufficiently large number of samples of meaningful duration t a additionally the number of samples is increased by selecting them as partially overlapping i e shifting them in time by δ t t a as illustrated in fig 7 therefore the information used to estimate the misfit is the surface elevation data in the total time window covered by the samples which has a duration t c t a n s 1 δ t a similar approach was employed in naaijen et al 2014 to investigate the spatio temporal evolution of the prediction zone based on experimental and numerical data the wave field prediction error at a specific location x is finally computed by averaging the corresponding misfit over the theoretical time prediction zone t t min t max as 21 e p x 1 t max t min t min t max e x t d t fig 8 shows for case e the evolution of the wave field prediction error e p computed as a function of the amount of data used to calculate it quantified by the relative duration t c t p of the time window used to evaluate the misfit e we see that the prediction error converges for t c t p 60 note that the wave gauge network used to generate the observations covers a zone only slightly larger than 2 λ p if this zone was larger the optimal number of peak wave periods for the sampling time window would likely be less than 60 additionally for deterministic comparison we make use of the cross correlation between time series corresponding to the predicted and the measured surface elevations which provides a correlation factor c as a function of a time lag t the maximal value of the correlation factor and its corresponding time lag can be interpreted as the correspondence in terms of shape and amplitude of the two elevations and as an estimate of the time shift between the two elevations respectively the cross correlation is defined by 22 c t 1 t max t min t min t max η t η r t t d t where t min max are the prediction zone boundaries and η t η t σ η t min t t max is the normalized free surface elevation similarly η r η r σ η r for the reference surface 5 prediction error sensitivity to reconstruction algorithm we first assess the sensitivity of the prediction error to both the method used linear or nonlinear and parameters of the assimilation procedure namely the assimilation time t a and the time shift of the assimilated data τ for case a which corresponds to a mild characteristic wave steepness of 0 65 fig 9a shows that the linear prediction error converges well as t a increases for the three considered τ values although convergence is slower for larger τ hence the converged error is independent of the time resolution of observations this is a consequence of the characteristics of the physical description emerging from observations as the assimilation time increases the diversity of wave processes included in the assimilated information is enhanced with respect to the relevant physics simulated in the model causing the prediction error to converge additionally the accuracy of the description of physical phenomena which is directly function of the time resolution of observations affects the prediction error convergence rate for a given assimilation time t a a smaller time step τ will yield a prediction error closer to the converged value for the predictions presented later we keep τ t p 0 07 for case e which corresponds to a larger wave steepness of 3 18 and hence a fairly nonlinear case fig 9b shows that overall prediction errors are larger than for case a increasing from 0 005 0 05 to 0 05 0 075 fig 9b also shows that as could be expected for this nonlinear case the prediction errors are larger with the linear method than with the nonlinear method finally the convergence of the nonlinear method to achieve an approximately constant value of ε p requires a slightly larger t a than for the linear method this can be explained by the higher level of physics represented in the icwm model than in lwt which requires larger time scales to achieve convergence 6 prediction results and discussion applications of the reconstruction and forecasting algorithms to cases of table 1 are presented in the following and the accuracy of the wave field forecast is discussed in particular in terms of its sensitivity to the linear or nonlinear methods used 6 1 wave group analysis all cases in table 1 correspond to sea states generated using a jonswap spectrum with identical peak period t p 10 s at full scale and peakedness γ 3 3 but a different significant wave height h s and hence characteristic wave steepness h s λ p in both the physical and numerical wave tanks these sea states are generated using the same set of random phases so time series of surface elevations should be similar except for small changes in amplitude due to nonlinear effects proportional to h s in the following we analyze the prediction error for a group of 8 waves of elevation on the order of η 0 5 h s approximately centered at t 113 t p recorded simulated at wave gauge 22 for cases a to h see fig 4 the data used in the prediction algorithms was selected for the prediction zone to span t 108 t p to 118 t p at the location of gauge 22 fig 10 shows time series of surface elevations for these wave groups in cases a e and h compared to predictions of the linear lwt linear corrected lwt cdr and nonlinear icwm models using experimental a c e and numerical b d f data for each case only small differences due to experimental noise can be seen between the experimentally and numerically generated reference surfaces while there is an overall agreement between the reference and predicted surfaces differences in wave phase and elevation increase with wave steepness due to cumulative effects of nonlinearity during wave propagation accordingly for the smallest wave steepness case a all three models predict the same surface elevation in good agreement with references particularly for numerical data b for which predictions almost perfectly overlap the hos solution but predictions become increasingly different between the three algorithms the larger the characteristic wave steepness although differences do not appear visually large this is more pronounced for the algorithm based on icwm which as will be shown next using various prediction error metrics provides the most accurate prediction differences between the reference measured or simulated with hos surface elevations and those predicted by the three algorithms are quantified by their maximum cross correlation max c i e normalized convolution eq 22 and corresponding time lag t s arg max c both parameters are shown in fig 11 for all cases in table 1 based on time series measured or simulated at the location of wave gauge 22 e g fig 10 the former quantifies the accuracy of the prediction in terms of wave shape and amplitude while the latter quantifies the time shift of the predicted signal compared to the reference signal fig 11a b show that for all prediction algorithms time lag increases with wave steepness i e nonlinearity from 0 for the smallest steepness to a few percent of t p for the largest one consistent with the expected effects of nonlinearity as seen for instance in the time series of fig 10 lwt yields the largest time lags compared to the nonlinear models lwt cdr which includes a phase shift correction provides a time lag very close to that of icwm particularly for the simulated data indicating that the nonlinear phase shift prevails over the nonlinear wave geometry represented in the latter model for these cases also the rate of increase of time lag with wave steepness is similar whether or not the nonlinear phase shift is included in the model this result is unexpected since this phase shift its due to nonlinear amplitude dispersion which is function of wave steepness fig 11c d show the maximum cross correlations for the same cases consistent with the larger time lag max c mostly decreases the larger the wave steepness to reach a minimum of 96 for the largest wave steepness except for case g which is discussed below the maximum cross correlation is larger using icwm which is expected since only this model is able to represent nonlinear wave geometry the abnormal behavior of case g which is seen in both the experimental and numerical data likely results from a significant increase in wave breaking events within the considered wave group for this case note for case h which has an even larger steepness wave phases were such that breaking was not as widespread as for case g wave breaking affects wave geometry in a non trivial manner and is not represented in icwm in the case of the wave group considered here for some unknown reason it appears that broken waves are better represented in the linear model than using icwm finally fig 12 shows results similar to fig 11 using icwm for numerical or experimental data at wave gauges 20 21 and 22 observations are acquired and reconstructed at wave gauge 20 which is the last gauge used in observations and predictions are made at the other 2 gauges which are increasingly distant from it fig 3 for both the experimental and numerical data the time lags and their rates of increase with wave steepness are lower for prediction locations closer to the observation gauge fig 12a b this results from inaccuracies in nonlinear wave propagation modeled by icwm which yield increasing differences in predicted surface elevations with time or space traveled compared to the reference data consistent with this observation fig 12c d show that for steepnesses larger than 2 5 the maximum cross correlation decreases as the distance of the prediction gauge to the observation location increases 6 2 instantaneous misfit of wave prediction we investigate next the evolution of the instantaneous misfit e x t of the wave prediction for case e which corresponds to a moderate steepness although nonlinear effects already have a marked influence on the wave field dynamics for both experimental and numerical cases we compare the misfit obtained using the lwt lwt cdr and icwm prediction algorithms fig 13 shows the temporal evolution of the wave prediction misfit computed using different algorithms with respect to data simulated for case e at both gauge 22 a and for all gauges b the misfit at gauge 22 is significantly lower within the accessible prediction zone t min t max fig 13a reaching a minimum value of about 3 5 for icwm compared to about 4 5 for lwt whose misfit is consistently about 30 larger than that of icwm within the time prediction zone the error gradually slightly increases due to the limited physics represented in both wave models in the spatio temporal domain fig 13b icwm s misfit is lowest within the theoretical prediction zone reaching a maximum of about 7 along its boundary as the x location of the wave gauge increases the misfit gradient decreases across the prediction zone upper boundary t max or in other words the transition of the misfit values from within to outside the prediction zone becomes more diffused which is due to the dispersion of the assimilated information more specifically as detailed in section 3 2 the energy associated with the reconstructed wave components disperses as x increases gradually limiting the physical description of the wave field even within the spatio temporal region corresponding to the observations black rectangle in fig 13b the misfit is non zero since observations are discrete rather than continuous samples of elevations hence the reconstructed elevation nowcast is always an estimate of the reference solution note that the accessible prediction horizon in the depicted configuration is t max t r 3 7 t p and 4 3 t p at gauges 21 and 22 respectively and is expected to further increase at larger distances at the expense of the prediction accuracy then from the location where the beginning of the prediction zone t min matches the reconstruction time t r the accessible horizon starts decreasing for the same case e fig 14 shows for both experimental or simulated reference data the spatio temporal evolution of the ratio of the nonlinear icwm to linear lwt a b or linear with corrected dispersion lwt cdr c d wave prediction misfit for the simulated data fig 14b the misfit is reduced by up to 35 within the prediction zone when using icwm instead of lwt compared to lwt cdr fig 14d the reduction is smaller and mostly limited to the spatio temporal region of assimilated data within the solid box particularly where the wave gauge density is larger outside of this region t t a 7 t p time propagation or at the location of gauges 21 and 22 space propagation the misfit ratio rapidly approaches one indicating that the improvement achieved using icwm rather than lwt cdr becomes negligible for the experimental data fig 14a c similar patterns are observed but the improvement achieved using icwm is not as pronounced as for simulated data these results indicate that the improved representation of nonlinear wave geometry using icwm mostly affects the accuracy of the reconstructed part of the wave field once reconstructed waves are propagated to the prediction zone the nonlinear phase shift which is corrected in lwt cdr to the same level as in icwm becomes the main source of error and effects of nonlinear wave geometry become negligible compared to it the wave models are parameterized to provide a relevant and consistent approximation of the wave field over the entire region covered by the observations hence while the reconstructed wave field is constrained to fit the measurements when waves are propagated to issue a prediction only their propagation properties featured in the models come into play 6 3 influence of experimental noise on wave prediction the prediction misfits based on numerical and experimental reference data are compared in fig 15 at gauges 20 21 and 22 for all cases listed in table 1 using the linear lwt or nonlinear icwm algorithms to better assess the effect of experimental noise on the prediction misfit a noisy numerical dataset was created by adding to the numerical data a noise signal having the same spectral shape or nsr as that analyzed for the experiments fig 5b scaled by the measured noise amplitude h n fig 5a with independent random phases for each wave gauge as would be expected for both algorithms the prediction misfits are larger at all wave gauges using experimental data as compared to noise free numerical data particularly for cases with a lower steepness which have relatively larger noise levels using the noisy numerical data however prediction misfits increase to nearly match those of the experimental data this indicates that the noisy numerical data is consistent with the experimental data and provides a digital twin of experiments that explains for the most part differences observed between predictions issued for experimental and noise free numerical data 6 4 application to remote sensing free surface slope prediction in the free surface elevation predictions described above the nonlinear phase correction was responsible for the main relative improvement in prediction misfit rather than the nonlinear wave geometry represented in icwm while for many ocean engineering applications predicting instantaneous free surface elevations is most important such as when computing wave forces or runup on structures or controlling a wave energy converter in some applications such as remote sensing the main parameter of interest is free surface slope which governs the backscattered signal to the radar or optical sensor used e g nouguier et al 2010 2014 hence in the following we quantify the improvement in free surface slopes representation achieved using icwm rather than lwt cdr more specifically at the location of wave gauge 20 we analyze the evolution as a function of wave steepness of the maximum prediction misfit ratio e i c w m p e l w t c d r p for both surface elevation and slope as the distance between gauges 19 and 20 is small 0 02 λ p the wave surface slope can be approximated by 23 s t η x 20 t η x 19 t x 20 x 19 where η denotes the reference or predicted surface elevation and x 19 20 the location of gauge 19 and 20 we calculate the slope prediction misfit by replacing η with s in eq 20 results in fig 16 show a consistently lower misfit ratio for the slope prediction whether experimental or numerical data is used although in the latter case the ratios are lower in absolute value indicating that unlike with surface elevation predictions geometrical nonlinearities included in icwm provide a significant improvement for predicting surface slopes further in icwm geometrical nonlinearities are second order in wave steepness whereas nonlinear phase shifts are third order nouguier et al 2009 2010 guérin et al 2019 accordingly in fig 16 the improved performance of icwm for predicting surface slopes is much more significant at small wave steepness when third order effects are not prominent yet additionally when using numerical data the misfit ratios for surface elevation and slope predictions become increasingly close the larger the wave steepness with experimental data the residual noise causes higher frequency surface oscillations that significantly affect the slope calculation and prevent a proper evaluation of the corresponding prediction misfit hence in fig 16 both elevation and slope misfit ratios are close to one at low wave steepness when initializing a nonlinear model based on a superposition of harmonics linearly extracted from a standard wave spectrum such as here a jonswap nonlinearity in the model equations will cause the generation of higher frequency wave components that will translate into additional spectral energy at those frequencies from the onset likewise waves generated in a wave tank based on a similar standard spectrum will evolve nonlinearly which results in energy transfer towards higher frequencies this energy redistribution in wave spectra is referred to as the dressing process nouguier et al 2009 in our applications it is thus the dressed spectrum that is calculated based on the reference surface both in experiments and simulations this is illustrated in fig 17 which shows the normalized energy density spectra of the free surface s η s η f p h s 2 16 computed for case e over the time interval corresponding to the prediction zone t min t max at the location of gauge 20 waves are only generated by both experimental and numerical wavemakers in the frequency range f f l f h with f l 0 68 f p and f h 2 18 f p the low and high cut off frequencies respectively within this frequency range fig 17a c spectral amplitudes agree well with each other for the reference data and all wave models however as a result of nonlinearity in the reference data for f f h fig 17b d energy increases in all cases as compared to the targeted spectrum more specifically while for f f h spectral amplitudes are lower in all the models than in the reference data icwm provides results in much better agreement with the latter particularly for the numerical reference data and lwt and lwt cdr provide similar results both lower than those of icwm these results confirm that high frequency wave components that predominantly affect wave slope predictions are more accurately predicted with the latter model due to its representation of nonlinear wave geometry e g sharper crests 7 conclusions in the context of the deterministic prediction of ocean surface waves we assessed and compared the accuracy of three ocean wave prediction algorithms based on three wave models having different nonlinear properties the algorithms were tested against data time series of surface elevation acquired for long crested wave fields using wave gauges in wave tank experiments as well as in simulations of similar experiments with a high order numerical wave tank a number of test cases were defined with different characteristic wave steepness from mildly to more strongly nonlinear the set of wave gauges physical or numerical was non uniformly distributed in space to mimic the typical uneven sampling made by optical sensors at grazing incidence the wave models used in the prediction algorithms were inverted based on the wave gauge data and reconstructed waves were then propagated with the models residual oscillations observed in the physical wave tank were investigated and found to result from perturbations caused by the wavemaker these oscillations were identified as the principal cause for observed differences between the experimental and numerical data adding the experimental noise to numerical reference data in fact led to similar levels of wave prediction misfit or accuracy as when using experimental data our study showed that the prediction accuracy of the algorithms quantified by a misfit parameter converged with the duration of the assimilated surface elevation time series i e amount of data used in addition smaller data acquisition time steps yielded higher convergence rates and the larger the characteristic wave steepness the larger the prediction error in the form of nonlinear phase shifts related to wave phase velocity and wave shape discrepancies the recently developed improved choppy wave model icwm introduced in guérin et al 2019 yielded improved predictions within the accessible prediction zone as compared to a linear wave model with a maximum prediction misfit reduction of 35 for an intermediate wave steepness h s λ p 3 18 based on numerical data in the spatio temporal region corresponding to the observations the wave shape asymmetry represented in icwm improved the surface elevation representation for waves that had propagated in space and or time the main factor for reducing the prediction misfit was the accurate modeling of nonlinear wave phase velocity for surface slope predictions however the improved representation of wave shape asymmetry in icwm allowed to achieve an average prediction misfit reduction of 20 over the prediction zone for a low wave steepness of 1 2 as compared to a linear model with a phase speed correction lwt cdr note that higher order wave models e g hos mnls are expected to further improve the prediction accuracy but only provided that the assimilation procedure yields the correct initial model parameters which becomes increasingly complex and time consuming when the model order increases using such models to propagate waves will also require a much larger computational effort lessons learned in this study will help applying our prediction algorithms to data acquired at sea using optical sensor systems such as lidars e g belmont et al 2007 nouguier et al 2014 as the method described here is directly applicable for predicting directional wave fields further investigation of the

21687,we assess the capability of fast wave models to deterministically predict nonlinear ocean surface waves from non uniformly distributed data such as sampled from an optical ocean sensor linear and weakly nonlinear prediction algorithms are applied to long crested irregular waves based on a set of laboratory experiments and corresponding numerical simulations an array of wave gauges is used for data acquisition representing the typical spatial sampling an optical sensor e g lidar would make at grazing incidence predictions of the weakly nonlinear improved choppy wave model are compared to those of the linear wave theory with and without a nonlinear dispersion relationship correction wave models are first inverted based on gauge data which provides the initial model parameters then propagated to issue a prediction we find that the wave prediction accuracy converges with the amount of input data used in the inversion when waves are propagated in the models correctly modeling the nonlinear wave phase velocity provides the main improvement in accuracy while including nonlinear wave shape effects only improves surface elevation representation in the spatio temporal region where input data are acquired surface slope prediction accuracy however strongly depends on the appropriate nonlinear wave shape modeling keywords ocean waves nonlinear waves deterministic prediction wave tank experiments 1 introduction the availability of real time phase resolved wave fields is key for the optimization of a vast range of marine applications the prediction and control of the wave induced motion is crucially important to extend the operational envelope and optimal maneuvering of many surface vessels such as to stabilize aircraft or helicopter carriers during takeoff landing manoeuvres ships during ship to ship transfer or to perform installation and maintenance operations on marine structures for ocean renewable energy harvesting systems advance knowledge of incoming waves conditions the performances of control strategies for instance it is shown that the optimal control of wave energy converters relying on wave to wave predictions significantly improves their efficiency li et al 2012 also the life time of floating wind turbines could be increased by mitigating fatigue loads through appropriate control of the structure motions induced by wave loads ma et al 2018 the deterministic prediction of ocean wave fields requires inverting a model describing the wave dynamics based on a set of observations i e measurements that contain information about the wave

next ocean naaijen et al 2018 or futurewaves kusters et al 2016 have been used to generate large spatio temporal data sets of wave elevations surrounding the structure upon which they are mounted such radars make use of the backscattered signal resulting from the bragg resonance between the radar microwaves 3 cm wavelength and short wavelength capillary gravity waves 1 5 cm wavelength covering the ocean surface due to wind generation hydrodynamic and tilt modulations of such short ripples by longer gravity waves carrying them that affect the backscattered signal allow inverting for surface

to estimate gravity waves characteristics lidar cameras provide direct geo referenced measurements of free surface elevations computed based on laser beam travel times one advantage of this technique as compared to x band radars is the higher spatial resolution resulting from the smaller divergence of the laser beams compared to the microwave beams sviridov 1993 providing a more accurate phase resolved instantaneous measurement of the ocean surface when mounted on an ocean structure or surface vessel to remotely measure ocean surface elevations both x band radar and lidar camera have limitations resulting from the grazing incidence angles of the beams first it will cause wave shadowing effects leading data sets acquired by these systems to exhibit spatial gaps behind illuminated wave fronts which have an area increasing with the distance from the sensor second assuming a uniform distribution of beams over the sensor s aperture angles the density of the measurement points geometrically decreases with the distance from the sensor in the case of x band radars shadowing effects are used to generate a shadowing mask that is implemented in the mtf used for wave inversion nieto borge et al 2004 for lidar cameras the lack of information in the shadowed area can be compensated for by using spatio temporal data sets i e at a slightly later time shadowed areas without measurement points can become illuminated due to wave motion this however also requires performing a spatio temporal wave field inversion grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 desmars et al 2018 in addition to generating spatial gaps shadowing effects cause laser beams to hit the ocean surface at unknown horizontal locations leading the measurement points to be distributed over an a priori unknown unstructured grid these properties together with the non periodicity of observations prevent using standard signal processing techniques based on fourier decomposition in the wave inversion unless a pre or post processing method is used e g interpolation end matching filtering due to real time constraints i e sufficient computational efficiency existing deterministic wave prediction systems have typically used models based on linear wave theory lwt hilmer and thornhill 2015 kusters et al 2016 naaijen et al 2018 however this limits their applicability to sea states with a small characteristic steepness and further assumes that i bound waves i e harmonic waves that do not obey the dispersion relation can be neglected and ii the space and time scales of observations and the prediction horizon do not allow time dependent nonlinear wave wave interactions e g nonlinear phase shift to significantly affect wave dynamics whenever these limitations are not met the accurate prediction of ocean surface waves will require modeling weakly or fully nonlinear wave properties weakly nonlinear models have been developed and used for wave simulation and prediction based on expanding eulerian wave properties up to the second order in wave steepness e g zhang et al 1996 1999 which for instance allows separating free and bound wave components in wave measurements a model based on the modified nonlinear schrödinger mnls equation which simulates third order wave properties such as phase speed was used to predict bichromatic waves trulsen and stansberg 2001 then extended to both one directional and directional irregular seas simanesew et al 2017 the latter study showed that the mnls equation is able to provide satisfactory predictions of long crested irregular waves but the lack of directional input data prevented properly estimating its prediction performance for short crested waves with increasing directional spread higher order wave models based on the high order spectral hos method were also applied for nonlinear prediction of ocean surfaces e g wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 qi et al 2018a based on a pseudo spectral approach this method solves the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions to an arbitrary order for a velocity potential and allows to simulate the propagation of any wave fields over large space and time scales with a high accuracy predictions of long crested irregular waves using both hos lwt and nonlinear schrödinger approaches were recently compared klein et al 2020 showing that the appropriate modeling of nonlinear dispersion effects plays a significant role from moderate to high wave steepness with hos being the most accurate prediction model the main counterpoint of hos is its initialization process that necessitates a high number of operations exponentially increasing with its order of nonlinearity recent works have been carried out on improved assimilation methods for hos to be adequate for real time prediction köllisch et al 2018 fujimoto and waseda 2020 in this study we apply and experimentally validate a wave reconstruction and prediction algorithm based on the recently developed improved choppy wave model icwm guérin et al 2019 which extends with higher order corrections the weakly nonlinear lagrangian choppy wave model nouguier et al 2009 which was used in our earlier work on ocean wave reconstruction algorithms based on lidar camera data grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the wave models that are used in this study namely the lwt the icwm and a linear wave model corrected with a nonlinear dispersion relation section 3 details the data assimilation procedure that is employed here as well as key aspects relative to the determination of the accessible prediction zone section 4 describes the experimental and numerical modeling setups used in our applications together with an analysis of the experimental data perturbations followed by definitions of the prediction misfit indicators used in this study section 5 investigates the sensitivity of the proposed prediction algorithms to assimilation parameters their accuracy is finally discussed in section 6 2 wave models while it is desirable to account for the nonlinearity of ocean waves the development of fast methods for the real time reconstruction and prediction of nonlinear sea states cannot be easily or efficiently achieved using complex i e highly nonlinear wave models such as based on a hos method e g wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 qi et al 2018a instead the wave model used to this effect should be able to properly account for salient nonlinear effects in the propagation of the considered wave fields while being sufficiently efficient for providing real time predictions here we consider and compare two wave models one based on linear wave theory lwt and a weakly nonlinear wave model referred to as choppy wave model cwm derived in an explicit efficient lagrangian formalism the improved form of cwm referred to as improved choppy wave model icwm guérin et al 2019 is used in the present applications both models provide an analytical expression of the free surface elevation which can be efficiently initiated the assimilation procedure is detailed in section 3 1 and propagated forward in time to forecast the future state of a given wave field the latter being simply obtained by increasing the value of time in the formulation we limit our developments to the deep water assumption but the extension to intermediate depth is straightforward 2 1 linear wave theory lwt refers here to the equations derived from the classical eulerian approach for an inviscid incompressible fluid with an irrotational motion linearized with respect to the wave steepness let us consider a cartesian coordinate system x y z with the x and y horizontal axes located at the mean water surface and the z axis being vertical and positive upward under lwt a generic irregular ocean surface wave field is simply represented as the superposition of n 1 n individual harmonic wave components propagating in the horizontal plane r x y in direction θ n with respect to the x axis of amplitude a n and angular frequency ω n following 1 η lin r t n 1 n a n cos k n r ω n t φ n where t is time φ n are phases and k n k n k ˆ n k n cos θ n k n sin θ n and k n 2 π λ n k n are wavenumber vectors and wavenumbers respectively with λ n the wavelength with the latter found as k n ω n 2 g based on the deep water dispersion relationship and g the acceleration of gravity to simplify later mathematical developments the free surface will be equivalently described as 2 η lin r t n 1 n a n cos ψ n b n sin ψ n in which ψ n k n r ω n t are spatio temporal phases and a n b n a n cos φ n a n sin φ n are wave parameters describing the ocean surface 2 2 improved choppy wave model the cwm was derived based on a first order lagrangian description of water particle motions on the free surface nouguier et al 2009 and thus corresponds for a periodic wave to the classical gerstner wave model gerstner 1809 the cwm provides results that include features from a higher order eulerian wave theory e g second order stokes theory but the wave phase speed is still that given by lwt a recent improvement of the cwm was proposed to account for higher order nonlinear effects in particular on the wave phase speed without requiring a full second order lagrangian description guérin et al 2019 the resulting wave model icwm is used in the present work using a formalism similar to that introduced in the previous section icwm represents the free surface elevation z r 0 t as a function of time for water particles initially located at r 0 on the still water level at rest as 3 r r 0 t r 0 n 1 n k ˆ n a n sin ψ n b n cos ψ n u s 0 t a z r 0 t n 1 n a n cos ψ n b n sin ψ n n 1 n 1 2 a n 2 b n 2 k n b where ψ n k n r 0 ω n t denote phases of wave components ω n ω n 1 2 k n u s 0 modified angular frequencies and u s 0 n 1 n a n 2 b n 2 ω n k n the free surface stokes drift vector the last term in eq 3a and in the modified angular frequency equation are nonlinear corrections added to the standard cwm which account for stokes drift effects on the free surface the last term in eq 3b accounts for a correction of the mean surface level typical measurements of ocean surfaces such as with an optical system are made at irregularly distributed locations defined in a reference coordinate system hence these are eulerian measurements the wave model used to reconstruct the ocean surface must thus be able to use similar information which makes the above lagrangian form of icwm not directly usable hence an approximate eulerian model equivalent to icwm is derived in the following introducing an approximation similar to that made of the cwm nouguier et al 2009 for which an efficient algorithm was developed based on computing horizontal displacements of a reference linear surface using efficient riesz and spatial fourier transforms an explicit relationship between r and z in eqs 3a and 3b could be derived by performing a taylor series expansion of particle vertical locations z around their instantaneous horizontal location r thus providing z r in this case however successive eulerian orders of expansion lose the lagrangian formulation s simplicity which makes the model inefficient here we first modify eqs 3a and 3b by implicitly incorporating the particle horizontal shift into a modified angular frequency ϕ n thus replacing r 0 by r 0 r 0 u s 0 t leading to 4 r r 0 t r r 0 t r 0 d r 0 r 0 n 1 n k ˆ n a n sin ϕ n b n cos ϕ n z r 0 t z r 0 t n 1 n a n cos ϕ n b n sin ϕ n n 1 n 1 2 a n 2 b n 2 k n where ϕ n k n r 0 ω l n t and ω l n ω n 1 2 k n u s 0 then as for the cwm nouguier et al 2009 a simple method for numerically evaluating icwm surface elevation at any spatial point is derived by computing the particle vertical displacement at its instantaneous rather than its reference location earlier work has shown grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 that errors due to this approximation are on the order of the mean square surface slope i e the second order moment of the wave spectrum 0 k 2 s η k d k which is expected to be small compared to other sources of error in the ocean surface reconstruction process hence assuming 5 z r 0 z r d r 0 z r d r η nl r eq 4 yields an explicit approximate nonlinear free surface elevation η nl at any spatial point r as 6 η nl r t n 1 n a n cos ψ n b n sin ψ n 1 2 a n 2 b n 2 k n ψ n k n r i 1 n k ˆ i a i sin ϕ i b i cos ϕ i ω l n t where the modified phases are now computed as ϕ i k i r ω l i t 2 3 linear wave theory with corrected dispersion relation to quantify effects of nonlinear wave phase corrections on our wave prediction results independently of the wave shape asymmetry represented in the icwm we will evaluate the performance of a third wave model referred to as lwt cdr which is based on lwt eq 2 but uses a dispersion relationship corrected by stokes drift as for the icwm i e the linear angular frequency ω n k is replaced by its nonlinear equivalent ω l n k this yields the corrected linear free surface elevation 7 η cl r t n 1 n a n cos ϕ n b n sin ϕ n 3 methods model based predictions rely on the model inversion from observations measured data for parameters specifying the initial conditions prior to model propagation this model initialization step referred to as the assimilation procedure is detailed in this section for the three wave models presented previously we then explain the method to determine theoretically the accessible spatio temporal prediction zone from the assimilated data 3 1 data assimilation procedure a standard method for assimilating wave elevation data is the variational approach blondel 2009 in which a cost function f representing the error between the measured wave field and its representation with a wave model is minimized here we assume that an a priori estimate of the solution is not available and statistical parameters of the aleatory error in observations or free surface elevation measurements are stationary i e they are not functions of time or space accordingly similar to earlier work grilli et al 2011 nouguier et al 2014 the cost function is expressed as the mean square of the difference between spatio temporal ocean observations and their model representation as 8 f p 1 2 k 1 k j 1 j η j k p η j k 2 1 2 ℓ 1 l η ℓ p η ℓ 2 in which p a n b n n 1 n is the control vector of 2 n unknown model parameters j and k are the number of spatial observations made at each observation time and the number of observation times respectively hence the total number of assimilated spatio temporal observations is j k l η j k or η ℓ are free surface elevations measured at spatial locations r j j 1 j and times t k k 1 k and η j k or η ℓ are estimates of these computed with the wave model i e with eq 2 for lwt eq 7 for lwt cdr or eq 6 for icwm model parameters are obtained next by minimizing the cost function with respect to these parameters and solving the system of equations 9 f a m 0 f b m 0 a m n p n b m where n m 1 n 2 and p n a n p n n b n constitute the unknown vector of 2 n model parameters associated to wave components of predefined wavenumbers k n the set of wavenumbers k n is distributed in k min k max following a decreasing logarithmic law with k min max defining the bandwidth of the reconstructed wave field see section 3 3 for details about how to choose k min max since the considered wave models have analytical formulations the system of eq 9 can be explicitly expressed note that in practice and to increase the accuracy of the parameter estimation the number of observations used l is larger than the number of wave components n used to perform the wave model inversion hence the optimal solution of an overdetermined system of equations is computed to assimilate data in the model which can be done using a least squares method accordingly to obtain an accurate solution the larger the spatio temporal region covered by the observations the larger the number of degrees of freedom required in the wave model in each application considered in the following n will be adequately selected to satisfy this constraint 3 1 1 linear assimilation linear wave fields are reconstructed by computing the cost function eq 8 using the linear wave model eq 2 thus in the minimization eq 9 we get a m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ cos ψ m ℓ a m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ cos ψ m ℓ 10 a n m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ sin ψ m ℓ a n m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ sin ψ m ℓ and 11 b m ℓ 1 l η ℓ cos ψ m ℓ b n m ℓ 1 l η ℓ sin ψ m ℓ where ψ m ℓ k m r ℓ ω m t ℓ 3 1 2 nonlinear assimilation nonlinear wave fields are reconstructed by computing the cost function eq 8 using the icwm eq 6 thus in the minimization eq 9 we now obtain a m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ 1 2 a n k n p m ℓ a m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ 1 2 b n k n p m ℓ 12 a n m n ℓ 1 l cos ψ n ℓ 1 2 a n k n q m ℓ a n m n n ℓ 1 l sin ψ n ℓ 1 2 b n k n q m ℓ and 13 b m ℓ 1 l η ℓ p m ℓ b n m ℓ 1 l η ℓ q m ℓ in which 14 p m ℓ cos ψ m ℓ k m a m sin ψ m ℓ b m cos ψ m ℓ sin ϕ m ℓ k m a m cos ϕ m ℓ b m sin ϕ m ℓ 1 a m ω m k m t ℓ a m k m q m ℓ sin ψ m ℓ k m a m sin ψ m ℓ b m cos ψ m ℓ cos ϕ m ℓ k m a m cos ϕ m ℓ b m sin ϕ m ℓ 1 b m ω m k m t ℓ b m k m since both a m n and b m now depend on model parameters a n b n the system of eq 9 must be solved iteratively following nouguier et al 2014 when solving for p n q 1 at iteration q 1 a m n q and b m q are computed based on wave parameters obtained at the previous iteration q the solution is initialized at q 0 by computing a m n 0 and b m 0 as for the linear reconstruction using eqs 10 and 11 based on a relative error between p n q and p n q 1 evaluated at each iteration q 1 convergence of the solution is typically achieved within a few to a few dozens iterations depending on the wave steepness this ensures a very efficient assimilation procedure in this nonlinear context as indicated above a third system of equations is solved for wave parameters corresponding to the lwt cdr eq 7 this formulation is not detailed here for the sake of conciseness 3 1 3 regularization of the inverse problem in operative applications the ocean reconstruction problem may become ill conditioned due to practical constraints such as the heterogeneous distribution of spatial observation points the limited ocean area observed by the optical sensor and the frequency and direction bandwidth cutoffs in the reconstructed wave field nevertheless consistent results can be achieved independently of the conditioning of the system matrix to invert i e a m n by applying a tikhonov regularization in which the matrix inversion is replaced by the following minimization problem 15 min a m n p n b m 2 ξ 2 p n 2 where ξ denotes the regularization parameter an optimal value of the regularization parameter can be found using the l curve method which consists in finding the ξ value corresponding to the point of maximal curvature i e corner of the parametric curve log a m n p n b m log p n this method provides an optimal compromise between minimizing the residual error of the assimilation system and ensuring that the norm of the solution does not become too large the l curve corner can be determined analytically through solving a singular value decomposition problem calvetti et al 2004 hansen 2000 note that this procedure is equivalent to adding a constraint to the minimization problem physically representing the total energy of the reconstructed wave spectrum since the latter is proportional to the squared norm of p n in this case ξ 2 can simply be interpreted as a lagrangian multiplier 3 2 accessible prediction zone from non uniform observations earlier work has shown that the spatio temporal region over which wave dynamics can be predicted based on a set of free surface measurements is bounded wu 2004 naaijen et al 2014 qi et al 2018b when measurements are made using an optical system at a specific sampling rate and over a given observation zone this limits the amount of data that can be assimilated and used in the wave reconstruction process yielding a reconstructed surface in space time defined with finite frequency and direction bandwidths in light of this the sea state prediction obtained by propagating the assimilated information is similarly limited to a spatio temporal region referred to as prediction zone in the following we show how the latter can be estimated for a set of fixed surface observations of a one directional wave field the accurate description of a wave field is limited to the knowledge of its wave components energy which propagates at the wave group velocity further sea states that are of interest in our study such as described by a jonswap wave spectrum yield a fairly concentrated energy around their peak frequency this allows using a finite frequency bandwidth to describe the evolution of such sea states hence the intersection of the slowest and fastest wave components in the finite frequency bandwidth of the wave field determine the boundary of the spatio temporal region within which an amount of information sufficient to issue a prediction is available consequently as time increases the accessible prediction region shrinks to eventually disappear when the assimilated information is completely dispersed fig 1 illustrates this phenomenon for a one directional wave field propagating in the x direction the latest time used in data assimilation corresponds to the reconstruction time t r t k k when only spatial data are used in the assimilation i e k 1 see fig 1a the prediction zone at reconstruction time p t r is the spatial area where observations were made however when spatio temporal data sets are acquired over an assimilation time t a see fig 1b p t r expands due to the advection of wave information during t a therefore a point x t t r is included in the prediction zone if 16 x b c g 1 t t r x x e c g 2 t t r where c g 1 and c g 2 are the fastest and slowest group velocities respectively and x b and x e define the beginning and the end of p t r fig 1 as 17 x b min j x j x e max j x j c g 2 t a where x j are spatial locations of the observations although future applications could rely on observations with spatial location variations i e x j functions of time the presented investigations are restricted to fixed measurement locations 3 3 bandwidths of the reconstructed wave field as mentioned above the accurate representation of the wave field dynamics can be ensured by selecting a finite wavenumber bandwidth having relevant cutoff limits k min max however the spatio temporal characteristics of the observation grid limit the wave information that is accessible for reconstruction thus imposing constraints on these cutoffs for instance the smallest wavenumber that is measurable in a given grid k min 2 π l o is function of the largest distance l o x e x b between two observation points at reconstruction time t r fig 1b at the same time x e is a function of the chosen minimum group velocity c g 2 of individual wave components in the wave field when reconstructing a wave field over a uniformly sampled observation grid i e one with constant spatial sampling the maximum high cutoff wavenumber must satisfy shannon s condition i e k max 2 π 2 ℓ o where ℓ o is the distance between two observation points however using an optical sensing method the observation grid is highly non uniform and k max must be set such that the spectral energy truncated at higher frequencies be negligible for the dynamic description of the wave field in later applications we use k max 20 k p min δ x 2 π 2 δ x with δ x the distance between two consecutive observation points and k p the wavenumber of the peak spectral energy 3 4 group velocities for the determination of the prediction zone in applications the cutoff frequencies calculated as discussed above may be too restrictive to estimate the evolution of the prediction zone i e due to the asymptotic behavior of the wave spectrum as the wavenumber goes to infinity the high cutoff wavenumber tends to be larger than necessary instead the group velocities c g 1 2 governing the evolution of the prediction zone boundaries are defined on the basis of angular frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 corresponding to a low and high minimum energy threshold respectively in the wave energy density spectrum as 18 s η ω 1 s η ω 2 μ s η ω p where s η ω is the wave energy density spectrum ω p is the peak angular frequency and μ 1 is a small fraction of the peak spectral energy μ 0 05 is used throughout the paper in the following the linear deep water dispersion relationship is used to estimate the group velocities from ω 1 2 i e c g g 2 ω 4 experimental and numerical frameworks applications presented hereafter are based on surface elevations measured in laboratory experiments and computed in corresponding numerical simulations both data sets are referred to full scale wave parameters but they are both performed at a ℓ 1 50 geometric scale corresponding time scale is t ℓ 7 06 under froude scaling for long crested wave trains generated in the oceanic 3d tank of école centrale de nantes ecn which is 50 m long 30 m wide and d 5 m deep waves are generated at one side of the tank by 48 individual rotating flaps and absorbed by a beach at the other extremity numerical simulations are performed using the open source code hos nwt 1 1 https github com lheea hos nwt developed at ecn it makes use of the hos method to simulate a numerical wave tank and has been extensively used and validated against real wave tank experiments bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2012 based on a pseudo spectral approach the hos method solves to an arbitrary order m in wave steepness the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions for a velocity potential a converged estimate of the potential for which a value of m 7 is used hereafter gives access to the fully nonlinear solution in section 6 this numerical model is used to improve the analysis pertaining to the experimental results as waves of characteristic wave steepness larger than h s λ p 0 035 where λ p 2 π k p is the peak wavelength will start breaking a wave breaking model allowing to both detect impending breaking and absorb wave energy is used in hos nwt seiffert et al 2017 seiffert and ducrozet 2018 the same wavemaker motion is specified in both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations which ensures a consistent comparison between experimental and numerical results in the following we first detail the experimental and numerical setups used to acquire compute surface elevation data an analysis of experimental measurements is then performed through the characterization of noisy perturbations finally we present relevant indicators of the quality of free surface prediction and the procedure implemented to reliably evaluate them 4 1 description of the experimental modeling setups as shown in fig 2 spatial sampling of a free surface elevation by an optical sensor exhibits gaps due to shadowing effects from the illuminated wave fronts and assuming a uniform distribution of beams over the sensor s aperture angles measurement points density geometrically decreases with the distance from the sensor in experiments simulations free surface elevations are measured computed at 22 wave gauges resistive probes in experiments irregularly distributed along the wave direction of propagation consistent with an optical sensor facing the wavemaker side of the tank the first 20 measurement points have a decreasing density away from it corresponding to the intersection with a surface of uniformly angularly spaced beams propagating away from a point source e g lidar camera we consider the illumination of a flat surface which allowed us to position the gauges vertically into the water this way wave shadowing effects are not reproduced but only the geometrically decreasing density of observations which is the prominent source of irregularity in the measurement points locations the virtual sensor is located at an elevation z c 30 m 0 6 m in tank scale z c λ p 0 19 and aimed at the water surface with an angle α 7 6 and 20 virtual beams which are uniformly spread over an aperture angle of α a 2 0 see fig 2 for a representation of α and α a the resulting geometrical distribution of the wave gauge locations is depicted in fig 3 two additional gauges measure downstream elevations for comparison with predictions every gauge is labeled according to its x location from 1 for that closest to the wavemaker to 22 for that furthest away wave gauges provide observations that are used as input to the surface reconstruction and prediction algorithms the number of spatial observations is thus constant at j 20 and the number of observation times k depends on the assimilation time duration t a and data acquisition time step τ as k t a τ in both experiments and numerical simulations we consider a full scale one directional wave field extracted from a jonswap spectrum with a t p 10 s peak period 1 41 s in tank scale and a γ 3 3 peakedness parameter eight sea states were generated using the same set of wave phases table 1 with their significant wave height h s h m 0 4 m 0 where m 0 0 s η f d f selected such that the characteristic steepness h s λ p varies between 0 6 and 5 with λ p 156 m 3 12 m in tank scale in tank scale we have λ p d which confirms that the deep water approximation is applicable a theoretical wavemaker motion is deduced by applying a transfer function based on the one directional finite depth linear wavemaker theory and on the wavemaker geometry which is for both experiments and simulations a rotating flap that is hinged three meters below the mean surface level the amplitude of the wavemaker deflection is adjusted according to the target h s values without further consideration the obtained theoretical motion serves as input for our physical and numerical wavemakers we notice differences between the target and generated significant wave heights refer to section 4 2 for the explicit formulation eq for the calculation of h s in experiments h s values are found consistently lower than target values for sea states of small to moderate steepness cases a to d this is mainly explained by the wavemaker transfer function leading the physical wavemaker to generate waves of lower amplitude than according to the input in contrast simulations yield h s values that are slightly higher than the targets by an amount that is of the same order of magnitude as the expected effect pertaining to the wave reflection on the beach i e lower than 1 since the numerical beach is set such that its reflection rate corresponds to the physical one wave reflection is expected to have a similar effect on the experimental results i e very limited for high steepness i e h s λ p 3 5 cases e to h wave breaking events appear dissipating energy and reducing our estimates of h s wave breaking dissipation is encountered in both experiments and simulations due to the wave breaking modeling in the numerical model 4 2 analysis of experimental data fig 4 shows a typical time series of surface elevation measured at a resistive probe in laboratory experiments time t 0 corresponds to the start of the wavemaker motion i e the beginning of wave generation at time t a it is estimated based on a truncation of the prescribed wave energy spectrum similar to section 3 4 that all the energetic wave components generated at the wavemaker have been seen by all gauges at time t b the wavemaker is shutdown and waves generation is interrupted finally similar to the determination of t a at time t c it is estimated that all the generated energetic wave components have propagated past all gauges based on this the data used for the wave field prediction study is restricted to the time interval t a t b with t b t a 173 t p it is desirable to analyze and quantify the influence of the perturbations pertaining to the limitations of our experimental setup referred to as noise throughout this work on the recorded wave signal this is done by considering that the rest of the data acquired at wave gauges for a few dozen peak wave periods beyond t t c provides a representation of noise during the entire data acquisition duration based on this data a noise to signal ratio nsr h n h s is computed as a function of characteristic heights for both the primary wave t t a t b and noise t t c signals following 19 h s 1 n p j 1 n p 4 σ η x j t a t t b a h n 1 n p j 1 n p 4 σ η x j t t c b respectively where σ η x t denotes the standard deviation of the free surface elevation η x t and n p 22 wave gauges the nsr is computed for each case a to h in table 1 and plotted in fig 5a as a function of the corresponding characteristic wave steepness we see that the nsr decreases as a function of wave steepness with the largest value being about 25 for the smallest steepness and the smallest value being about 11 5 for the largest steepness it thus appears that the geometry of our experimental set up in a 3d wave tank allowing the generation of directional wave fields may have significantly affected the targeted one directional wave fields as will be detailed in section 6 3 this potentially large nsr may affect the performance of the wave prediction algorithm to better quantify noise effects on the desired experimental data and relate the generated noise to a physical process we computed the power spectral density s n of the noisy part of the signal t t c for each steepness the spectrum was averaged over results obtained at the 22 wave gauges and normalized as s n s n f p m 0 where m 0 h n 2 16 is the zeroth order moment of the spectrum these normalized noise spectra were found to be nearly identical for each steepness fig 5b shows their average which is composed of a narrow banded peak centered on 1 1 f p and a broad banded high frequency part of much lower amplitude the wave spectrum calculated on t a t b is given on the same figure as a visual help for interpretation fig 6 shows normalized surface elevations of the noise signal η h n in which frequencies f 1 4 f p have been removed by filtering i e these correspond to the dominant part of the noise signal it shows that elevations for case a at wave gauges 1 to 22 which are aligned along the x direction are mostly in phase suggesting that the dominant experimental noise may be caused by resonant excitations of transverse modes in the 3d wave tank this hypothesis is confirmed by our visual observations of these waves during calm down times between measurements and is explained by the presence of small interstices between the wavemaker flaps locally generating transverse disturbances the much less energetic noisy components of the signal with frequencies f 1 4 f p were not found to be in phase indicating that they result from aleatory processes 4 3 misfit indicators definitions the misfit indicator used to quantify the accuracy of the predicted wave field is defined as 20 e x t 1 n s i 1 n s η i x t η r i x t h s where η is the predicted surface elevation and η r is the reference surface measured or calculated depending on whether experimental or numerical data is used to better assess its overall behavior the misfit is averaged over n s surface samples denoted by index i an unbiased estimate can only be obtained for a large number of samples from independent wave field realizations i e of different sets of random wave phases with to the limit n s instead we elected to generate one single surface realization per sea state but to record or compute wave gauge data over a long time so that the signals can be split into a sufficiently large number of samples of meaningful duration t a additionally the number of samples is increased by selecting them as partially overlapping i e shifting them in time by δ t t a as illustrated in fig 7 therefore the information used to estimate the misfit is the surface elevation data in the total time window covered by the samples which has a duration t c t a n s 1 δ t a similar approach was employed in naaijen et al 2014 to investigate the spatio temporal evolution of the prediction zone based on experimental and numerical data the wave field prediction error at a specific location x is finally computed by averaging the corresponding misfit over the theoretical time prediction zone t t min t max as 21 e p x 1 t max t min t min t max e x t d t fig 8 shows for case e the evolution of the wave field prediction error e p computed as a function of the amount of data used to calculate it quantified by the relative duration t c t p of the time window used to evaluate the misfit e we see that the prediction error converges for t c t p 60 note that the wave gauge network used to generate the observations covers a zone only slightly larger than 2 λ p if this zone was larger the optimal number of peak wave periods for the sampling time window would likely be less than 60 additionally for deterministic comparison we make use of the cross correlation between time series corresponding to the predicted and the measured surface elevations which provides a correlation factor c as a function of a time lag t the maximal value of the correlation factor and its corresponding time lag can be interpreted as the correspondence in terms of shape and amplitude of the two elevations and as an estimate of the time shift between the two elevations respectively the cross correlation is defined by 22 c t 1 t max t min t min t max η t η r t t d t where t min max are the prediction zone boundaries and η t η t σ η t min t t max is the normalized free surface elevation similarly η r η r σ η r for the reference surface 5 prediction error sensitivity to reconstruction algorithm we first assess the sensitivity of the prediction error to both the method used linear or nonlinear and parameters of the assimilation procedure namely the assimilation time t a and the time shift of the assimilated data τ for case a which corresponds to a mild characteristic wave steepness of 0 65 fig 9a shows that the linear prediction error converges well as t a increases for the three considered τ values although convergence is slower for larger τ hence the converged error is independent of the time resolution of observations this is a consequence of the characteristics of the physical description emerging from observations as the assimilation time increases the diversity of wave processes included in the assimilated information is enhanced with respect to the relevant physics simulated in the model causing the prediction error to converge additionally the accuracy of the description of physical phenomena which is directly function of the time resolution of observations affects the prediction error convergence rate for a given assimilation time t a a smaller time step τ will yield a prediction error closer to the converged value for the predictions presented later we keep τ t p 0 07 for case e which corresponds to a larger wave steepness of 3 18 and hence a fairly nonlinear case fig 9b shows that overall prediction errors are larger than for case a increasing from 0 005 0 05 to 0 05 0 075 fig 9b also shows that as could be expected for this nonlinear case the prediction errors are larger with the linear method than with the nonlinear method finally the convergence of the nonlinear method to achieve an approximately constant value of ε p requires a slightly larger t a than for the linear method this can be explained by the higher level of physics represented in the icwm model than in lwt which requires larger time scales to achieve convergence 6 prediction results and discussion applications of the reconstruction and forecasting algorithms to cases of table 1 are presented in the following and the accuracy of the wave field forecast is discussed in particular in terms of its sensitivity to the linear or nonlinear methods used 6 1 wave group analysis all cases in table 1 correspond to sea states generated using a jonswap spectrum with identical peak period t p 10 s at full scale and peakedness γ 3 3 but a different significant wave height h s and hence characteristic wave steepness h s λ p in both the physical and numerical wave tanks these sea states are generated using the same set of random phases so time series of surface elevations should be similar except for small changes in amplitude due to nonlinear effects proportional to h s in the following we analyze the prediction error for a group of 8 waves of elevation on the order of η 0 5 h s approximately centered at t 113 t p recorded simulated at wave gauge 22 for cases a to h see fig 4 the data used in the prediction algorithms was selected for the prediction zone to span t 108 t p to 118 t p at the location of gauge 22 fig 10 shows time series of surface elevations for these wave groups in cases a e and h compared to predictions of the linear lwt linear corrected lwt cdr and nonlinear icwm models using experimental a c e and numerical b d f data for each case only small differences due to experimental noise can be seen between the experimentally and numerically generated reference surfaces while there is an overall agreement between the reference and predicted surfaces differences in wave phase and elevation increase with wave steepness due to cumulative effects of nonlinearity during wave propagation accordingly for the smallest wave steepness case a all three models predict the same surface elevation in good agreement with references particularly for numerical data b for which predictions almost perfectly overlap the hos solution but predictions become increasingly different between the three algorithms the larger the characteristic wave steepness although differences do not appear visually large this is more pronounced for the algorithm based on icwm which as will be shown next using various prediction error metrics provides the most accurate prediction differences between the reference measured or simulated with hos surface elevations and those predicted by the three algorithms are quantified by their maximum cross correlation max c i e normalized convolution eq 22 and corresponding time lag t s arg max c both parameters are shown in fig 11 for all cases in table 1 based on time series measured or simulated at the location of wave gauge 22 e g fig 10 the former quantifies the accuracy of the prediction in terms of wave shape and amplitude while the latter quantifies the time shift of the predicted signal compared to the reference signal fig 11a b show that for all prediction algorithms time lag increases with wave steepness i e nonlinearity from 0 for the smallest steepness to a few percent of t p for the largest one consistent with the expected effects of nonlinearity as seen for instance in the time series of fig 10 lwt yields the largest time lags compared to the nonlinear models lwt cdr which includes a phase shift correction provides a time lag very close to that of icwm particularly for the simulated data indicating that the nonlinear phase shift prevails over the nonlinear wave geometry represented in the latter model for these cases also the rate of increase of time lag with wave steepness is similar whether or not the nonlinear phase shift is included in the model this result is unexpected since this phase shift its due to nonlinear amplitude dispersion which is function of wave steepness fig 11c d show the maximum cross correlations for the same cases consistent with the larger time lag max c mostly decreases the larger the wave steepness to reach a minimum of 96 for the largest wave steepness except for case g which is discussed below the maximum cross correlation is larger using icwm which is expected since only this model is able to represent nonlinear wave geometry the abnormal behavior of case g which is seen in both the experimental and numerical data likely results from a significant increase in wave breaking events within the considered wave group for this case note for case h which has an even larger steepness wave phases were such that breaking was not as widespread as for case g wave breaking affects wave geometry in a non trivial manner and is not represented in icwm in the case of the wave group considered here for some unknown reason it appears that broken waves are better represented in the linear model than using icwm finally fig 12 shows results similar to fig 11 using icwm for numerical or experimental data at wave gauges 20 21 and 22 observations are acquired and reconstructed at wave gauge 20 which is the last gauge used in observations and predictions are made at the other 2 gauges which are increasingly distant from it fig 3 for both the experimental and numerical data the time lags and their rates of increase with wave steepness are lower for prediction locations closer to the observation gauge fig 12a b this results from inaccuracies in nonlinear wave propagation modeled by icwm which yield increasing differences in predicted surface elevations with time or space traveled compared to the reference data consistent with this observation fig 12c d show that for steepnesses larger than 2 5 the maximum cross correlation decreases as the distance of the prediction gauge to the observation location increases 6 2 instantaneous misfit of wave prediction we investigate next the evolution of the instantaneous misfit e x t of the wave prediction for case e which corresponds to a moderate steepness although nonlinear effects already have a marked influence on the wave field dynamics for both experimental and numerical cases we compare the misfit obtained using the lwt lwt cdr and icwm prediction algorithms fig 13 shows the temporal evolution of the wave prediction misfit computed using different algorithms with respect to data simulated for case e at both gauge 22 a and for all gauges b the misfit at gauge 22 is significantly lower within the accessible prediction zone t min t max fig 13a reaching a minimum value of about 3 5 for icwm compared to about 4 5 for lwt whose misfit is consistently about 30 larger than that of icwm within the time prediction zone the error gradually slightly increases due to the limited physics represented in both wave models in the spatio temporal domain fig 13b icwm s misfit is lowest within the theoretical prediction zone reaching a maximum of about 7 along its boundary as the x location of the wave gauge increases the misfit gradient decreases across the prediction zone upper boundary t max or in other words the transition of the misfit values from within to outside the prediction zone becomes more diffused which is due to the dispersion of the assimilated information more specifically as detailed in section 3 2 the energy associated with the reconstructed wave components disperses as x increases gradually limiting the physical description of the wave field even within the spatio temporal region corresponding to the observations black rectangle in fig 13b the misfit is non zero since observations are discrete rather than continuous samples of elevations hence the reconstructed elevation nowcast is always an estimate of the reference solution note that the accessible prediction horizon in the depicted configuration is t max t r 3 7 t p and 4 3 t p at gauges 21 and 22 respectively and is expected to further increase at larger distances at the expense of the prediction accuracy then from the location where the beginning of the prediction zone t min matches the reconstruction time t r the accessible horizon starts decreasing for the same case e fig 14 shows for both experimental or simulated reference data the spatio temporal evolution of the ratio of the nonlinear icwm to linear lwt a b or linear with corrected dispersion lwt cdr c d wave prediction misfit for the simulated data fig 14b the misfit is reduced by up to 35 within the prediction zone when using icwm instead of lwt compared to lwt cdr fig 14d the reduction is smaller and mostly limited to the spatio temporal region of assimilated data within the solid box particularly where the wave gauge density is larger outside of this region t t a 7 t p time propagation or at the location of gauges 21 and 22 space propagation the misfit ratio rapidly approaches one indicating that the improvement achieved using icwm rather than lwt cdr becomes negligible for the experimental data fig 14a c similar patterns are observed but the improvement achieved using icwm is not as pronounced as for simulated data these results indicate that the improved representation of nonlinear wave geometry using icwm mostly affects the accuracy of the reconstructed part of the wave field once reconstructed waves are propagated to the prediction zone the nonlinear phase shift which is corrected in lwt cdr to the same level as in icwm becomes the main source of error and effects of nonlinear wave geometry become negligible compared to it the wave models are parameterized to provide a relevant and consistent approximation of the wave field over the entire region covered by the observations hence while the reconstructed wave field is constrained to fit the measurements when waves are propagated to issue a prediction only their propagation properties featured in the models come into play 6 3 influence of experimental noise on wave prediction the prediction misfits based on numerical and experimental reference data are compared in fig 15 at gauges 20 21 and 22 for all cases listed in table 1 using the linear lwt or nonlinear icwm algorithms to better assess the effect of experimental noise on the prediction misfit a noisy numerical dataset was created by adding to the numerical data a noise signal having the same spectral shape or nsr as that analyzed for the experiments fig 5b scaled by the measured noise amplitude h n fig 5a with independent random phases for each wave gauge as would be expected for both algorithms the prediction misfits are larger at all wave gauges using experimental data as compared to noise free numerical data particularly for cases with a lower steepness which have relatively larger noise levels using the noisy numerical data however prediction misfits increase to nearly match those of the experimental data this indicates that the noisy numerical data is consistent with the experimental data and provides a digital twin of experiments that explains for the most part differences observed between predictions issued for experimental and noise free numerical data 6 4 application to remote sensing free surface slope prediction in the free surface elevation predictions described above the nonlinear phase correction was responsible for the main relative improvement in prediction misfit rather than the nonlinear wave geometry represented in icwm while for many ocean engineering applications predicting instantaneous free surface elevations is most important such as when computing wave forces or runup on structures or controlling a wave energy converter in some applications such as remote sensing the main parameter of interest is free surface slope which governs the backscattered signal to the radar or optical sensor used e g nouguier et al 2010 2014 hence in the following we quantify the improvement in free surface slopes representation achieved using icwm rather than lwt cdr more specifically at the location of wave gauge 20 we analyze the evolution as a function of wave steepness of the maximum prediction misfit ratio e i c w m p e l w t c d r p for both surface elevation and slope as the distance between gauges 19 and 20 is small 0 02 λ p the wave surface slope can be approximated by 23 s t η x 20 t η x 19 t x 20 x 19 where η denotes the reference or predicted surface elevation and x 19 20 the location of gauge 19 and 20 we calculate the slope prediction misfit by replacing η with s in eq 20 results in fig 16 show a consistently lower misfit ratio for the slope prediction whether experimental or numerical data is used although in the latter case the ratios are lower in absolute value indicating that unlike with surface elevation predictions geometrical nonlinearities included in icwm provide a significant improvement for predicting surface slopes further in icwm geometrical nonlinearities are second order in wave steepness whereas nonlinear phase shifts are third order nouguier et al 2009 2010 guérin et al 2019 accordingly in fig 16 the improved performance of icwm for predicting surface slopes is much more significant at small wave steepness when third order effects are not prominent yet additionally when using numerical data the misfit ratios for surface elevation and slope predictions become increasingly close the larger the wave steepness with experimental data the residual noise causes higher frequency surface oscillations that significantly affect the slope calculation and prevent a proper evaluation of the corresponding prediction misfit hence in fig 16 both elevation and slope misfit ratios are close to one at low wave steepness when initializing a nonlinear model based on a superposition of harmonics linearly extracted from a standard wave spectrum such as here a jonswap nonlinearity in the model equations will cause the generation of higher frequency wave components that will translate into additional spectral energy at those frequencies from the onset likewise waves generated in a wave tank based on a similar standard spectrum will evolve nonlinearly which results in energy transfer towards higher frequencies this energy redistribution in wave spectra is referred to as the dressing process nouguier et al 2009 in our applications it is thus the dressed spectrum that is calculated based on the reference surface both in experiments and simulations this is illustrated in fig 17 which shows the normalized energy density spectra of the free surface s η s η f p h s 2 16 computed for case e over the time interval corresponding to the prediction zone t min t max at the location of gauge 20 waves are only generated by both experimental and numerical wavemakers in the frequency range f f l f h with f l 0 68 f p and f h 2 18 f p the low and high cut off frequencies respectively within this frequency range fig 17a c spectral amplitudes agree well with each other for the reference data and all wave models however as a result of nonlinearity in the reference data for f f h fig 17b d energy increases in all cases as compared to the targeted spectrum more specifically while for f f h spectral amplitudes are lower in all the models than in the reference data icwm provides results in much better agreement with the latter particularly for the numerical reference data and lwt and lwt cdr provide similar results both lower than those of icwm these results confirm that high frequency wave components that predominantly affect wave slope predictions are more accurately predicted with the latter model due to its representation of nonlinear wave geometry e g sharper crests 7 conclusions in the context of the deterministic prediction of ocean surface waves we assessed and compared the accuracy of three ocean wave prediction algorithms based on three wave models having different nonlinear properties the algorithms were tested against data time series of surface elevation acquired for long crested wave fields using wave gauges in wave tank experiments as well as in simulations of similar experiments with a high order numerical wave tank a number of test cases were defined with different characteristic wave steepness from mildly to more strongly nonlinear the set of wave gauges physical or numerical was non uniformly distributed in space to mimic the typical uneven sampling made by optical sensors at grazing incidence the wave models used in the prediction algorithms were inverted based on the wave gauge data and reconstructed waves were then propagated with the models residual oscillations observed in the physical wave tank were investigated and found to result from perturbations caused by the wavemaker these oscillations were identified as the principal cause for observed differences between the experimental and numerical data adding the experimental noise to numerical reference data in fact led to similar levels of wave prediction misfit or accuracy as when using experimental data our study showed that the prediction accuracy of the algorithms quantified by a misfit parameter converged with the duration of the assimilated surface elevation time series i e amount of data used in addition smaller data acquisition time steps yielded higher convergence rates and the larger the characteristic wave steepness the larger the prediction error in the form of nonlinear phase shifts related to wave phase velocity and wave shape discrepancies the recently developed improved choppy wave model icwm introduced in guérin et al 2019 yielded improved predictions within the accessible prediction zone as compared to a linear wave model with a maximum prediction misfit reduction of 35 for an intermediate wave steepness h s λ p 3 18 based on numerical data in the spatio temporal region corresponding to the observations the wave shape asymmetry represented in icwm improved the surface elevation representation for waves that had propagated in space and or time the main factor for reducing the prediction misfit was the accurate modeling of nonlinear wave phase velocity for surface slope predictions however the improved representation of wave shape asymmetry in icwm allowed to achieve an average prediction misfit reduction of 20 over the prediction zone for a low wave steepness of 1 2 as compared to a linear model with a phase speed correction lwt cdr note that higher order wave models e g hos mnls are expected to further improve the prediction accuracy but only provided that the assimilation procedure yields the correct initial model parameters which becomes increasingly complex and time consuming when the model order increases using such models to propagate waves will also require a much larger computational effort lessons learned in this study will help applying our prediction algorithms to data acquired at sea using optical sensor systems such as lidars e g belmont et al 2007 nouguier et al 2014 as the method described here is directly applicable for predicting directional wave fields further investigation of the performance of our algorithms for short crested waves will be pursued in future work credit authorship contribution statement n desmars conceptualization methodology software validation formal

21688,existing physical model test data indicate that negative deadrise planing surfaces may be capable of producing greater lift and lift to drag ratios than positive deadrise planing surfaces however there is a lack of systematic experiments in which deadrise is varied with all other parameters are fixed in this study computational fluid dynamics software star ccm is applied to simulate fixed attitude prismatic planing hulls with variable deadrise including positive and negative angles mesh dependency study and comparison with experimental data have been performed the main reported hydrodynamic characteristics include the lift and drag coefficients wetted area and center of pressure the negative deadrise hulls are found to possess higher lift capabilities while the highest lift

dissipation rate μ fluid viscosity ρ fluid density τ hull trim angle 1 introduction negative deadrise planing surfaces are a type of tunnel hull in which the sides of the hull are deeper in the water than the centerline fig 1 shows a rendering of a negative deadrise surface and fig 2 shows a schematic of hulls with both positive and negative deadrise including some of the notation used in this paper the negative deadrise concept formed the basis of the hickman sea sled u s patent no 1 204 355 produced in great numbers between world war i and the 1960s some of the advantages attributed to this type of hull include increased bottom lift coefficients caused by the trapping of air and water near the centerline and a reduction in spray because it is directed inward observed disadvantages include aeration of the water into the propellers high impact accelerations in waves and possible difficulty in turning while there have been design studies of boats incorporating negative deadrise there are relatively few studies exploring the hydrodynamic lift drag and pressure distribution of negative deadrise prismatic planing surfaces there are still open questions such as do negative deadrise planing surfaces generate higher lift coefficients than equivalent flat plates and what happens as the deadrise angle becomes very largely negative the present study aims to answer these questions by providing a systematic comparison of the effect of deadrise variation from positive 30 to negative 30 the study utilizes computational fluid dynamics cfd for the comparisons because of its ability to clearly show the pressure distributions which are difficult to obtain in physical model testing while this paper includes discussion of the validation methods used the purpose of this paper is not just to run cfd for a novel problem but to use this tool to explore an interesting question about the fundamentals of planing craft the majority of the systematic testing of negative deadrise hulls was done during the cold war era for design purposes clement and tate 1959 presented physical model test data of a variety of planing craft concepts including an inverted deadrise sea sled all tested at a standard bottom loading and center of gravity position at the david taylor model basin a similar hull was tested as part of the russian mbk series of small military boats egorov et al 1978 comparisons by morabito 2019 showed that the results of these tests are somewhat mixed with the negative deadrise planing hulls having a higher lift to drag ratio than some deep vee hulls but lower lift to drag ratio than well designed craft such as the series 62 clement and blount 1963 nuttall and kamm 1969 explored a negative deadrise hull for use on heavily loaded high speed wheeled amphibians finding that the negative deadrise hull had the highest lift to drag ratio of the candidate designs at planing speeds however it had double the added resistance in waves and double the seakeeping impact accelerations of all the candidate designs nuttall and kamm 1969 seakeeping tests qualitatively agreed with some of the full scale findings by meyer 1957 which showed that the sea sled hull had much higher accelerations in waves than other candidate designs theses references explored the design applications of a negative deadrise planing surface but did not explain the fundamental hydrodynamics well kimon 1957 provided systematic tests on a 10 deadrise prismatic planing surface considered for potential use as a seaplane landing ski with very low spray comparison of these systematic test data with known prismatic planing hull lift equations such as given by savitsky 1964 indicates that the negative deadrise planing surface can produce greater lift coefficients and higher lift to drag ratios than flat plates or positive deadrise planing hulls morabito 2019 the high speeds angles of attack and loading of seaplane landing skis do not overlap much with the typical conditions of most planing boats leaving some question as to whether the results are applicable to planing boats edge 1958 did impact testing of a 20 deadrise prismatic planing surface funding that the negative deadrise surface produced higher impact forces than a flat plate except at low trim around 4 6 and very high trim about 25 however it is somewhat difficult to relate these impact cases to the steady planing condition with growing computational resources cfd tools have been broadly applied for traditional planing hulls in recent years while the hull drag and attitude can be approximately predicted for these hulls in the range of speeds from the displacement to planing modes cfd results in high speed regimes often show 10 15 disagreement with test data o shea et al 2012 mousaviraad et al 2015 de luca et al 2016 sukas et al 2017 wheeler et al 2018 at the same time experimental data especially reported in older publications often had up to 20 scatter in hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls payne 1995 as concerns numerical studies of inverse v and more complicated tunnel hulls there are fewer publications in the literature kornev et al 2010 explored dynamics and stability of tunnel hulls with help of the added mass theory as a part of linearized potential flow modeling of variable deadrise hulls matveev 2014 included a negative deadrise hull and showed that the center of pressure and wetted areas of such a hull were rather different from characteristics of positive deadrise hulls using cfd simulations jiang et al 2017 investigated a transition between water and air dominant flow regimes in the tunnels of a planing trimaran the main objective of the present study is to apply cfd modeling for prismatic hulls with variable deadrise including inverse v configurations in order to investigate effects of deadrise angle on the main hydrodynamic characteristics of the hulls and to explore differences in the water deformations wetted surfaces and pressure distributions caused by variation of a deadrise angle 2 computational aspects computational modeling of planing hull hydrodynamics has been carried out using the cfd software star ccm version 2019 1 the finite volume segregated rans flow solver with the second order spatial discretization and the first order implicit time stepping was employed for most situations only steady state results are reported in this paper corresponding to the states with no longer evolving time averaged properties the water and air flows are modeled within the eulerian multiphase framework based on the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 using the constant density water and the isothermal ideal gas model for air gravity and surface tension are also accounted for

star ccm manual 2019 2 1 numerical setup the negative deadrise hull and the numerical domain with boundary conditions utilized in this study are shown in fig 3 the hull attitude was always kept fixed at specified values the domain length height and width were selected as 40 12 and 6 of the hull beams respectively the hull surface had a no slip condition imposed the symmetry plane was implemented along the body centerplane the top bottom and starboard sides of the numerical domain were treated as slip walls the velocity inlet and the pressure outlet were used at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively the time step was selected to keep the courant number below one all results presented in the next sections correspond to steady state conditions the numerical mesh employing octree formed hexahedral cells was constructed in the numerical domain fig 4 it has refinement zones near the hull and along the free surface to keep computations economical and prevent numerical instabilities at the outlet the mesh was coarsened away from the hull and a damping zone of about 5 hull beams was specified near the downstream domain boundary to resolve the boundary layer 15 prism cell layers were generated at the hull surface the overall prism layer thickness was selected as 1 cm to encompass the boundary layer in the studied conditions the near wall cell thicknesses were generally about 20 40 of y values on the water covered areas and below 3 on the air covered areas thus the wall function approach was primarily utilized on the wet surfaces whereas the resolution down to the viscous sub layer was achieved on the dry surfaces for the hull adjacent cells with intermediate y values the blended approach was used in the applied here the two layer all y method rodi 1991 for most cases in this study the realizable k ε turbulence model shih et al 1995 was employed although the rans approach and the k ε model have limited abilities in capturing shed vortices in case of hulls planing on the water surface at low attack angles and having dry transoms the k ε turbulence model works well and is often recommended for ship hydrodynamics applications de luca et al 2016 another common turbulence model the sst k ω model was also used for comparison as discussed in the next section 3 mesh dependency study and comparison with test data since the main focus of this paper is on inverse v hulls experimental data obtained by kimon 1957 for negative 10 degree deadrise planing surfaces were chosen for the mesh verification study and comparison with numerical results in kimon s work a simple prismatic hull such as shown in fig 3 was towed in a tank at different fixed attitudes and high beam based froude numbers primarily above 10 the hull length beam and height were 0 9144 m 0 1016 m and 0 0333 m respectively the reynolds numbers of the runs used for the present validation study were in the range from 2 106 to 8 106 in this study the hull heave and trim were also kept fixed in each numerical simulation the lift and drag coefficients as well as the center of pressure counted from transom and normalized by the beam l p b were reported in the experimental tests kimon 1957 and used as the primary metrics in the present verification study the beam based force coefficients as well as the beam froude number and the lift drag ratio are defined as follows 8 c l 2 l ρ w u 2 b 2 9 c d 2 d ρ w u 2 b 2 10 f r u g b 11 l d r c l c d where l and d are the lift and drag forces respectively u is the incident flow velocity b is the hull beam and g is the gravitational constant the beam froude number f r used here is the same as the speed coefficient c v used by savitsky 1964 for the mesh verification three numerical grids of different densities were generated with cell counts ranging from about 300 thousand to 1 4 million table 1 the grid dependency study was conducted for one of the experimental cases with beam froude number f r 13 21 trim angle τ 4ᵒ and transom submergence at chine d 0 32 b the numerical results obtained on three grids are summarized in table 1 monotonic convergence is attained for all three metrics demonstrating the solution verification the numerical uncertainty was assessed starting with richardson extrapolation ferziger and peric 1999 12 δ r e δ 12 α γ 1 where δ 12 is the difference between solutions obtained in the fine and medium grids α is the grid refinement ratio equal to 2 in this study and γ is the observed order of accuracy 13 γ log δ 23 δ 12 log α where δ 23 is the difference between medium and coarse mesh solutions then the richardson correction given by eq 12 was multiplied by the factor of safety calculated following the standard numerical uncertainty analysis xing and stern 2010 the grid based numerical uncertainty is listed in table 1 as percentage of the solution values obtained in the fine mesh relatively small uncertainty is achieved for the lift coefficient and the center of pressure while higher but still moderate uncertainty is attained for the drag coefficient the water volume fraction obtained on this hull surface is illustrated in fig 5 one can notice that the side walls of this hull are dry as it operates at a sufficiently high froude number a comparison of the present numerical results with experimental data kimon 1957 for this and two other test conditions is given in table 2 additionally results of cfd simulations produced using sst k ω turbulent model are also included which show relatively little difference from the simulations with the realizable k ε model the agreement between computational and experimental results is reasonably good larger deviations are observed at low submergences where results become more sensitive to hull attitudes so that small experimental errors in submergence may lead to significant variations of hydrodynamic characteristics since tests of kimon 1957 correspond to high froude numbers an additional comparison was undertaken for flat planing surfaces at variable froude numbers and hull submergences and results were compared with the empirical correlations of savitsky 1964 in the present modeling the negative deadrise hull was transformed into the flat bottom hull with zero deadrise while the hull length and beam were kept the same one set of simulations was conducted in a range of froude numbers with the fixed trim angle of 4ᵒ and the fixed relative transom submergence of d b 0 276 this state corresponds to a nominal wetted length defined as the at rest mean wetted length l n b of about 4 the use of this zero speed nominal wetted length l n is different than the use of the dynamic keel chine and mean wetted lengths seen in savitsky 1964 because the present computations are performed at fixed model attitude the dynamic mean wetted lengths will be larger than this at rest value because of the wave rise that occurs on the planing hull subsequent graphs in this paper are given showing the wetted surface area of the hull while running which may be correlated to the mean wetted length l m by the following relation 14 l m s w e t b o t t o m b cos β where s w e t b o t t o m is the wetted area of the bottom of the hull when planing and β is the deadrise angle the second set of simulations was done for variable l n b while keeping the beam froude number of 4 and trim angle of 4ᵒ the comparison of results for the three hydrodynamic characteristics lift and drag coefficients and the center of pressure normalized by beam is given figs 6 and 7 the lift and drag coefficients decrease with increasing froude number fig 6 since the nearly speed independent hydrostatic force on a fixed hull plays less important role in the force coefficients at higher speeds as forces are normalized by the speed squared fig 6 the center of pressure location increases with f r since the hydrodynamic force is applied further forward from the hull transom and a role of this force increases fig 6 the lift and drag coefficients as well as the center of pressure location also increase with increasing the hull length fig 7 since the submerged volume and length of the hull increase the agreement between the current numerical results and with savitsky s correlations is deemed satisfactory given the approximate nature of simple empirical correlations thus the current numerical approach has been demonstrated to work well for planing surfaces 4 results of parametric study since the main focus of this study is on the effect of deadrise angle parametric simulations have been carried out in a range of deadrise angles between 30ᵒ and 30ᵒ at common for planing boats beam froude number of 4 trim angle of 4ᵒ and two nominal wetted length values l n b 2 and 4 which are also in the range of practical hull attitudes the hull geometry was similar to the one used in the validation study the same length and beam with the exception of geometry of the prismatic hull bottom which deadrise angle was treated as the main variable parameter for hulls with non zero deadrise the nominal wetted length was defined as the average of the nominal wetted lengths at the keel and chine the hull trim and heave were kept fixed in each simulation the hydrodynamic metrics evaluated in the steady state planing regimes including the lift and drag coefficients lift drag ratio center of pressure and normalized wetted area are summarized in fig 8 as one can see the lift coefficients for both hull positions increase with reduction of deadrise and reach maxima at the most negative deadrise of 30ᵒ fig 8a which suggests that inverse v hulls have larger load capabilities the lift dependence on deadrise for the hulls with longer nominal length is almost linear while the lift increases at lower rate at negative β for the hulls with shorter wetted length the drag coefficients reach minima at zero deadrise fig 8b due to smaller wetted area s w e t t o t a l shown in fig 8c drag of negative deadrise hulls studied here appears to be greater than resistances of positive deadrise hulls with the same absolute values of the deadrise angle this can be attributed to much more pronounced side wetting of inverse v hulls comparison images are shown later and as a consequence larger wetted hull surface areas fig 8c the lift drag ratio l d r which is simply a lift coefficient divided by a drag coefficient peaks at the zero deadrise angle fig 8d consistent with behavior of c l and c d the lift drag ratios generally decline with increase of absolute values of deadrise angles although this trend changes at the extreme β 30ᵒ for the hull with deeper submergence at large in magnitude deadrise angles l d r of inverse v hulls tend to be higher than l d r of positive v hulls implying that increases of lift coefficients of inverse v hulls fig 8a overcome increases of their drag coefficients fig 8b moreover the negative deadrise hulls in practical applications are likely to have some kind of spray rails at the chines on their side walls that prevent or minimize the side wall wetting also the side wetting phenomenon is scale dependent and often small strips are applied at chines to eliminate side wetting on small hull models in situations when it is unlikely to appear on large scale hulls fridsma 1969 due to computational limitations only small scale models were simulated here if one is interested in the effect of eliminating the side wall wetting on the performance increase a simplistic estimation can be obtained using the present results but considering only the bottom hull surfaces where most of the lift is generated but only a fraction of drag is produced the bottom based wetted area and the corresponding lift drag ratio are shown in fig 9 while for zero and positive deadrise hulls the bottom wetted area remains almost the same as that for entire hulls figs 9a and 8c there is a large 30 40 decrease of the wetted bottom area for hulls with significant negative deadrise this results in the substantial increase of l d r b o t t o m of inverse v hulls figs 9b and 8d so the degradation of lift drag ratio for such hulls with increase of absolute deadrise angles becomes much smaller in the case with extreme deadrise β 30ᵒ and deeper submergence l n b 4 l d r b o t t o m even exceeds l d r of the zero deadrise hull another hydrodynamic characteristic important for planing hulls is the center of pressure which is presented here in hull beams forward of transom l p b for two hull positions used in the parametric study this metric is shown in fig 8e for the hull with shorter wetted length l p b does not vary much with deadrise but shows a weakly pronounced minimum at zero deadrise in case of the hull with long wetted length the center of pressure decreases significantly and monotonically with increasing deadrise angle distributions of some hydrodynamic characteristics for hulls with l n b 2 and β 20ᵒ 0ᵒ 20ᵒ are presented in fig 10 the underwater views on water surface elevations fig 10a c show typical for planing hulls near field wave patterns the wave hollow behind transom is the narrowest in case of the positive deadrise hull fig 10a since the deepest portion of this hull is located at the centerline a wide water depression exists behind the flat bottom hull fig 10b the inverse v hull exhibits two narrow wave hollows formed behind side portions of transom with deeper submergences these hollows merge together further downstream one can also observe the divergent waves originating from the side walls fig 10a c the crests of the near hull waves and the wake wash in general are the widest for the flat bottom case and the narrowest and much less pronounced for the inverse v hull also shown in fig 10 are the lines l1 and l2 designating the static water line and the spray root line calculated with the correlation given by savitsky 1964 a good agreement between the simplified savitsky s expression and the present numerical results is observed for all three cases including the inverse v hull the hull area between lines l1 and l2 is attributed to the water rise due to partial stagnation of the impinging water flow the wetted surfaces on hull bottoms are illustrated in fig 10d g with help of water volume fractions significant forward directed spray reaching the front portion of the hull surface is noticed for the flat bottom hull and is much more pronounced for the inverse v hull the distributed pressure coefficient on the hulls is shown in fig 10h j in case of the positive deadrise hull the regions of highest pressure are represented by narrow strips along the spray root lines originating at the keel and reaching the hull chines fig 10h on the hull bottom the pressure gradually declines towards the transom where it approaches the atmospheric pressure much more concentrated zone of high pressure larger in amplitude but covering smaller area is noticed for the flat bottom hull fig 10i again it is formed near the spray root line but it declines toward the chines the pressure distribution is more uniform along the hull bottom behind this zone than in the previous case which is consistent with more forward position of the center of pressure for the flat hull fig 8e for the inverse v hull fig 10j the peak pressure zone occurs near the intersection of the keel line and the spray root line due to local concentration of high pressure and the bottom wall geometry the forward spray of this hull is narrower and more intensive fig 10g than for the flat bottom to elucidate the point about the side wall wetting made previously for the inverse v hulls at studied here conditions three dimensional views of the positive and negative deadrise hulls are given in fig 11 one can see that side walls remain dry for the normal v hull fig 11a c while a significant portion of the side walls of the inverse v hull is wetted fig 11b d which leads to increased values of the total wetted surface area of this hull fig 8c and is accompanied by the drag penalty due to larger friction resistance fig 8b distributions of hydrodynamic characteristics obtained with deeper positioned hulls l n b 4 and the same deadrise angles β 20ᵒ 0ᵒ 20ᵒ are shown in fig 12 the main flow features are similar to those of shallower hulls fig 10 the savitsky s spray root correlation works well for the positive deadrise hull fig 12a whereas there is more planform curvature in this boundary obtained with cfd for the flat bottom hull fig 12b in case of the inverse v hull unsteady flow phenomena associated with air entrainment by the water flow along the raised keel line make the flow more complex and unsteady in the impingement region the volume fraction of water and the pressure coefficient distributions fig 12d j are generally similar to those properties of shallower hulls one can observe a local pressure rise near the keel downstream of the impingement zone for the positive deadrise hull fig 12h due to increased importance of hydrostatic pressure for deeper hulls reduced pressure zones visible near the keel for the inverse v hull are caused by appearance of air in this flow region it is known that the so called numerical ventilation in cfd may predict appearance of air under hulls when it does not happen physically e g bohm and graf 2014 wheeler et al 2018 however since this process was not significant for flat and positive deadrise hulls in the present study with small scale hulls no special means were used here to suppress numerical ventilation nevertheless a role of numerical ventilation in the predicted air trapping under inverse v hulls is presently unknown and future experimental studies are needed to better understand this phenomenon for the extreme 30ᵒ deadrise hull in the current simulations the air entrainment becomes very pronounced as shown in fig 13 in this case a continuous though non uniform and unsteady air conduit is formed along the keel line fig 13a however most of this air is passing through at some distance below the hull so the hull surface near the keel line does not become completely dry although the water volume fraction falls well below one at several spots fig 13b the maximum values of the pressure coefficient decrease in comparison with lower deadrise hull fig 12f but now the elevated pressure region occupies much larger area so the hull lift continues to increase with decreasing deadrise fig 8a 5 conclusions this computational study performed at typical speeds trim angle and wetted lengths of planing craft has shown that the lift coefficient increased with decreasing deadrise angle even up to 30 the largest negative deadrise angle explored this supports the claim that the negative deadrise hulls can generate greater lift coefficients than flat plates or positive deadrise hulls this agrees qualitatively with the experimental findings of kimon 1957 and edge 1958 with 10 and 20 hulls unlike a positive deadrise planing hull with dominant flow pattens going from the keel to the chine the negative deadrise planing surface at moderate froude numbers does not push the water out from the sides of the hull as effectively resulting in side wetting however at very high froude numbers such as seen in the computations of kimon 1957 experiments the negative deadrise hull does not have side wetting the lift to drag ratio was greatest for the flat plate this is usually the case for positive deadrise hulls because the hull generates less lift with a greater wetted area and hence friction drag in this case of a negative deadrise hull the increase in lift was offset by additional frictional drag due to the increased wetted area of the bottom and sides the elimination of the side wetting mitigated to great extent the reduction in lift to drag ratio that occurred with the negative deadrise hull features such as spray rails or breaks in the side of the hull are ordinarily employed to eliminate this side wetting in general it seems that the negative deadrise hull is promising for being able to carry more weight on a given size craft than a flat bottom or positive deadrise hull this may be why the negative deadrise hull was so promising in calm water for the heavy wheeled amphibian studied by nuttall and kamm 1969 with the increase in lift coefficient also comes an increase in impact accelerations in waves this is why high positive deadrise hulls 20 30 are used for high speed offshore work despite the fact that they have a lower lift to drag ratio and require more power in some cases the boats are fitted with trim tabs to reduce the trim angle of the boat in waves and limit impact accelerations flat bottom planing boats are usually only seen on rivers and lakes despite the fact that in calm water they have greater lift to drag ratios than high deadrise hulls it is common to see warped planing hulls with higher deadrise steeper forward in order to mitigate wave slamming loads and lower deadrise flatter aft in order to produce a higher lift to drag ratio the hickman sea sled is also warped having large negative deadrise steeper forward and small negative deadrise flatter aft the present study found that the lift coefficient continued to increase all the way down to 30 deadrise this could indicate that the negative warp seen in the hickman sea sled does not mitigate the impact accelerations in waves in the same way as a conventional warped hull does in fact the impact loads on the bow may have been even greater as a result of the warp and trapping effect the inability to mitigate bow slamming with warp could be problematic for any type of offshore work and agrees qualitatively with the findings of meyer 1957 in which the bow of the patrol boat was actually broken due to high impact forces in trials as for possible future research directions investigating applications of spray rails on inverse v hulls and conducting high resolution experimental and computational studies of air entrainment on hulls with large bottom tunnels can provide useful data for practical design of high performance negative deadrise hulls underwater photographs of inverse v hulls may help determine whether numerical ventilation affects cfd prediction of air trapping further expansion of the test variables can be also used to extend the existing lift equations

21688,existing physical model test data indicate that negative deadrise planing surfaces may be capable of producing greater lift and lift to drag ratios than positive deadrise planing surfaces however there is a lack of systematic experiments in which deadrise is varied with all other parameters are fixed in this study computational fluid dynamics software star ccm is applied to simulate fixed attitude prismatic planing hulls with variable deadrise including positive and negative angles mesh dependency study and comparison with experimental data have been performed the main reported hydrodynamic characteristics include the lift and drag coefficients wetted area and center of pressure the negative deadrise hulls are found to possess higher lift capabilities while the highest lift

than the centerline fig 1 shows a rendering of a negative deadrise surface and fig 2 shows a schematic of hulls with both positive and negative deadrise including some of the notation used in this paper the negative deadrise concept formed the basis of the hickman sea sled u s patent no 1 204 355 produced in great numbers between world war i and the 1960s some of the advantages attributed to this type of hull include increased bottom lift coefficients caused by the trapping of air and water near the centerline and a reduction in spray because it is directed inward observed disadvantages include aeration of the water into the propellers high impact accelerations in waves and possible difficulty in turning while there have been design studies of boats incorporating negative deadrise there are relatively few studies exploring the hydrodynamic lift drag and pressure distribution of negative deadrise prismatic planing surfaces there are still open questions such as do negative deadrise planing surfaces generate higher lift coefficients than equivalent flat plates and what happens as the deadrise angle becomes very largely negative the present study aims to answer these questions by providing a systematic comparison of the effect of deadrise variation from positive 30 to negative 30 the study utilizes computational fluid dynamics cfd for the comparisons because of its ability to clearly show the pressure distributions which are difficult to obtain in physical model testing while this paper includes discussion of the validation methods used the purpose of this paper is not just to run cfd for a novel problem but to use this tool to explore an interesting question about the fundamentals of planing craft the majority of the systematic testing of negative deadrise hulls was done during the cold war era for design purposes clement and tate 1959 presented physical model test data of a variety of planing craft concepts including an inverted deadrise sea sled all tested at a standard bottom loading and center of gravity position at the david taylor model basin a similar hull was tested as part of the russian mbk series of small military boats egorov et al 1978 comparisons by morabito 2019 showed that the results of these tests are somewhat mixed with the negative deadrise planing hulls having a higher lift to drag ratio than some deep vee hulls but lower lift to drag ratio than well designed craft such as the series 62 clement and blount 1963 nuttall and kamm 1969 explored a negative deadrise hull for use on heavily loaded high speed wheeled amphibians finding that the negative deadrise hull had the highest lift to drag ratio of the candidate designs at planing speeds however it had double the added resistance in waves and double the seakeeping impact accelerations of all the candidate designs nuttall and kamm 1969 seakeeping tests qualitatively agreed with some of the full scale findings by meyer 1957 which showed that the sea sled hull had much higher accelerations in waves than other candidate designs theses references explored the design applications of a negative deadrise planing surface but did not explain the fundamental hydrodynamics well kimon 1957 provided systematic tests on a 10 deadrise prismatic planing surface considered for potential use as a seaplane landing ski with very low spray comparison of these systematic test data with known prismatic planing hull lift equations such as given by savitsky 1964 indicates that the negative deadrise planing surface can produce greater lift coefficients and higher lift to drag ratios than flat plates or positive deadrise planing hulls morabito 2019 the high speeds angles of attack and loading of seaplane landing skis do not overlap much with the typical conditions of most planing boats leaving some question as to whether the results are applicable to planing boats edge 1958 did impact testing of a 20 deadrise prismatic planing surface funding that the negative deadrise surface produced higher impact forces than a flat plate except at low trim around 4 6 and very high trim about 25 however it is somewhat difficult to relate these impact cases to the steady planing condition with growing computational resources cfd tools have been broadly applied for traditional planing hulls in recent years while the hull drag and attitude can be approximately predicted for these hulls in the range of speeds from the displacement to planing modes cfd results in high speed regimes often show 10 15 disagreement with test data o shea et al 2012 mousaviraad et al 2015 de luca et al 2016 sukas et al 2017 wheeler et al 2018 at the same time experimental data especially reported in older publications often had up to 20 scatter in hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls payne 1995 as concerns numerical studies of inverse v and more complicated tunnel hulls there are fewer publications in the literature kornev et al 2010 explored dynamics and stability of tunnel hulls with help of the added mass theory as a part of linearized potential flow modeling of variable deadrise hulls matveev 2014 included a negative deadrise hull and showed that the center of pressure and wetted areas of such a hull were rather different from characteristics of positive deadrise hulls using cfd simulations jiang et al 2017 investigated a transition between water and air dominant flow regimes in the tunnels of a planing trimaran the main objective of the present study is to apply cfd modeling for prismatic hulls with variable deadrise including inverse v configurations in order to investigate effects of deadrise angle on the main hydrodynamic characteristics of the hulls and to explore differences in the water deformations wetted surfaces and pressure distributions caused by variation of a deadrise angle 2 computational aspects computational modeling of planing hull hydrodynamics has been carried out using the cfd software star ccm version 2019 1 the finite volume segregated rans flow solver with the second order spatial discretization and the first order implicit time stepping was employed for most situations only steady state results are reported in this paper corresponding to the states with no longer evolving time averaged properties the water and air flows are modeled within the eulerian multiphase framework based on the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 using the constant density water and the isothermal ideal gas model for air gravity and surface tension are also accounted for the continuity momentum and volume fraction transport equations in the unsteady reynolds averaged approach can be presented as follows 1 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j

star ccm manual 2019 2 1 numerical setup the negative deadrise hull and the numerical domain with boundary conditions utilized in this study are shown in fig 3 the hull attitude was always kept fixed at specified values the domain length height and width were selected as 40 12 and 6 of the hull beams respectively the hull surface had a no slip condition imposed the symmetry plane was implemented along the body centerplane the top bottom and starboard sides of the numerical domain were treated as slip walls the velocity inlet and the pressure outlet were used at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively the time step was selected to keep the courant number below one all results presented in the next sections correspond to steady state conditions the numerical mesh employing octree formed hexahedral cells was constructed in the numerical domain fig 4 it has refinement zones near the hull and along the free surface to keep computations economical and prevent numerical instabilities at the outlet the mesh was coarsened away from the hull and a damping zone of about 5 hull beams was specified near the downstream domain boundary to resolve the boundary layer 15 prism cell layers were generated at the hull surface the overall prism layer thickness was selected as 1 cm to encompass the boundary layer in the studied conditions the near wall cell thicknesses were generally about 20 40 of y values on the water covered areas and below 3 on the air covered areas thus the wall function approach was primarily utilized on the wet surfaces whereas the resolution down to the viscous sub layer was achieved on the dry surfaces for the hull adjacent cells with intermediate y values the blended approach was used in the applied here the two layer all y method rodi 1991 for most cases in this study the realizable k ε turbulence model shih et al 1995 was employed although the rans approach and the k ε model have limited abilities in capturing shed vortices in case of hulls planing on the water surface at low attack angles and having dry transoms the k ε turbulence model works well and is often recommended for ship hydrodynamics applications de luca et al 2016 another common turbulence model the sst k ω model was also used for comparison as discussed in the next section 3 mesh dependency study and comparison with test data since the main focus of this paper is on inverse v hulls experimental data obtained by kimon 1957 for negative 10 degree deadrise planing surfaces were chosen for the mesh verification study and comparison with numerical results in kimon s work a simple prismatic hull such as shown in fig 3 was towed in a tank at different fixed attitudes and high beam based froude numbers primarily above 10 the hull length beam and height were 0 9144 m 0 1016 m and 0 0333 m respectively the reynolds numbers of the runs used for the present validation study were in the range from 2 106 to 8 106 in this study the hull heave and trim were also kept fixed in each numerical simulation the lift and drag coefficients as well as the center of pressure counted from transom and normalized by the beam l p b were reported in the experimental tests kimon 1957 and used as the primary metrics in the present verification study the beam based force coefficients as well as the beam froude number and the lift drag ratio are defined as follows 8 c l 2 l ρ w u 2 b 2 9 c d 2 d ρ w u 2 b 2 10 f r u g b 11 l d r c l c d where l and d are the lift and drag forces respectively u is the incident flow velocity b is the hull beam and g is the gravitational constant the beam froude number f r used here is the same as the speed coefficient c v used by savitsky 1964 for the mesh verification three numerical grids of different densities were generated with cell counts ranging from about 300 thousand to 1 4 million table 1 the grid dependency study was conducted for one of the experimental cases with beam froude number f r 13 21 trim angle τ 4ᵒ and transom submergence at chine d 0 32 b the numerical results obtained on three grids are summarized in table 1 monotonic convergence is attained for all three metrics demonstrating the solution verification the numerical uncertainty was assessed starting with richardson extrapolation ferziger and peric 1999 12 δ r e δ 12 α γ 1 where δ 12 is the difference between solutions obtained in the fine and medium grids α is the grid refinement ratio equal to 2 in this study and γ is the observed order of accuracy 13 γ log δ 23 δ 12 log α where δ 23 is the difference between medium and coarse mesh solutions then the richardson correction given by eq 12 was multiplied by the factor of safety calculated following the standard numerical uncertainty analysis xing and stern 2010 the grid based numerical uncertainty is listed in table 1 as percentage of the solution values obtained in the fine mesh relatively small uncertainty is achieved for the lift coefficient and the center of pressure while higher but still moderate uncertainty is attained for the drag coefficient the water volume fraction obtained on this hull surface is illustrated in fig 5 one can notice that the side walls of this hull are dry as it operates at a sufficiently high froude number a comparison of the present numerical results with experimental data kimon 1957 for this and two other test conditions is given in table 2 additionally results of cfd simulations produced using sst k ω turbulent model are also included which show relatively little difference from the simulations with the realizable k ε model the agreement between computational and experimental results is reasonably good larger deviations are observed at low submergences where results become more sensitive to hull attitudes so that small experimental errors in submergence may lead to significant variations of hydrodynamic characteristics since tests of kimon 1957 correspond to high froude numbers an additional comparison was undertaken for flat planing surfaces at variable froude numbers and hull submergences and results were compared with the empirical correlations of savitsky 1964 in the present modeling the negative deadrise hull was transformed into the flat bottom hull with zero deadrise while the hull length and beam were kept the same one set of simulations was conducted in a range of froude numbers with the fixed trim angle of 4ᵒ and the fixed relative transom submergence of d b 0 276 this state corresponds to a nominal wetted length defined as the at rest mean wetted length l n b of about 4 the use of this zero speed nominal wetted length l n is different than the use of the dynamic keel chine and mean wetted lengths seen in savitsky 1964 because the present computations are performed at fixed model attitude the dynamic mean wetted lengths will be larger than this at rest value because of the wave rise that occurs on the planing hull subsequent graphs in this paper are given showing the wetted surface area of the hull while running which may be correlated to the mean wetted length l m by the following relation 14 l m s w e t b o t t o m b cos β where s w e t b o t t o m is the wetted area of the bottom of the hull when planing and β is the deadrise angle the second set of simulations was done for variable l n b while keeping the beam froude number of 4 and trim angle of 4ᵒ the comparison of results for the three hydrodynamic characteristics lift and drag coefficients and the center of pressure normalized by beam is given figs 6 and 7 the lift and drag coefficients decrease with increasing froude number fig 6 since the nearly speed independent hydrostatic force on a fixed hull plays less important role in the force coefficients at higher speeds as forces are normalized by the speed squared fig 6 the center of pressure location increases with f r since the hydrodynamic force is applied further forward from the hull transom and a role of this force increases fig 6 the lift and drag coefficients as well as the center of pressure location also increase with increasing the hull length fig 7 since the submerged volume and length of the hull increase the agreement between the current numerical results and with savitsky s correlations is deemed satisfactory given the approximate nature of simple empirical correlations thus the current numerical approach has been demonstrated to work well for planing surfaces 4 results of parametric study since the main focus of this study is on the effect of deadrise angle parametric simulations have been carried out in a range of deadrise angles between 30ᵒ and 30ᵒ at common for planing boats beam froude number of 4 trim angle of 4ᵒ and two nominal wetted length values l n b 2 and 4 which are also in the range of practical hull attitudes the hull geometry was similar to the one used in the validation study the same length and beam with the exception of geometry of the prismatic hull bottom which deadrise angle was treated as the main variable parameter for hulls with non zero deadrise the nominal wetted length was defined as the average of the nominal wetted lengths at the keel and chine the hull trim and heave were kept fixed in each simulation the hydrodynamic metrics evaluated in the steady state planing regimes including the lift and drag coefficients lift drag ratio center of pressure and normalized wetted area are summarized in fig 8 as one can see the lift coefficients for both hull positions increase with reduction of deadrise and reach maxima at the most negative deadrise of 30ᵒ fig 8a which suggests that inverse v hulls have larger load capabilities the lift dependence on deadrise for the hulls with longer nominal length is almost linear while the lift increases at lower rate at negative β for the hulls with shorter wetted length the drag coefficients reach minima at zero deadrise fig 8b due to smaller wetted area s w e t t o t a l shown in fig 8c drag of negative deadrise hulls studied here appears to be greater than resistances of positive deadrise hulls with the same absolute values of the deadrise angle this can be attributed to much more pronounced side wetting of inverse v hulls comparison images are shown later and as a consequence larger wetted hull surface areas fig 8c the lift drag ratio l d r which is simply a lift coefficient divided by a drag coefficient peaks at the zero deadrise angle fig 8d consistent with behavior of c l and c d the lift drag ratios generally decline with increase of absolute values of deadrise angles although this trend changes at the extreme β 30ᵒ for the hull with deeper submergence at large in magnitude deadrise angles l d r of inverse v hulls tend to be higher than l d r of positive v hulls implying that increases of lift coefficients of inverse v hulls fig 8a overcome increases of their drag coefficients fig 8b moreover the negative deadrise hulls in practical applications are likely to have some kind of spray rails at the chines on their side walls that prevent or minimize the side wall wetting also the side wetting phenomenon is scale dependent and often small strips are applied at chines to eliminate side wetting on small hull models in situations when it is unlikely to appear on large scale hulls fridsma 1969 due to computational limitations only small scale models were simulated here if one is interested in the effect of eliminating the side wall wetting on the performance increase a simplistic estimation can be obtained using the present results but considering only the bottom hull surfaces where most of the lift is generated but only a fraction of drag is produced the bottom based wetted area and the corresponding lift drag ratio are shown in fig 9 while for zero and positive deadrise hulls the bottom wetted area remains almost the same as that for entire hulls figs 9a and 8c there is a large 30 40 decrease of the wetted bottom area for hulls with significant negative deadrise this results in the substantial increase of l d r b o t t o m of inverse v hulls figs 9b and 8d so the degradation of lift drag ratio for such hulls with increase of absolute deadrise angles becomes much smaller in the case with extreme deadrise β 30ᵒ and deeper submergence l n b 4 l d r b o t t o m even exceeds l d r of the zero deadrise hull another hydrodynamic characteristic important for planing hulls is the center of pressure which is presented here in hull beams forward of transom l p b for two hull positions used in the parametric study this metric is shown in fig 8e for the hull with shorter wetted length l p b does not vary much with deadrise but shows a weakly pronounced minimum at zero deadrise in case of the hull with long wetted length the center of pressure decreases significantly and monotonically with increasing deadrise angle distributions of some hydrodynamic characteristics for hulls with l n b 2 and β 20ᵒ 0ᵒ 20ᵒ are presented in fig 10 the underwater views on water surface elevations fig 10a c show typical for planing hulls near field wave patterns the wave hollow behind transom is the narrowest in case of the positive deadrise hull fig 10a since the deepest portion of this hull is located at the centerline a wide water depression exists behind the flat bottom hull fig 10b the inverse v hull exhibits two narrow wave hollows formed behind side portions of transom with deeper submergences these hollows merge together further downstream one can also observe the divergent waves originating from the side walls fig 10a c the crests of the near hull waves and the wake wash in general are the widest for the flat bottom case and the narrowest and much less pronounced for the inverse v hull also shown in fig 10 are the lines l1 and l2 designating the static water line and the spray root line calculated with the correlation given by savitsky 1964 a good agreement between the simplified savitsky s expression and the present numerical results is observed for all three cases including the inverse v hull the hull area between lines l1 and l2 is attributed to the water rise due to partial stagnation of the impinging water flow the wetted surfaces on hull bottoms are illustrated in fig 10d g with help of water volume fractions significant forward directed spray reaching the front portion of the hull surface is noticed for the flat bottom hull and is much more pronounced for the inverse v hull the distributed pressure coefficient on the hulls is shown in fig 10h j in case of the positive deadrise hull the regions of highest pressure are represented by narrow strips along the spray root lines originating at the keel and reaching the hull chines fig 10h on the hull bottom the pressure gradually declines towards the transom where it approaches the atmospheric pressure much more concentrated zone of high pressure larger in amplitude but covering smaller area is noticed for the flat bottom hull fig 10i again it is formed near the spray root line but it declines toward the chines the pressure distribution is more uniform along the hull bottom behind this zone than in the previous case which is consistent with more forward position of the center of pressure for the flat hull fig 8e for the inverse v hull fig 10j the peak pressure zone occurs near the intersection of the keel line and the spray root line due to local concentration of high pressure and the bottom wall geometry the forward spray of this hull is narrower and more intensive fig 10g than for the flat bottom to elucidate the point about the side wall wetting made previously for the inverse v hulls at studied here conditions three dimensional views of the positive and negative deadrise hulls are given in fig 11 one can see that side walls remain dry for the normal v hull fig 11a c while a significant portion of the side walls of the inverse v hull is wetted fig 11b d which leads to increased values of the total wetted surface area of this hull fig 8c and is accompanied by the drag penalty due to larger friction resistance fig 8b distributions of hydrodynamic characteristics obtained with deeper positioned hulls l n b 4 and the same deadrise angles β 20ᵒ 0ᵒ 20ᵒ are shown in fig 12 the main flow features are similar to those of shallower hulls fig 10 the savitsky s spray root correlation works well for the positive deadrise hull fig 12a whereas there is more planform curvature in this boundary obtained with cfd for the flat bottom hull fig 12b in case of the inverse v hull unsteady flow phenomena associated with air entrainment by the water flow along the raised keel line make the flow more complex and unsteady in the impingement region the volume fraction of water and the pressure coefficient distributions fig 12d j are generally similar to those properties of shallower hulls one can observe a local pressure rise near the keel downstream of the impingement zone for the positive deadrise hull fig 12h due to increased importance of hydrostatic pressure for deeper hulls reduced pressure zones visible near the keel for the inverse v hull are caused by appearance of air in this flow region it is known that the so called numerical ventilation in cfd may predict appearance of air under hulls when it does not happen physically e g bohm and graf 2014 wheeler et al 2018 however since this process was not significant for flat and positive deadrise hulls in the present study with small scale hulls no special means were used here to suppress numerical ventilation nevertheless a role of numerical ventilation in the predicted air trapping under inverse v hulls is presently unknown and future experimental studies are needed to better understand this phenomenon for the extreme 30ᵒ deadrise hull in the current simulations the air entrainment becomes very pronounced as shown in fig 13 in this case a continuous though non uniform and unsteady air conduit is formed along the keel line fig 13a however most of this air is passing through at some distance below the hull so the hull surface near the keel line does not become completely dry although the water volume fraction falls well below one at several spots fig 13b the maximum values of the pressure coefficient decrease in comparison with lower deadrise hull fig 12f but now the elevated pressure region occupies much larger area so the hull lift continues to increase with decreasing deadrise fig 8a 5 conclusions this computational study performed at typical speeds trim angle and wetted lengths of planing craft has shown that the lift coefficient increased with decreasing deadrise angle even up to 30 the largest negative deadrise angle explored this supports the claim that the negative deadrise hulls can generate greater lift coefficients than flat plates or positive deadrise hulls this agrees qualitatively with the experimental findings of kimon 1957 and edge 1958 with 10 and 20 hulls unlike a positive deadrise planing hull with dominant flow pattens going from the keel to the chine the negative deadrise planing surface at moderate froude numbers does not push the water out from the sides of the hull as effectively resulting in side wetting however at very high froude numbers such as seen in the computations of kimon 1957 experiments the negative deadrise hull does not have side wetting the lift to drag ratio was greatest for the flat plate this is usually the case for positive deadrise hulls because the hull generates less lift with a greater wetted area and hence friction drag in this case of a negative deadrise hull the increase in lift was offset by additional frictional drag due to the increased wetted area of the bottom and sides the elimination of the side wetting mitigated to great extent the reduction in lift to drag ratio that occurred with the negative deadrise hull features such as spray rails or breaks in the side of the hull are ordinarily employed to eliminate this side wetting in general it seems that the negative deadrise hull is promising for being able to carry more weight on a given size craft than a flat bottom or positive deadrise hull this may be why the negative deadrise hull was so promising in calm water for the heavy wheeled amphibian studied by nuttall and kamm 1969 with the increase in lift coefficient also comes an increase in impact accelerations in waves this is why high positive deadrise hulls 20 30 are used for high speed offshore work despite the fact that they have a lower lift to drag ratio and require more power in some cases the boats are fitted with trim tabs to reduce the trim angle of the boat in waves and limit impact accelerations flat bottom planing boats are usually only seen on rivers and lakes despite the fact that in calm water they have greater lift to drag ratios than high deadrise hulls it is common to see warped planing hulls with higher deadrise steeper forward in order to mitigate wave slamming loads and lower deadrise flatter aft in order to produce a higher lift to drag ratio the hickman sea sled is also warped having large negative deadrise steeper forward and small negative deadrise flatter aft the present study found that the lift coefficient continued to increase all the way down to 30 deadrise this could indicate that the negative warp seen in the hickman sea sled does not mitigate the impact accelerations in waves in the same way as a conventional warped hull does in fact the impact loads on the bow may have been even greater as a result of the warp and trapping effect the inability to mitigate bow slamming with warp could be problematic for any type of offshore work and agrees qualitatively with the findings of meyer 1957 in which the bow of the patrol boat was actually broken due to high impact forces in trials as for possible future research directions investigating applications of spray rails on inverse v hulls and conducting high resolution experimental and computational studies of air entrainment on hulls with large bottom tunnels can provide useful data for practical design of high performance negative deadrise hulls underwater photographs of inverse v hulls may help determine whether numerical ventilation affects cfd prediction of air trapping further expansion of the test variables can be also used to extend the existing lift equations

21689,a full time domain two dimensional 2 d numerical model was established for the coupled dynamic analysis of submerged floating tunnel sft structures for hydrodynamic loads a second order time domain potential flow numerical model was developed and a higher order boundary element method hobem was applied to discretize the body boundary and the free surface boundary the elastic rod theory was used to analyse the cable force to the sft hinged boundary conditions were used at the junction of the mooring line and the structure the viscous damping coefficient of the submerged cylinder was obtained through a decay physical model test which was employed in the numerical simulation in the coupled dynamic analysis the motion equation for the hull and dynamic equations for the mooring lines were solved simultaneously using the newmark β method the coupled analysis numerical model was applied in an sft simulation with waves of different frequencies the influences of viscous damping buoyancy weight ratios bwrs and mooring stiffness distributions on the first and second order motion responses and tension of the mooring lines are analysed in detail and some significant conclusions are presented keywords submerged floating tunnel mooring system coupled dynamic model buoyancy weight ratio mooring stiffness viscous damping 1 introduction a submerged floating tunnel sft is a new traffic structure concept for crossing a strait bay or lake the sft has a large internal space that is sufficient for roads and even railways there are harsh natural conditions in some fjords and traditional spanning methods such as cross sea bridges and immersed tunnels are not feasible due to environmental conditions and technical constraints however in such conditions an sft offers the possibility of crossing sft support systems are generally categorized according to the buoyancy weight ratio bwr free type bwr 1 pressure bearing pier type bwr 1 buoy type and tension leg type bwr 1 in a free system there is no supporting connection system the sft floats freely in the sea which has too many restrictions in use a pressure bearing pier system is similar to a submarine bridge and is stabilized by its own gravity a tension leg system which uses a mooring system to balance buoyancy and gravity is generally more widely studied the choice of the size and stiffness of the anchor chain is closely related to the overall force and motion response of the sft an sft is continuously exposed to wave effects from the free surface because the submerged depth is not sufficient to avoid free surface waves kunisu et al 1994 addressed the wave force characteristics and dynamic behaviour of the sft with numerical calculations using morison s equation remseth et al 1999 discussed the stochastic dynamic response of an sft to wind driven waves and time domain earthquake analysis with particular emphasis on fluid structure interaction mai 2005 also applied morison equation to solve the fluid force acting on the sft and established a static dynamic finite element numerical model for the sft structure in which the analysis of static dynamic response could be conducted wang 2008 further considered the role of nonlinear lift force and simulated the overall motion response using finite element software long 2009 used fifth order stokes wave theory and morison formula to calculate the dynamic response of an sft under different bwrs and proposed an optimised range of bwr for the sft prototype lu et al 2011 investigated sft dynamics with tether slacking and the related snap force under wave conditions and provided an alternative philosophy for sft structural design concerned with preventing the occurrence of tether slacking and snap force seo et al 2015 proposed a simplified method for estimation of an sft behaviour in waves conducting physical model tests in a wave flume for variation for the wave exciting force calculation of an sft in waves many scholars have applied high precision numerical models in addition to empirical formulas full nonlinear potential numerical wave tank models have been used by guerber et al 2012 hannan et al 2014 and bai et al 2014 to examine the higher harmonics of wave forces on a horizontal submerged circular cylinder liu et al 2016 and teng et al 2018 2019 used the viscous flow theory to calculate the wave action on a submerged cylinder for tension leg type floating bodies previous research has focused on the tension leg platform tlp adrezin and benaroya 1999a 1999b investigated the coupled dynamic response of a tlp with a single tendon in which the hull was represented by a rigid cylindrical body and the tendon by a nonlinear elastic beam chandraekaran and jain 2002a 2002b studied the dynamic responses of square and triangular configuration tlps under random sea wave loads tabeshpour et al 2006 focused on the comprehensive interpretation of structure responses in random sea in both time and frequency domains however the diffraction effects and second order wave forces were not considered zeng et al 2007 analysed the nonlinear behaviour of a tlp with finite displacement in which multifold nonlinearities were considered subsequently the dynamic responses of a tlp with a slack taut tether were studied considering several nonlinear factors induced by large amplitude motions zeng et al 2009 however a tension leg type sft is different from a tlp as the sft must meet traffic requirements its motion response must be controlled not only in the vertical direction but also in the horizontal direction through the mooring system which results in the natural frequency increasing because the structure is submerged in water its own radiation damping is small viscous damping must be considered in the calculation to minimize calculation error based on the previous research this study fully considers the wave effects from the free surface on the mooring sft and use the hobem based on potential flow theory to simulate the wave load the viscous damping is obtained from the physical model test the mooring line dynamics are simulated by the finite element method fem based on the rod theory in the coupled dynamic analysis the motion equation for the hull of sft and dynamic equations for the mooring lines are solved simultaneously using the newmark β method numerical results including first and second order motion responses and tension at the top of the mooring lines are presented and some further suggestions for sfts are proposed 2 mathematic formulations 2 1 second order potential flow theory because the length of an sft is much greater than the section size two right handed two dimensional 2 d coordinate systems fig 1 can be established to investigate the interaction between waves and the sft one is a space fixed coordinate system oxz with its origin at the still water surface with x measured horizontally and z measured vertically the other is a body fixed coordinate system o x z the water depth is defined as d and the submerged depth from the free surface to the centre of the structure is defined as h under the assumption of ideal fluid there exists a velocity potential φ that satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain and it is subjected to the corresponding boundary conditions the velocity potential φ wave elevation η translation motion ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 and rotation motion α ξ 3 can be expanded following the stokes expansion procedure in addition the velocity potential and wave elevation can also be separated into incident and scattered components which are expressed with subscripts i and s respectively 1 φ ε φ i 1 φ s 1 ε 2 φ i 2 φ s 2 2 η ε η i 1 η s 1 ε 2 η i 2 η s 2 3 ξ ε ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 4 α ε α 1 ε 2 α 2 where ε is a small perturbation parameter related to the wave steepness the superscripts 1 and 2 indicate separately the wave components at the first and second order of ε respectively for the kth order scattered wave

k z z 0 ξ 2 k ξ 2 k α k x x 0 by applying green s second theorem to the scattered potential and green s function the boundary value problem can be converted to the boundary integral equation the corresponding formulations have been described in previous research jin and gou 2018 after obtaining the velocity potential the wave force on a moving body can be calculated by integrating the fluid pressure over the mean body surface the total force can be divided into several terms via their orders in ε 17 f ε f d 1 f s 1 ε 2 f d 2 f s 2 f i 2 the first order term can be further divided into 18 f d 1 ρ s m φ 1 t n d s 19 f s 1 ρ g l w p ξ 2 1 α x f x 0 k 0 where f d 1 is the dynamic force and f s 1 is the restoring force which is zero for the sft the second order terms can also be written as 20 f d 2 ρ s m φ 2 t n d s 21 f s 2 ρ g l w p ξ 2 2 α x f x 0 k 0 22 f i 2 ρ s b n 1 2 φ w 1 2 φ t 1 ξ 1 α 1 x x 0 d l where f d 2 is the second order dynamic wave force in the numerical model f s 2 is the second order restoring force and f i 2 is the second order component contributed by the first order potential and the first order body movement 2 2 dynamic force of mooring system in this study an elastic slender rod garrett 1982 was proposed to simulate mooring lines considering linear tension and bending behaviour the finite element method was used to solve the problem assuming that there is no torque or applied external moment on a mooring line a linear momentum conversion equation with respect to a position vector r s t which is a function of arc length s and time t can be expressed as 23 f m i q ρ r 24 λ t e i κ 2 where f mi is the internal force q is the external force unit length ρ is the mass per length and r is the unit cut vector the point above the vector r indicates the derivative of the time ei is the bending stiffness t is the local tension and κ is the local curvature the scalar variable λ can be regarded as a lagrange multiplier if the rod is considered stretchable and stretching is linear and small the following extensible condition must be satisfied 25 1 2 r r 1 t a e λ a e for these equations geometric nonlinearity is fully considered and there is no special assumption made concerning the shape or orientation of lines eq 23 is directly defined in a global coordinate system and does not require any transformations to the local coordinate system eqs 23 and 25 are the basic governing equations for the mooring cable finite element analysis 2 3 coupled dynamic analysis methods the dynamic equation of the mooring line and the motion equation of the floater are coupled by matching conditions at the fairleads the first order and second order motion equations for hull are expressed as 26 m ξ 1 b ξ 1 c ξ 1 f d 1 f m 1 27 m ξ 2 b ξ 2 c ξ 2 f d 2 f i 2 f m 2 where m is the mass matrix of a rigid body b is the viscous damping matrix c is the restoring force matrix f m k is the kth order mooring force of the anchor chains coupling analysis of the entire system can be achieved by applying appropriate boundary conditions at the fairleads in this study hinged boundary conditions are used at the junction of the mooring line and the floater the coordinates of the mooring point of the lth cable in the body fixed coordinate system are r cl and the coordinates of the rotation centre in the body fixed coordinate system are r 0 at any time the coordinates of the mooring point in the space fixed coordinate system are r cl which can be expressed as 28 r c l r 0 ξ t t r c l r 0 where t is a transformation matrix between a body fixed coordinate system and a space fixed coordinate system and is an orthogonal matrix t t t 1 the expression of t is 29 t cos α sin α sin α cos α it is assumed that the mooring point is at the top unit and the forces on the mooring cable tension leg at the mooring point are 30 f l λ r e i r if the mooring system of the floating body contains l mooring cables based on the relationship between the force and the reaction force the force on the floating body is 31 f m l 1 l f l l 1 l f l 2 4 derivation of damping coefficient to obtain precise motion response of the sft the damping force should be considered in the motion equation which is obtained from the decay experiment in the wave tank the free motion equation of the sft in still water is 32 m i i a i i ξ i b i i b i i ξ i k i i c i i ξ i 0 where a ii b ii and k ii are main diagonal elements of added mass matrix radiation damping and stiffness matrix respectively defining 2 λ i b i i b i i m i i a i i and ω i 2 k i i c i i m i i a i i eq 32 can be written as follow 33 ξ i 2 λ i ξ i ω i 2 ξ 0 whose solution is 34 ξ ξ a 0 e λ i t cos ω i t μ i ω sin ω i t where ξ a0 is the initial displacement λ i b i i b i i 2 m i i a i i is the damping coefficient and ω i ω i 2 λ i 2 is the natural frequency considering the water damping μ i λ i ω i is the dimensionless decay coefficient according to the decay curve the motion amplitude decays exponentially over time the nth peak value of motion is recorded as ξ an therefore the expression of dimensionless decay coefficient is 35 μ i 1 π n 1 n 2 n ln ξ i a n 1 ξ i a n after obtaining the viscous damping the motion response can be revised by the damping force which is opposite to the direction of movement when a submerged cylinder is located in deep water the influence of the free surface is weak the radiation damping approaches zero and the added mass of the submerged cylinder in the surge and heave directions tends to be consistent for this reason the viscous damping in the surge and heave directions is the same 3 decay experiment results of single degree of freedom 3 1 experiment equipment and measuring instruments the physical model experiments were conducted in the wave flume of tiwte china the flume was 44 m long 0 5 m wide and 1 2 m deep the sft element model was manufactured from plastic and concrete the manufactured model of the sft element is shown in fig 2 the two mooring lines are connected with springs and tighteners the water depth d was 0 70 m the submerged depth h was 0 30 m and the diameter of the submerged cylinder d was 0 16 m the bwrs were 1 20 1 35 and 1 50 to confirm the mooring lines tight to obtain accurate motion characteristics of the sft the error of the model parameters in manufacture was controlled within 2 the motion responses of the sft were measured synchronously by an electromagnetic motion system the transmitter was fixed on the wooden frame without affecting the magnetic field 0 5 m above the assembly and emitted space magnetic field as the origin of the reference frame the receiver was attached at the top centre of the assembly to position and track the six real time dofs of the rigid body by continuous processing of the magnetic signal the accuracy is 1 mm for translations and 0 4 for rotations all data were sampled at 120 hz 3 2 experiment results the free decay physical model experiment for a tension leg type sft was conducted to obtain the natural periods and viscous damping the moored uniform structure was set with a small initial displacement and released to return to the equilibrium position gradually by the spring stiffness of the mooring system figs 3 and 4 shows the time curves of the sway and heave directions of the sft in the free decay experiment with different bwrs table 1 shows the natural frequency dimensionless decay coefficient and damping coefficient of the submerged cylinder in different directions of movement it is observed that the decay coefficient is almost the same in surge and heave directions which illustrates that damping is only related to shape and mass in the water the damping coefficient is approximately 0 10 for a submerged cylinder in the calculation of viscous damping which is subsequently employed in the numerical simulation the damping obtained through the free decay experiment is the total damping during movement including the radiation damping and fluid viscous damping of the submerged cylinder the radiation damping can be calculated by the wave radiation theory and the viscous damping can be obtained by subtracting the radiation damping from the total damping for the sft in deep water the radiation damping is negligibly small and ignored in the calculation 3 3 dynamic analysis of an sft with mooring system a tension leg type sft is a combination of a submerged structure and tension legs this section verifies the correctness of the hydrodynamic model of the submerged structure and analyses the effects of the bwr and the mooring stiffness on the motion response of the sft 3 4 model validation the current numerical model is implemented to simulate the example conducted by other scholars ogilvie 1963 vada 1987 who calculated the diffraction force on a horizontal fixed cylinder under waves the water depth d was 0 85 m the submerged depth h was 0 102 m and the radius of cylinder r was 0 051 m the scholars analysed the keulegan carpenter kc number on the wave force defined as 36 k c π h 2 r exp k h π a r exp k h where h is the wave height a is the wave amplitude and k is the wave number in the current study the influence of the kc number on the hydrodynamic forces is investigated by varying the wave amplitude from 0 006 m to 0 024 m and the wave period is 1 0 s the comparison of first and second order wave forces is presented in fig 5 the results show that the first and second order diffraction wave forces coincide with potential flow results in previous research which illustrates the accuracy of the diffraction force calculation to better validate the numerical model a mooring floating box with width b 2 0 m and draft t 0 5 m in bichromatic waves calculated here the water depth is 1 0 m and the spring stiffness in surge motion is k x ρgh 0 05 a series of bichromatic waves with the same wave frequencies ω 1 2 424 rad s ω 2 2 140 rad s and different wave amplitudes are chosen as the incident waves a sketch of the system is shown in fig 6 the second order dimensionless surge motions induced by wave difference frequencies are shown in fig 7 and compared with previous results agnon et al 1988 ohyama and hsu 1995 the comparison reveals that all calculation results coincide with the analytical results and nonlinear numerical results combining the two validation examples and considering the small motion amplitude of sft the current numerical model is suitable for the analysis in this study 3 5 results discussion for a tension leg type sft in addition to vertical mooring lines inclined anchor chains are required to limit the horizontal displacement of the structure a coupled numerical model of the sft and mooring system is established fig 8 shows the sketch of numerical model 3 5 1 the effect of bwr of sft on the motion response in the design of the sft with a mooring system the proper bwr must be calculated to balance the safety and economy of sft when the bwr is large the system is light in overall weight with reduced construction costs but the mooring system has a large pre tension and a poor safety condition when the bwr is small the overall weight is heavy and the construction cost is large due to the long tunnel length in the calculation the mass centre and the rotation centre are both in the middle of the sft at 30 m if the size of the sft is fixed the buoyancy of the structure is fixed and the calculated bwrs are 1 20 1 35 and 1 50 the detailed parameters of the sft per metre in the calculation are presented in table 2 the mooring system consists of four identical anchors that bear the same vertical pre tension the properties of the mooring system are presented in table 3 the wave amplitude is 1 2 m and the wave frequencies in the calculation range from 0 3 rad s to 1 7 rad s there are too many cases in the calculation to show all of them the time histories of some cases are shown here in one case the sft is affected by a relatively low frequency wave in the other case the sft is affected by a relatively high frequency wave in the calculation to analyse the influence of viscous damping on the sft motion response the time histories of motion response with and without viscous damping are compared figs 9 11 show the results of the first order and second order motion and the tension of each mooring line when the wave frequency is 0 4 rad s and bwr 1 20 it is observed from the calculation results that there is little difference in the motion response with and without viscous damping the motion response with viscous damping is slightly smaller than without viscous damping the same trend is found in the comparison of the amplitude spectrum as shown in figs 12 and 13 for the low frequency wave the first order and second order wave frequencies are far from the natural frequency of the sft at this time the motion of the sft is only affected by the incident wave and the calculation results considering the influence of viscous damping are smaller than those without considering the influence of viscous damping fig 14 16 show the corresponding results when the wave frequency is 1 2 rad s and bwr 1 50 it is observed from the calculation results that with and without damping the motion response results are quite different both in amplitude and phase the time histories are analysed in detail by fourier transform as shown in figs 17 and 18 when viscous damping is considered the motion of the sft is affected mainly by waves without considering viscous damping the motion is affected by waves and also by the natural frequency of the structure indicating that the existence of viscous damping weakens the resonance phenomenon caused by waves near the natural frequency of the sft structure in summary the viscous damping of the sft has little influence on the motion response far from the natural frequency but has a great influence on the motion response near the natural frequency which greatly weakens the resonance effect at the natural frequency of the structure thus it cannot be ignored in the calculation and the influence on the result is considered in subsequent calculations because the sft consists of inclined and vertical anchor chains the horizontal stiffness of the sft is less than the vertical stiffness thus the horizontal movement of the sft is usually greater than the vertical movement due to the existence of second order mean drift force a small mean offset is observed in the second order displacement response the mean drift value accounts for a relatively small proportion of the horizontal motion amplitude but accounts for a large proportion relative to motion amplitude in the vertical direction first and second order results of the sft under different bwrs and different wave frequencies are presented in figs 19 and 20 the first order result is the vibration amplitude the second order result includes the vibration amplitude and the mean drift value which further reflects the analysis although the bwr has little effect on the motion response of the sft it has a greater influence on the tension of the mooring system as shown in figs 21 and 22 different bwrs suggest different pretensions in the mooring system a larger bwr requires that a larger anchor cable tension to stabilise the sft once the performance of one anchor cable in the mooring system changes it has a great impact on the overall force therefore a smaller bwr for a tension leg type sft is recommended 3 5 2 the effect of mooring stiffness on the motion response in the previous section the influence of bwr on the motion response of sft was studied the effect of mooring stiffness on the motion response under the same conditions is investigated in this section to reduce the motion response the proper stiffness distribution is critical three stiffness distributions are compared case a the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain stiffness1 is greater than that of the vertical anchor chain stiffness2 case b the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain stiffness2 is less than that of the vertical anchor chain stiffness1 case c the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain stiffness 2 is the same as that of the vertical chain as shown in table 4 in the calculation all sft parameters are the same as in the previous example the submerged depth is 30 0 m and the bwr is 1 20 the mooring system properties are different as shown in table 5 figs 23 26 show the first and second order motion response comparisons for the three mooring conditions in surge and heave directions when the incident wave frequency is 0 5 rad s it is observed that when the anchor chain stiffness of the sft increases the overall first and second order displacements of the sft decrease the increase in the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain mainly reduces the surge motion displacement the heave motion displacement also decreases the increase in the stiffness of the vertical anchor chain mainly reduces the heave motion displacement the surge motion displacement also decreases from the data analysis it is observed that the effect of increased stiffness of the inclined anchor chain is better than the effect of increased stiffness of the vertical anchor chain figs 27 and 28 show the first and second order motion response with different mooring systems under different wave frequencies containing surge motion and heave motion the second order motion results fig 28 show that the increase in mooring stiffness has a significant effect on the mean drift value and the

21689,a full time domain two dimensional 2 d numerical model was established for the coupled dynamic analysis of submerged floating tunnel sft structures for hydrodynamic loads a second order time domain potential flow numerical model was developed and a higher order boundary element method hobem was applied to discretize the body boundary and the free surface boundary the elastic rod theory was used to analyse the cable force to the sft hinged boundary conditions were used at the junction of the mooring line and the structure the viscous damping coefficient of the submerged cylinder was obtained through a decay physical model test which was employed in the numerical simulation in the coupled dynamic analysis the motion equation for the hull and dynamic equations for the mooring lines were solved simultaneously using the newmark β method the coupled analysis numerical model was applied in an sft simulation with waves of different frequencies the influences of viscous damping buoyancy weight ratios bwrs and mooring stiffness distributions on the first and second order motion responses and tension of the mooring lines are analysed in detail and some significant conclusions are presented keywords submerged floating tunnel mooring system coupled dynamic model buoyancy weight ratio mooring stiffness viscous damping 1 introduction a submerged floating tunnel sft is a new traffic structure concept for crossing a strait bay or lake the sft has a large internal space that is sufficient for roads and even railways there are harsh natural conditions in some fjords and traditional spanning methods such as cross sea bridges and immersed tunnels are not feasible due to environmental conditions and technical constraints however in such conditions an sft offers the possibility of crossing sft support systems are generally categorized according to the buoyancy weight ratio bwr free type bwr 1 pressure bearing pier type bwr 1 buoy type and tension leg type bwr 1 in a free system there is no supporting connection system the sft floats freely in the sea which has too many restrictions in use a pressure bearing pier system is similar to a submarine bridge and is stabilized by its own gravity a tension leg system which uses a mooring system to balance buoyancy and gravity is generally more widely studied the choice of the size and stiffness of the anchor chain is closely related to the overall force and motion response of the sft an sft is continuously exposed to wave effects from the free surface because the submerged depth is not sufficient to avoid free surface waves kunisu et al 1994 addressed the wave force characteristics and dynamic behaviour of the sft with numerical calculations using morison s equation remseth et al 1999 discussed the stochastic dynamic response of an sft to wind driven waves and time domain earthquake analysis with particular emphasis on fluid structure interaction mai 2005 also applied morison equation to solve the fluid force acting on the sft and established a static dynamic finite element numerical model for the sft structure in which the analysis of static dynamic response could be conducted wang 2008 further considered the role of nonlinear lift force and simulated the overall motion response using finite element software long 2009 used fifth order stokes wave theory and morison formula to calculate the dynamic response of an sft under different bwrs and proposed an optimised range of bwr for the sft prototype lu et al 2011 investigated sft dynamics with tether slacking and the related snap force under wave conditions and provided an alternative philosophy for sft structural design concerned with preventing the occurrence of tether slacking and snap force seo et al 2015 proposed a simplified method for estimation of an sft behaviour in waves conducting physical model tests in a wave flume for variation for the wave exciting force calculation of an sft in waves many scholars have applied high precision numerical models in addition to empirical formulas full nonlinear potential numerical wave tank models have been used by guerber et al 2012 hannan et al 2014 and bai et al 2014 to examine the higher harmonics of wave forces on a horizontal submerged circular cylinder liu et al 2016 and teng et al 2018 2019 used the viscous flow theory to calculate the wave action on a submerged cylinder for tension leg type floating bodies previous research has focused on the tension leg platform tlp adrezin and benaroya 1999a 1999b investigated the coupled dynamic response of a tlp with a single tendon in which the hull was represented by a rigid cylindrical body and the tendon by a nonlinear elastic beam chandraekaran and jain 2002a 2002b studied the dynamic responses of square and triangular configuration tlps under random sea wave loads tabeshpour et al 2006 focused on the comprehensive interpretation of structure responses in random sea in both time and frequency domains however the diffraction effects and second order wave forces were not considered zeng et al 2007 analysed the nonlinear behaviour of a tlp with finite displacement in which multifold nonlinearities were considered subsequently the dynamic responses of a tlp with a slack taut tether were studied considering several nonlinear factors induced by large amplitude motions zeng et al 2009 however a tension leg type sft is different from a tlp as the sft must meet traffic requirements its motion response must be controlled not only in the vertical direction but also in the horizontal direction through the mooring system which results in the natural frequency increasing because the structure is submerged in water its own radiation damping is small viscous damping must be considered in the calculation to minimize calculation error based on the previous research this study fully considers the wave effects from the free surface on the mooring sft and use the hobem based on potential flow theory to simulate the wave load the viscous damping is obtained from the physical model test the mooring line dynamics are simulated by the finite element method fem based on the rod theory in the coupled dynamic analysis the motion equation for the hull of sft and dynamic equations for the mooring lines are solved simultaneously using the newmark β method numerical results including first and second order motion responses and tension at the top of the mooring lines are presented and some further suggestions for sfts are proposed 2 mathematic formulations 2 1 second order potential flow theory because the length of an sft is much greater than the section size two right handed two dimensional 2 d coordinate systems fig 1 can be established to investigate the interaction between waves and the sft one is a space fixed coordinate system oxz with its origin at the still water surface with x measured horizontally and z measured vertically the other is a body fixed coordinate system o x z the water depth is defined as d and the submerged depth from the free surface to the centre of the structure is defined as h under the assumption of ideal fluid there exists a velocity potential φ that satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain and it is subjected to the corresponding boundary conditions the velocity potential φ wave elevation η translation motion ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 and rotation motion α ξ 3 can be expanded following the stokes expansion procedure in addition the velocity potential and wave elevation can also be separated into incident and scattered components which are expressed with subscripts i and s respectively 1 φ ε φ i 1 φ s 1 ε 2 φ i 2 φ s 2 2 η ε η i 1 η s 1 ε 2 η i 2 η s 2 3 ξ ε ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 4 α ε α 1 ε 2 α 2 where ε is a small perturbation parameter related to the wave steepness the superscripts 1 and 2 indicate separately the wave components at the first and second order of ε respectively for the kth order scattered wave problem k 1 2 the scattered velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation in the domain 5 2 φ s k 0 and is subjected to the boundary conditions applied on the seabed the mean body surface and the still water surface respectively as 6 φ s k z 0 7 φ s k n φ i k n b k 8 η s k t φ s k z f 1 k 9 φ s k t g η s k f 2 k where b k f 1 k and f 2 k are the forcing items on the body surface and the free

k z z 0 ξ 2 k ξ 2 k α k x x 0 by applying green s second theorem to the scattered potential and green s function the boundary value problem can be converted to the boundary integral equation the corresponding formulations have been described in previous research jin and gou 2018 after obtaining the velocity potential the wave force on a moving body can be calculated by integrating the fluid pressure over the mean body surface the total force can be divided into several terms via their orders in ε 17 f ε f d 1 f s 1 ε 2 f d 2 f s 2 f i 2 the first order term can be further divided into 18 f d 1 ρ s m φ 1 t n d s 19 f s 1 ρ g l w p ξ 2 1 α x f x 0 k 0 where f d 1 is the dynamic force and f s 1 is the restoring force which is zero for the sft the second order terms can also be written as 20 f d 2 ρ s m φ 2 t n d s 21 f s 2 ρ g l w p ξ 2 2 α x f x 0 k 0 22 f i 2 ρ s b n 1 2 φ w 1 2 φ t 1 ξ 1 α 1 x x 0 d l where f d 2 is the second order dynamic wave force in the numerical model f s 2 is the second order restoring force and f i 2 is the second order component contributed by the first order potential and the first order body movement 2 2 dynamic force of mooring system in this study an elastic slender rod garrett 1982 was proposed to simulate mooring lines considering linear tension and bending behaviour the finite element method was used to solve the problem assuming that there is no torque or applied external moment on a mooring line a linear momentum conversion equation with respect to a position vector r s t which is a function of arc length s and time t can be expressed as 23 f m i q ρ r 24 λ t e i κ 2 where f mi is the internal force q is the external force unit length ρ is the mass per length and r is the unit cut vector the point above the vector r indicates the derivative of the time ei is the bending stiffness t is the local tension and κ is the local curvature the scalar variable λ can be regarded as a lagrange multiplier if the rod is considered stretchable and stretching is linear and small the following extensible condition must be satisfied 25 1 2 r r 1 t a e λ a e for these equations geometric nonlinearity is fully considered and there is no special assumption made concerning the shape or orientation of lines eq 23 is directly defined in a global coordinate system and does not require any transformations to the local coordinate system eqs 23 and 25 are the basic governing equations for the mooring cable finite element analysis 2 3 coupled dynamic analysis methods the dynamic equation of the mooring line and the motion equation of the floater are coupled by matching conditions at the fairleads the first order and second order motion equations for hull are expressed as 26 m ξ 1 b ξ 1 c ξ 1 f d 1 f m 1 27 m ξ 2 b ξ 2 c ξ 2 f d 2 f i 2 f m 2 where m is the mass matrix of a rigid body b is the viscous damping matrix c is the restoring force matrix f m k is the kth order mooring force of the anchor chains coupling analysis of the entire system can be achieved by applying appropriate boundary conditions at the fairleads in this study hinged boundary conditions are used at the junction of the mooring line and the floater the coordinates of the mooring point of the lth cable in the body fixed coordinate system are r cl and the coordinates of the rotation centre in the body fixed coordinate system are r 0 at any time the coordinates of the mooring point in the space fixed coordinate system are r cl which can be expressed as 28 r c l r 0 ξ t t r c l r 0 where t is a transformation matrix between a body fixed coordinate system and a space fixed coordinate system and is an orthogonal matrix t t t 1 the expression of t is 29 t cos α sin α sin α cos α it is assumed that the mooring point is at the top unit and the forces on the mooring cable tension leg at the mooring point are 30 f l λ r e i r if the mooring system of the floating body contains l mooring cables based on the relationship between the force and the reaction force the force on the floating body is 31 f m l 1 l f l l 1 l f l 2 4 derivation of damping coefficient to obtain precise motion response of the sft the damping force should be considered in the motion equation which is obtained from the decay experiment in the wave tank the free motion equation of the sft in still water is 32 m i i a i i ξ i b i i b i i ξ i k i i c i i ξ i 0 where a ii b ii and k ii are main diagonal elements of added mass matrix radiation damping and stiffness matrix respectively defining 2 λ i b i i b i i m i i a i i and ω i 2 k i i c i i m i i a i i eq 32 can be written as follow 33 ξ i 2 λ i ξ i ω i 2 ξ 0 whose solution is 34 ξ ξ a 0 e λ i t cos ω i t μ i ω sin ω i t where ξ a0 is the initial displacement λ i b i i b i i 2 m i i a i i is the damping coefficient and ω i ω i 2 λ i 2 is the natural frequency considering the water damping μ i λ i ω i is the dimensionless decay coefficient according to the decay curve the motion amplitude decays exponentially over time the nth peak value of motion is recorded as ξ an therefore the expression of dimensionless decay coefficient is 35 μ i 1 π n 1 n 2 n ln ξ i a n 1 ξ i a n after obtaining the viscous damping the motion response can be revised by the damping force which is opposite to the direction of movement when a submerged cylinder is located in deep water the influence of the free surface is weak the radiation damping approaches zero and the added mass of the submerged cylinder in the surge and heave directions tends to be consistent for this reason the viscous damping in the surge and heave directions is the same 3 decay experiment results of single degree of freedom 3 1 experiment equipment and measuring instruments the physical model experiments were conducted in the wave flume of tiwte china the flume was 44 m long 0 5 m wide and 1 2 m deep the sft element model was manufactured from plastic and concrete the manufactured model of the sft element is shown in fig 2 the two mooring lines are connected with springs and tighteners the water depth d was 0 70 m the submerged depth h was 0 30 m and the diameter of the submerged cylinder d was 0 16 m the bwrs were 1 20 1 35 and 1 50 to confirm the mooring lines tight to obtain accurate motion characteristics of the sft the error of the model parameters in manufacture was controlled within 2 the motion responses of the sft were measured synchronously by an electromagnetic motion system the transmitter was fixed on the wooden frame without affecting the magnetic field 0 5 m above the assembly and emitted space magnetic field as the origin of the reference frame the receiver was attached at the top centre of the assembly to position and track the six real time dofs of the rigid body by continuous processing of the magnetic signal the accuracy is 1 mm for translations and 0 4 for rotations all data were sampled at 120 hz 3 2 experiment results the free decay physical model experiment for a tension leg type sft was conducted to obtain the natural periods and viscous damping the moored uniform structure was set with a small initial displacement and released to return to the equilibrium position gradually by the spring stiffness of the mooring system figs 3 and 4 shows the time curves of the sway and heave directions of the sft in the free decay experiment with different bwrs table 1 shows the natural frequency dimensionless decay coefficient and damping coefficient of the submerged cylinder in different directions of movement it is observed that the decay coefficient is almost the same in surge and heave directions which illustrates that damping is only related to shape and mass in the water the damping coefficient is approximately 0 10 for a submerged cylinder in the calculation of viscous damping which is subsequently employed in the numerical simulation the damping obtained through the free decay experiment is the total damping during movement including the radiation damping and fluid viscous damping of the submerged cylinder the radiation damping can be calculated by the wave radiation theory and the viscous damping can be obtained by subtracting the radiation damping from the total damping for the sft in deep water the radiation damping is negligibly small and ignored in the calculation 3 3 dynamic analysis of an sft with mooring system a tension leg type sft is a combination of a submerged structure and tension legs this section verifies the correctness of the hydrodynamic model of the submerged structure and analyses the effects of the bwr and the mooring stiffness on the motion response of the sft 3 4 model validation the current numerical model is implemented to simulate the example conducted by other scholars ogilvie 1963 vada 1987 who calculated the diffraction force on a horizontal fixed cylinder under waves the water depth d was 0 85 m the submerged depth h was 0 102 m and the radius of cylinder r was 0 051 m the scholars analysed the keulegan carpenter kc number on the wave force defined as 36 k c π h 2 r exp k h π a r exp k h where h is the wave height a is the wave amplitude and k is the wave number in the current study the influence of the kc number on the hydrodynamic forces is investigated by varying the wave amplitude from 0 006 m to 0 024 m and the wave period is 1 0 s the comparison of first and second order wave forces is presented in fig 5 the results show that the first and second order diffraction wave forces coincide with potential flow results in previous research which illustrates the accuracy of the diffraction force calculation to better validate the numerical model a mooring floating box with width b 2 0 m and draft t 0 5 m in bichromatic waves calculated here the water depth is 1 0 m and the spring stiffness in surge motion is k x ρgh 0 05 a series of bichromatic waves with the same wave frequencies ω 1 2 424 rad s ω 2 2 140 rad s and different wave amplitudes are chosen as the incident waves a sketch of the system is shown in fig 6 the second order dimensionless surge motions induced by wave difference frequencies are shown in fig 7 and compared with previous results agnon et al 1988 ohyama and hsu 1995 the comparison reveals that all calculation results coincide with the analytical results and nonlinear numerical results combining the two validation examples and considering the small motion amplitude of sft the current numerical model is suitable for the analysis in this study 3 5 results discussion for a tension leg type sft in addition to vertical mooring lines inclined anchor chains are required to limit the horizontal displacement of the structure a coupled numerical model of the sft and mooring system is established fig 8 shows the sketch of numerical model 3 5 1 the effect of bwr of sft on the motion response in the design of the sft with a mooring system the proper bwr must be calculated to balance the safety and economy of sft when the bwr is large the system is light in overall weight with reduced construction costs but the mooring system has a large pre tension and a poor safety condition when the bwr is small the overall weight is heavy and the construction cost is large due to the long tunnel length in the calculation the mass centre and the rotation centre are both in the middle of the sft at 30 m if the size of the sft is fixed the buoyancy of the structure is fixed and the calculated bwrs are 1 20 1 35 and 1 50 the detailed parameters of the sft per metre in the calculation are presented in table 2 the mooring system consists of four identical anchors that bear the same vertical pre tension the properties of the mooring system are presented in table 3 the wave amplitude is 1 2 m and the wave frequencies in the calculation range from 0 3 rad s to 1 7 rad s there are too many cases in the calculation to show all of them the time histories of some cases are shown here in one case the sft is affected by a relatively low frequency wave in the other case the sft is affected by a relatively high frequency wave in the calculation to analyse the influence of viscous damping on the sft motion response the time histories of motion response with and without viscous damping are compared figs 9 11 show the results of the first order and second order motion and the tension of each mooring line when the wave frequency is 0 4 rad s and bwr 1 20 it is observed from the calculation results that there is little difference in the motion response with and without viscous damping the motion response with viscous damping is slightly smaller than without viscous damping the same trend is found in the comparison of the amplitude spectrum as shown in figs 12 and 13 for the low frequency wave the first order and second order wave frequencies are far from the natural frequency of the sft at this time the motion of the sft is only affected by the incident wave and the calculation results considering the influence of viscous damping are smaller than those without considering the influence of viscous damping fig 14 16 show the corresponding results when the wave frequency is 1 2 rad s and bwr 1 50 it is observed from the calculation results that with and without damping the motion response results are quite different both in amplitude and phase the time histories are analysed in detail by fourier transform as shown in figs 17 and 18 when viscous damping is considered the motion of the sft is affected mainly by waves without considering viscous damping the motion is affected by waves and also by the natural frequency of the structure indicating that the existence of viscous damping weakens the resonance phenomenon caused by waves near the natural frequency of the sft structure in summary the viscous damping of the sft has little influence on the motion response far from the natural frequency but has a great influence on the motion response near the natural frequency which greatly weakens the resonance effect at the natural frequency of the structure thus it cannot be ignored in the calculation and the influence on the result is considered in subsequent calculations because the sft consists of inclined and vertical anchor chains the horizontal stiffness of the sft is less than the vertical stiffness thus the horizontal movement of the sft is usually greater than the vertical movement due to the existence of second order mean drift force a small mean offset is observed in the second order displacement response the mean drift value accounts for a relatively small proportion of the horizontal motion amplitude but accounts for a large proportion relative to motion amplitude in the vertical direction first and second order results of the sft under different bwrs and different wave frequencies are presented in figs 19 and 20 the first order result is the vibration amplitude the second order result includes the vibration amplitude and the mean drift value which further reflects the analysis although the bwr has little effect on the motion response of the sft it has a greater influence on the tension of the mooring system as shown in figs 21 and 22 different bwrs suggest different pretensions in the mooring system a larger bwr requires that a larger anchor cable tension to stabilise the sft once the performance of one anchor cable in the mooring system changes it has a great impact on the overall force therefore a smaller bwr for a tension leg type sft is recommended 3 5 2 the effect of mooring stiffness on the motion response in the previous section the influence of bwr on the motion response of sft was studied the effect of mooring stiffness on the motion response under the same conditions is investigated in this section to reduce the motion response the proper stiffness distribution is critical three stiffness distributions are compared case a the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain stiffness1 is greater than that of the vertical anchor chain stiffness2 case b the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain stiffness2 is less than that of the vertical anchor chain stiffness1 case c the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain stiffness 2 is the same as that of the vertical chain as shown in table 4 in the calculation all sft parameters are the same as in the previous example the submerged depth is 30 0 m and the bwr is 1 20 the mooring system properties are different as shown in table 5 figs 23 26 show the first and second order motion response comparisons for the three mooring conditions in surge and heave directions when the incident wave frequency is 0 5 rad s it is observed that when the anchor chain stiffness of the sft increases the overall first and second order displacements of the sft decrease the increase in the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain mainly reduces the surge motion displacement the heave motion displacement also decreases the increase in the stiffness of the vertical anchor chain mainly reduces the heave motion displacement the surge motion displacement also decreases from the data analysis it is observed that the effect of increased stiffness of the inclined anchor chain is better than the effect of increased stiffness of the vertical anchor chain figs 27 and 28 show the first and second order motion response with different mooring systems under different wave frequencies containing surge motion and heave motion the second order motion results fig 28 show that the increase in mooring stiffness has a significant effect on the mean drift value and the trend is the same as the analysis result for the motion amplitude all results indicate that when the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain and the vertical chain of the tension leg type sft are not the same it is recommended that the stiffness of the inclined anchor chain is greater than the stiffness of the vertical chain 4 conclusion to fully consider the wave effects from the free surface on the sft the hobem based on potential flow theory was used to simulate the wave load in the time domain for every time step for the mooring line dynamics an fem based on rod theory was developed motion equations for the hull and dynamic equations for its mooring line system were integrated by imposing appropriate boundary conditions at the connection points in the coupled dynamic analysis the motion equation for the hull and dynamic equations for the mooring lines were solved simultaneously using the newmark β method to obtain the more accurate calculation results decay physical model test was conducted to calculate the viscous damping coefficient of the submerged cylinder which was employed in the numerical simulation the coupled analysis program was applied for the first and second order
