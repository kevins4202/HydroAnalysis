3435,the relation between arsenic groundwater concentrations and hydrogeological processes was investigated in the proximal part of the red river delta vietnam west of the depression cone formed by the exploitation of groundwater in hanoi flow paths in the quaternary aquifers were modeled based on previously interpreted geological structure and hydrogeological data gathered during field work in 2014 2017 sedimentary structures and simulated flow patterns were compared with the spatial distribution of the groundwater arsenic concentration the regression of the sea in the area started 4 ka bp in the holocene the low tectonic subsidence rate of the red river delta led to intensive erosion and replacement of fine grained sediments of the sea level high stand by sandy channel belts resulting in hydraulic connections between the pleistocene and holocene aquifers the pleistocene aquifer is recharged by both regional flow paths and naturally occurring vertical recharge through holocene sand and clay layers young groundwater 40 a in the shallow holocene aquifer generally discharges to surface water bodies the shallow flow system is also seasonally recharged with surface water as indicated by δ18o enrichment of groundwater and oscillating groundwater ages in wells in the vicinity of water channels the deeper flow system discharges into the red river and day river or flows parallel to the rivers toward the sea the overall pattern of arsenic groundwater concentrations decreasing with increasing sediment age is modified by groundwater flow the arsenic contamination of the pleistocene aquifer of the red river delta is not only caused by the intensive groundwater abstraction in hanoi as reported previously but also by the natural flow of high arsenic groundwater from holocene to pleistocene aquifers in areas located outside of the depression cone groundwater with 50 µg l 1 arsenic is found in the pleistocene aquifer close to the recharge zone in the mountains bordering the red river delta and in the holocene and pleistocene aquifers where clay deposits were eroded close to the recent red river channel recharge of older holocene and pleistocene sediments occurs partially by arsenic contaminated groundwater from the youngest holocene aquifers and here arsenic concentrations exceed 50 µg l 1 a high arsenic concentration is also present in the early holocene pleistocene aquifer beneath thick clay layers indicating a limited extent of flushing and the inflow of fresh organic matter keywords groundwater arsenic quaternary aquifers numerical modeling sediment age flushed pore volumes arsenic transport 1 introduction natural contamination of groundwater by arsenic is a widespread problem in se asia van geen et al 2003 winkel et al 2011 kocar et al 2014 stahl et al 2016 gao et al 2020 groundwater arsenic concentrations in the floodplains of se asia are the result of interacting hydrochemical sedimentary and geological processes arsenic is released to groundwater from iron hydroxides reduced by organic matter under anoxic conditions postma et al 2007 kocar et al 2014 postma et al 2016 gao et al 2020 with time the reactivity of the organic matter in an aquifer decreases and the rate of the reduction processes and the resulting groundwater arsenic content decreases lawson et al 2016 postma et al 2016 jakobsen et al 2018 also due to large water volumes recharged through the aquifer leaching sorbed arsenic from the sediment kocar et al 2014 jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 thus groundwater arsenic levels decrease with increasing sediment age postma et al 2012 but levels also depend on the sedimentary structure of the floodplain weinman et al 2008 donselaar et al 2017 a highly heterogeneous distribution of arsenic in holocene aquifers is often interpreted using flow michael and voss 2009 hoque et al 2017 or reactive transport models kocar et al 2014 jakobsen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 however three dimensional 3d models set up at the regional scale do not include detailed information regarding sedimentary structure and sediment age michael and voss 2009 hoque et al 2017 furthermore local more detailed one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d models cannot capture regional flow patterns and the complexity of flow paths in meandering river environments kocar et al 2014 jakobsen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 a regional 3d flow model including detailed information on sediment age and sedimentary structures could shed new light on the relation between sedimentary structure sediment age flow patterns and groundwater arsenic distribution at the regional scale aquifers in older geological formations including pleistocene aquifers usually have low arsenic content van geen et al 2003 hoque et al 2017 this may be due to the decreased reactivity of organic matter with the sediment age postma et al 2012 lawson et al 2016 oxic conditions in the sediments formed during the sea regression in pleistocene van geen et al 2003 van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 and a high number of recharged aquifer volumes jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 the pattern is modified if an additional source of a fresh organic matter exists weinman et al 2008 nath et al 2010 lawson et al 2016 stahl et al 2016 or if high arsenic groundwater recharges pleistocene aquifers due to excessive groundwater abstraction winkel et al 2011 stahl et al 2016 donselaar et al 2017 stopelli et al 2020 excess groundwater abstraction may also result in transport of fresh organic matter into deeper aquifers and subsequent arsenic release harvey et al 2002 lawson et al 2013 or land subsidence leading to clay layers shrinking and releasing arsenic contaminated groundwater from aquitards erban et al 2013 intensive groundwater abstraction below the city of hanoi in the red river delta vietnam led to an intrusion of arsenic enriched groundwater from holocene to pleistocene aquifers winkel et al 2011 van geen et al 2013 and intrusion of river water into holocene aquifers and a subsequent arsenic release stahl et al 2016 stopelli et al 2020 the contamination front in the pleistocene aquifer is retarded by the oxidized pleistocene sand and gravel van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 jakobsen et al 2018 hypothesized based on a 2d reactive transport model for the proximal part of the red river delta outside the influence zone of the hanoi groundwater abstraction that arsenic is transported to the deeper aquifer along natural flow paths this hypothesis is in line with the findings by larsen et al 2008 at the single meander scale but has not been studied at the regional scale clay layers are often reported as an important factor that prevents transport of arsenic from holocene to pleistocene aquifers in the floodplains of se asia due to transport retardation van geen et al 2003 these clay layers act as natural barriers to redirect high arsenic groundwater toward discharge zones instead of to underlying aquifers hoque et al 2017 underlying pleistocene aquifers are recharged by low arsenic groundwater of a regional flow system michael and voss 2009 however arsenic levels in pleistocene aquifers below thick clay layers in the red river delta are high kazmierczak et al 2022 and the related processes have not been previously investigated the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate and understand how the distribution of arsenic in quaternary aquifer systems is related to the joint influence of sedimentary structure and hydrogeological processes and 2 to investigate hydrogeological processes leading to the occurrence of high arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer in the absence of pumping for this purpose a detailed model of the sedimentary architecture of the proximal part of the red river delta kazmierczak et al 2022 was developed into a three dimensional flow model 2 study area 2 1 geology of the red river delta the research was conducted in the upper part of the red river delta vietnam fig 1 a west of the hanoi depression cone fig 2 the formation of the red river delta started at approximately 9 ka before present bp during the post glacial sea level transgression currently the delta covers a surface area of 10 3 103 km2 tanabe et al 2006 the area was tectonically active until 5 5 ma rangin et al 1995 the current tectonic subsidence rate in the red river delta is low with a range of 0 04 0 12 mm a 1 mathers and zalasiewicz 1999 the bedrock consists of limestones sandstones and siltstones displaced by numerous nw se striking faults extending to the gulf of tonkin the bedrock is overlain by a low permeable neogene clay and a sequence of fining upward pleistocene deposits gravel of the lechi and hanoi formations and sand and clay of the vinphuc formation the pleistocene deposits are followed by fine grained deltaic and floodplain deposits haihung formation sediments of the previous geological periods are cut through by fine to coarse grained sand of the thaibinh formation deposited in the river channels with inserts of clay nghi et al 1991 during the early holocene 9 6 ka bp a vertical accretion of the fine grained deposits was the dominant sedimentary process during sea level regression which started at approximately 4 ka bp the vertical accretion was exchanged with alluvial erosion and a lateral accretion of sand in the channel belts funabiki et al 2012 the geological structure of the uppermost part of the red river delta consists of a continuous layer of pleistocene gravel overlain by islands of pleistocene sand and clay the pleistocene deposits were covered by a thick layer of fine grained floodplain and deltaic deposits that were exposed to alluvial erosion at the sw margin of the floodplain and along the recent red river course and replaced by coarse grained channel belt deposits and fine grained floodplain and oxbow lakes deposits figs 3 and 4 kazmierczak et al 2022 four hydrogeological units are distinguished in the red river delta lower and upper pleistocene aquifers and lower and upper holocene aquifers winkel et al 2011 2 2 climate and hydrological conditions precipitation evaporation river discharge and water levels in the western part of the red river delta were monitored at the son tay climate station fig 1b by the vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration vnmha gov vn the climate in northern vietnam is divided into a rainy season from may to october and a dry season from november to april the rainy season accounts for about 70 of the total annual precipitation with a maximum rainfall of often over 300 mm in august the annual rainfall at the son tay station reached 1483 mm in 2014 1381 mm in 2015 and 1759 mm in 2016 rainfall in january and august 2016 was well above the 2007 2016 median fig 5 evaporation measured in 2016 at the son tay station was 683 mm and the mean annual evaporation in the period 2007 2016 was 705 mm the maximum water level of the red river at the son tay station in 2014 2016 was 9 3 m a s l and the minimum water level was 1 8 m a s l fig 6 a in the same period the maximum and minimum discharge of the red river was 7448 m3 s 1 and 557 m3 s 1 respectively vnmha gov vn interactions between the red river and the day river are heavily influenced by drainage systems and a dam the dam in the day river is located downstream from the l3 river station and was in the period 2014 2017 almost permanently closed two drainage systems in the modeled area open if the water level in the red river exceeds 3 0 m in the dry season and 6 0 m in the rainy season vnmha gov vn 3 methods 3 1 hydrological conditions the river stage of the red river day river and a discontinuous larger river channel at the sw boundary of the research area was monitored at five three and two river stations respectively fig 1b the water level of the red river at the meteorological son tay station was measured every six hours and at the qsh1 station that belongs to the water resources monitoring network every six days in the dry season and every three days in the rainy season monthly red river water levels were monitored at three additional sites van phuc rr1 and rr2 from january 2016 to august 2017 fig 1b monthly water levels of the day river were monitored from september 2016 to august 2017 at the two river stations dr1 and l3 upstream of the dam in the day river and one station dr2 downstream of the dam fig 1b 21 km downstream of the research area there is a river station sd1 of the water resources monitoring network where water level is measured every six days in the dry season and every three days in the rainy season the water levels at the two stations d1 and d2 fig 1b at the discontinuous river channel were measured twice once in march and once in august 2017 3 2 well construction and hydrogeological conditions 12 multilevel well pads and two transects white squares and k transect in fig 1b with one pvc well at each sampling depth down to the pleistocene gravel and five single pvc wells l1 l5 with screens at the bottom of the holocene aquifer were installed using water jet drilling the screens were 1 m long had a diameter of 60 mm and were surrounded by a quartz sand pack each well was pumped clean directly after the installation and left to equilibrate for at least three months in the research area there are also 11 wells of the national monitoring network fig 1b hydraulic heads were measured in all monitoring wells either manually or with a solinst water level logger the loggers were synchronized with the national monitoring network and set up to measure the hydraulic head every two hours hydraulic heads in the remaining wells were measured monthly the hydraulic heads were monitored from december 2014 to august 2017 with the largest extent of the monitoring network in 2016 water levels were corrected using the data from two barometric loggers installed at the van phuc and phu kim well pads located next to the red river and close to the sw delta boundary respectively fig 1b hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers was estimated via slug tests performed in wells of the 12 well pads and two transects and five single wells fig 1b results of the slug tests conducted in the h and k transects were presented in larsen et al 2008 slug tests in the remaining wells were performed in 2015 a slug test device was designed by a local manufacturer it consisted of three solid aluminum cylinders each one meter long with a diameter of 48 mm sealed to avoid water intrusion the test was performed by lowering the device below groundwater level rising head test and quickly removing the device from the water column falling head test changes in the water pressure were measured automatically with the solinst water level logger slug test results were interpreted in aquifer test version 3 0 using a hvorslev analytical solution hvorslev 1951 at the well pads and transects a mean hydraulic conductivity of the pleistocene and holocene aquifers was calculated an additional 28 hydraulic conductivities derived from single well pumping tests were extracted from the national monitoring

the red river delta were presented in studies by postma et al 2007 postma et al 2012 postma et al 2016 and sø et al 2018 in this study the total arsenic concentrations from both holocene and pleistocene aquifers were used additional four total arsenic concentrations measured in the tubewells by winkel et al 2011 were added to the analysis winkel et al 2011 report an as measurement

concentrations were calculated for four sedimentary units 1 holocene channel belt deposits with a burial age 1 7 ka 2 holocene channel belt deposits with a burial age 2 9 ka 3 pleistocene aquifer separated from holocene aquifer by a thick 10 m clay layer and 4 pleistocene aquifer in the areas with hydraulic windows the groundwater age was determined using the 3h 3he method water samples for tritium were taken in 1 l pvc bottles and for helium and neon isotopes in 0 5 m long cu tubes sealed at the ends with pinch off clamps the samples were analyzed at the university of bremen sültenfuss et al 2009 the age of the groundwater in the holocene aquifers was presented in sø et al 2018 in this study additional data from the pleistocene aquifers sampled at the cam yen and tan hoi well pads were used sø et al 2018 presented a good agreement between the sum of 3h and 3he in groundwater of the red river delta and the 3h time series in precipitation in hong kong it indicates that there is no major mixing of groundwater with different ages and the uncertainty of the recharge age was estimated to be 2 a sø et al 2018 water for the analysis of stable isotopes δ18o and δd was sampled in 20 ml pvc bottles the isotopes were measured at the national geological survey of denmark and greenland geus using a picarro l 2120i analyzer the dataset was extended with the δ18o and δd concentrations in groundwater from the h transect k transect the red river and precipitation in hanoi presented in larsen et al 2008 3 4 flow model a 3d steady state flow model for the proximal part of the red river floodplain was set up using modflow and the nwt solver harbaugh et al 2000 the model had 38 numerical layers and a discretization of 100 m 100 m in the xy directions fig 7 geology in the model domain was derived from the 3d sedimentary model kazmierczak et al 2022 figs 1b 3 and 4 the geological structure was simplified to seven units comprising 1 pleistocene gravel 2 pleistocene sand 3 pleistocene clay 4 early holocene sand deposited 9 ka bp 5 thick fine grained sediments of middle holocene and early holocene sand 6 and clay 7 fig 8 the top of the model was interpolated to the digital elevation model and bathymetry of the red river measured by acoustic doppler current profiler in seven transects perpendicular to the river shores in march 2000 a non uniform recharge was assigned to the uppermost layer decreasing with an increasing thickness of the uppermost clay layer the recharge area included small water bodies that are abundant in the proximal part of the red river delta the bottom of the model corresponded to the bottom of the pleistocene aquifer and was a no flow boundary the northern model boundary was set as a river boundary condition assigned to the cells of the uppermost layer fig 7 the river conductance was 10 m2 d 1 m 1 and a mean water level in 2016 was assigned to the cells corresponding to the river stations the day river was separated from the red river for most of 2016 and was discontinuous since the dam downstream from the l3 river station was closed thus the day river was represented using a general head boundary condition fig 7 conductance of 100 m2 d 1 and a water stage ranging from 4 to 3 8 m a s l a specified head of 4 5 m a s l was assigned to the eastern model boundary fig 7 the boundary was set at the mean hydraulic head isoline bordering the extent of the hanoi depression cone in 2016 the extent of the hanoi depression cone was delineated using a mean hydraulic head in 2016 in 32 wells with screens in the pleistocene aquifer fig 2 part of the wells were outside of the study area and belonged to the national monitoring network local pumping wells in the study area excluding single household tube wells were inventoried by the national center for water resources planning and investigation hanoi vietnam in total 19 local pumping wells were mapped and based on the data supplied by the owners assigned to the grid with the middle of the screens from 0 6 to 35 5 m a s l and a pumping rate from 1 to 700 m3 d 1 fig 7 a major part of the wells had the screen in the pleistocene aquifer groundwater age was simulated in mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 with a zero order production term of 1 following the approach by engesgaard and molson 1998 the production term was assigned to all active cells and represented the aging of groundwater with one day per day longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to zero and the recharge age was 0 the model was run for 2 ka in order to reach steady state conditions hydrogeological properties hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and porosity of the geological units and the recharge rate were calibrated by trial and error method against the mean hydraulic heads in 2016 in 16 wells and 65 groundwater age measurements of these eight wells were placed where holocene and pleistocene aquifers were connected and eight in areas where pleistocene and holocene aquifers were separated by a thick clay layer out of the latter four wells had a screen in the pleistocene aquifer and four in the holocene aquifer in the first step hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and porosity were adjusted to minimize the root mean squared error rmse and the solution with the lowest rmse was selected for the groundwater age simulation in the second step the porosity was adjusted to obtain the best fit between the measured and simulated groundwater age 4 results 4 1 hydrogeological conditions 4 1 1 surface water water levels in the rivers fluctuated from a minimum in the dry season to a maximum in the rainy season fig 6 the amplitude of fluctuations was 6 m in the red river and 3 m in the day river the response of water levels in the red river to changes in rainfall magnitude is immediate while the highest fluctuations of water stage in the day river were related to discharge directed from the red river to the day river the mean annual river stage of the red river in 2016 was 5 5 m a s l at the upstream son tay river station and 2 4 m a s l at the downstream rr2 river station the mean annual hydraulic gradient between the stations was 0 0001 mean water levels in the day river from september to december 2016 at the dr1 and l3 river stations located upstream from the dam were nearly equal 4 7 m a s l fig 6b this indicates a hydraulic gradient near zero in the day river upstream from the dam the mean water level of 4 7 m a s l was also found at the dr2 river station downstream from the dam the mean annual river stage in 2016 at the sd1 river

the study area to 6 9 m a s l at well qtiv3m1 located se from well l5 hydraulic heads in the holocene aquifer connected to the pleistocene aquifer and influenced by the groundwater abstraction were below 0 m a s l and a minimum mean head in 2016 equaled 0 1 m a s l at well q55m1 located near the red river in the ne corner of the study area fig 6 hydraulic heads in the pleistocene aquifer decreased rapidly towards the east from an isoline of 4 5 m a s l a 2016 mean that enclosed the hanoi depression cone fig 2 mean hydraulic heads in 2016 in the pleistocene aquifer varied from 5 4 m a s l at well q58 at the eastern border of the study area to 6 9 m a s l at well q173 located approximately 20 km nw from well q58 a downward vertical gradient was observed between holocene and pleistocene aquifers both in areas influenced by groundwater pumping and outside of the depression cone fig 7 hydraulic heads similar to river stages fluctuated from a minimum in the dry season to a maximum in the rainy season fig 6 the highest annual groundwater level fluctuations were in the well pads located close to the red river e g 6 5 m at van phuc annual hydraulic head fluctuations

well pads located 2 km from the red river and ranged from 0 7 to 3 9 m with the highest fluctuations 3 2 3 9 m along the day river and its tributaries extreme rainfall events had an influence only on hydraulic heads in the well pads located near the red river or the day river in 2016 2017 the hydraulic heads in the wells located close to the red river and the day river were higher than the river water level for most of the year fig 6 reversals of the hydraulic gradient occurred during the rainy season e g van phuc and h transect well pads located close to the red river and a single well l3 located near the day river fig 6 well q55m1 located near the red river in the ne corner of the study area was influenced by groundwater abstraction and its hydraulic head was below the river stage throughout the entire period the mean hydraulic head gradient at a distance 2 km from the red river and the day river was 0 0002 stable isotope values in groundwater varied from 4 4 to 8 8 for δ18o and from 31 9 to 60 4 for δd fig 9 some of groundwaters in the well pads were enriched in δ18o and δd e g k transect thuong coc and xuan phu in fig 9 stable isotopes ratios in the remaining samples

value of the residual head ranged from 0 04 to 1 1 m the lowest deviations between measured and modeled hydraulic heads were along the red river and the day river fig 4 the simulated groundwater age exceeded the measured age in part of the samples at especially phuong dinh located near the recent day river channel and phu kim at the sw flow model boundary but otherwise with some scatter were comparable to the observations fig 10 4 2 2 flow patterns and velocities the highest hydraulic heads were modeled along the sw model boundary and the lowest along the red river and the day river courses and at the eastern model boundary figs 7 and 8 higher heads were also predicted in the ne area of the model simulated heads ranged from 3 9 to 7 6 m a s l and showed a slight downward gradient the red river and the day river were major discharge paths of groundwater and drained 43 103 m3 d 1 which was 80 of the total recharge 18 of groundwater flowed through the old abandoned channel belts parallel to the recent red river and day river courses and discharged at the eastern model boundary figs 8 11 and 12 the remaining 2 of the recharge was abstracted by the pumping wells groundwater flow was from south to north at the western part of the study area and changed into a more complex flow system in the eastern part where recharged groundwater created a radial diverging flow toward the red river the day river and the eastern model boundary figs 8 11 and 12 groundwater flow was nearly vertical through the uppermost clay layers and shallow holocene aquifer and changed into horizontal flow in the deeper part of the holocene aquifer and in the pleistocene aquifer figs 4 11 and 12 part of the groundwater from the holocene aquifer recharged the pleistocene aquifer either via hydraulic windows or through the clay islands figs 4 8 11 and 12 the travel time to the wells with screens in the holocene aquifer was a few decades while in the pleistocene aquifer simulated travel times reached 100 a figs 11 and 12 the range of simulated flow velocities in holocene and pleistocene aquifers was similar fig 13 flow velocities were highest along rivers and in the pleistocene aquifer figs 11 and 12 the lowest simulated flow velocities in the pleistocene aquifer were below thick clay layers figs 12 and 13 the flow velocities were up to 0 3 m d 1 fig 13 and near 10 3 m d 1 in clays and 10 2 m d 1 in sands 4 3 arsenic distribution the highest groundwater arsenic concentrations in the holocene aquifer were found in the ne part of the study area figs 4 and 11 while in the pleistocene aquifer high groundwater arsenic concentrations were spread throughout a larger area figs 4 and 12 in the holocene aquifer the highest arsenic concentrations are present in the recent red river channel belt with a sediment burial age 1 ka bp and in the older holocene channel belts overlain by younger deposits of the day river figs 4 and 11 median and maximum arsenic concentrations in channel belts with a burial age 1 7 ka were 81 and 488 μg l 1 respectively fig 14 the groundwater arsenic concentrations are lower median concentration of 41 μg l 1 along the sw model boundary where sand was buried at 2 9 ka bp figs 3 4 11 and 14 the lowest groundwater arsenic concentrations are at the western part of the study area in both early and late holocene deposits here pleistocene and mid holocene clay layers were eroded and the flow velocities are high figs 4 11 12 and 13 groundwater arsenic concentrations were also low 10 μg l 1 in the uppermost 1 2 m of holocene aquifer increasing with depth up to 488 μg l 1 light blue deposits 0 5 ka in fig 4 all wells with screens in the pleistocene aquifer in the modeled area had groundwater that exceeded the who guideline for arsenic content in drinking water 10 µg l 1 with minimum arsenic concentration of 27 μg l 1 below the hydraulic windows and 113 μg l 1 below thick clay layers figs 12 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer were found below thick pleistocene and mid holocene clay layers median of 145 μg l 1 and downstream from the recent burial age 1 ka bp channel belt deposits figs 12 and 14 groundwater arsenic concentrations exceeding 10 µg l 1 as were also found downstream from the channel belts buried at 2 9 ka bp and in the areas of the higher flow velocities figs 4 and 12 5 discussion 5 1 hydrogeological conditions 5 1 1 groundwater surface water interactions the rivers in the red river delta are the major groundwater discharge zones figs 8 11 and 12 river water only recharges the aquifers during the rainy season a hydraulic gradient reversal as indicated by measured water levels fig 6 is confirmed by δ18o and δd values in groundwater near the surface water bodies being similar to surface water values larsen et al 2008 showing an enrichment in the heavy isotopes compared to the precipitation curve fig 9 vertical profiles of groundwater age also indicate flow reversals with plumes of younger groundwater in the uppermost part of the profiles sø et al 2018 the study of groundwater surface water interactions would require a transient flow model in order to simulate hydraulic gradient reversals however in this study a steady state flow model describing mean annual conditions was set up the reason being that the focus of this study was on flow velocities water volumes flushed through the aquifers and the main flow paths in holocene and pleistocene aquifers detailed local short term groundwater surface water interactions were beyond the study scope seasonal changes of recharge and river stages only cause fluctuations in local near surface flow paths michael and voss 2009 in the proximal part of the red river delta the seasonal hydraulic head fluctuations decrease from 6 to 1 m with an increasing distance from the red river and the day river flow reversals only occur along the red river while day river is recharged by groundwater most of the year fig 6 in the transient flow model set up for the h transect area by larsen et al 2008 the hydraulic gradient reversals occur within a maximum distance of 1 5 km from the red river furthermore the recharge of an aquifer with river water in the rainy season corresponds to only 5 of the groundwater recharge to the river in the dry season larsen et al 2008 and low hydraulic gradients in the aquifers fig 8 prevent fast inland migration of the river water thus flow patterns are only disturbed near the red river and flow reversals do not have a significant impact on the arsenic mass balance in the studied aquifers larsen et al 2008 arsenic release in the red river delta takes place in the anoxic part of aquifers postma et al 2007 2016 that have thickness on the order of tens of meters therefore immobilisation of arsenic in the uppermost 1 2 m of the aquifer due to oxygen inflow during seasonal water level decrease larsen et al 2008 would also have a minor influence on the observed distribution of arsenic concentrations at the regional scale the limited extent in time and space of flow reversals the small volume of aquifer influenced by arsenic immobilisation due to oxic conditions and the focus on regional flow paths fig 7 all support the choice of a steady state flow model 5 1 2 calibrated parameters the model was calibrated against mean hydraulic heads and river water levels in 2016 when a higher than mean rainfall for the period 2007 2016 took place in january and august fig 5 however the extreme rainfall events did not influence the mean red river stage and groundwater levels fig 6 the red river stage in the rainy season in 2016 was up to 10 m a s l and did not exceed a mean water stage of nearly 12 m a s l in the previous years larsen et al 2008 calibrated hydrogeological properties in the proximal part of the red river delta fig 8 compare well with parameters used in previous modeling studies by larsen et al 2008 and jusseret et al 2009 hydraulic conductivities of holocene sand deposited in channel belts early holocene sand of the delta initiation phase and pleistocene gravel were 50 20 and 75 m d 1 respectively hydraulic conductivities in the model set up for the hanoi area jusseret et al 2009 had the same order of magnitude and equaled 43 m d 1 in holocene channel belt sand and 78 m d 1 in pleistocene gravel mean hydraulic conductivity in holocene sand in the h transect area was 30 m d 1 larsen et al 2008 calibrated hydraulic conductivities also fit into the ranges of measured hydraulic conductivities that were 9 to 93 m d 1 in holocene sand and 105 m d 1 standard deviation of 74 m d 1 in pleistocene gravel calibrated hydraulic conductivities for clay and silt are up to three orders of magnitude higher than in the models set up by jusseret et al 2009 and thu and fredlund 2000 for the hanoi area these models however assumed no recharge via the clay layers the difference in hydraulic conductivities decreases to one order of magnitude for a scenario with aquifer recharge through both sand and clay layers jusseret et al 2009 higher hydraulic conductivities in clay layers in the uppermost part of the red river delta compared to the hanoi area may be a result of erosion processes the uppermost clay layers in the modeled area are weathered and intensively fractured and thus highly permeable larsen et al 2008 jakobsen et al 2018 highly permeable clay windows responsible for rapid recharge of aquifers were also described in the mekong delta cambodia lawson et al 2016 higher permeability of clay in the study area results in low arsenic concentrations in groundwater below the thin uppermost clay layers fig 4 indicating an inflow of oxic groundwater that prevents the reduction of iron hydroxides larsen et al 2008 nearly linearly increasing groundwater age with depth in the holocene aquifer also indicates recharge through overlying clay layers sø et al 2018 flow paths with a significant vertical component in the holocene aquifer were also simulated in the 3d flow model dark blue arrows in fig 11 and in 2d by jakobsen et al 2018 alluvial deposits in the red river delta are well sorted larsen et al 2008 it is visible in the nearly homogeneous vertical profiles of measured hydraulic conductivity and in the gamma log profiles showing a uniform natural gamma radiation kazmierczak et al 2022 thus a low vertical anisotropy was set in the model area with a range from 1 to 3 porosity assigned to the model ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 and is within a range 0 001 to 0 3 used in the flow model for the hanoi area jusseret et al 2009 a mean porosity of holocene sand estimated in the local study at the h transect was 0 39 larsen et al 2008 calibrated recharge rates on the order of 10 4 m d 1 which compares well with the recharge of 3 10 4 m d 1 in the local model for the h transect larsen et al 2008 the developed model represents well the distribution of hydraulic heads and groundwater age in the proximal part of the red river delta and hydraulic properties of the aquifers are within the ranges reported in previous studies larsen et al 2008 jusseret et al 2009 however as a trial and error calibration method was applied it must be noted that the developed model is perhaps one of many plausible solutions but not one that is objectively determined to be the best given the available data 5 2 processes controlling groundwater arsenic distribution 5 2 1 sedimentary structure vs arsenic distribution the arsenic distribution in the holocene aquifer in the red river delta resembles the heterogeneous pattern observed in bangladesh van geen et al 2003 weinman et al 2008 and cambodia kocar et al 2014 arsenic in the aquifers of the red river delta is released from iron oxyhydroxides reduced by organic matter under anoxic conditions postma et al 2007 postma et al 2016 the reactivity of organic matter deposited in the alluvial sediments and therefore the reduction rate of iron hydroxides and mobilization of arsenic decreases with time lawson et al 2016 postma et al 2016 furthermore the arsenic concentration decreases with increasing number of pore volumes flushed through the aquifer postma et al 2012 jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 thus assuming homogeneous hydrogeological conditions the groundwater arsenic content decreases with increasing sediment age postma et al 2012 in the shallow holocene aquifer a clear link exists between sediment age and the groundwater arsenic level although exemptions were also observed figs 4 11 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic levels median of 81 μg l 1 are found in the youngest holocene sediments buried 1 7 ka bp fig 14 these deposits are distributed along recent courses of the red river and the day river light blue and light yellow color in figs 4 and 11a groundwater with lower arsenic levels median of 41 μg l 1 occurs in the sw part of the model area that consists of channel belt deposits with a burial age 2 9 ka bp figs 4 11a and 14 the relation between groundwater arsenic content and sediment age is not present in the deeper and older parts of the holocene aquifer where high arsenic concentrations can be found there are also parts of the pleistocene aquifer which is normally low in arsenic due to a different geological history where high arsenic levels occur cross sections c c and d d in fig 4 figs 12 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer are below clay layers with a thickness 10 m greyed areas in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 high arsenic levels below or adjacent to thick clay layers are common in holocene aquifers weinman et al 2008 nath et al 2010 kocar et al 2014 donselaar et al 2017 clay layers overlying pleistocene aquifers were so far reported as a factor causing retardation or even preventing arsenic transport to the pleistocene aquifers hoque et al 2017 however clay layers in the proximal part of the red river delta lead to increased arsenic contamination of the pleistocene aquifer fig 12 high groundwater arsenic levels in the older holocene river channels and pleistocene deposits figs 13 and 14 are related to a limited extent of aquifer flushing section 5 2 2 jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 and migration of arsenic from shallow to deeper aquifers section 5 2 3 winkel et al 2011 transport of organic matter from e g clay layers or surface water bodies into the deeper aquifers may be an additional factor that increases reduction rates of iron hydroxides and subsequent arsenic release postma et al 2007 weinman et al 2008 kocar et al 2014 lawson et al 2016 stahl et al 2016 5 2 2 number of flushed pore volumes vs arsenic distribution a relation between groundwater arsenic content and the number of recharged aquifer volumes has been documented for the holocene aquifers figs 11 12 and 13 as previously reported by jakobsen et al 2018 and sø et al 2018 a similar effect would be expected for the pleistocene aquifers but due to the more complex history of the pleistocene aquifers they cannot be compared directly with the holocene aquifers the number of recharged pore volumes is an effect of the recharge rate changes in flow patterns with shifting river courses and the sediment burial age jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 the modeled range of pore water velocities is similar in all aquifers of the red river floodplain fig 13 however the time available for the aquifer flushing after the sediment burial varies from 128 11 ka to 0 46 30 ka kazmierczak et al 2022 the lowest groundwater arsenic levels are found in the western part of the study site where clay layers were eroded and replaced with coarse grained channel belt deposits at 2 9 5 9 ka bp figs 4 11 and 12 here the high number of flushed pore water volumes resulting from the increased pore water velocities and the longer time available for aquifer flushing removed arsenic contamination from early holocene aquifers and presumably also the pleistocene aquifer figs 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic levels in the holocene aquifer are in the ne part of the study site comprised of channel belt deposits with a burial age 1 7 ka figs 4 and 12 despite relatively high pore water velocities fig 13 according to the model study by postma et al 2016 the groundwater arsenic level in the proximal part of the red river floodplain reaches a maximum during the first 1200 a thus high arsenic levels in the youngest channel belts are related to high rates of arsenic mobilisation and limited extent of flushing high arsenic concentrations are also found in pleistocene aquifers below thick clay layers greyed areas in fig 12 recharge of the pleistocene aquifer through thick clay layers 10 m in the study area is lower than through the outcrops of the holocene or pleistocene aquifers fig 13 the occurrence of thick clay layers limits recharge of the aquifer and thus pore water velocity and thereby the ability to flush groundwater high in released arsenic figs 12 and 13 high groundwater arsenic levels in pleistocene aquifers may additionally be a result of clay layers acting as a source of organic matter weinman et al 2008 kocar et al 2014 lawson et al 2013 lawson et al 2016 the relation between the extent of flushing and groundwater arsenic levels in holocene aquifers in the proximal part of the red river delta was described by sø et al 2018 sø et al 2018 estimated based on the sediment burial age aquifer depth and the vertical flux rate calculated from 3h 3he profiles that the groundwater arsenic concentration decreases 10 μg l 1 after approximately 200 pore volumes were flushed through the aquifer however extremely high arsenic concentrations were also found in older holocene aquifers with pore water velocities of approximately 0 5 m d 1 fig 13 the 2d conceptual transient reactive transport model for arsenic in the red river aquifers set up by jakobsen et al 2018 showed that high arsenic concentrations in the older aquifers may be related to the downward transport of contamination furthermore high arsenic groundwater accumulates in stagnation zones below the major river channels and the flushing process is delayed until the river channel shifts position and changes the flow pattern jakobsen et al 2018 5 2 3 arsenic distribution modified by flow patterns the red river delta developed under low tectonic subsidence rates mathers and zalasiewicz 1999 that led to erosion of older deposits during sea level regression at 4 ka bp it resulted in connections between the pleistocene and holocene aquifers and transport of high arsenic groundwater from the youngest alluvial channels to older holocene and pleistocene aquifers e g wells phuong dinh p 18 and p 19 in figs 11 12 and 13 this is contrary to the thick deposits in the bengal basin with a high tectonic subsidence rate where holocene and pleistocene aquifers are well separated and hierarchical flow systems are imposed by the many interleaved discontinuous clay layers hoque et al 2017 here the pleistocene aquifers are less contaminated with arsenic unless excess groundwater pumping takes place in the deeper aquifers hoque et al 2017 additionally the high anisotropy in aquifers of the bengal basin imposes a regional flow system in the pleistocene aquifer and prevents seepage of arsenic contaminated groundwater from the youngest holocene deposits michael and voss 2009 at the proximal part of the red river delta despite the complex geological structure the pleistocene aquifer has both regional and local flow systems figs 4 and 8 the flow paths of the latter transports arsenic to the pleistocene aquifer as also suggested by jakobsen et al 2018 all groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer in the study area exceed who guideline of 10 µg l 1 fig 12 it appears contrary to the occurrence of oxic sediments in the pleistocene aquifer and potentially high number of recharged aquifer volumes sø et al 2018 groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene in areas where thick clay layers have been eroded wells outside of the greyed areas in fig 12 are similar to those in holocene aquifers with burial age 2 9 ka figs 13 and 14 it indicates that groundwater from older holocene aquifers with 10 µg l 1 arsenic fig 11 flows vertically down into the pleistocene aquifer which is supported by modeled flow paths to the wells along the sw model boundary screened in the pleistocene aquifer fig 12 the vertical flow is facilitated by low sediment anisotropy within the channel belt deposits transport of the groundwater enriched in arsenic from holocene to pleistocene aquifers in the proximal part of the red river delta was reported at the single meander scale by larsen et al 2008 anomalous arsenic concentrations in deeper groundwater were also found in the bengal basin where hydraulic windows existed hoque et al 2017 increased groundwater arsenic concentrations in pleistocene aquifers are a result of complex flow and transport patterns imposed by heterogeneities in the sedimentary structure of the floodplain and topographical differences also observed in cambodia kocar et al 2014 bangladesh and vietnam jakobsen et al 2018 the capacity of the oxic sandy pleistocene sediments to retard arsenic contamination described for a locality east of hanoi van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 and from bangladesh van geen et al 2003 is apparently much lower in the studied area probably due to the coarse grained nature of the sediment annual hydraulic head fluctuations enable the intrusion of oxygen with recharging groundwater to the uppermost part of holocene aquifer where clay layers are thin larsen et al 2008 infiltrated oxygen oxidizes organic matter and prevents reduction of iron hydroxides and a subsequent arsenic release larsen et al 2008 kocar et al 2014 furthermore it leads to precipitation of secondary iron hydroxides and re adsorption of the released arsenic larsen et al 2008 thus arsenic concentrations in the holocene aquifer near the groundwater table are 10 μg l 1 and are limited to the uppermost 2 m of holocene aquifer fig 4 5 3 implications for drinking water resources elevated arsenic concentrations in pleistocene aquifers of the red river delta were previously reported winkel et al 2011 stahl et al 2016 and interpreted as a result of excessive groundwater abstraction however our study site is located outside of the hanoi depression cone fig 2 the local wells in the area only abstract 2 of the total aquifer recharge and hydraulic heads are not lower in the vicinity of the local abstraction wells compared to the surrounding areas see phuong thuong and tam thuan well pads in fig 7 furthermore hydraulic head measurements in the vertical profiles and model results both indicated a small downward hydraulic gradient between the holocene and pleistocene aquifer fig 7 under these conditions in a highly conductive pleistocene aquifer with regional flow paths low groundwater arsenic concentrations are expected especially beneath the thick clay layers michael and voss 2009 hoque et al 2017 however high arsenic levels in the pleistocene aquifer of our study site are found in both areas with and without local abstraction wells figs 4 and 12 elevated arsenic levels in the pleistocene aquifer of the uppermost part of the red river delta are therefore not an outcome of excess groundwater abstraction as reported in the hanoi area winkel et al 2011 instead they are a result of hydrogeological processes such as a limited extent of flushing and transport of contamination from shallow to deeper aquifers section 5 2 remediation of drinking water resources to limit arsenic contents in the proximal part of the red river delta is therefore not possible e g by change of pumping rates due to the natural origin of the contamination however additional deterioration of groundwater quality in the aquifers outside of the expanding hanoi depression cone fig 7 bui et al 2012 can be prevented by sustainable water resources management 6 conclusions groundwater enriched in arsenic was found in pleistocene aquifers of the red river delta outside of the hanoi depression cone high groundwater arsenic levels in pleistocene aquifers of the red river delta may be the result of a limited extent of flushing and inflow of arsenic contaminated groundwater from holocene aquifers along natural flow paths and not only as previously described inflow induced by excess groundwater abstraction due to the low tectonic subsidence rate in the red river delta clay layers separating aquifers have been extensively removed by erosion as a result arsenic enriched groundwater from holocene aquifers is transported naturally through hydrogeological windows into the pleistocene aquifers which are often by default considered as a source of low arsenic water in addition thick clay layers if permeable may provide organic matter to underlying aquifers this may induce iron hydroxides reduction and arsenic release not only in younger holocene aquifers but also in pleistocene aquifers resulting in high groundwater arsenic levels credit authorship contribution statement jolanta kazmierczak

3435,the relation between arsenic groundwater concentrations and hydrogeological processes was investigated in the proximal part of the red river delta vietnam west of the depression cone formed by the exploitation of groundwater in hanoi flow paths in the quaternary aquifers were modeled based on previously interpreted geological structure and hydrogeological data gathered during field work in 2014 2017 sedimentary structures and simulated flow patterns were compared with the spatial distribution of the groundwater arsenic concentration the regression of the sea in the area started 4 ka bp in the holocene the low tectonic subsidence rate of the red river delta led to intensive erosion and replacement of fine grained sediments of the sea level high stand by sandy channel belts resulting in hydraulic connections between the pleistocene and holocene aquifers the pleistocene aquifer is recharged by both regional flow paths and naturally occurring vertical recharge through holocene sand and clay layers young groundwater 40 a in the shallow holocene aquifer generally discharges to surface water bodies the shallow flow system is also seasonally recharged with surface water as indicated by δ18o enrichment of groundwater and oscillating groundwater ages in wells in the vicinity of water channels the deeper flow system discharges into the red river and day river or flows parallel to the rivers toward the sea the overall pattern of arsenic groundwater concentrations decreasing with increasing sediment age is modified by groundwater flow the arsenic contamination of the pleistocene aquifer of the red river delta is not only caused by the intensive groundwater abstraction in hanoi as reported previously but also by the natural flow of high arsenic groundwater from holocene to pleistocene aquifers in areas located outside of the depression cone groundwater with 50 µg l 1 arsenic is found in the pleistocene aquifer close to the recharge zone in the mountains bordering the red river delta and in the holocene and pleistocene aquifers where clay deposits were eroded close to the recent red river channel recharge of older holocene and pleistocene sediments occurs partially by arsenic contaminated groundwater from the youngest holocene aquifers and here arsenic concentrations exceed 50 µg l 1 a high arsenic concentration is also present in the early holocene pleistocene aquifer beneath thick clay layers indicating a limited extent of flushing and the inflow of fresh organic matter keywords groundwater arsenic quaternary aquifers numerical modeling sediment age flushed pore volumes arsenic transport 1 introduction natural contamination of groundwater by arsenic is a widespread problem in se asia van geen et al 2003 winkel et al 2011 kocar et al 2014 stahl et al 2016 gao et al 2020 groundwater arsenic concentrations in the floodplains of se asia are the result of interacting hydrochemical sedimentary and geological processes arsenic is released to groundwater from iron hydroxides reduced by organic matter under anoxic conditions postma et al 2007 kocar et al 2014 postma et al 2016 gao et al 2020 with time the reactivity of the organic matter in an aquifer decreases and the rate of the reduction processes and the resulting groundwater arsenic content decreases lawson et al 2016 postma et al 2016 jakobsen et al 2018 also due to large water volumes recharged through the aquifer leaching sorbed arsenic from the sediment kocar et al 2014 jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 thus groundwater arsenic levels decrease with increasing sediment age postma et al 2012 but levels also depend on the sedimentary structure of the floodplain weinman et al 2008 donselaar et al 2017 a highly heterogeneous distribution of arsenic in holocene aquifers is often interpreted using flow michael and voss 2009 hoque et al 2017 or reactive transport models kocar et al 2014 jakobsen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 however three dimensional 3d models set up at the regional scale do not include detailed information regarding sedimentary structure and sediment age michael and voss 2009 hoque et al 2017 furthermore local more detailed one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d models cannot capture regional flow patterns and the complexity of flow paths in meandering river environments kocar et al 2014 jakobsen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 a regional 3d flow model including detailed information on sediment age and sedimentary structures could shed new light on the relation between sedimentary structure sediment age flow patterns and groundwater arsenic distribution at the regional scale aquifers in older geological formations including pleistocene aquifers usually have low arsenic content van geen et al 2003 hoque et al 2017 this may be due to the decreased reactivity of organic matter with the sediment age postma et al 2012 lawson et al 2016 oxic conditions in the sediments formed during the sea regression in pleistocene van geen et al 2003 van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 and a high number of recharged aquifer volumes jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 the pattern is modified if an additional source of a fresh organic matter exists weinman et al 2008 nath et al 2010 lawson et al 2016 stahl et al 2016 or if high arsenic groundwater recharges pleistocene aquifers due to excessive groundwater abstraction winkel et al 2011 stahl et al 2016 donselaar et al 2017 stopelli et al 2020 excess groundwater abstraction may also result in transport of fresh organic matter into deeper aquifers and subsequent arsenic release harvey et al 2002 lawson et al 2013 or land subsidence leading to clay layers shrinking and releasing arsenic contaminated groundwater from aquitards erban et al 2013 intensive groundwater abstraction below the city of hanoi in the red river delta vietnam led to an intrusion of arsenic enriched groundwater from holocene to pleistocene aquifers winkel et al 2011 van geen et al 2013 and intrusion of river water into holocene aquifers and a subsequent arsenic release stahl et al 2016 stopelli et al 2020 the contamination front in the pleistocene aquifer is retarded by the oxidized pleistocene sand and gravel van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 jakobsen et al 2018 hypothesized based on a 2d reactive transport model for the proximal part of the red river delta outside the influence zone of the hanoi groundwater abstraction that arsenic is transported to the deeper aquifer along natural flow paths this hypothesis is in line with the findings by larsen et al 2008 at the single meander scale but has not been studied at the regional scale clay layers are often reported as an important factor that prevents transport of arsenic from holocene to pleistocene aquifers in the floodplains of se asia due to transport retardation van geen et al 2003 these clay layers act as natural barriers to redirect high arsenic groundwater toward discharge zones instead of to underlying aquifers hoque et al 2017 underlying pleistocene aquifers are recharged by low arsenic groundwater of a regional flow system michael and voss 2009 however arsenic levels in pleistocene aquifers below thick clay layers in the red river delta are high kazmierczak et al 2022 and the related processes have not been previously investigated the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate and understand how the distribution of arsenic in quaternary aquifer systems is related to the joint influence of sedimentary structure and hydrogeological processes and 2 to investigate hydrogeological processes leading to the occurrence of high arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer in the absence of pumping for this purpose a detailed model of the sedimentary architecture of the proximal part of the red river delta kazmierczak et al 2022 was developed into a three dimensional flow model 2 study area 2 1 geology of the red river delta the research was conducted in the upper part of the red river delta vietnam fig 1 a west of the hanoi depression cone fig 2 the formation of the red river delta started at approximately 9 ka before present bp during the post glacial sea level transgression currently the delta covers a surface area of 10 3 103 km2 tanabe et al 2006 the area was tectonically active until 5 5 ma rangin et al 1995 the current tectonic subsidence rate in the red river delta is low with a range of 0 04 0 12 mm a 1 mathers and zalasiewicz 1999 the bedrock consists of limestones sandstones and siltstones displaced by numerous nw se striking faults extending to the gulf of tonkin the bedrock is overlain by a low permeable neogene clay and a sequence of fining upward pleistocene deposits gravel of the lechi and hanoi formations and sand and clay of the vinphuc formation the pleistocene deposits are followed by fine grained deltaic and floodplain deposits haihung formation sediments of the previous geological periods are cut through by fine to coarse grained sand of the thaibinh formation deposited in the river channels with inserts of clay nghi et al 1991 during the early holocene 9 6 ka bp a vertical accretion of the fine grained deposits was the dominant sedimentary process during sea level regression which started at approximately 4 ka bp the vertical accretion was exchanged with alluvial erosion and a lateral accretion of sand in the channel belts funabiki et al 2012 the geological structure of the uppermost part of the red river delta consists of a continuous layer of pleistocene gravel overlain by islands of pleistocene sand and clay the pleistocene deposits were covered by a thick layer of fine grained floodplain and deltaic deposits that were exposed to alluvial erosion at the sw margin of the floodplain and along the recent red river course and replaced by coarse grained channel belt deposits and fine grained floodplain and oxbow lakes deposits figs 3 and 4 kazmierczak et al 2022 four hydrogeological units are distinguished in the red river delta lower and upper pleistocene aquifers and lower and upper holocene aquifers winkel et al 2011 2 2 climate and hydrological conditions precipitation evaporation river discharge and water levels in the western part of the red river delta were monitored at the son tay climate station fig 1b by the vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration vnmha gov vn the climate in northern vietnam is divided into a rainy season from may to october and a dry season from november to april the rainy season accounts for about 70 of the total annual precipitation with a maximum rainfall of often over 300 mm in august the annual rainfall at the son tay station reached 1483 mm in 2014 1381 mm in 2015 and 1759 mm in 2016 rainfall in january and august 2016 was well above the 2007 2016 median fig 5 evaporation measured in 2016 at the son tay station was 683 mm and the mean annual evaporation in the period 2007 2016 was 705 mm the maximum water level of the red river at the son tay station in 2014 2016 was 9 3 m a s l and the minimum water level was 1 8 m a s l fig 6 a in the same period the maximum and minimum discharge of the red river was 7448 m3 s 1 and 557 m3 s 1 respectively vnmha gov vn interactions between the red river and the day river are heavily influenced by drainage systems and a dam the dam in the day river is located downstream from the l3 river station and was in the period 2014 2017 almost permanently closed two drainage systems in the modeled area open if the water level in the red river exceeds 3 0 m in the dry season and 6 0 m in the rainy season vnmha gov vn 3 methods 3 1 hydrological conditions the river stage of the red river day river and a discontinuous larger river channel at the sw boundary of the research area was monitored at five three and two river stations respectively fig 1b the water level of the red river at the meteorological son tay station was measured every six hours and at the qsh1 station that belongs to the water resources monitoring network every six days in the dry season and every three days in the rainy season monthly red river water levels were monitored at three additional sites van phuc rr1 and rr2 from january 2016 to august 2017 fig 1b monthly water levels of the day river were monitored from september 2016 to august 2017 at the two river stations dr1 and l3 upstream of the dam in the day river and one station dr2 downstream of the dam fig 1b 21 km downstream of the research area there is a river station sd1 of the water resources monitoring network where water level is measured every six days in the dry season and every three days in the rainy season the water levels at the two stations d1 and d2 fig 1b at the discontinuous river channel were measured twice once in march and once in august 2017 3 2 well construction and hydrogeological conditions 12 multilevel well pads and two transects white squares and k transect in fig 1b with one pvc well at each sampling depth down to the pleistocene gravel and five single pvc wells l1 l5 with screens at the bottom of the holocene aquifer were installed using water jet drilling the screens were 1 m long had a diameter of 60 mm and were surrounded by a quartz sand pack each well was pumped clean directly after the installation and left to equilibrate for at least three months in the research area there are also 11 wells of the national monitoring network fig 1b hydraulic heads were measured in all monitoring wells either manually or with a solinst water level logger the loggers were synchronized with the national monitoring network and set up to measure the hydraulic head every two hours hydraulic heads in the remaining wells were measured monthly the hydraulic heads were monitored from december 2014 to august 2017 with the largest extent of the monitoring network in 2016 water levels were corrected using the data from two barometric loggers installed at the van phuc and phu kim well pads located next to the red river and close to the sw delta boundary respectively fig 1b hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers was estimated via slug tests performed in wells of the 12 well pads and two transects and five single wells fig 1b results of the slug tests conducted in the h and k transects were presented in larsen et al 2008 slug tests in the remaining wells were performed in 2015 a slug test device was designed by a local manufacturer it consisted of three solid aluminum cylinders each one meter long with a diameter of 48 mm sealed to avoid water intrusion the test was performed by lowering the device below groundwater level rising head test and quickly removing the device from the water column falling head test changes in the water pressure were measured automatically with the solinst water level logger slug test results were interpreted in aquifer test version 3 0 using a hvorslev analytical solution hvorslev 1951 at the well pads and transects a mean hydraulic conductivity of the pleistocene and holocene aquifers was calculated an additional 28 hydraulic conductivities derived from single well pumping tests were extracted from the national monitoring

separated from holocene aquifer by a thick 10 m clay layer and 4 pleistocene aquifer in the areas with hydraulic windows the groundwater age was determined using the 3h 3he method water samples for tritium were taken in 1 l pvc bottles and for helium and neon isotopes in 0 5 m long cu tubes sealed at the ends with pinch off clamps the samples were analyzed at the university of bremen sültenfuss

were used sø et al 2018 presented a good agreement between the sum of 3h and 3he in groundwater of the red river delta and the 3h time series in precipitation in hong kong it indicates that there is no major mixing of groundwater with different ages and the uncertainty of the recharge age was estimated to be 2 a sø et al 2018 water for the analysis of stable isotopes δ18o and δd was sampled in 20

in groundwater from the h transect k transect the red river and precipitation in hanoi presented in larsen et al 2008 3 4 flow model a 3d steady state flow model for the proximal part of the red river floodplain was set up using modflow and the nwt solver harbaugh et al 2000 the model had 38 numerical layers and a discretization of 100 m 100 m in the xy directions fig 7 geology in the model domain was derived from the 3d sedimentary model kazmierczak et al 2022 figs 1b 3 and 4 the geological structure was simplified to seven units comprising 1 pleistocene gravel 2 pleistocene sand 3 pleistocene clay 4 early holocene sand deposited 9 ka bp 5 thick fine grained sediments of middle holocene and early holocene sand 6 and clay 7 fig 8 the top of the model was interpolated to the digital elevation model and bathymetry of the red river measured by acoustic doppler current profiler in seven transects perpendicular to the river shores in march 2000 a non uniform recharge was assigned to the uppermost layer decreasing with an increasing thickness of the uppermost clay layer the recharge area included small water bodies that are abundant in the proximal part of the red river delta the bottom of the model corresponded to the bottom of the pleistocene aquifer and was a no flow boundary the northern model boundary was set as a river boundary condition assigned to the cells of the uppermost layer fig 7 the river conductance was 10 m2 d 1 m 1 and a mean water level in 2016 was assigned to the cells corresponding to the river stations the day river was separated from the red river for most of 2016 and was discontinuous since the dam downstream from the l3 river station was closed thus the day river was represented using a general head boundary condition fig 7 conductance of 100 m2 d 1 and a water stage ranging from 4 to 3 8 m a s l a specified head of 4 5 m a s l was assigned to the eastern model boundary fig 7 the boundary was set at the mean hydraulic head isoline bordering the extent of the hanoi depression cone in 2016 the extent of the hanoi depression cone was delineated using a mean hydraulic head in 2016 in 32 wells with screens in the pleistocene aquifer fig 2 part of the wells were outside of the study area and belonged to the national monitoring network local pumping wells in the study area excluding single household tube wells were inventoried by the national center for water resources planning and investigation hanoi vietnam in total 19 local pumping wells were mapped and based on the data supplied by the owners assigned to the grid with the middle of the screens from 0 6 to 35 5 m a s l and a pumping rate from 1 to 700 m3 d 1 fig 7 a major part of the wells had the screen in the pleistocene aquifer groundwater age was simulated in mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 with a zero order production term of 1 following the approach by engesgaard and molson 1998 the production term was assigned to all active cells and represented the aging of groundwater with one day per day longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to zero and the recharge age was 0 the model was run for 2 ka in order to reach steady state conditions hydrogeological properties hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and porosity of the geological units and the recharge rate were calibrated by trial and error method against the mean hydraulic heads in 2016 in 16 wells and 65 groundwater age measurements of these eight wells were placed where holocene and pleistocene aquifers were connected and eight in areas where pleistocene and holocene aquifers were separated by a thick clay layer out of the latter four wells had a screen in the pleistocene aquifer and four in the holocene aquifer in the first step hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and porosity were adjusted to minimize the root mean squared error rmse and the solution with the lowest rmse was selected for the groundwater age simulation in the second step the porosity was adjusted to obtain the best fit between the measured and simulated groundwater age 4 results 4 1 hydrogeological conditions 4 1 1 surface water water levels in the rivers fluctuated from a minimum in the dry season to a maximum in the rainy season fig 6 the amplitude of fluctuations was 6 m in the red river and 3 m in the day river the response of water levels in the red river to changes in rainfall magnitude is immediate while the highest fluctuations of water stage in the day river were related to discharge directed from the red river to the day river the mean annual river stage of the red river in 2016 was 5 5 m a s l at the upstream son tay river station and 2 4 m a s l at the downstream rr2 river station the mean annual hydraulic gradient between the stations was 0 0001 mean water levels in the day river from september to december 2016 at the dr1 and l3 river stations located upstream from the dam were nearly equal 4 7 m a s l fig 6b this indicates a hydraulic gradient near zero in the day river upstream from the dam the mean water level of 4 7 m a s l was also found at the dr2 river station downstream from the dam the mean annual river stage in 2016 at the sd1 river station located approximately 20 km downstream from the dr2 river station was 2 2 m a s l the mean annual hydraulic gradient in the day river downstream from the dam was 5 10 5 the water level at stations d1 and d2 at the sw discontinuous river channel fig 1b was above the groundwater level in the nearest wells during both dry and rainy season the stable isotope composition of the red river water during 2008 ranged from 10 4 to 0 03 for δ18o and from 68 0 to 0 3 for δd fig 9 larsen et al 2008 4 1 2 groundwater the pleistocene and holocene aquifers of the study area were mostly hydraulically connected and only locally separated by pleistocene and early to mid holocene clay layers figs 3 and 4 the clay layers were more abundant in the se part of the study area fig 4 the hydraulic heads in the holocene aquifer decreased towards the red river and the day river and were highest in the ne part of the research area where a thick clay layer occurred and at the sw delta boundary fig 7 during 2016 the mean hydraulic heads in the holocene aquifer not affected by the hanoi groundwater abstraction varied from 2 6 m a s l at well l5 near the red river in the ne part of the study area to 6 9 m a s l at well qtiv3m1 located se from well l5 hydraulic heads in the holocene aquifer connected to the pleistocene aquifer and influenced by the groundwater abstraction were below 0 m a s l and a minimum mean head in 2016 equaled 0 1 m a s l at well q55m1 located near the red river in the ne corner of the study area fig 6 hydraulic heads in the pleistocene aquifer decreased rapidly towards the east from an isoline of 4 5 m a s l a 2016 mean that enclosed the hanoi depression cone fig 2 mean hydraulic heads in 2016 in the pleistocene aquifer varied from 5 4 m a s l at well q58 at the eastern border of the study area to 6 9 m a s l at well q173 located approximately 20 km nw from well q58 a downward vertical gradient was observed between holocene and pleistocene aquifers both in areas influenced by groundwater pumping and outside of the depression cone fig 7 hydraulic heads similar to river stages fluctuated from a minimum in the dry season to a maximum in the rainy season fig 6 the highest annual groundwater level fluctuations were in the well pads located close to the red river e g 6 5 m at van phuc annual hydraulic head fluctuations decreased with increasing distance from the red river e g from 6 5 m at van phuc to 3 m at the h transect well pads for location see fig 1b the lowest annual groundwater level fluctuations were in the well pads located 2 km from the red river and ranged from 0 7 to 3 9 m with the highest fluctuations 3 2 3 9 m along the day river and its tributaries extreme rainfall events had an influence only on hydraulic heads in the well pads located near the red river or the day river in 2016 2017 the hydraulic heads in the wells located close to the red river and the day river were higher than the river water level for most of the year fig 6 reversals of the hydraulic gradient occurred during the rainy season e g van phuc and h transect well pads located close to the red river and a single well l3 located near the day river fig 6 well q55m1 located near the red river in the ne corner of the study area was influenced by groundwater abstraction and its hydraulic head was below the river stage throughout the entire period the mean hydraulic head gradient at a distance 2 km from the red river and the day river was 0 0002 stable isotope values in groundwater varied from 4 4 to 8 8 for δ18o and from 31 9 to 60 4 for δd fig 9 some of groundwaters in the well pads were enriched in δ18o and δd e g k transect thuong coc and xuan phu in fig 9 stable isotopes ratios in the remaining samples were close to the precipitation in hanoi larsen et al 2008 groundwater with the lowest content of δ18o and δd was found in van phuc and h transect in the northern part of the study area cam yen located on a the pleistocene terrace along the sw model boundary and at phuong town with wells screened in the early holocene deposits covered by a thick clay layer fig 9 the measured groundwater age in general increased linearly with depth sø et al 2018 and ranged from 0 1 a in the holocene aquifer at phuong dinh located approximately 1 km from the day river and se boundary of the flow model to 79 4 a in the pleistocene aquifer at van coc located in the northern part of the study area approximately 1 km from the red river fig 10 in some of the vertical profiles near surface water bodies the groundwater age oscillated in the shallow part of the aquifer sø et al 2018 4 1 3 aquifer properties hydraulic conductivity in the aquifers measured in this study section 3 3 and by larsen et al 2008 and derived from the national monitoring database varied from 1 to 240 m d 1 and was highest in the pleistocene aquifer consisting of gravel and coarse sand the mean hydraulic conductivity equaled 36 m d 1 in holocene sand 12 m d 1 in pleistocene sand and 105 m d 1 in pleistocene gravel the standard deviation in hydraulic conductivity was 26 12 and 74 m d 1 in holocene sand pleistocene sand and pleistocene gravel respectively the holocene sand deposited in channel belts had a rather homogenous hydraulic conductivity at each well pad transect and varied by an order of magnitude the mean hydraulic conductivity of the holocene aquifer at well pad transects varied from 9 m d 1 at phu kim to 93 m d 1 at phuc hoa both located in sw old river channel fig 1b 4 2 flow model 4 2 1 model calibration the calibrated hydraulic conductivity varied from 0 1 m d 1 in pleistocene clay to 75 m d 1 in pleistocene gravel fig 8 the calibrated vertical anisotropy was 0 5 to 1 in clay layers and 2 to 3 in pleistocene and holocene sand and gravel fig 8 calibrated effective porosity ranged from 0 2 in clay layers to 0 3 in sand and gravel the assigned recharge ranged from 2 5 10 4 to 5 5 10 4 m d 1 decreasing with an increasing thickness of the top clay layer and was lowest in some of the areas along the se flow model boundary rmse for hydraulic heads of the final model was 0 7 m the absolute value of the residual head ranged from 0 04 to 1 1 m the lowest deviations between measured and modeled hydraulic heads were along the red river and the day river fig 4 the simulated groundwater age exceeded the measured age in part of the samples at especially phuong dinh located near the recent day river channel and phu kim at the sw flow model boundary but otherwise with some scatter were comparable to the observations fig 10 4 2 2 flow patterns and velocities the highest hydraulic heads were modeled along the sw model boundary and the lowest along the red river and the day river courses and at the eastern model boundary figs 7 and 8 higher heads were also predicted in the ne area of the model simulated heads ranged from 3 9 to 7 6 m a s l and showed a slight downward gradient the red river and the day river were major discharge paths of groundwater and drained 43 103 m3 d 1 which was 80 of the total recharge 18 of groundwater flowed through the old abandoned channel belts parallel to the recent red river and day river courses and discharged at the eastern model boundary figs 8 11 and 12 the remaining 2 of the recharge was abstracted by the pumping wells groundwater flow was from south to north at the western part of the study area and changed into a more complex flow system in the eastern part where recharged groundwater created a radial diverging flow toward the red river the day river and the eastern model boundary figs 8 11 and 12 groundwater flow was nearly vertical through the uppermost clay layers and shallow holocene aquifer and changed into horizontal flow in the deeper part of the holocene aquifer and in the pleistocene aquifer figs 4 11 and 12 part of the groundwater from the holocene aquifer recharged the pleistocene aquifer either via hydraulic windows or through the clay islands figs 4 8 11 and 12 the travel time to the wells with screens in the holocene aquifer was a few decades while in the pleistocene aquifer simulated travel times reached 100 a figs 11 and 12 the range of simulated flow velocities in holocene and pleistocene aquifers was similar fig 13 flow velocities were highest along rivers and in the pleistocene aquifer figs 11 and 12 the lowest simulated flow velocities in the pleistocene aquifer were below thick clay layers figs 12 and 13 the flow velocities were up to 0 3 m d 1 fig 13 and near 10 3 m d 1 in clays and 10 2 m d 1 in sands 4 3 arsenic distribution the highest groundwater arsenic concentrations in the holocene aquifer were found in the ne part of the study area figs 4 and 11 while in the pleistocene aquifer high groundwater arsenic concentrations were spread throughout a larger area figs 4 and 12 in the holocene aquifer the highest arsenic concentrations are present in the recent red river channel belt with a sediment burial age 1 ka bp and in the older holocene channel belts overlain by younger deposits of the day river figs 4 and 11 median and maximum arsenic concentrations in channel belts with a burial age 1 7 ka were 81 and 488 μg l 1 respectively fig 14 the groundwater arsenic concentrations are lower median concentration of 41 μg l 1 along the sw model boundary where sand was buried at 2 9 ka bp figs 3 4 11 and 14 the lowest groundwater arsenic concentrations are at the western part of the study area in both early and late holocene deposits here pleistocene and mid holocene clay layers were eroded and the flow velocities are high figs 4 11 12 and 13 groundwater arsenic concentrations were also low 10 μg l 1 in the uppermost 1 2 m of holocene aquifer increasing with depth up to 488 μg l 1 light blue deposits 0 5 ka in fig 4 all wells with screens in the pleistocene aquifer in the modeled area had groundwater that exceeded the who guideline for arsenic content in drinking water 10 µg l 1 with minimum arsenic concentration of 27 μg l 1 below the hydraulic windows and 113 μg l 1 below thick clay layers figs 12 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer were found below thick pleistocene and mid holocene clay layers median of 145 μg l 1 and downstream from the recent burial age 1 ka bp channel belt deposits figs 12 and 14 groundwater arsenic concentrations exceeding 10 µg l 1 as were also found downstream from the channel belts buried at 2 9 ka bp and in the areas of the higher flow velocities figs 4 and 12 5 discussion 5 1 hydrogeological conditions 5 1 1 groundwater surface water interactions the rivers in the red river delta are the major groundwater discharge zones figs 8 11 and 12 river water only recharges the aquifers during the rainy season a hydraulic gradient reversal as indicated by measured water levels fig 6 is confirmed by δ18o and δd values in groundwater near the surface water bodies being similar to surface water values larsen et al 2008 showing an enrichment in the heavy isotopes compared to the precipitation curve fig 9 vertical profiles of groundwater age also indicate flow reversals with plumes of younger groundwater in the uppermost part of the profiles sø et al 2018 the study of groundwater surface water interactions would require a transient flow model in order to simulate hydraulic gradient reversals however in this study a steady state flow model describing mean annual conditions was set up the reason being that the focus of this study was on flow velocities water volumes flushed through the aquifers and the main flow paths in holocene and pleistocene aquifers detailed local short term groundwater surface water interactions were beyond the study scope seasonal changes of recharge and river stages only cause fluctuations in local near surface flow paths michael and voss 2009 in the proximal part of the red river delta the seasonal hydraulic head fluctuations decrease from 6 to 1 m with an increasing distance from the red river and the day river flow reversals only occur along the red river while day river is recharged by groundwater most of the year fig 6 in the transient flow model set up for the h transect area by larsen et al 2008 the hydraulic gradient reversals occur within a maximum distance of 1 5 km from the red river furthermore the recharge of an aquifer with river water in the rainy season corresponds to only 5 of the groundwater recharge to the river in the dry season larsen et al 2008 and low hydraulic gradients in the aquifers fig 8 prevent fast inland migration of the river water thus flow patterns are only disturbed near the red river and flow reversals do not have a significant impact on the arsenic mass balance in the studied aquifers larsen et al 2008 arsenic release in the red river delta takes place in the anoxic part of aquifers postma et al 2007 2016 that have thickness on the order of tens of meters therefore immobilisation of arsenic in the uppermost 1 2 m of the aquifer due to oxygen inflow during seasonal water level decrease larsen et al 2008 would also have a minor influence on the observed distribution of arsenic concentrations at the regional scale the limited extent in time and space of flow reversals the small volume of aquifer influenced by arsenic immobilisation due to oxic conditions and the focus on regional flow paths fig 7 all support the choice of a steady state flow model 5 1 2 calibrated parameters the model was calibrated against mean hydraulic heads and river water levels in 2016 when a higher than mean rainfall for the period 2007 2016 took place in january and august fig 5 however the extreme rainfall events did not influence the mean red river stage and groundwater levels fig 6 the red river stage in the rainy season in 2016 was up to 10 m a s l and did not exceed a mean water stage of nearly 12 m a s l in the previous years larsen et al 2008 calibrated hydrogeological properties in the proximal part of the red river delta fig 8 compare well with parameters used in previous modeling studies by larsen et al 2008 and jusseret et al 2009 hydraulic conductivities of holocene sand deposited in channel belts early holocene sand of the delta initiation phase and pleistocene gravel were 50 20 and 75 m d 1 respectively hydraulic conductivities in the model set up for the hanoi area jusseret et al 2009 had the same order of magnitude and equaled 43 m d 1 in holocene channel belt sand and 78 m d 1 in pleistocene gravel mean hydraulic conductivity in holocene sand in the h transect area was 30 m d 1 larsen et al 2008 calibrated hydraulic conductivities also fit into the ranges of measured hydraulic conductivities that were 9 to 93 m d 1 in holocene sand and 105 m d 1 standard deviation of 74 m d 1 in pleistocene gravel calibrated hydraulic conductivities for clay and silt are up to three orders of magnitude higher than in the models set up by jusseret et al 2009 and thu and fredlund 2000 for the hanoi area these models however assumed no recharge via the clay layers the difference in hydraulic conductivities decreases to one order of magnitude for a scenario with aquifer recharge through both sand and clay layers jusseret et al 2009 higher hydraulic conductivities in clay layers in the uppermost part of the red river delta compared to the hanoi area may be a result of erosion processes the uppermost clay layers in the modeled area are weathered and intensively fractured and thus highly permeable larsen et al 2008 jakobsen et al 2018 highly permeable clay windows responsible for rapid recharge of aquifers were also described in the mekong delta cambodia lawson et al 2016 higher permeability of clay in the study area results in low arsenic concentrations in groundwater below the thin uppermost clay layers fig 4 indicating an inflow of oxic groundwater that prevents the reduction of iron hydroxides larsen et al 2008 nearly linearly increasing groundwater age with depth in the holocene aquifer also indicates recharge through overlying clay layers sø et al 2018 flow paths with a significant vertical component in the holocene aquifer were also simulated in the 3d flow model dark blue arrows in fig 11 and in 2d by jakobsen et al 2018 alluvial deposits in the red river delta are well sorted larsen et al 2008 it is visible in the nearly homogeneous vertical profiles of measured hydraulic conductivity and in the gamma log profiles showing a uniform natural gamma radiation kazmierczak et al 2022 thus a low vertical anisotropy was set in the model area with a range from 1 to 3 porosity assigned to the model ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 and is within a range 0 001 to 0 3 used in the flow model for the hanoi area jusseret et al 2009 a mean porosity of holocene sand estimated in the local study at the h transect was 0 39 larsen et al 2008 calibrated recharge rates on the order of 10 4 m d 1 which compares well with the recharge of 3 10 4 m d 1 in the local model for the h transect larsen et al 2008 the developed model represents well the distribution of hydraulic heads and groundwater age in the proximal part of the red river delta and hydraulic properties of the aquifers are within the ranges reported in previous studies larsen et al 2008 jusseret et al 2009 however as a trial and error calibration method was applied it must be noted that the developed model is perhaps one of many plausible solutions but not one that is objectively determined to be the best given the available data 5 2 processes controlling groundwater arsenic distribution 5 2 1 sedimentary structure vs arsenic distribution the arsenic distribution in the holocene aquifer in the red river delta resembles the heterogeneous pattern observed in bangladesh van geen et al 2003 weinman et al 2008 and cambodia kocar et al 2014 arsenic in the aquifers of the red river delta is released from iron oxyhydroxides reduced by organic matter under anoxic conditions postma et al 2007 postma et al 2016 the reactivity of organic matter deposited in the alluvial sediments and therefore the reduction rate of iron hydroxides and mobilization of arsenic decreases with time lawson et al 2016 postma et al 2016 furthermore the arsenic concentration decreases with increasing number of pore volumes flushed through the aquifer postma et al 2012 jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 thus assuming homogeneous hydrogeological conditions the groundwater arsenic content decreases with increasing sediment age postma et al 2012 in the shallow holocene aquifer a clear link exists between sediment age and the groundwater arsenic level although exemptions were also observed figs 4 11 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic levels median of 81 μg l 1 are found in the youngest holocene sediments buried 1 7 ka bp fig 14 these deposits are distributed along recent courses of the red river and the day river light blue and light yellow color in figs 4 and 11a groundwater with lower arsenic levels median of 41 μg l 1 occurs in the sw part of the model area that consists of channel belt deposits with a burial age 2 9 ka bp figs 4 11a and 14 the relation between groundwater arsenic content and sediment age is not present in the deeper and older parts of the holocene aquifer where high arsenic concentrations can be found there are also parts of the pleistocene aquifer which is normally low in arsenic due to a different geological history where high arsenic levels occur cross sections c c and d d in fig 4 figs 12 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer are below clay layers with a thickness 10 m greyed areas in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 high arsenic levels below or adjacent to thick clay layers are common in holocene aquifers weinman et al 2008 nath et al 2010 kocar et al 2014 donselaar et al 2017 clay layers overlying pleistocene aquifers were so far reported as a factor causing retardation or even preventing arsenic transport to the pleistocene aquifers hoque et al 2017 however clay layers in the proximal part of the red river delta lead to increased arsenic contamination of the pleistocene aquifer fig 12 high groundwater arsenic levels in the older holocene river channels and pleistocene deposits figs 13 and 14 are related to a limited extent of aquifer flushing section 5 2 2 jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 and migration of arsenic from shallow to deeper aquifers section 5 2 3 winkel et al 2011 transport of organic matter from e g clay layers or surface water bodies into the deeper aquifers may be an additional factor that increases reduction rates of iron hydroxides and subsequent arsenic release postma et al 2007 weinman et al 2008 kocar et al 2014 lawson et al 2016 stahl et al 2016 5 2 2 number of flushed pore volumes vs arsenic distribution a relation between groundwater arsenic content and the number of recharged aquifer volumes has been documented for the holocene aquifers figs 11 12 and 13 as previously reported by jakobsen et al 2018 and sø et al 2018 a similar effect would be expected for the pleistocene aquifers but due to the more complex history of the pleistocene aquifers they cannot be compared directly with the holocene aquifers the number of recharged pore volumes is an effect of the recharge rate changes in flow patterns with shifting river courses and the sediment burial age jakobsen et al 2018 sø et al 2018 the modeled range of pore water velocities is similar in all aquifers of the red river floodplain fig 13 however the time available for the aquifer flushing after the sediment burial varies from 128 11 ka to 0 46 30 ka kazmierczak et al 2022 the lowest groundwater arsenic levels are found in the western part of the study site where clay layers were eroded and replaced with coarse grained channel belt deposits at 2 9 5 9 ka bp figs 4 11 and 12 here the high number of flushed pore water volumes resulting from the increased pore water velocities and the longer time available for aquifer flushing removed arsenic contamination from early holocene aquifers and presumably also the pleistocene aquifer figs 13 and 14 the highest groundwater arsenic levels in the holocene aquifer are in the ne part of the study site comprised of channel belt deposits with a burial age 1 7 ka figs 4 and 12 despite relatively high pore water velocities fig 13 according to the model study by postma et al 2016 the groundwater arsenic level in the proximal part of the red river floodplain reaches a maximum during the first 1200 a thus high arsenic levels in the youngest channel belts are related to high rates of arsenic mobilisation and limited extent of flushing high arsenic concentrations are also found in pleistocene aquifers below thick clay layers greyed areas in fig 12 recharge of the pleistocene aquifer through thick clay layers 10 m in the study area is lower than through the outcrops of the holocene or pleistocene aquifers fig 13 the occurrence of thick clay layers limits recharge of the aquifer and thus pore water velocity and thereby the ability to flush groundwater high in released arsenic figs 12 and 13 high groundwater arsenic levels in pleistocene aquifers may additionally be a result of clay layers acting as a source of organic matter weinman et al 2008 kocar et al 2014 lawson et al 2013 lawson et al 2016 the relation between the extent of flushing and groundwater arsenic levels in holocene aquifers in the proximal part of the red river delta was described by sø et al 2018 sø et al 2018 estimated based on the sediment burial age aquifer depth and the vertical flux rate calculated from 3h 3he profiles that the groundwater arsenic concentration decreases 10 μg l 1 after approximately 200 pore volumes were flushed through the aquifer however extremely high arsenic concentrations were also found in older holocene aquifers with pore water velocities of approximately 0 5 m d 1 fig 13 the 2d conceptual transient reactive transport model for arsenic in the red river aquifers set up by jakobsen et al 2018 showed that high arsenic concentrations in the older aquifers may be related to the downward transport of contamination furthermore high arsenic groundwater accumulates in stagnation zones below the major river channels and the flushing process is delayed until the river channel shifts position and changes the flow pattern jakobsen et al 2018 5 2 3 arsenic distribution modified by flow patterns the red river delta developed under low tectonic subsidence rates mathers and zalasiewicz 1999 that led to erosion of older deposits during sea level regression at 4 ka bp it resulted in connections between the pleistocene and holocene aquifers and transport of high arsenic groundwater from the youngest alluvial channels to older holocene and pleistocene aquifers e g wells phuong dinh p 18 and p 19 in figs 11 12 and 13 this is contrary to the thick deposits in the bengal basin with a high tectonic subsidence rate where holocene and pleistocene aquifers are well separated and hierarchical flow systems are imposed by the many interleaved discontinuous clay layers hoque et al 2017 here the pleistocene aquifers are less contaminated with arsenic unless excess groundwater pumping takes place in the deeper aquifers hoque et al 2017 additionally the high anisotropy in aquifers of the bengal basin imposes a regional flow system in the pleistocene aquifer and prevents seepage of arsenic contaminated groundwater from the youngest holocene deposits michael and voss 2009 at the proximal part of the red river delta despite the complex geological structure the pleistocene aquifer has both regional and local flow systems figs 4 and 8 the flow paths of the latter transports arsenic to the pleistocene aquifer as also suggested by jakobsen et al 2018 all groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene aquifer in the study area exceed who guideline of 10 µg l 1 fig 12 it appears contrary to the occurrence of oxic sediments in the pleistocene aquifer and potentially high number of recharged aquifer volumes sø et al 2018 groundwater arsenic concentrations in the pleistocene in areas where thick clay layers have been eroded wells outside of the greyed areas in fig 12 are similar to those in holocene aquifers with burial age 2 9 ka figs 13 and 14 it indicates that groundwater from older holocene aquifers with 10 µg l 1 arsenic fig 11 flows vertically down into the pleistocene aquifer which is supported by modeled flow paths to the wells along the sw model boundary screened in the pleistocene aquifer fig 12 the vertical flow is facilitated by low sediment anisotropy within the channel belt deposits transport of the groundwater enriched in arsenic from holocene to pleistocene aquifers in the proximal part of the red river delta was reported at the single meander scale by larsen et al 2008 anomalous arsenic concentrations in deeper groundwater were also found in the bengal basin where hydraulic windows existed hoque et al 2017 increased groundwater arsenic concentrations in pleistocene aquifers are a result of complex flow and transport patterns imposed by heterogeneities in the sedimentary structure of the floodplain and topographical differences also observed in cambodia kocar et al 2014 bangladesh and vietnam jakobsen et al 2018 the capacity of the oxic sandy pleistocene sediments to retard arsenic contamination described for a locality east of hanoi van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 and from bangladesh van geen et al 2003 is apparently much lower in the studied area probably due to the coarse grained nature of the sediment annual hydraulic head fluctuations enable the intrusion of oxygen with recharging groundwater to the uppermost part of holocene aquifer where clay layers are thin larsen et al 2008 infiltrated oxygen oxidizes organic matter and prevents reduction of iron hydroxides and a subsequent arsenic release larsen et al 2008 kocar et al 2014 furthermore it leads to precipitation of secondary iron hydroxides and re adsorption of the released arsenic larsen et al 2008 thus arsenic concentrations in the holocene aquifer near the groundwater table are 10 μg l 1 and are limited to the uppermost 2 m of holocene aquifer fig 4 5 3 implications for drinking water resources elevated arsenic concentrations in pleistocene aquifers of the red river delta were previously reported winkel et al 2011 stahl et al 2016 and interpreted as a result of excessive groundwater abstraction however our study site is located outside of the hanoi depression cone fig 2 the local wells in the area only abstract 2 of the total aquifer recharge and hydraulic heads are not lower in the vicinity of the local abstraction wells compared to the surrounding areas see phuong thuong and tam thuan well pads in fig 7 furthermore hydraulic head measurements in the vertical profiles and model results both indicated a small downward hydraulic gradient between the holocene and pleistocene aquifer fig 7 under these conditions in a highly conductive pleistocene aquifer with regional flow paths low groundwater arsenic concentrations are expected especially beneath the thick clay layers michael and voss 2009 hoque et al 2017 however high arsenic levels in the pleistocene aquifer of our study site are found in both areas with and without local abstraction wells figs 4 and 12 elevated arsenic levels in the pleistocene aquifer of the uppermost part of the red river delta are therefore not an outcome of excess groundwater abstraction as reported in the hanoi area winkel et al 2011 instead they are a result of hydrogeological processes such as a limited extent of flushing and transport of contamination from shallow to deeper aquifers section 5 2 remediation of drinking water resources to limit arsenic contents in the proximal part of the red river delta is therefore not possible e g by change of pumping rates due to the natural origin of the contamination however additional deterioration of groundwater quality in the aquifers outside of the expanding hanoi depression cone fig 7 bui et al 2012 can be prevented by sustainable water resources management 6 conclusions groundwater enriched in arsenic was found in pleistocene aquifers of the red river delta outside of the hanoi depression cone high groundwater arsenic levels in pleistocene aquifers of the red river delta may be the result of a limited extent of flushing and inflow of arsenic contaminated groundwater from holocene aquifers along natural flow paths and not only as previously described inflow induced by excess groundwater abstraction due to the low tectonic subsidence rate in the red river delta clay layers separating aquifers have been extensively removed by erosion as a result arsenic enriched groundwater from holocene aquifers is transported naturally through hydrogeological windows into the pleistocene aquifers which are often by default considered as a source of low arsenic water in addition thick clay layers if permeable may provide organic matter to underlying aquifers this may induce iron hydroxides reduction and arsenic release not only in younger holocene aquifers but also in pleistocene aquifers resulting in high groundwater arsenic levels credit authorship contribution statement jolanta kazmierczak

3436,tropical forests have experienced rapid deforestation due to demand from agriculture timber and urbanisation throughout the caribbean planting resilient fast growing exotic pine trees such as pinus caribaea or pinus oorcarpa have been used to reforest many degraded landscapes however little is understood on how these exotic pine forests alter hydrological processes and water resource availability we examined the rainfall interception dynamics between an exotic pine and contiguous native secondary forest in trinidad canopy understory and litter interception were quantified and examined along with throughfall variability rainfall characteristics and canopy cover our results indicate that over a one year period the exotic pine forest intercepts 30 more of the incoming precipitation than the native forest reducing the rainfall reaching the forest floor the pine forest had a lower canopy cover but still had a higher storage capacity of 4 3 mm leading to a higher annual interception of 29 the native forest had a lower storage capacity of 2 6 mm and a lower annual interception of 24 understory vegetation played a critical role in the interception process in the pine forest storing an additional 29 of incoming rainfall increasing the total vegetative interception in the pine forest to 58 763 mm these findings point to the creation of drier conditions within pine forest and the need to re examine the use of pine trees as a reforestation tool this study highlights the importance of understory vegetation interception and stresses the need for more research on understory precipitation interactions keywords rainfall partitioning throughfall forest floor water storage capacity tropical forest reforestation 1 introduction globally forests have been significantly impacted by degradation and deforestation through logging fires and urbanization garcīa loez et al 2018 to counteract this forest plantations and agroforestry have been increasingly seen and used as a viable alternative for degraded lands park et al 2010 waterloo et al 2007 however many of these reforestation programmes utilize non native plant species the changing of forest composition often results in alterations of the hydrological processes such as throughfall stemflow and interception garcīa loez et al 2018 huber and iroumé 2001 park et al 2010 these processes strongly influence soil moisture which in turn impacts streamflow and groundwater recharge huber and iroumé 2001 and are therefore vital in establishing an accurate water budget additionally understanding the processes involved in rainfall distribution is vital in water resource management as it can be used to help quantify and model factors such as canopy interception loss water yield and storage in forest catchment kato et al 2013 when rainfall reaches a forested area it interacts with the forest canopy and is partitioned along three possible pathways throughfall stemflow and canopy interception kato et al 2013 macinnis ng et al 2012 this partitioning varies among forest and vegetation types and climates with interception and throughfall values ranging widely how rainfall is partitioned between throughfall stemflow and canopy interception depends primarily on the climatic and vegetative factors within the forest bulcock and jewitt 2012a macinnis ng et al 2012 kato et al 2013 van stan et al 2016 these factors not only affect the amount of rainfall that is partitioned but also how the rainfall is partitioned spatially and temporally kowalska et al 2016 levia and germer 2015 rainfall event characteristics depth intensity and duration have a significant impact on throughfall and stemflow amount and variability bulcock and jewitt 2012b macinnis ng et al 2012 eaton et al 1973 the amount of throughfall increases with higher rainfall amount and intensity van stan et al 2016 likewise stemflow increases with higher precipitation depths and intensities levia et al 2011 the influence of duration on either of these processes is not as well understood with far less information available the spatial variability of throughfall is strongly influenced by rainfall depth andré et al 2011 levia et al 2011 throughfall spatial variability decreases with increasing rainfall depth until a threshold water input is reached after which there is little to no difference in the spatial variability kato et al 2013 wullaert et al 2009 although rainfall intensity and duration influence throughfall spatial variability the extent of the impact remains inconsistent among studies wullaert et al 2009 vegetation interactions with the incident precipitation strongly determines the ratios of the rainfall partitioning within a forest system the main vegetation features that have been identified include species type andré et al 2011 kato et al 2013 and canopy structure kowalska et al 2016 van stan and pypker 2015 other forest scale factors such as the stand density canopy cover leaf area index lai and woody area index wai also strongly impact canopy interception processes dietz et al 2006 macinnis ng et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2018 swaffer et al 2014 at the individual tree scale morphological features such as tree crown structure macinnis ng et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2018 leaf and branch characteristics holder and gibbes 2017 van stan et al 2016 phenophase or state of the canopy andré et al 2011 brasil et al 2018 and epiphyte load van stan and pypker 2015 play an important role in rainfall partitioning the differences in vegetative structure can have a strong effect on interception values bulcock and jewitt 2012a showed interception values of 14 9 27 7 and 21 4 in eucalyptus grandis acacia mearnsii and pinus patual under the same rainfall conditions although many studies show differences in interception among forest types others show little to no difference among individual tree species under the same rainfall conditions swaffer et al 2014 huber and iroumé 2001 showed that annual interception in broadleaved forests ranged from 10 to 37 which was not substantially different than coniferous forest stands that ranged from 11 to 39 interception in the canopy is a threshold driven process given by the amount of water that is required to fill the canopy reservoir before the excess precipitation reaches the understory litter layer and forest floor bulcock and jewitt 2012a canopy interception thresholds of 0 2 4 7 mm have been recorded in a variety of ecosystems eaton et al 1973 klamerus iwan et al 2020 llorens and gallart 2000 interception processes within a forest continues below the canopy understory and litter layer interception occurs after losses to the canopy storing much of the throughfall which increases the overall interception very little is known about understory interception and leaf litter interception is not as widely studied as canopy interception bulcock and jewitt 2012a gerrits et al 2007 park et al 2010 despite this the understory and litter layers can intercept up to 21 and 34 of rainfall respectively e g gordon et al 2020 dunkerley 2015 and therefore play significant roles in the transfer of water in forests bulcock and jewitt 2012a b replanting degraded or deforested areas with various exotic pine species is a commonly used strategy due to their faster growth easier management resistance to fire and capacity to grow on degraded lands del campo et al 2014 richardson and petit 2006 in some locations these pine plantations have improved the microclimate and soil properties del campo et al 2014 while in others a noticeable decrease in percolation and groundwater recharge rates due to higher canopy interception have been observed huber et al 2008 therefore employing appropriate reforestation practices is necessary to limit hydrological changes capable of diminishing the societal benefits of natural ecosystems especially in areas with lower adaption and mitigation capacity such as the humid tropics garcīa loez et al 2018 in many parts of the caribbean exotic pine forests have been used as a reforestation tool to combat deforestation caused primarily by forest fires while the ecological impacts of these plantations are somewhat understood hayes and samad 1998 little to no work has been done on their impacts on hydrological processes and water availability in this comparative study we examined the differences in rainfall interception between native secondary deciduous tropical forests and exotic pine forest the specific objectives of this study were to 1 examine the major controls on canopy interception between both forests 2 characterize the canopy interception over space and time between both forests 3 quantify and examine the understory and forest litter interception dynamics between the two forest types 4 examine how pine forest reforestation influence the water available for other hydrological processes 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study was conducted from january 2018 to november 2018 in the st anns valley of trinidad and tobago 10 41 45 3 n 61 29 23 0 w fig 1 the climate is tropical monsoon köppen geiger am with a distinct wet and dry season the average annual precipitation is 2077 mm year of which 79 falls between june and december the native forest and exotic pine forest both have an usda soil order of ultisols and both areas have a sandy loam soil texture pinus oocarpa was the dominant tree species in the exotic pine forest and was planted prior to 1990 trees were planted approximately six to seven meters apart and most had suffered burns from a forest fire the previous year the understory within the pine forest consisted primarily of cecropia peltate pteridium arachnoideum hyptis pectinate myrcia sp and genipa americana with heights less than three meters the adjacent native secondary deciduous forest contained many large emergent trees such as spondias sp and cecropis sp and the major canopy trees were identified as theobroma cacao and coffea cf arabica the native forest floor was sparse with very few shrubs or ferns scattered throughout fig 2 an area of 1000 m2 was selected within each forest where the tree cover and terrain are representative of the whole forest in both forests the 1000 m2 study area was broken into two plots each differing in size due to the steepness of the terrain the plots had the following dimensions exotic pine plot 1 was 15 m 30 m 450 m2 and exotic pine plot 2 was 22 m 25 m 550 m2 native forest plot 1 was 10 m 25 m 250 m2 and native forest plot 2 was 25 m 30 m 750 m2 2 2 rainfall measurements rainfall data was collected at 10 minute intervals using a hobo data logging rain gauge situated in a cleared area located 800 m away from the pine plot and 100 m away from the native forest plot the depth mm intensity mm h and duration h were calculated for individual storm events during the study period these values were then used to estimate the weekly depth mm and the average weekly intensity and duration of the rainfall events a criterion was developed to determine individual rainfall events based on the length of time between events similar to that given by rasheed et al 2019 rainfall events were considered separate after two hours of no rainfall activity an exception to this was given to intense dry season conditions with cumulative weekly rainfall below 5 mm as to account for the smaller isolated events that occur during the dry season weeks with a total rainfall amount lower than 1 mm were excluded from characteristics data set due to the possibly of tipping caused by condensation or animal interactions 2 3 throughfall and canopy interception throughfall was collected weekly from january to november 2018 using 165 cm2 funnel collectors which can hold a maximum of 2500 mm of throughfall before overflowing all collectors were fitted with small styrofoam balls in the funnel to limit water loss by evaporation and reduce clogging by falling plant material each forest contained 22 roving collectors that were randomly distributed within both plots and relocated every two weeks to a new location two to six meters away from the original location the collectors were placed in areas cleared of short understory vegetation ferns and at least two meters away from taller understory vegetation this roving method accounts for variability in the canopy and eliminates bias in the data lloyd et al 1988 thimonier 1998 understorey throughfall was collected only in the pine forest due the thickness of its forest floor vegetation ten additional roving collectors were randomly placed below the understory plants and were relocated every two weeks ten stationary collectors were randomly placed within each forest and remained in the same location for the duration of the project canopy interception was determined by subtracting the mean throughfall of all the collectors stationary and roving from the rainfall depth similarly understory interception was determined by subtracting the mean canopy throughfall by the mean understory throughfall 2 4 stem flow due to design material and installation challenges stemflow was only collected from august to november 2018 weekly the pine forest was fitted with seven collectors while the native forest contained eight collectors the trees in the pine plantation were selected based on the various size classes found in the native forest the collectors were placed on the major tree species of the forest whereby two to three of each of the species were selected to ensure a non biased sample three spondias sp with dbh ranging from 14 cm to 68 cm three cecropis sp ranging from 21 cm to 39 cm one theobroma cacao multiple trunks at breast height and one unidentified tree species silicone was used to firmly secure the tubes to the tress at breast height in the form of two loops around the trees the tubing was then attached to multiple 15 l buckets for water storage the relative stemflow for the entire plot being measured was determined using the following formula thimonier 1998 t o t a l v o l u m e i n t h e p l o t m i l l i m e t e r totalstemflowofntrees l i t e r plotarea h e c t a r e totalbasalareaofalltreesintheplot totalbasalareaofthentrees 10 4 2 5 leaf litter interception leaf litter interception was collected from june to november 2018 on a weekly basis each forest contained 15 collectors of the same dimensions as the throughfall collectors covered with a wire mesh with 0 64 cm spaces the wire mesh was cut into 18 cm 18 cm squares to fully cover the collectors the collectors were randomly placed throughout each forest in areas of varying litter thickness to account for the variations in the environment and differences in tree species for the native forest the wire mesh was carefully slid under the leaf litter with the assistance of a thin metal ruler in order to maintain the composition and orientation of the litter the litter comprised of semi decomposed litter and the recently fallen undecomposed litter from the end of the dry season the mesh was then placed on the collector which was then inserted in the same location where the litter was collected some leaves collected in the native forests were carefully trimmed to fit the dimensions of the collectors as they were excessively larger than the collectors 2 6 vegetation characteristics the diameter at breast height dbh needed to calculate the basal area was measured at 1 3 m above the ground level and on the uphill side of each tree the basal area of the stand was determined using the following equation b a s a l a r e a meter 2 0 00007854 diameteratbreastheight 2 bettinger et al 2017 the vegetation cover fractions the ratio of surface covered by green vegetation were determined through photos of the canopy directly above each stationary throughfall collector using a nikon 3300 camera and processed using the can eye software weiss and baret 2017 to examine seasonal and monthly changes in vegetation cover fraction ten photos of the forest canopy were taken in each plot at the start of each month the photos were taken at the same location as the ten stationary collectors within each plot additional photos were taken throughout each plot in a grid fashion every six to seven meters to be used as supplementary images if needed photos were taken under the same degree of camera zoom angle and under similar cloud cover to ensure similar comparative processing of images within the can eye software weiss and baret 2017 2 7 statistical analysis the monthly vegetation cover of the native forest and pine forest were compared using t test statistics to determine the significant differences between them the spss statistical package ibm spss statistics for windows version 24 0 armonk ny inm corp was used to conduct the test 3 results 3 1 vegetation and hydrometeorological characteristics the pine forests had a dbh that ranged from 16 to 66 cm with an average of 34 cm the average basal area within the pine forest was 0 10 0 05 m2 the native secondary forest had an average basal area of 0 13 0 09 m2 while the average dbh was 37 cm and ranged from 14 cm to 68 cm the annual mean vegetation cover fraction in the native forest was 97 and monthly means ranged from 95 to 98 the annual mean vegetation cover fraction in the pine forest was 62 with monthly means from 56 to 66 overall there was a statistically significant difference p 0 05 in the vegetation cover between the pine and natural forest a total of 1314 mm of rainfall was recorded between january and december 2018 the dry season january may accumulated a sum of 380 mm of rainfall which was 29 of the annual rainfall the wet season june december rainfall total was 934 mm which was 71 of annual rainfall in the dry season the mean weekly rainfall was 21 8 17 mm and ranged from 1 6 mm to 59 6 mm table 1 the wet season rainfall ranged from 3 6 mm to 144 mm with a mean weekly rainfall of 59 4 39 mm the depth of rainfall per event in the wet season was a little over twofold that of the dry season the mean duration of rainfall events in the wet season was 1 60 h versus 1 15 h in the dry season while the mean rainfall intensity within the wet season was 4 6 2 5 mm h compared to 3 2 1 4 mm h in the dry season 3 2 rainfall canopy interception relationships in the native forest weekly throughfall ranged from 0 5 to 85 3 mm 30 to 96 of rainfall and showed a statistically significant linear relationship with total weekly rainfall r 2 0 96 p 0 0001 fig 3 a the pine forests showed a similar range of throughfall values of 0 5 to 81 7 mm 28 to 95 of rainfall and a statistically significant linear relationship with total weekly rainfall r 2 0 96 p 0 0001 fig 3b the relationship between interception and gross rainfall were significant in the native r 2 0 49 p 0 0001 and pine forest r 2 0 53 p 0 0001 based on the regression analysis between interception mm and gross rainfall mm a rainfall storage threshold of 2 6 mm and 4 3 mm was estimated for throughfall to occur in the native forest and pine forest respectively fig 3c d the percentage canopy interception by the native forest ranged from 4 to 70 and shows a strong negative relationship with rainfall depth r 2 0 54 fig 4 a the pine forest presented similar results with interception ranging from 5 to 72 and a similar negative relationship with rainfall depth r 2 0 48 fig 4b to better explain the relationship between rainfall and interception the rainfall events were categorised as i low intensity low duration ii low intensity high duration iii high intensity low duration and iv high intensity high duration and then plotted against the interception fig 4d e intensity and duration were divided into high and low categories based on the median value low average weekly rainfall intensities ranged from 1 2 to 3 4 mm h and high intensity events were 3 4 mm h low average weekly rainfall duration ranged from 0 22 to 1 45 hrs and high duration events were 1 47 hrs for both forests the highest interception values were observed during low intensity low duration events this was more evident in the pine forests where higher interception rates were recorded for such events however once these low intensity low duration events had rainfall depths above the storage threshold interception was greatly reduced fig 4d e the low intensity high duration and high intensity low duration events generally occupied the middle range of 20 to 60 canopy interception rates for weekly rainfall depths of 10 to 50 mm fig 4d e it is important to note that in the native forest a greater number of these event types four experienced interception rates 20 than in the pine forest three events although high intensity high duration events typically produced lower canopy interception rates interception rates were high for a few of these events particularly in the native forest 3 3 temporal and spatial variations in canopy interception throughfall values varied temporally seasonally and spatially in both forests during the dry season throughfall accounted for 66 of the gross rainfall in the native forest with a mean weekly throughfall of 14 0 12 7 mm and 62 of the gross rainfall in the pine forest with a mean weekly throughfall of 13 1 12 4 mm throughfall rates in the wet season were substantially higher than in the dry season in the native forest throughfall was 80 of gross rainfall with mean weekly values of 41 4 28 4 mm while throughfall was 74 of rainfall with mean weekly values of 38 6 28 9 mm in the pine forest to assess the spatial variability of throughfall in both forests the coefficient of variation cv was determined using the throughfall data from stationary and roving collectors when examined across the entire study period the mean cv in the native forest was 46 with weekly values from 27 to 98 this was higher than the pine forest which had a mean cv of 18 3 and weekly values of 8 to 56 fig 5 in the pine forest the largest cv was associated with smaller weekly rainfall 9mm averaging 29 while totals 19 mm remained relatively consistent 14 4 the largest cv in the natural forest was also associated with weekly rainfall of 9 mm with a mean of 70 however larger weekly rainfall totals of 50 mm were required to produce a relatively consistent cv 37 6 7 3 4 rainfall understory and litter interception relationships throughfall in the pine understory ranged from 0 1 to 51 3 mm 5 to 62 of rainfall and 13 to 82 of pine canopy throughfall and showed a statistically significant linear relationship with pine canopy throughfall r 2 0 96 p 0 0001 fig 6 a when pine understory interception is plotted against pine canopy throughfall the linear relationship remained statistically significant r 2 0 93 p 0 0001 fig 6b the understory storage threshold obtained through the regression analysis with pine understory throughfall and pine canopy throughfall and understory interception and pine canopy throughfall was estimated at 0 57 0 43 mm fig 6a b pine understory throughfall was highly spatially variable with a mean annual cv of 50 and a maximum cv of 162 the percentage of rainfall intercepted at the understory level of the pine forest ranged from 38 to 95 and had a similar relationship with rainfall r 2 0 53 fig 4c like both forest canopies when assessed using the same intensity duration characteristics as the forest canopy the low intensity low duration events generally produced the highest interception rates in the understory with 70 rainfall interception for such events fig 4f all other event characteristics showed no discernible trends fig 4f throughfall in the litter layer of the native forest ranged from 0 2 to 80 7 mm 0 7 to 94 6 of native forest canopy throughfall and showed a positive linear relationship with native forest canopy throughfall r 2 0 43 p 0 0001 fig 7 a throughfall in the pine forest litter ranged from 0 2 to 37 5 mm 10 8 to 52 2 of pine canopy throughfall and had a stronger statistically significant relationship with pine canopy throughfall r 2 0 97 p 0 0001 fig 7b it should be noted that the absence of a rim around the throughfall could allow any horizontally traveling water to spill outside the collector especially along with the sloped areas where the collectors were installed zhao et al 2019 this may result in the overestimation of litter layer interception 3 5 annual interception in exotic pine versus native forests in assessing the impact of pine forest plantations on the annual interception and water availability overflowing throughfall collectors and associated rainfall were removed from the analysis the total rainfall was 1314 mm fig 8 a throughfall collected in the native forest totalled 997 mm resulting in a canopy interception of 24 while 930 mm of throughfall was measured in the exotic pine forest equating to 29 canopy rainfall interception table 2 fig 8a the 5 difference in interception between the forest canopies resulted in the pine forests intercepting 67 mm more rainfall throughfall at the understory level of the pine forest was 551 mm this accounted for an additional 29 of incoming rainfall being intercepted by the understory increasing the total vegetative interception in the pine forest to 58 763 mm stemflow in the native forest accounted for 0 03 to 0 2 of rainfall while in the exotic pine forest stemflow accounted for 0 07 to 2 2 of rainfall stemflow was only collected during the second half of the wet season due to installation issues however a conservative estimation of the annual stemflow was made assuming the mean values of 0 1 and 0 8 in the native and the pine forest respectively can be used throughout the year application of these rates to the annual rainfall of 1314 mm year produces annual stemflow values of 1 3 mm year and 10 5 mm year in the native and pine forests respectively during the leaf litter measurement period 906 mm of rainfall was recorded fig 8b litter layer throughfall in the native forest was 343 mm 62 rainfall interception and was 294 mm 68 rainfall interception in the pine forest 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall interception in native forests and exotic pine forest canopies the strong positive linear relationship between throughfall and rainfall observed in this study at a weekly time interval aligns with observations in other forests huber and iroumé 2001 sun et al 2018 a 1 7 mm difference in the canopy storage capacity was recorded for the native 2 6 mm and exotic pine 4 3 mm forests these observations support the work of klamerus iwan et al 2020 which recorded higher storage capacities and associated interception rates in pine forests fan et al 2014 this is often attributed to differences in leaf structure crown structure and stem densities between broadleaf and pine forests ghimire et al 2012 levia et al 2011 ilek et al 2017 van stan et al 2016 we did not directly measure stem density however the vegetation cover fraction in the pine forest was lower than in the native forest indicating that stem density does not explain the higher storage and interception in the pine since the climate would be similar in both stands due to their close proximity the higher interception is therefore ascribed to the pine needle leaf structure pine needle clusters hold intercepted rainfall more securely than vertically aligned broad leaves sun et al 2018 thereby increasing the storage capacity and interception in pine canopies in this study we explored the use of weekly rather than daily measurements of throughfall to assess the canopy storage thresholds in forest canopies this approach was used due to limited financial and instrument resources as thresholds observed in our study were similar to those recorded for other broadleaf and pine forests which range from 0 2 to 4 7 mm klamerus iwan et al 2020 llorens and gallart 2000 it suggests that if sampled over an extended time i e more than one year weekly throughfall samples may give a strong indication of canopy threshold dynamics to fully test this hypothesis we recommend that further work be done to examine weekly versus daily measurements in assessing interception thresholds interception as a percentage of rainfall is influenced by rainfall depth van stan et al 2016 while we observed this for both forest types the regression analysis indicated that the relationship was not very strong this suggests that additional rainfall characteristics e g intensity and duration play an important role in the interception process macinnis ng et al 2012 van stan and friesen 2020 to assess this we categorised rainfall events by intensity duration characteristics and examined interception rates the high interception for low intensity low duration events is attributed to these events having rainfall depths below the storage threshold klamerus iwan et al 2020 while higher intensity or duration events had a lower interception the rates were quite variable making interpretation challenging fig 4d f this is likely a result of using weekly values and not individual events the high cv and large variation in throughfall in the native forest is within the range reported for other tropical forests huber and iroumé 2001 macinnis ng et al 2012 zimmermann et al 2008 2007 this has been attributed to high heterogeneity high epiphytic load and broadleaf morphologies which generate variable drip points increasing throughfall spatial variability andré et al 2011 germer et al 2006 wullaert et al 2009 the throughfall variability in our pine forests is one of the first recorded for pine forests in the tropics the low variability observed in the pine is similar to the reports of other studies conducted in native and planted pine forests fan et al 2015 kowalska et al 2016 the pine forest sites are typically monocultures with no epiphytes which produce more stable spatial throughfall distribution huber and iroumé 2001 kowalska et al 2016 additionally the uniform establishment of our pine forest must also be considered the forest being established through reforestation efforts has trees of the same age size and spacing further promoting the low spatial variability 4 2 understory and litter layer interception research on the interception dynamics of understory vegetation is an emerging area where little currently understood klamerus iwan et al 2020 our current study shows that like the tree canopy throughfall in the understory is strongly impacted by precipitation characteristics particularly rainfall depth however precipitation intensity and duration had little impact on understory interception the influence of rainfall intensity and duration may be buffered by the canopy as it acts as a barrier reducing the intensity and slowing water penetration to the forest floor thereby making tree canopy throughfall a more important factor when assessing understory interception dynamics gerrits and savenije 2011 this is observed in our current study as the depth of throughfall from the pine canopy had a stronger influence on understory throughfall our estimated understory storage threshold range of 0 57 0 43 mm was lower than the 1 3 mm recorded by gordon et al 2020 for dogfennel in the lab our values likely reflect differences in methodologies the 1 3 mm by gordon et al 2020 uses the mass change of dried and wet vegetation this represents the maximum storage of both leaves 0 9 mm and stems 0 43 mm and may overestimate the storage when compared to field based assessments which may not estimate the maximum storage of both leaves and stems the understory vegetation structure and characteristics may also have a strong influence on the storage capacities unlike gordon et al 2020 who focused on a single herbaceous species our site contained a mix of herbaceous and woody understory species the high pine understory throughfall cv 50 but low pine canopy throughfall cv 18 suggests that the understory throughfall is influenced by characteristics the of heterogenous understory layer this may also explain the lower recorded understory capacities at our site which are more reflective of a diverse understory canopy and not a single species throughfall has been shown to have a stronger influence on the interception dynamics of the litter reservoir than precipitation bulcock and jewitt 2012a gerrits and savenije 2011 tsiko et al 2012 our study supports these observations as we recorded a stronger relationship between canopy throughfall and litter throughfall than precipitation and litter throughfall in both forests this further highlights the importance of using canopy throughfall characteristics and not precipitation when examining the litter reservoir litter throughfall in the native forest had a substantially weaker relationship with canopy throughfall and was more variable than in the pine forests this can be viewed as a product of the spatial variability of canopy throughfall throughfall patterns can affect litter storage as canopy heterogeneity can produce either more or less localised drainage patterns gerrits and savenije 2011 klamerus iwan et al 2020 the native forest had high canopy throughfall spatial variability with distinctive dripping points and dry points when paired with the higher diversity of litter in terms of type size and rate of deposition a more dynamic process is created leading to greater variability in the litter throughfall as the pine trees were artificially planted the spacing and age among trees is approximately the same while the litter layer was quite homogenous primarily pine needles this homogeneity likely led to the lower variability and stronger relationship between canopy and litter layer throughfall in the pine forests 4 3 the impact of non native pine forests on water availability our results indicate that over a one year period the exotic pine forest can intercept 30 more of the incoming precipitation than the native forest table 2 and leads to a substantial reduction in water reaching the forest floor this higher interception rate occurs at all forests levels canopy understory and litter layer comparative studies on the impacts of exotic pine forests on rainfall interception especially in the tropics are not well examined in locations where information exists exotic pine forests have either higher fan et al 2014 or lower ghimire et al 2012 canopy interception rates than the native forests our study falls into the former category and as mentioned earlier is likely due to the leaf structural differences between both forests this study highlights the importance of characterising the understory interception in forested environments our work shows that the exotic pine understory intercepts 29 of precipitation which is the same as gordon et al 2020 but substantially higher than the 3 8 recorded by jiang et al 2019 the high value in our understory is reflective of the extensive and dense understory layer which covered the entirety of the pine forest the annual leaf litter interception in the exotic pine forest was greater than in the native forests this difference was not static as the native forests intercepted more rainfall from june august however by september weekly interception in the pine litter was greater and by november total interception in pine litter surpassed the native forest fig 8b the difference in litter interception from june august can be attributed to litter layer thickness and composition when litter thickness is the same broadleaf litter has a greater storage capacity than needles gerrits and savenije 2011 klamerus iwan et al 2020 due to differences in leaf area macropore size and contact angle li and niu jianzhi 2013 by september substantial amounts of decomposition were observed in the native forest litter with some collectors having no litter on the screen this reduced the overall thickness of the litter layer in the native forest and led to a sharp decrease in the interception the pine litter experienced little decomposition during this time and maintained a relatively thick litter layer allowing consistent interception during this period while our litter interception results are useful for comparing the relative difference between our forest stands the use of the values to compare to other global sites should be done with caution annual leaf litter interception typically ranges from 1 to 34 bulcock and jewitt 2012a dunkerley 2015 helvey 1964 zhao et al 2019 our values of 62 68 far exceed these and may be due to instrument errors and overestimations due to evaporation bulcock and jewitt 2012a and horizontal flow over the litter and spillage outside the collector zhao et al 2019 5 conclusion exotic pine forests can substantially impact the hydrology of tropical systems through changes to interception pine forests intercepted 58 of the incoming annual precipitation compared to 24 in the native forest the understory vegetation in the pine forest was the primary driver for the increased interception holding 29 of the annual precipitation and it is highly recommended that when present understory interception be measured these changes to interception have substantial implications for soil water storage and subsequently runoff and streamflow generation and groundwater recharge despite the higher interception rates in the pine forest rainfall characteristics were major controls on interception for both forest types while rainfall characteristics had a strong influence on both understory and litter throughfall our study indicated that canopy throughfall has a greater effect on understory and litter interception however the use of weekly not event based data to examine understory and litter processes is a limitation of this study one that future work can overcome using an automated gauge network or simulated rainfall credit authorship contribution

3436,tropical forests have experienced rapid deforestation due to demand from agriculture timber and urbanisation throughout the caribbean planting resilient fast growing exotic pine trees such as pinus caribaea or pinus oorcarpa have been used to reforest many degraded landscapes however little is understood on how these exotic pine forests alter hydrological processes and water resource availability we examined the rainfall interception dynamics between an exotic pine and contiguous native secondary forest in trinidad canopy understory and litter interception were quantified and examined along with throughfall variability rainfall characteristics and canopy cover our results indicate that over a one year period the exotic pine forest intercepts 30 more of the incoming precipitation than the native forest reducing the rainfall reaching the forest floor the pine forest had a lower canopy cover but still had a higher storage capacity of 4 3 mm leading to a higher annual interception of 29 the native forest had a lower storage capacity of 2 6 mm and a lower annual interception of 24 understory vegetation played a critical role in the interception process in the pine forest storing an additional 29 of incoming rainfall increasing the total vegetative interception in the pine forest to 58 763 mm these findings point to the creation of drier conditions within pine forest and the need to re examine the use of pine trees as a reforestation tool this study highlights the importance of understory vegetation interception and stresses the need for more research on understory precipitation interactions keywords rainfall partitioning throughfall forest floor water storage capacity tropical forest reforestation 1 introduction globally forests have been significantly impacted by degradation and deforestation through logging fires and urbanization garcīa loez et al 2018 to counteract this forest plantations and agroforestry have been increasingly seen and used as a viable alternative for degraded lands park et al 2010 waterloo et al 2007 however many of these reforestation programmes utilize non native plant species the changing of forest composition often results in alterations of the hydrological processes such as throughfall stemflow and interception garcīa loez et al 2018 huber and iroumé 2001 park et al 2010 these processes strongly influence soil moisture which in turn impacts streamflow and groundwater recharge huber and iroumé 2001 and are therefore vital in establishing an accurate water budget additionally understanding the processes involved in rainfall distribution is vital in water resource management as it can be used to help quantify and model factors such as canopy interception loss water yield and storage in forest catchment kato et al 2013 when rainfall reaches a forested area it interacts with the forest canopy and is partitioned along three possible pathways throughfall stemflow and canopy interception kato et al 2013 macinnis ng et al 2012 this partitioning varies among forest and vegetation types and climates with interception and throughfall values ranging widely how rainfall is partitioned between throughfall stemflow and canopy interception depends primarily on the climatic and vegetative factors within the forest bulcock and jewitt 2012a macinnis ng et al 2012 kato et al 2013 van stan et al 2016 these factors not only affect the amount of rainfall that is partitioned but also how the rainfall is partitioned spatially and temporally kowalska et al 2016 levia and germer 2015 rainfall event characteristics depth intensity and duration have a significant impact on throughfall and stemflow amount and variability bulcock and jewitt 2012b macinnis ng et al 2012 eaton et al 1973 the amount of throughfall increases with higher rainfall amount and intensity van stan et al 2016 likewise stemflow increases with higher precipitation depths and intensities levia et al 2011 the influence of duration on either of these processes is not as well understood with far less information available the spatial variability of throughfall is strongly influenced by rainfall depth andré et al 2011 levia et al 2011 throughfall spatial variability decreases with increasing rainfall depth until a threshold water input is reached after which there is little to no difference in the spatial variability kato et al 2013 wullaert et al 2009 although rainfall intensity and duration influence throughfall spatial variability the extent of the impact remains inconsistent among studies wullaert et al 2009 vegetation interactions with the incident precipitation strongly determines the ratios of the rainfall partitioning within a forest system the main vegetation features that have been identified include species type andré et al 2011 kato et al 2013 and canopy structure kowalska et al 2016 van stan and pypker 2015 other forest scale factors such as the stand density canopy cover leaf area index lai and woody area index wai also strongly impact canopy interception processes dietz et al 2006 macinnis ng et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2018 swaffer et al 2014 at the individual tree scale morphological features such as tree crown structure macinnis ng et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2018 leaf and branch characteristics holder and gibbes 2017 van stan et al 2016 phenophase or state of the canopy andré et al 2011 brasil et al 2018 and epiphyte load van stan and pypker 2015 play an important role in rainfall partitioning the differences in vegetative structure can have a strong effect on interception values bulcock and jewitt 2012a showed interception values of 14 9 27 7 and 21 4 in eucalyptus grandis acacia mearnsii and pinus patual under the same rainfall conditions although many studies show differences in interception among forest types others show little to no difference among individual tree species under the same rainfall conditions swaffer et al 2014 huber and iroumé 2001 showed that annual interception in broadleaved forests ranged from 10 to 37 which was not substantially different than coniferous forest stands that ranged from 11 to 39 interception in the canopy is a threshold driven process given by the amount of water that is required to fill the canopy reservoir before the excess precipitation reaches the understory litter layer and forest floor bulcock and jewitt 2012a canopy interception thresholds of 0 2 4 7 mm have been recorded in a variety of ecosystems eaton et al 1973 klamerus iwan et al 2020 llorens and gallart 2000 interception processes within a forest continues below the canopy understory and litter layer interception occurs after losses to the canopy storing much of the throughfall which increases the overall interception very little is known about understory interception and leaf litter interception is not as widely studied as canopy interception bulcock and jewitt 2012a gerrits et al 2007 park et al 2010 despite this the understory and litter layers can intercept up to 21 and 34 of rainfall respectively e g gordon et al 2020 dunkerley 2015 and therefore play significant roles in the transfer of water in forests bulcock and jewitt 2012a b replanting degraded or deforested areas with various exotic pine species is a commonly used strategy due to their faster growth easier management resistance to fire and capacity to grow on degraded lands del campo et al 2014 richardson and petit 2006 in some locations these pine plantations have improved the microclimate and soil properties del campo et al 2014 while in others a noticeable decrease in percolation and groundwater recharge rates due to higher canopy interception have been observed huber et al 2008 therefore employing appropriate reforestation practices is necessary to limit hydrological changes capable of diminishing the societal benefits of natural ecosystems especially in areas with lower adaption and mitigation capacity such as the humid tropics garcīa loez et al 2018 in many parts of the caribbean exotic pine forests have been used as a reforestation tool to combat deforestation caused primarily by forest fires while the ecological impacts of these plantations are somewhat understood hayes and samad 1998 little to no work has been done on their impacts on hydrological processes and water availability in this comparative study we examined the differences in rainfall interception between native secondary deciduous tropical forests and exotic pine forest the specific objectives of this study were to 1 examine the major controls on canopy interception between both forests 2 characterize the canopy interception over space and time between both forests 3 quantify and examine the understory and forest litter interception dynamics between the two forest types 4 examine how pine forest reforestation influence the water available for other hydrological processes 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study was conducted from january 2018 to november 2018 in the st anns valley of trinidad and tobago 10 41 45 3 n 61 29 23 0 w fig 1 the climate is tropical monsoon köppen geiger am with a distinct wet and dry season the average annual precipitation is 2077 mm year of which 79 falls between june and december the native forest and exotic pine forest both have an usda soil order of ultisols and both areas have a sandy loam soil texture pinus oocarpa was the dominant tree species in the exotic pine forest and was planted prior to 1990 trees were planted approximately six to seven meters apart and most had suffered burns from a forest fire the previous year the understory within the pine forest consisted primarily of cecropia peltate pteridium arachnoideum hyptis pectinate myrcia sp and genipa americana with heights less than three meters the adjacent native secondary deciduous forest contained many large emergent trees such as spondias sp and cecropis sp and the major canopy trees were identified as theobroma cacao and coffea cf arabica the native forest floor was sparse with very few shrubs or ferns scattered throughout fig 2 an area of 1000 m2 was selected within each forest where the tree cover and terrain are representative of the whole forest in both forests the 1000 m2 study area was broken into two plots each differing in size due to the steepness of the terrain the plots had the following dimensions exotic pine plot 1 was 15 m 30 m 450 m2 and exotic pine plot 2 was 22 m 25 m 550 m2 native forest plot 1 was 10 m 25 m 250 m2 and native forest plot 2 was 25 m 30 m 750 m2 2 2 rainfall measurements rainfall data was collected at 10 minute intervals using a hobo data logging rain gauge situated in a cleared area located 800 m away from the pine plot and 100 m away from the native forest plot the depth mm intensity mm h and duration h were calculated for individual storm events during the study period these values were then used to estimate the weekly depth mm and the average weekly intensity and duration of the rainfall events a criterion was developed to determine individual rainfall events based on the length of time between events similar to that given by rasheed et al 2019 rainfall events were considered separate after two hours of no rainfall activity an exception to this was given to intense dry season conditions with cumulative weekly rainfall below 5 mm as to account for the smaller isolated events that occur during the dry season weeks with a total rainfall amount lower than 1 mm were excluded from characteristics data set due to the possibly of tipping caused by condensation or animal interactions 2 3 throughfall and canopy interception throughfall was collected weekly from january to november 2018 using 165 cm2 funnel collectors which can hold a maximum of 2500 mm of throughfall before overflowing all collectors were fitted with small styrofoam balls in the funnel to limit water loss by evaporation and reduce clogging by falling plant material each forest contained 22 roving collectors that were randomly distributed within both plots and relocated every two weeks to a new location two to six meters away from the original location the collectors were placed in areas cleared of short understory vegetation ferns and at least two meters away from taller understory vegetation this roving method accounts for variability in the canopy and eliminates bias in the data lloyd et al 1988 thimonier 1998 understorey throughfall was collected only in the pine forest due the thickness of its forest floor vegetation ten additional roving collectors were randomly placed below the understory plants and were relocated every two weeks ten stationary collectors were randomly placed within each forest and remained in the same location for the duration of the project canopy interception was determined by subtracting the mean throughfall of all the collectors stationary and roving from the rainfall depth similarly understory interception was determined by subtracting the mean canopy throughfall by the mean understory throughfall 2 4 stem flow due to design material and installation challenges stemflow was only collected from august to november 2018 weekly the pine forest was fitted with seven collectors while the native forest contained eight collectors the trees in the pine plantation were selected based on the various size classes found in the native forest the collectors were placed on the major tree species of the forest whereby two to three of each of the species were selected to ensure a non biased sample three spondias sp with dbh ranging from 14 cm to 68 cm three cecropis sp ranging from 21 cm to 39 cm one theobroma cacao multiple trunks at breast height and one unidentified tree species silicone was used to firmly secure the tubes to the tress at breast height in the form of two loops around the trees the tubing was then attached to multiple 15 l buckets for water storage the relative stemflow for the entire plot being measured was determined using the following formula thimonier 1998 t o t a l v o l u m e i n t h e p l o t m i l l i m e t e r totalstemflowofntrees l i t e r plotarea h e c t a r e totalbasalareaofalltreesintheplot totalbasalareaofthentrees 10 4 2 5 leaf litter interception leaf litter interception was collected from june to november 2018 on a weekly basis each forest contained 15 collectors of the same dimensions as the throughfall collectors covered with a wire mesh with 0 64 cm spaces the wire mesh was cut into 18 cm 18 cm squares to fully cover the collectors the collectors were randomly placed throughout each forest in areas of varying litter thickness to account for the variations in the environment and differences in tree species for the native forest the wire mesh was carefully slid under the leaf litter with the assistance of a thin metal ruler in order to maintain the composition and orientation of the litter the litter comprised of semi decomposed litter and the recently fallen undecomposed litter from the end of the dry season the mesh was then placed on the collector which was then inserted in the same location where the litter was collected some leaves collected in the native forests were carefully trimmed to fit the dimensions of the collectors as they were excessively larger than the collectors 2 6 vegetation characteristics the diameter at breast height dbh needed to calculate the basal area was measured at 1 3 m above the ground level and on the uphill side of each tree the basal area of the stand was determined using the following equation b a s a l a r e a meter 2 0 00007854 diameteratbreastheight 2 bettinger et al 2017 the vegetation cover fractions the ratio of surface covered by green vegetation were determined through photos of the canopy directly above each stationary throughfall collector using a nikon 3300 camera and processed using the can eye software weiss and baret 2017 to examine seasonal and monthly changes in vegetation cover fraction ten photos of the forest canopy were taken in each plot at the start of each month the photos were taken at the same location as the ten stationary collectors within each plot additional photos were taken throughout each plot in a grid fashion every six to seven meters to be used as supplementary images if needed photos were taken under the same degree of camera zoom angle and under similar cloud cover to ensure similar comparative processing of images within the can eye software weiss and baret 2017 2 7 statistical analysis the monthly vegetation cover of the native forest and pine forest were compared using t test statistics to determine the significant differences between them the spss statistical package ibm spss statistics for windows version 24 0 armonk ny inm corp was used to conduct the test 3 results 3 1 vegetation and hydrometeorological characteristics the pine forests had a dbh that ranged from 16 to 66 cm with an average of 34 cm the average basal area within the pine forest was 0 10 0 05 m2 the native secondary forest had an average basal area of 0 13 0 09 m2 while the average dbh was 37 cm and ranged from 14 cm to 68 cm the annual mean vegetation cover fraction in the native forest was 97 and monthly means ranged from 95 to 98 the annual mean vegetation cover fraction in the pine forest was 62 with monthly means from 56 to 66 overall there was a statistically significant difference p 0 05 in the vegetation cover between the pine and natural forest a total of 1314 mm of rainfall was recorded between january and december 2018 the dry season january may accumulated a sum of 380 mm of rainfall which was 29 of the annual rainfall the wet season june december rainfall total was 934 mm which was 71 of annual rainfall in the dry season the mean weekly rainfall was 21 8 17 mm and ranged from 1 6 mm to 59 6 mm table 1 the wet season rainfall ranged from 3 6 mm to 144 mm with a mean weekly rainfall of 59 4 39 mm the depth of rainfall per event in the wet season was a little over twofold that of the dry season the mean duration of rainfall events in the wet season was 1 60 h versus 1 15 h in the dry season while the mean rainfall intensity within the wet season was 4 6 2 5 mm h compared to 3 2 1 4 mm h in the dry season 3 2 rainfall canopy interception relationships in the native forest weekly throughfall ranged from 0 5 to 85 3 mm 30 to 96 of rainfall and showed a statistically significant linear relationship with total weekly rainfall r 2 0 96 p 0 0001 fig 3 a the pine forests showed a similar range of throughfall values of 0 5 to 81 7 mm 28 to 95 of rainfall and a statistically significant linear relationship with total weekly rainfall r 2 0 96 p 0 0001 fig 3b the relationship between interception and gross rainfall were significant in the native r 2 0 49 p 0 0001 and pine forest r 2 0 53 p 0 0001 based on the regression analysis between interception mm and gross rainfall mm a rainfall storage threshold of 2 6 mm and 4 3 mm was estimated for throughfall to occur in the native forest and pine forest respectively fig 3c d the percentage canopy interception by the native forest ranged from 4 to 70 and shows a strong negative relationship with rainfall depth r 2 0 54 fig 4 a the pine forest presented similar results with interception ranging from 5 to 72 and a similar negative relationship with rainfall depth r 2 0 48 fig 4b to better explain the relationship between rainfall and interception the rainfall events were categorised as i low intensity low duration ii low intensity high duration iii high intensity low duration and iv high intensity high duration and then plotted against the interception fig 4d e intensity and duration were divided into high and low categories based on the median value low average weekly rainfall intensities ranged from 1 2 to 3 4 mm h and high intensity events were 3 4 mm h low average weekly rainfall duration ranged from 0 22 to 1 45 hrs and high duration events were 1 47 hrs for both forests the highest interception values were observed during low intensity low duration events this was more evident in the pine forests where higher interception rates were recorded for such events however once these low intensity low duration events had rainfall depths above the storage threshold interception was greatly reduced fig 4d e the low intensity high duration and high intensity low duration events generally occupied the middle range of 20 to 60 canopy interception rates for weekly rainfall depths of 10 to 50 mm fig 4d e it is important to note that in the native forest a greater number of these event types four experienced interception rates 20 than in the pine forest three events although high intensity high duration events typically produced lower canopy interception rates interception rates were high for a few of these events particularly in the native forest 3 3 temporal and spatial variations in canopy interception throughfall values varied temporally seasonally and spatially in both forests during the dry season throughfall accounted for 66 of the gross rainfall in the native forest with a mean weekly throughfall of 14 0 12 7 mm and 62 of the gross rainfall in the pine forest with a mean weekly throughfall of 13 1 12 4 mm throughfall rates in the wet season were substantially higher than in the dry season in the native forest throughfall was 80 of gross rainfall with mean weekly values of 41 4 28 4 mm while throughfall was 74 of rainfall with mean weekly values of 38 6 28 9 mm in the pine forest to assess the spatial variability of throughfall in both forests the coefficient of variation cv was determined using the throughfall data from stationary and roving collectors when examined across the entire study period the mean cv in the native forest was 46 with weekly values from 27 to 98 this was higher than the pine forest which had a mean cv of 18 3 and weekly values of 8 to 56 fig 5 in the pine forest the largest cv was associated with smaller weekly rainfall 9mm averaging 29 while totals 19 mm remained relatively consistent 14 4 the largest cv in the natural forest was also associated with weekly rainfall of 9 mm with a mean of 70 however larger weekly rainfall totals of 50 mm were required to produce a relatively consistent cv 37 6 7 3 4 rainfall understory and litter interception relationships throughfall in the pine understory ranged from 0 1 to 51 3 mm 5 to 62 of rainfall and 13 to 82 of pine canopy throughfall and showed a statistically significant linear relationship with pine canopy throughfall r 2 0 96 p 0 0001 fig 6 a when pine understory interception is plotted against pine canopy throughfall the linear relationship remained statistically significant r 2 0 93 p 0 0001 fig 6b the understory storage threshold obtained through the regression analysis with pine understory throughfall and pine canopy throughfall and understory interception and pine canopy throughfall was estimated at 0 57 0 43 mm fig 6a b pine understory throughfall was highly spatially variable with a mean annual cv of 50 and a maximum cv of 162 the percentage of rainfall intercepted at the understory level of the pine forest ranged from 38 to 95 and had a similar relationship with rainfall r 2 0 53 fig 4c like both forest canopies when assessed using the same intensity duration characteristics as the forest canopy the low intensity low duration events generally produced the highest interception rates in the understory with 70 rainfall interception for such events fig 4f all other event characteristics showed no discernible trends fig 4f throughfall in the litter layer of the native forest ranged from 0 2 to 80 7 mm 0 7 to 94 6 of native forest canopy throughfall and showed a positive linear relationship with native forest canopy throughfall r 2 0 43 p 0 0001 fig 7 a throughfall in the pine forest litter ranged from 0 2 to 37 5 mm 10 8 to 52 2 of pine canopy throughfall and had a stronger statistically significant relationship with pine canopy throughfall r 2 0 97 p 0 0001 fig 7b it should be noted that the absence of a rim around the throughfall could allow any horizontally traveling water to spill outside the collector especially along with the sloped areas where the collectors were installed zhao et al 2019 this may result in the overestimation of litter layer interception 3 5 annual interception in exotic pine versus native forests in assessing the impact of pine forest plantations on the annual interception and water availability overflowing throughfall collectors and associated rainfall were removed from the analysis the total rainfall was 1314 mm fig 8 a throughfall collected in the native forest totalled 997 mm resulting in a canopy interception of 24 while 930 mm of throughfall was measured in the exotic pine forest equating to 29 canopy rainfall interception table 2 fig 8a the 5 difference in interception between the forest canopies resulted in the pine forests intercepting 67 mm more rainfall throughfall at the understory level of the pine forest was 551 mm this accounted for an additional 29 of incoming rainfall being intercepted by the understory increasing the total vegetative interception in the pine forest to 58 763 mm stemflow in the native forest accounted for 0 03 to 0 2 of rainfall while in the exotic pine forest stemflow accounted for 0 07 to 2 2 of rainfall stemflow was only collected during the second half of the wet season due to installation issues however a conservative estimation of the annual stemflow was made assuming the mean values of 0 1 and 0 8 in the native and the pine forest respectively can be used throughout the year application of these rates to the annual rainfall of 1314 mm year produces annual stemflow values of 1 3 mm year and 10 5 mm year in the native and pine forests respectively during the leaf litter measurement period 906 mm of rainfall was recorded fig 8b litter layer throughfall in the native forest was 343 mm 62 rainfall interception and was 294 mm 68 rainfall interception in the pine forest 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall interception in native forests and exotic pine forest canopies the strong positive linear relationship between throughfall and rainfall observed in this study at a weekly time interval aligns with observations in other forests huber and iroumé 2001 sun et al 2018 a 1 7 mm difference in the canopy storage capacity was recorded for the native 2 6 mm and exotic pine 4 3 mm forests these observations support the work of klamerus iwan et al 2020 which recorded higher storage capacities and associated interception rates in pine forests fan et al 2014 this is often attributed to differences in leaf structure crown structure and stem densities between broadleaf and pine forests ghimire et al 2012 levia et al 2011 ilek et al 2017 van stan et al 2016 we did not directly measure stem density however the vegetation cover fraction in the pine forest was lower than in the native forest indicating that stem density does not explain the higher storage and interception in the pine since the climate would be similar in both stands due to their close proximity the higher interception is therefore ascribed to the pine needle leaf structure pine needle clusters hold intercepted rainfall more securely than vertically aligned broad leaves sun et al 2018 thereby increasing the storage capacity and interception in pine canopies in this study we explored the use of weekly rather than daily measurements of throughfall to assess the canopy storage thresholds in forest canopies this approach was used due to limited financial and instrument resources as thresholds observed in our study were similar to those recorded for other broadleaf and pine forests which range from 0 2 to 4 7 mm klamerus iwan et al 2020 llorens and gallart 2000 it suggests that if sampled over an extended time i e more than one year weekly throughfall samples may give a strong indication of canopy threshold dynamics to fully test this hypothesis we recommend that further work be done to examine weekly versus daily measurements in assessing interception thresholds interception as a percentage of rainfall is influenced by rainfall depth van stan et al 2016 while we observed this for both forest types the regression analysis indicated that the relationship was not very strong this suggests that additional rainfall characteristics e g intensity and duration play an important role in the interception process macinnis ng et al 2012 van stan and friesen 2020 to assess this we categorised rainfall events by intensity duration characteristics and examined interception rates the high interception for low intensity low duration events is attributed to these events having rainfall depths below the storage threshold klamerus iwan et al 2020 while higher intensity or duration events had a lower interception the rates were quite variable making interpretation challenging fig 4d f this is likely a result of using weekly values and not individual events the high cv and large variation in throughfall in the native forest is within the range reported for other tropical forests huber and iroumé 2001 macinnis ng et al 2012 zimmermann et al 2008 2007 this has been attributed to high heterogeneity high epiphytic load and broadleaf morphologies which generate variable drip points increasing throughfall spatial variability andré et al 2011 germer et al 2006 wullaert et al 2009 the throughfall variability in our pine forests is one of the first recorded for pine forests in the tropics the low variability observed in the pine is similar to the reports of other studies conducted in native and planted pine forests fan et al 2015 kowalska et al 2016 the pine forest sites are typically monocultures with no epiphytes which produce more stable spatial throughfall distribution huber and iroumé 2001 kowalska et al 2016 additionally the uniform establishment of our pine forest must also be considered the forest being established through reforestation efforts has trees of the same age size and spacing further promoting the low spatial variability 4 2 understory and litter layer interception research on the interception dynamics of understory vegetation is an emerging area where little currently understood klamerus iwan et al 2020 our current study shows that like the tree canopy throughfall in the understory is strongly impacted by precipitation characteristics particularly rainfall depth however precipitation intensity and duration had little impact on understory interception the influence of rainfall intensity and duration may be buffered by the canopy as it acts as a barrier reducing the intensity and slowing water penetration to the forest floor thereby making tree canopy throughfall a more important factor when assessing understory interception dynamics gerrits and savenije 2011 this is observed in our current study as the depth of throughfall from the pine canopy had a stronger influence on understory throughfall our estimated understory storage threshold range of 0 57 0 43 mm was lower than the 1 3 mm recorded by gordon et al 2020 for dogfennel in the lab our values likely reflect differences in methodologies the 1 3 mm by gordon et al 2020 uses the mass change of dried and wet vegetation this represents the maximum storage of both leaves 0 9 mm and stems 0 43 mm and may overestimate the storage when compared to field based assessments which may not estimate the maximum storage of both leaves and stems the understory vegetation structure and characteristics may also have a strong influence on the storage capacities unlike gordon et al 2020 who focused on a single herbaceous species our site contained a mix of herbaceous and woody understory species the high pine understory throughfall cv 50 but low pine canopy throughfall cv 18 suggests that the understory throughfall is influenced by characteristics the of heterogenous understory layer this may also explain the lower recorded understory capacities at our site which are more reflective of a diverse understory canopy and not a single species throughfall has been shown to have a stronger influence on the interception dynamics of the litter reservoir than precipitation bulcock and jewitt 2012a gerrits and savenije 2011 tsiko et al 2012 our study supports these observations as we recorded a stronger relationship between canopy throughfall and litter throughfall than precipitation and litter throughfall in both forests this further highlights the importance of using canopy throughfall characteristics and not precipitation when examining the litter reservoir litter throughfall in the native forest had a substantially weaker relationship with canopy throughfall and was more variable than in the pine forests this can be viewed as a product of the spatial variability of canopy throughfall throughfall patterns can affect litter storage as canopy heterogeneity can produce either more or less localised drainage patterns gerrits and savenije 2011 klamerus iwan et al 2020 the native forest had high canopy throughfall spatial variability with distinctive dripping points and dry points when paired with the higher diversity of litter in terms of type size and rate of deposition a more dynamic process is created leading to greater variability in the litter throughfall as the pine trees were artificially planted the spacing and age among trees is approximately the same while the litter layer was quite homogenous primarily pine needles this homogeneity likely led to the lower variability and stronger relationship between canopy and litter layer throughfall in the pine forests 4 3 the impact of non native pine forests on water availability our results indicate that over a one year period the exotic pine forest can intercept 30 more of the incoming precipitation than the native forest table 2 and leads to a substantial reduction in water reaching the forest floor this higher interception rate occurs at all forests levels canopy understory and litter layer comparative studies on the impacts of exotic pine forests on rainfall interception especially in the tropics are not well examined in locations where information exists exotic pine forests have either higher fan et al 2014 or lower ghimire et al 2012 canopy interception rates than the native forests our study falls into the former category and as mentioned earlier is likely due to the leaf structural differences between both forests this study highlights the importance of characterising the understory interception in forested environments our work shows that the exotic pine understory intercepts 29 of precipitation which is the same as gordon et al 2020 but substantially higher than the 3 8 recorded by jiang et al 2019 the high value in our understory is reflective of the extensive and dense understory layer which covered the entirety of the pine forest the annual leaf litter interception in the exotic pine forest was greater than in the native forests this difference was not static as the native forests intercepted more rainfall from june august however by september weekly interception in the pine litter was greater and by november total interception in pine litter surpassed the native forest fig 8b the difference in litter interception from june august can be attributed to litter layer thickness and composition when litter thickness is the same broadleaf litter has a greater storage capacity than needles gerrits and savenije 2011 klamerus iwan et al 2020 due to differences in leaf area macropore size and contact angle li and niu jianzhi 2013 by september substantial amounts of decomposition were observed in the native forest litter with some collectors having no litter on the screen this reduced the overall thickness of the litter layer in the native forest and led to a sharp decrease in the interception the pine litter experienced little decomposition during this time and maintained a relatively thick litter layer allowing consistent interception during this period while our litter interception results are useful for comparing the relative difference between our forest stands the use of the values to compare to other global sites should be done with caution annual leaf litter interception typically ranges from 1 to 34 bulcock and jewitt 2012a dunkerley 2015 helvey 1964 zhao et al 2019 our values of 62 68 far exceed these and may be due to instrument errors and overestimations due to evaporation bulcock and jewitt 2012a and horizontal flow over the litter and spillage outside the collector zhao et al 2019 5 conclusion exotic pine forests can substantially impact the hydrology of tropical systems through changes to interception pine forests intercepted 58 of the incoming annual precipitation compared to 24 in the native forest the understory vegetation in the pine forest was the primary driver for the increased interception holding 29 of the annual precipitation and it is highly recommended that when present understory interception be measured these changes to interception have substantial implications for soil water storage and subsequently runoff and streamflow generation and groundwater recharge despite the higher interception rates in the pine forest rainfall characteristics were major controls on interception for both forest types while rainfall characteristics had a strong influence on both understory and litter throughfall our study indicated that canopy throughfall has a greater effect on understory and litter interception however the use of weekly not event based data to examine understory and litter processes is a limitation of this study one that future work can overcome using an automated gauge network or simulated rainfall credit authorship contribution

3437,identifying and mapping of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems pgdes are pivotal to well understanding of the interaction between groundwater and ecosystem as well as rational allocation of regional water resources as the largest tributary of the yellow river with complex landscape types the weihe river basin is an essential region for both water and sediment management in the yellow river basin however either the distribution of pgdes or the role of groundwater in ecosystems of the weihe river basin has been largely unexplored in this study focused on the weihe river basin the framework for identifying and mapping of pgdes was suggested to perform hierarchical grade based on the coupling of ndvi classification method and groundwater dependent ecosystem mapping gem method moreover the identification and mapping of pgdes were validated based on statistical analyses among normalized difference vegetation index ndvi water table depth wtd previous month s precipitation ppm evapotranspiration et and precipitation p the spatial patterns of pgdes obtained from mapping are generally consistent with those from validation and the differences of pgdes in the weihe river distributed largely the pgdes group of likely and very likely accounted for 22 5 of the basin and mainly distributed in ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains and huanglong mountains and the neutral group was scattered in the loess area of the northwestern basin accounting for 13 the finding of this study promotes the development of the gdes identification and provides references for water and ecosystem regulation and protection of the weihe river basin as well as other similar basins keywords potential groundwater dependent ecosystems remote sensing gem method statistical analysis the weihe river basin 1 introduction water controlled ecosystems have been the primary focus of the relatively new field of ecohydrology in that vegetation growth is driven by water transpiration loheide and gorelick 2007 groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes are a particular type of water controlled ecosystems which comprise groundwater biocenoses and the surrounding environment characterized by intermittent or long term dependence on groundwater to maintain their ecological structures and functions boulton and hancock 2006 griebler et al 2019 gdes offer a range of ecological services such as soil formation soil preservation water purification pollutant reduction as well as regulation of water flow murray et al 2006 gdes are located in the marine in stream terrestrial and aquifer environments including aquatic hyporheic and riparian habitats wetlands and springs estuarine and nearshore marine ecosystems eamus et al 2006 kløve et al 2011 as an indispensable part of gdes groundwater resources are threatened by global scale depletion han et al 2015 in addition climate change and human activity exacerbate the depletion by reducing precipitation and changing underlying surface and watercourse both of which will decrease recharge and increase the utilization of groundwater kløve et al 2014 affected by the shortage of groundwater vegetation growth is also inhibited especially in the vegetation ecosystem dependent on groundwater in arid period johansen et al 2018 koirala et al 2017 yang et al 2019 thus a better understanding of the interaction of eco hydrological processes in gdes is warranted which improves the scientific basis for restoration and management of vegetation ecosystems vegetation in gdes plays a vital role in regulating surface water and groundwater in a dry climate since its primary source of water is groundwater kløve et al 2011 groundwater supports vegetation growth by affecting vegetation roots oxygen water and nutrient absorption chui et al 2011 therefore groundwater depth drought flood events and salt concentration are the key factors controlling the growth of the arbor and shrub in the arid catchments huang et al 2013 in turn changes in vegetation type and coverage can also affect groundwater recharge and even cause groundwater drought by changing water cycle processes such as interception and transpiration anurag et al 2021 han et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 this strong interaction of eco hydrological processes for gdes reveals indispensable feedbacks between vegetation and groundwater chui et al 2011 although regional ecology and water conservation are inextricably linked to the study of gdes due to the hidden nature of groundwater sun 2013 information about gdes on a large scale is still lacking it s necessary to identify and delineate the potential gdes pgdes before clarifying the interaction mechanisms between vegetation and groundwater orellana et al 2012 although the scope of gdes can be achieved through ecosystem fieldwork pérez hoyos et al 2016 large scale fieldwork and mapping require a great deal of time manpower and material furthermore empirical extrapolation was applied to expand known gdes areas to regional scales doody et al 2017 however such an approach cannot be applied to regions without gdes research the multicriteria approximation based on assigning weights to multiple geographic parameters through experts survey and verifying results through fieldwork can analyze the continuous spatio temporal changes of gdes at an annual scale via various elements but its stronger subjective may lead to controversial weights of some parameters duran llacer et al 2022 therefore given the complicated interaction mechanism between vegetation and groundwater gdes identification and mapping based on remote sensing data is necessary and feasible for studying gdes in regions with a complex topography and limited groundwater information gdes identification methods based on remote sensing include supervised classification martínez santos et al 2021 unsupervised classification e g groundwater dependent ecosystem mapping gem barron et al 2014 and index classification e g gde index gou et al 2015 and standardized ndvi classification gou et al 2015 liu et al 2021 páscoa et al 2020 for single supervised or unsupervised classification the area where vegetation may use groundwater can be only selected but the degree of likelihood of its existence is unclear and the index classification method only takes into account a certain vegetation index often ignoring the influence of other factors such as moisture the above methods all present certain limitations which ignore the universality of the application processes therefore a comprehensive gdes identification approach is warranted herein we coupled the gem method and a vegetation index classification method to extend the pgdes identification and mapping framework and the weihe river basin was used as the study area the weihe river is the largest tributary of the yellow river and a significant component of the loess plateau the study of gdes in the weihe river basin is beneficial to the high quality development of the yellow river basin it plays an essential role in the ecological conservation of the loess plateau the purpose of this manuscript is to 1 extend the framework of pgdes identification based on remote sensing data 2 delineate the preliminary scope of pgdes in the weihe river basin 3 group the likelihood of pgdes 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the weihe

monitoring data of twenty phreatic wells were selected and the kriging spatial interpolation method was used to describe the approximate spatial trend of groundwater 2 3 methods 2 3 1 pgdes indentification the identification of pgdes is mainly divided into three steps fig 2 1 selection of wetlands and natural vegetation areas and calculation of aridity index ai to select dry periods 2 the delineation of the preliminary scope using the gem method 3 the grouping of the likelihood of pgdes within the preliminary scope 4 validation of pgdes identification and mapping first we determine the dry period by the aridity index spinoni et al 2015 calculated by eq 1 1 ai i 1 n p i pet i n where p i is average annual precipitation of the i th pixel pet i is the average annual potential evapotranspiration of the i th pixel the classification criteria of ai include arid 0 ai 0 5 mid 0 5 ai 0 75 and humid 0 75 ai 0 5 is used as the threshold value for the dry and wet seasons in this paper the gem method consists of unsupervised classification to obtain natural clusters and natural cluster centroids analysis to obtain reclassified land cover class initial natural clusters of rasters within natural vegetation were performed by unsupervised classification isodata from four dimensional vectors of ndvi and ndwi at the end of the wet and dry seasons five land cover reclassification criteria were combined to reclassify the identified initial natural clusters centroids and rlc1 rlc2 and rlc5 were used as the preliminary scope of pgdes the criteria for reclassification of land cover types are shown below ndvi townshend et al 1987 and ndwi mcfeeters 1996 are calculated as follows 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red n d w i ρ green ρ nir ρ green ρ nir where ρ nir ρ red and ρ green are near infrared band infrared band and green light band respectively the criteria for reclassification of land cover types are shown below a reclassified land cover class 1 rlc1 areas where vegetation can always be supported by groundwater to maintain high greenness and wetness even after a prolonged drought barron et al 2014 therefore areas with almost invariable ndvi and ndwi at the end of the wet and dry seasons were determined as pgdes b reclassified land cover class 2 rlc2 areas where vegetation can always be supported by groundwater and show some level of greenness increase and wetness reduction after a prolonged drought barron et al 2014 therefore areas with almost increased ndvi and decreased ndwi at the end of the wet and dry seasons were determined as pgdes c reclassified land cover class 3 rlc3 after a prolonged drought the areas where the ndvi and ndwi had significantly decreased or the area where the ndvi decreased with increased ndwi were considered to be non pgdes d reclassified land cover class 4 rlc4 areas where the ndvi is less than 0 35 at the end of wet or dry seasons barron et al 2014 sobrino et al 2006 sobrino and raissouni 2010 we believe that the vegetation in these areas is dry or non existent therefore rlc4 was considered as non pgdes e reclassified land cover class 5 rlc5 areas where the ndwi increase renders it impossible to determine whether the growth of vegetation depends on groundwater were determined as uncertain class finally the preliminary scope of pgdes was graded using ndvi classification method gou et al 2015 the first criterion is that vegetation remains green and active in the dry season eamus et al 2015 in other words the greater the ndvi at the end of the dry season in a dry year the greater the likelihood of pgdes in the region the second and third criteria are that areas would be more likely to be supported by groundwater if they re characterized by limited inter annual and seasonal variation in vegetation respectively eamus et al 2006 liu et al 2021 the monthly ndvi values for june 2011 were selected to calculate criterion 1 the ndvi sd of july from 2004 to 2016 and the dry period from 2010 to 2011 were used to calculate criteria 2 and 3 the inter annual and seasonal variation of vegetation were expressed using the standard deviation of ndvi which was calculated from eq 3 3 sd 1 n t 1 n ndvi t i ndvi mean i 2 where n is the number of images i is the i th image pixel n d v i t i is the ndvi value of the i th pixel at time t n d v i mean i is the mean ndvi value of the ith pixel for the n images the k means clustering method was used to group the raster for each criterion where the ndvi values in criterion 1 were ranked from lowest to highest while ndvi sd in criteria 2 and 3 was ranked from highest to lowest the raster calculator was used to add up the group values of the data layers of the three criteria and the resulting group values were between 3 and 15 we further divided these values into five pgdes likelihood groups as the final results very likely 12 to 15 likely 10 to 11 neutral 8 to 9 unlikely 6 to 7 and very unlikely 3 to 5 to reduce the error of wetland identified results we classified the rlc1 and rlc2 wetland as very likely and the rest as unlikely without regrouping 2 3 2 validation and statistical analysis to verify the accuracy of the identified results of pgdes we studied the spatial synergy between ndvi and wtd the correlation between ndvi and the previous month s precipitation ppm and the difference between evaporation et and precipitation p bivariate spatial autocorrelation was employed to explore the spatial relationships between ndvi and wtd zheng et al 2020 the local lisa maps in this method show the spatial dependency features of two variables where the spatial aggregation types of the regions with significant correlation include high high high low low low and low high the relevant formula is shown as follows 4 m o r a n s i xy α a x α a x σ x β 1 n p α β a y β a y σ y where m o r a n s i ij α is the global spatial bivariate autocorrelation index a x α and a y β are the values of the attributes x and y of the spatial unit a and σ are the mean and variance respectively p α β is the spatial weight matrix in addition considering the lag between p and vegetation response lamchin et al 2018 and the positive correlation between ndvi and p in the non gdes area liu et al 2021 we performed a correlation analysis between ndvi and ppm the less positive or negative correlation between ndvi and ppm in a region the more likely the presence of gdes furthermore the difference between et and p indicates the moisture gap between et and p eamus et al 2016 liu et al 2021 a more significant difference indicates that the region has high evaporation and low precipitation and the vegetation is more likely to gain water from groundwater according to the water balance method steinwand et al 2006 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics of ndvi and ndwi the spatial distribution of the multi year average and annual change rate of ndvi and ndwi in the weihe river basin from 2004 to 2016 are shown in fig 3 for ndvi the multi year average ranged from 0 09 to 0 79 fig 3a and the annual change rate from 0 023 to 0 048 fig 3c similar to the spatial distribution of forests the area with a relatively high value of multi year average mainly concentrated in ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains and guanshan mountains due to weak human disturbance primitive natural environment and better protection policy in the qinling mountains and ziwuling mountains ndvi is relatively high while areas with relatively high ndvi values showed an opposite trend compared to the annual change rate of ndvi in addition the relatively low value of the multi year average occurred in guanzhong plain and loess hilly and gully region which is similar to the distribution of annual change rate downstream of beiluo river jinghe river and upstream of weihe river had relatively high annual values of change rate and the medium multi year average of ndvi the multi year average and annual change rate for ndwi ranged from 0 70 to 0 26 fig 3b and 0 029 to 0 026 fig 3d respectively the multi year average had relatively low values in the ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains and guanshan mountains which was opposite to the spatial distribution of ndvi the relatively high values of multi year average mainly occurred in the weihe river and its tributaries the loess hilly as well as the loess hilly and gully in addition the value of ndwi also showed a more significant decreasing trend in the south central mountains fig 3d minimum negative and even positive values of annual change rate were found in loess hilly and gully region guanzhong plain and southeast of liupan mountains overall the value of ndwi showed a decreasing trend throughout the basin except for the guanzhong urban agglomeration 3 2 analysis of the identification process and results of pgdes 3 2 1 analysis of aridity index the first step in pgdes identification is to select the wet season s end and the dry season s end in the drier years so we calculated the ai from 2004 to 2016 as shown in fig 4 c the ai of the basin ranged from 0 01 to 1 87 during the study period a distinct dry season was identified from early fall to early summer of the following year most of the wet season ends in september and enters the dry season from october while the end of the dry season is in june almost every year the trend of monthly average on temperature fig 4a and wtd fig 4b is similar to ai hence considering the temperature limitation of photosynthesis the universality of the end month of the wet season and the annual distribution of wtd september and june were selected as the beginning and the end of the wet season respectively in addition combining the characteristics of dry season integrity we separated the study period into six sub time periods 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2015 2016 3 2 2 preliminary delineation of pgdes the results of the isodata classification presented in fig 5 showed scatterplots of the centroids for all clusters with fives colors representing five reclassified land cover classes during the initial identification of pgdes the identified natural clusters ranged from 13 to 18 during the study period the most significant number of natural clusters 18 was in 2006 indicating sizeable spatial variability of ndvi and ndwi in that year based on the reclassified criterion of the gem method we further classified the natural clusters of each year to obtain reclassified land cover types each year the number of rlc types is the same with four classes there is no rlc5 in 2015 except for years without rlc3 fig 6 illustrates the spatio temporal distribution of 5 reclassified land cover classes the spatially distributed rlc1 and rlc2 mainly include the ziwuling mountains huanglong mountains qinling mountains and liupan mountains which were the main areas of land cover type change in addition rlc3 and rlc4 were mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest of loess hills and gullies respectively the reclassification results showed that rlc5 existed in the previous five periods which indicated decreasing trend of ndwi rlc5 with uncertainty was mainly distributed in the loess hilly and gully region in the north of the basin but rarely found in the region with obvious land cover change the preliminary delineation of pgdes was obtained by the union of reclassified results of 2015 2016 with other periods the preliminary scope for pgdes occupied 40 4 of the whole area mostly grasslands and forests 3 2 3 grouping and mapping of the likelihood of pgdes as fig 7 shows the relatively high percentage of the total areas was in group 3 neutral and 4 likely accounting for 13 and 17 respectively followed by group 2 unlikely and 5 very likely accounting for 5 and 5 5 meanwhile the group values revealed a distribution pattern of high in the south and low in the north the areas with a relatively high likelihood of pgdes were found in the mountainous region such as the ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains guanshan mountains and huanglong mountains which mainly included very likely and likely fig 7b these areas are dominated by terrestrial vegetation ecosystems whose survival and evolution in a water scarce environment depends on direct water uptake from the phreatic water or capillary zone eamus and froend 2006 in addition pgdes of relatively high likelihood were also present in part of the riparian area of some rivers such as the mainstream of the weihe river fig 7d the areas with pgdes of relatively low likelihood are mainly located in the loess hills and gullies in the northwest of the basin where the groups of neutral likely and unlikely are scattered fig 7a the group of very likely in permanent wetlands occupied about 51 of the wetland area and were mainly distributed in the shitouhe river and heihe river on the south of the weihe river and the qishuihe river and qianhe river on the north of the weihe river fig 7c 3 3 validation of pgdes mapping first we analyzed bivariate spatial autocorrelation between ndvi and wtd and obtained the lisa cluster map of moran s i and significance map as shown in fig 8 thirteen percent of the spatial autocorrelation of ndvi and wtd passed the significance test at the 0 001 level followed by 32 2 and 27 3 of the areas passing the significance test at the 0 01 and 0 05 levels respectively fig 8a for the region that passed the significance test the global moran s i is 0 228 indicating that ndvi and wtd in most areas show a weak negative correlation fig 8c the spatial distribution of the correlation degree tends to be consistent with the spatial distribution of pgdes and the areas with stronger correlation are mainly located in the southeast of the ziwuling mountains the south of the huanglong mountains and most of the qinling mountains fig 8a the areas with weaker correlation are mainly distributed in the loess hills and gullies in the north of the weihe river basin however the distribution of spatial autocorrelation significance between ndvi and wtd was more uniform than the pgdes likelihood in the loess hills overall the high significance of spatial autocorrelation between ndvi and wtd occurred in areas with smaller wtd especially in the south and southwest of the basin fig 8b showed the spatial clustering characteristics of wtd and ndvi the areas with high high characteristics are distributed in the loess hills and gullies low low in the loess hills in the northwest of the basin low high in the qinling and liupan mountains and high low in the ziwuling mountains and parts of the huanglong mountains then the correlations between the ndvi and the ppm for the year with the highest ai 2011 during the study period are shown in fig 9 a significant negative correlation between ndvi and ppm was found in the areas along rivers such as the weihe river indicating that precipitation decreased with the increase of vegetation coverage fig 9a except for the riverside the correlation in the pgdes was increasing from southeast to northwest with the lowest correlation of the liupan mountains and the huanglong mountains the positive correlation was most significant in the loess hills while the median and the average of the correlations gradually decreased from unlikely to very likely fig 9b the very likely and likely concentrate on a more significant negative correlation reflecting the greater likelihood that vegetation in these groups depends on groundwater finally we compared multi year average evaporation and precipitation during the dry season in the dry years to analyze the dependence of vegetation on groundwater in terms of the water balance fig 10 theoretically vegetation growth in areas where evaporation is greater than precipitation requires groundwater support and the greater difference between evaporation and precipitation the greater the likelihood of pgdes eamus et al 2016 the areas with et greater than p accounted for 93 of the pgdes areas the difference in the ziwuling mountains the huanglong mountains and the loess hills in the northwest of the basin was the largest maximum value of 33 37 mm in addition the difference between et and p in the upstream and midstream of the beiluo river and the upstream of the weihe river is within 10 mm in contrast p exceeds et in the southern edge of the qinling mountains and parts of the guanzhong plain excluding areas where p is greater than et we found that the average difference was the most component for likely followed by very likely but the median of very likely was relatively large 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of pgdes in weihe river basin the identification and validation results showed that the vegetation in the loess hills and gullies ziwuling mountains and huanglong mountains are more likely to belong to gdes the wtd in these areas is relatively deep and the clustering types of high high or high low between wtd and ndvi contradict the theory in some studies that the shallower the groundwater the higher the likelihood of gdes eamus and froend 2006 however some studies have found that the increase of ndvi is the primary contributor to the intensification of groundwater drought on the loess plateau han et al 2020 due to the grain for green project introduced in 1999 a significant increase in ndvi has been observed in the loess plateau which is in the northwest of the weihe river basin chen et al 2015 in recent years vegetation restoration has dramatically reduced soil erosion playing a vital role in ecological restoration zhang et al 2021 the significant increase in vegetation cover has improved soil moisture retention and infiltration capacity chen et al 2015 however the evapotranspiration of the restored vegetation is significantly higher than natural vegetation resulting in excessive soil water depletion and even further reduction of groundwater storage disturbing the water balance zhao et al 2019 the water table depth threshold for groundwater dependent vegetation ecosystems in some studies is about 20 m liu et al 2021 páscoa et al 2020 in theory since vegetation roots often cannot directly absorb relatively deep groundwater it is implausible that vegetation in areas with wtd exceeding 20 m belongs to pgdes liu et al 2021 the soil layer in the loess area is thick and the maximum soil thickness can extend more than 100 m zhu et al 2018 the multi year average wtd is about 50 55 m based on the available data from the monitoring sites in the loess plateau of xifeng city according to pgdes identification results there is still vegetation in the loess area in the northwest of the basin belonging to pgdes studies have shown that the root system of vegetation can even reach 32 m such as the young rubber tree of north eastern thailand due to the dry climate and thick soil layer etc pierret et al 2016 shrubs on the loess plateau caragana korshinskii alfalfa etc have developed root systems and the main root zone can even reach more than 10 m wang et al 2011 when the dry season comes in the loess area whether the roots of deep rooted vegetation reach relatively deep phreatic water areas to directly utilize groundwater or the vegetation roots may not be able to access the phreatic water directly whether groundwater affects vegetation by acting on other types of water e g capillary upwelling needs to be further explored based on the validation results we found that the precipitation in the southern edge of the qinling mountains is sufficient and the rainfall in some areas is more significant than the evaporation in the dry season however the mapping results of pgdes show that these areas have a relatively high likelihood of the existence of pgdes and belong to the group very likely the qinling mountains are distributed in the weihe river basin the northern slope of the qinling mountains is dominated by oak and platycladus zhao et al 2014 and studies have shown that oak forests can directly absorb groundwater howard and merrifield 2010 it is uncertain to determine how much groundwater contribution exists to the larger ndvi in the region therefore the pgdes mapping results still have credibility but the degree of dependence on groundwater is currently uncertain and further research is needed 4 2 construction of identification method for pgdes the coupled framework accounts for moisture variability and applicability to various climate types with dry seasons compared with the independent gem and ndvi classification method the original gem method posits no precipitation in the region barron et al 2014 which has certain limitations for the pgdes identification in humid areas with increased ndwi for semi arid and semi humid areas deng et al 2020 small scale precipitation could increase ndwi during the dry period which complicates the judgment of the precipitation and groundwater use by the vegetation growth while in the ndvi classification method the wetness change during the dry period was not accounted for gou et al 2015 liu et al 2021 another limitation is that though the dry period is always mentioned in the gdes identification and mapping methods barron et al 2014 chen et al 2014 gou et al 2015 liu et al 2021 páscoa et al 2020 the classification methods of aridity degree are not unified to address the above limitations in this study the modified gem method adding rlc5 was coupled with the ndvi classification method while introducing the aridity index to improve the universality of pgdes identification and mapping framework misidentification of gdes can be avoided by excluding unnatural vegetation types such as croplands since the gem method is based on inferred access to groundwater irrigated croplands which have consistent access to surface water could be falsely identified as pgdes barron et al 2014 furthermore wetlands were extracted as a separate system through the spatial distribution of land cover types by analyzing the variations of ndvi and ndwi in wetlands the error caused by the impact of the river and the relatively low ndvi can be avoided groundwater dependent wetlands are defined by hydric or partially hydric soils howard and merrifield 2010 wetlands located in surface water inundation areas supported by runoff do not fall into the category of gdes barron et al 2014 eamus et al 2016 the gem method was applied initially in the mediterranean climate zone of australia where the high temperature periods coincide with the dry period and the identification of the pgdes can exclude the effect of temperature reduction on vegetation growth barron et al 2014 for regions with co occurrence of rain and heat such as the weihe river basin apart from the influence of precipitation the temperature gradient at the beginning and end of the dry period should be taken into account zhang et al 2019 unable to achieve regional unity the end of the dry and wet seasons can only be determined by the aridity index at the specific location since this method involves calculating the inter annual rate of ndvi change it is not possible to achieve year by year identification of pgdes but only stage by stage mapping according to the selected study area data resolution and acquisition issues need to be considered which is also one of the reasons for the uncertainty of identification results guirado et al 2018 the insufficient groundwater monitoring data and the limited accuracy of spatial visualization also impact the verification results 5 conclusion this study used an extended framework based on remote sensing data to identify and hierarchical mapping of pgdes in the weihe river basin statistical methods of the bivariate spatial autocorrelation and correlation coefficient and water balance method were used to verify the identification and mapping results the research led to the following conclusions the multi year average of ndvi and ndwi were ranged from 0 09 to 0 79 and 0 70 to 0 26 respectively the ndvi trended to increase over the year in a relatively large proportion of areas while the ndwi was the opposite the preliminary scope of pgdes in the weihe river basin includes the ziwuling mountains huanglong mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains the north of the loess hilly and south of loess hilly and gully the unlikely and neutral were mainly distributed in the loess plateau region while the very likely and likely are found in other mountains the distribution of pgdes was consistent with the distributions of the spatial autocorrelation between ndvi and wtd the correlation between ppm and ndvi and the difference between et and p it is important to quantify and distinguish the contribution of precipitation and groundwater in vegetation water consumption in future research by combining field survey and monitoring model simulation and other techniques for the large scale area the utilization mechanism of groundwater by vegetation in different landform types needs to be clarified especially for particular kinds such as loess areas on this basis it is essential to plan the groundwater extraction mechanism and pollution prevention reasonably to avoid the change of groundwater threatening vegetation growth in addition the degree of groundwater utilization by different vegetation should be considered in the process of vegetation restoration to avoid the potentially conflicting demands for water between the ecosystem and humans overall the identification results of pgdes in the weihe river basin are not only beneficial to further research on the mechanism of eco hydrological effects but also can provide a research basis for the rational allocation of water resources and maintenance of ecosystem health in the loess plateau and yellow river basin credit authorship contribution statement wenjin xu conceptualization

3437,identifying and mapping of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems pgdes are pivotal to well understanding of the interaction between groundwater and ecosystem as well as rational allocation of regional water resources as the largest tributary of the yellow river with complex landscape types the weihe river basin is an essential region for both water and sediment management in the yellow river basin however either the distribution of pgdes or the role of groundwater in ecosystems of the weihe river basin has been largely unexplored in this study focused on the weihe river basin the framework for identifying and mapping of pgdes was suggested to perform hierarchical grade based on the coupling of ndvi classification method and groundwater dependent ecosystem mapping gem method moreover the identification and mapping of pgdes were validated based on statistical analyses among normalized difference vegetation index ndvi water table depth wtd previous month s precipitation ppm evapotranspiration et and precipitation p the spatial patterns of pgdes obtained from mapping are generally consistent with those from validation and the differences of pgdes in the weihe river distributed largely the pgdes group of likely and very likely accounted for 22 5 of the basin and mainly distributed in ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains and huanglong mountains and the neutral group was scattered in the loess area of the northwestern basin accounting for 13 the finding of this study promotes the development of the gdes identification and provides references for water and ecosystem regulation and protection of the weihe river basin as well as other similar basins keywords potential groundwater dependent ecosystems remote sensing gem method statistical analysis the weihe river basin 1 introduction water controlled ecosystems have been the primary focus of the relatively new field of ecohydrology in that vegetation growth is driven by water transpiration loheide and gorelick 2007 groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes are a particular type of water controlled ecosystems which comprise groundwater biocenoses and the surrounding environment characterized by intermittent or long term dependence on groundwater to maintain their ecological structures and functions boulton and hancock 2006 griebler et al 2019 gdes offer a range of ecological services such as soil formation soil preservation water purification pollutant reduction as well as regulation of water flow murray et al 2006 gdes are located in the marine in stream terrestrial and aquifer environments including aquatic hyporheic and riparian habitats wetlands and springs estuarine and nearshore marine ecosystems eamus et al 2006 kløve et al 2011 as an indispensable part of gdes groundwater resources are threatened by global scale depletion han et al 2015 in addition climate change and human activity exacerbate the depletion by reducing precipitation and changing underlying surface and watercourse both of which will decrease recharge and increase the utilization of groundwater kløve et al 2014 affected by the shortage of groundwater vegetation growth is also inhibited especially in the vegetation ecosystem dependent on groundwater in arid period johansen et al 2018 koirala et al 2017 yang et al 2019 thus a better understanding of the interaction of eco hydrological processes in gdes is warranted which improves the scientific basis for restoration and management of vegetation ecosystems vegetation in gdes plays a vital role in regulating surface water and groundwater in a dry climate since its primary source of water is groundwater kløve et al 2011 groundwater supports vegetation growth by affecting vegetation roots oxygen water and nutrient absorption chui et al 2011 therefore groundwater depth drought flood events and salt concentration are the key factors controlling the growth of the arbor and shrub in the arid catchments huang et al 2013 in turn changes in vegetation type and coverage can also affect groundwater recharge and even cause groundwater drought by changing water cycle processes such as interception and transpiration anurag et al 2021 han et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 this strong interaction of eco hydrological processes for gdes reveals indispensable feedbacks between vegetation and groundwater chui et al 2011 although regional ecology and water conservation are inextricably linked to the study of gdes due to the hidden nature of groundwater sun 2013 information about gdes on a large scale is still lacking it s necessary to identify and delineate the potential gdes pgdes before clarifying the interaction mechanisms between vegetation and groundwater orellana et al 2012 although the scope of gdes can be achieved through ecosystem fieldwork pérez hoyos et al 2016 large scale fieldwork and mapping require a great deal of time manpower and material furthermore empirical extrapolation was applied to expand known gdes areas to regional scales doody et al 2017 however such an approach cannot be applied to regions without gdes research the multicriteria approximation based on assigning weights to multiple geographic parameters through experts survey and verifying results through fieldwork can analyze the continuous spatio temporal changes of gdes at an annual scale via various elements but its stronger subjective may lead to controversial weights of some parameters duran llacer et al 2022 therefore given the complicated interaction mechanism between vegetation and groundwater gdes identification and mapping based on remote sensing data is necessary and feasible for studying gdes in regions with a complex topography and limited groundwater information gdes identification methods based on remote sensing include supervised classification martínez santos et al 2021 unsupervised classification e g groundwater dependent ecosystem mapping gem barron et al 2014 and index classification e g gde index gou et al 2015 and standardized ndvi classification gou et al 2015 liu et al 2021 páscoa et al 2020 for single supervised or unsupervised classification the area where vegetation may use groundwater can be only selected but the degree of likelihood of its existence is unclear and the index classification method only takes into account a certain vegetation index often ignoring the influence of other factors such as moisture the above methods all present certain limitations which ignore the universality of the application processes therefore a comprehensive gdes identification approach is warranted herein we coupled the gem method and a vegetation index classification method to extend the pgdes identification and mapping framework and the weihe river basin was used as the study area the weihe river is the largest tributary of the yellow river and a significant component of the loess plateau the study of gdes in the weihe river basin is beneficial to the high quality development of the yellow river basin it plays an essential role in the ecological conservation of the loess plateau the purpose of this manuscript is to 1 extend the framework of pgdes identification based on remote sensing data 2 delineate the preliminary scope of pgdes in the weihe river basin 3 group the likelihood of pgdes 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the weihe

monitoring data of twenty phreatic wells were selected and the kriging spatial interpolation method was used to describe the approximate spatial trend of groundwater 2 3 methods 2 3 1 pgdes indentification the identification of pgdes is mainly divided into three steps fig 2 1 selection of wetlands and natural vegetation areas and calculation of aridity index ai to select dry periods 2 the delineation of the preliminary scope using the gem method 3 the grouping of the likelihood of pgdes within the preliminary scope 4 validation of pgdes identification and mapping first we determine the dry period by the aridity index spinoni et al 2015 calculated by eq 1 1 ai i 1 n p i pet i n where p i is average annual precipitation of the i th pixel pet i is the average annual potential evapotranspiration of the i th pixel the classification criteria of ai include arid 0 ai 0 5 mid 0 5 ai 0 75 and humid 0 75 ai 0 5 is used as the threshold value for the dry and wet seasons in this paper the gem method consists of unsupervised classification to obtain natural clusters and natural cluster centroids analysis to obtain reclassified land cover class initial natural clusters of rasters within natural vegetation were performed by unsupervised classification isodata from four dimensional vectors of ndvi and ndwi at the end of the wet and dry seasons five land cover reclassification criteria were combined to reclassify the identified initial natural clusters centroids and rlc1 rlc2 and rlc5 were used as the preliminary scope of pgdes the criteria for reclassification of land cover types are shown below ndvi townshend et al 1987 and ndwi mcfeeters 1996 are calculated as follows 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red n d w i ρ green ρ nir ρ green ρ nir where ρ nir ρ red and ρ green are near infrared band infrared band and green light band respectively the criteria for reclassification of land cover types are shown below a reclassified land cover class 1 rlc1 areas where vegetation can always be supported by groundwater to maintain high greenness and wetness even after a prolonged drought barron et al 2014 therefore areas with almost invariable ndvi and ndwi at the end of the wet and dry seasons were determined as pgdes b reclassified land cover class 2 rlc2 areas where vegetation can always be supported by groundwater and show some level of greenness increase and wetness reduction after a prolonged drought barron et al 2014 therefore areas with almost increased ndvi and decreased ndwi at the end of the wet and dry seasons were determined as pgdes c reclassified land cover class 3 rlc3 after a prolonged drought the areas where the ndvi and ndwi had significantly decreased or the area where the ndvi decreased with increased ndwi were considered to be non pgdes d reclassified land cover class 4 rlc4 areas where the ndvi is less than 0 35 at the end of wet or dry seasons barron et al 2014 sobrino et al 2006 sobrino and raissouni 2010 we believe that the vegetation in these areas is dry or non existent therefore rlc4 was considered as non pgdes e reclassified land cover class 5 rlc5 areas where the ndwi increase renders it impossible to determine whether the growth of vegetation depends on groundwater were determined as uncertain class finally the preliminary scope of pgdes was graded using ndvi classification method gou et al 2015 the first criterion is that vegetation remains green and active in the dry season eamus et al 2015 in other words the greater the ndvi at the end of the dry season in a dry year the greater the likelihood of pgdes in the region the second and third criteria are that areas would be more likely to be supported by groundwater if they re characterized by limited inter annual and seasonal variation in vegetation respectively eamus et al 2006 liu et al 2021 the monthly ndvi values for june 2011 were selected to calculate criterion 1 the ndvi sd of july from 2004 to 2016 and the dry period from 2010 to 2011 were used to calculate criteria 2 and 3 the inter annual and seasonal variation of vegetation were expressed using the standard deviation of ndvi which was calculated from eq 3 3 sd 1 n t 1 n ndvi t i ndvi mean i 2 where n is the number of images i is the i th image pixel n d v i t i is the ndvi value of the i th pixel at time t n d v i mean i is the mean ndvi value of the ith pixel for the n images the k means clustering method was used to group the raster for each criterion where the ndvi values in criterion 1 were ranked from lowest to highest while ndvi sd in criteria 2 and 3 was ranked from highest to lowest the raster calculator was used to add up the group values of the data layers of the three criteria and the resulting group values were between 3 and 15 we further divided these values into five pgdes likelihood groups as the final results very likely 12 to 15 likely 10 to 11 neutral 8 to 9 unlikely 6 to 7 and very unlikely 3 to 5 to reduce the error of wetland identified results we classified the rlc1 and rlc2 wetland as very likely and the rest as unlikely without regrouping 2 3 2 validation and statistical analysis to verify the accuracy of the identified results of pgdes we studied the spatial synergy between ndvi and wtd the correlation between ndvi and the previous month s precipitation ppm and the difference between evaporation et and precipitation p bivariate spatial autocorrelation was employed to explore the spatial relationships between ndvi and wtd zheng et al 2020 the local lisa maps in this method show the spatial dependency features of two variables where the spatial aggregation types of the regions with significant correlation include high high high low low low and low high the relevant formula is shown as follows 4 m o r a n s i xy α a x α a x σ x β 1 n p α β a y β a y σ y where m o r a n s i ij α is the global spatial bivariate autocorrelation index a x α and a y β are the values of the attributes x and y of the spatial unit a and σ are the mean and variance respectively p α β is the spatial weight matrix in addition considering the lag between p and vegetation response lamchin et al 2018 and the positive correlation between ndvi and p in the non gdes area liu et al 2021 we performed a correlation analysis between ndvi and ppm the less positive or negative correlation between ndvi and ppm in a region the more likely the presence of gdes furthermore the difference between et and p indicates the moisture gap between et and p eamus et al 2016 liu et al 2021 a more significant difference indicates that the region has high evaporation and low precipitation and the vegetation is more likely to gain water from groundwater according to the water balance method steinwand et al 2006 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics of ndvi and ndwi the spatial distribution of the multi year average and annual change rate of ndvi and ndwi in the weihe river basin from 2004 to 2016 are shown in fig 3 for ndvi the multi year average ranged from 0 09 to 0 79 fig 3a and the annual change rate from 0 023 to 0 048 fig 3c similar to the spatial distribution of forests the area with a relatively high value of multi year average mainly concentrated in ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains and guanshan mountains due to weak human disturbance primitive natural environment and better protection policy in the qinling mountains and ziwuling mountains ndvi is relatively high while areas with relatively high ndvi values showed an opposite trend compared to the annual change rate of ndvi in addition the relatively low value of the multi year average occurred in guanzhong plain and loess hilly and gully region which is similar to the distribution of annual change rate downstream of beiluo river jinghe river and upstream of weihe river had relatively high annual values of change rate and the medium multi year average of ndvi the multi year average and annual change rate for ndwi ranged from 0 70 to 0 26 fig 3b and 0 029 to 0 026 fig 3d respectively the multi year average had relatively low values in the ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains and guanshan mountains which was opposite to the spatial distribution of ndvi the relatively high values of multi year average mainly occurred in the weihe river and its tributaries the loess hilly as well as the loess hilly and gully in addition the value of ndwi also showed a more significant decreasing trend in the south central mountains fig 3d minimum negative and even positive values of annual change rate were found in loess hilly and gully region guanzhong plain and southeast of liupan mountains overall the value of ndwi showed a decreasing trend throughout the basin except for the guanzhong urban agglomeration 3 2 analysis of the identification process and results of pgdes 3 2 1 analysis of aridity index the first step in pgdes identification is to select the wet season s end and the dry season s end in the drier years so we calculated the ai from 2004 to 2016 as shown in fig 4 c the ai of the basin ranged from 0 01 to 1 87 during the study period a distinct dry season was identified from early fall to early summer of the following year most of the wet season ends in september and enters the dry season from october while the end of the dry season is in june almost every year the trend of monthly average on temperature fig 4a and wtd fig 4b is similar to ai hence considering the temperature limitation of photosynthesis the universality of the end month of the wet season and the annual distribution of wtd september and june were selected as the beginning and the end of the wet season respectively in addition combining the characteristics of dry season integrity we separated the study period into six sub time periods 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2015 2016 3 2 2 preliminary delineation of pgdes the results of the isodata classification presented in fig 5 showed scatterplots of the centroids for all clusters with fives colors representing five reclassified land cover classes during the initial identification of pgdes the identified natural clusters ranged from 13 to 18 during the study period the most significant number of natural clusters 18 was in 2006 indicating sizeable spatial variability of ndvi and ndwi in that year based on the reclassified criterion of the gem method we further classified the natural clusters of each year to obtain reclassified land cover types each year the number of rlc types is the same with four classes there is no rlc5 in 2015 except for years without rlc3 fig 6 illustrates the spatio temporal distribution of 5 reclassified land cover classes the spatially distributed rlc1 and rlc2 mainly include the ziwuling mountains huanglong mountains qinling mountains and liupan mountains which were the main areas of land cover type change in addition rlc3 and rlc4 were mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest of loess hills and gullies respectively the reclassification results showed that rlc5 existed in the previous five periods which indicated decreasing trend of ndwi rlc5 with uncertainty was mainly distributed in the loess hilly and gully region in the north of the basin but rarely found in the region with obvious land cover change the preliminary delineation of pgdes was obtained by the union of reclassified results of 2015 2016 with other periods the preliminary scope for pgdes occupied 40 4 of the whole area mostly grasslands and forests 3 2 3 grouping and mapping of the likelihood of pgdes as fig 7 shows the relatively high percentage of the total areas was in group 3 neutral and 4 likely accounting for 13 and 17 respectively followed by group 2 unlikely and 5 very likely accounting for 5 and 5 5 meanwhile the group values revealed a distribution pattern of high in the south and low in the north the areas with a relatively high likelihood of pgdes were found in the mountainous region such as the ziwuling mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains guanshan mountains and huanglong mountains which mainly included very likely and likely fig 7b these areas are dominated by terrestrial vegetation ecosystems whose survival and evolution in a water scarce environment depends on direct water uptake from the phreatic water or capillary zone eamus and froend 2006 in addition pgdes of relatively high likelihood were also present in part of the riparian area of some rivers such as the mainstream of the weihe river fig 7d the areas with pgdes of relatively low likelihood are mainly located in the loess hills and gullies in the northwest of the basin where the groups of neutral likely and unlikely are scattered fig 7a the group of very likely in permanent wetlands occupied about 51 of the wetland area and were mainly distributed in the shitouhe river and heihe river on the south of the weihe river and the qishuihe river and qianhe river on the north of the weihe river fig 7c 3 3 validation of pgdes mapping first we analyzed bivariate spatial autocorrelation between ndvi and wtd and obtained the lisa cluster map of moran s i and significance map as shown in fig 8 thirteen percent of the spatial autocorrelation of ndvi and wtd passed the significance test at the 0 001 level followed by 32 2 and 27 3 of the areas passing the significance test at the 0 01 and 0 05 levels respectively fig 8a for the region that passed the significance test the global moran s i is 0 228 indicating that ndvi and wtd in most areas show a weak negative correlation fig 8c the spatial distribution of the correlation degree tends to be consistent with the spatial distribution of pgdes and the areas with stronger correlation are mainly located in the southeast of the ziwuling mountains the south of the huanglong mountains and most of the qinling mountains fig 8a the areas with weaker correlation are mainly distributed in the loess hills and gullies in the north of the weihe river basin however the distribution of spatial autocorrelation significance between ndvi and wtd was more uniform than the pgdes likelihood in the loess hills overall the high significance of spatial autocorrelation between ndvi and wtd occurred in areas with smaller wtd especially in the south and southwest of the basin fig 8b showed the spatial clustering characteristics of wtd and ndvi the areas with high high characteristics are distributed in the loess hills and gullies low low in the loess hills in the northwest of the basin low high in the qinling and liupan mountains and high low in the ziwuling mountains and parts of the huanglong mountains then the correlations between the ndvi and the ppm for the year with the highest ai 2011 during the study period are shown in fig 9 a significant negative correlation between ndvi and ppm was found in the areas along rivers such as the weihe river indicating that precipitation decreased with the increase of vegetation coverage fig 9a except for the riverside the correlation in the pgdes was increasing from southeast to northwest with the lowest correlation of the liupan mountains and the huanglong mountains the positive correlation was most significant in the loess hills while the median and the average of the correlations gradually decreased from unlikely to very likely fig 9b the very likely and likely concentrate on a more significant negative correlation reflecting the greater likelihood that vegetation in these groups depends on groundwater finally we compared multi year average evaporation and precipitation during the dry season in the dry years to analyze the dependence of vegetation on groundwater in terms of the water balance fig 10 theoretically vegetation growth in areas where evaporation is greater than precipitation requires groundwater support and the greater difference between evaporation and precipitation the greater the likelihood of pgdes eamus et al 2016 the areas with et greater than p accounted for 93 of the pgdes areas the difference in the ziwuling mountains the huanglong mountains and the loess hills in the northwest of the basin was the largest maximum value of 33 37 mm in addition the difference between et and p in the upstream and midstream of the beiluo river and the upstream of the weihe river is within 10 mm in contrast p exceeds et in the southern edge of the qinling mountains and parts of the guanzhong plain excluding areas where p is greater than et we found that the average difference was the most component for likely followed by very likely but the median of very likely was relatively large 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of pgdes in weihe river basin the identification and validation results showed that the vegetation in the loess hills and gullies ziwuling mountains and huanglong mountains are more likely to belong to gdes the wtd in these areas is relatively deep and the clustering types of high high or high low between wtd and ndvi contradict the theory in some studies that the shallower the groundwater the higher the likelihood of gdes eamus and froend 2006 however some studies have found that the increase of ndvi is the primary contributor to the intensification of groundwater drought on the loess plateau han et al 2020 due to the grain for green project introduced in 1999 a significant increase in ndvi has been observed in the loess plateau which is in the northwest of the weihe river basin chen et al 2015 in recent years vegetation restoration has dramatically reduced soil erosion playing a vital role in ecological restoration zhang et al 2021 the significant increase in vegetation cover has improved soil moisture retention and infiltration capacity chen et al 2015 however the evapotranspiration of the restored vegetation is significantly higher than natural vegetation resulting in excessive soil water depletion and even further reduction of groundwater storage disturbing the water balance zhao et al 2019 the water table depth threshold for groundwater dependent vegetation ecosystems in some studies is about 20 m liu et al 2021 páscoa et al 2020 in theory since vegetation roots often cannot directly absorb relatively deep groundwater it is implausible that vegetation in areas with wtd exceeding 20 m belongs to pgdes liu et al 2021 the soil layer in the loess area is thick and the maximum soil thickness can extend more than 100 m zhu et al 2018 the multi year average wtd is about 50 55 m based on the available data from the monitoring sites in the loess plateau of xifeng city according to pgdes identification results there is still vegetation in the loess area in the northwest of the basin belonging to pgdes studies have shown that the root system of vegetation can even reach 32 m such as the young rubber tree of north eastern thailand due to the dry climate and thick soil layer etc pierret et al 2016 shrubs on the loess plateau caragana korshinskii alfalfa etc have developed root systems and the main root zone can even reach more than 10 m wang et al 2011 when the dry season comes in the loess area whether the roots of deep rooted vegetation reach relatively deep phreatic water areas to directly utilize groundwater or the vegetation roots may not be able to access the phreatic water directly whether groundwater affects vegetation by acting on other types of water e g capillary upwelling needs to be further explored based on the validation results we found that the precipitation in the southern edge of the qinling mountains is sufficient and the rainfall in some areas is more significant than the evaporation in the dry season however the mapping results of pgdes show that these areas have a relatively high likelihood of the existence of pgdes and belong to the group very likely the qinling mountains are distributed in the weihe river basin the northern slope of the qinling mountains is dominated by oak and platycladus zhao et al 2014 and studies have shown that oak forests can directly absorb groundwater howard and merrifield 2010 it is uncertain to determine how much groundwater contribution exists to the larger ndvi in the region therefore the pgdes mapping results still have credibility but the degree of dependence on groundwater is currently uncertain and further research is needed 4 2 construction of identification method for pgdes the coupled framework accounts for moisture variability and applicability to various climate types with dry seasons compared with the independent gem and ndvi classification method the original gem method posits no precipitation in the region barron et al 2014 which has certain limitations for the pgdes identification in humid areas with increased ndwi for semi arid and semi humid areas deng et al 2020 small scale precipitation could increase ndwi during the dry period which complicates the judgment of the precipitation and groundwater use by the vegetation growth while in the ndvi classification method the wetness change during the dry period was not accounted for gou et al 2015 liu et al 2021 another limitation is that though the dry period is always mentioned in the gdes identification and mapping methods barron et al 2014 chen et al 2014 gou et al 2015 liu et al 2021 páscoa et al 2020 the classification methods of aridity degree are not unified to address the above limitations in this study the modified gem method adding rlc5 was coupled with the ndvi classification method while introducing the aridity index to improve the universality of pgdes identification and mapping framework misidentification of gdes can be avoided by excluding unnatural vegetation types such as croplands since the gem method is based on inferred access to groundwater irrigated croplands which have consistent access to surface water could be falsely identified as pgdes barron et al 2014 furthermore wetlands were extracted as a separate system through the spatial distribution of land cover types by analyzing the variations of ndvi and ndwi in wetlands the error caused by the impact of the river and the relatively low ndvi can be avoided groundwater dependent wetlands are defined by hydric or partially hydric soils howard and merrifield 2010 wetlands located in surface water inundation areas supported by runoff do not fall into the category of gdes barron et al 2014 eamus et al 2016 the gem method was applied initially in the mediterranean climate zone of australia where the high temperature periods coincide with the dry period and the identification of the pgdes can exclude the effect of temperature reduction on vegetation growth barron et al 2014 for regions with co occurrence of rain and heat such as the weihe river basin apart from the influence of precipitation the temperature gradient at the beginning and end of the dry period should be taken into account zhang et al 2019 unable to achieve regional unity the end of the dry and wet seasons can only be determined by the aridity index at the specific location since this method involves calculating the inter annual rate of ndvi change it is not possible to achieve year by year identification of pgdes but only stage by stage mapping according to the selected study area data resolution and acquisition issues need to be considered which is also one of the reasons for the uncertainty of identification results guirado et al 2018 the insufficient groundwater monitoring data and the limited accuracy of spatial visualization also impact the verification results 5 conclusion this study used an extended framework based on remote sensing data to identify and hierarchical mapping of pgdes in the weihe river basin statistical methods of the bivariate spatial autocorrelation and correlation coefficient and water balance method were used to verify the identification and mapping results the research led to the following conclusions the multi year average of ndvi and ndwi were ranged from 0 09 to 0 79 and 0 70 to 0 26 respectively the ndvi trended to increase over the year in a relatively large proportion of areas while the ndwi was the opposite the preliminary scope of pgdes in the weihe river basin includes the ziwuling mountains huanglong mountains qinling mountains liupan mountains the north of the loess hilly and south of loess hilly and gully the unlikely and neutral were mainly distributed in the loess plateau region while the very likely and likely are found in other mountains the distribution of pgdes was consistent with the distributions of the spatial autocorrelation between ndvi and wtd the correlation between ppm and ndvi and the difference between et and p it is important to quantify and distinguish the contribution of precipitation and groundwater in vegetation water consumption in future research by combining field survey and monitoring model simulation and other techniques for the large scale area the utilization mechanism of groundwater by vegetation in different landform types needs to be clarified especially for particular kinds such as loess areas on this basis it is essential to plan the groundwater extraction mechanism and pollution prevention reasonably to avoid the change of groundwater threatening vegetation growth in addition the degree of groundwater utilization by different vegetation should be considered in the process of vegetation restoration to avoid the potentially conflicting demands for water between the ecosystem and humans overall the identification results of pgdes in the weihe river basin are not only beneficial to further research on the mechanism of eco hydrological effects but also can provide a research basis for the rational allocation of water resources and maintenance of ecosystem health in the loess plateau and yellow river basin credit authorship contribution statement wenjin xu conceptualization

3438,soil moisture sm plays a critical role in drought monitoring agricultural management flood forecasting and other practical applications however the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of sm products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals approximately 25 55 km greatly hamper their local scale applications in this research we proposed an sm downscaling framework based on the wide deep learning wdl method to improve the spatial resolution of the level 3 daily composite of soil moisture active passive smap radiometer sm product l3 sm p in this method horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperature tbh and tbv respectively surface reflectance and land surface temperature lst topographic attributes soil properties climate types and landcover types collected in the continental united states conus during the annual unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the smap sm l3 sm p product from its original 36 km to 1 km precipitation and in situ sm measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the international soil moisture network ismn over the conus were utilized to validate the downscaled sm the results demonstrated that the correlation r between the downscaled and the in situ sm ranged from 0 325 to 0 997 the average r value was 0 715 the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse values ranged from 0 010 to 0 141 m3 m3 with an average ubrmse of 0 041 m3 m3 which meets the accuracy of smap sm requirement of ubrmse approximately 0 04 m 3 m3 the downscaled sm also showed good temporal consistency with the in situ sm and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data the downscaled sm not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original smap sm but also provides more detailed spatial sm variations keywords soil moisture downscaling smap wide deep learning method the continental united states 1 introduction soil moisture sm plays an indispensable role in global carbon terrestrial energy and water balance abbaszadeh et al 2019 jung et al 2017 and also provides valuable information for drought monitoring agricultural irrigation and water resource management martínez fernández et al 2016 colliander et al 2017a b renzullo et al 2014 however traditional ground based sm measurements lack spatiotemporal continuity collow et al 2012 microwave remote sensing techniques utilize wavelengths longer than the visible and infrared bands and these longer wavelengths are less affected by weather conditions e g clouds and precipitation which could thus supply massive spatiotemporally continuous global sm observations at a high revisitation frequency peng et al 2017 abbaszadeh et al 2019 at present many active and passive microwave sensors have been launched to acquire surface sm including the advanced microwave scanning radiometer on the earth observing system amsr e jackson et al 2010 sridhar et al 2013 soil moisture and ocean salinity smos jackson et al 2012 kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap sensors entekhabi et al 2010 inevitably these sensors have some drawbacks active sensors such as the european remote sensing ers satellite provide observed data that are considerably influenced by scattering from the land surface roughness and vegetation structures verhoest et al 2008 wagner et al 2013 in contrast passive microwave sensors have a certain ability to penetrate vegetation and are less sensitive to scattering however the coarse spatial resolutions of most passive microwave products approximately 25 55 km greatly limit their practical application piles et al 2011 entekhabi et al 2010 molero et al 2016 by combining passive and active sensors it seems possible to provide reliable sm at finer spatial resolutions the soil moisture active passive smap satellite was therefore designed to provide global scale sm estimates at a 9 km resolution by using both active radar backscatter and passive radiometer observations entekhabi et al 2010 mcnairn et al 2015 kim and lakshmi 2018 unfortunately due to a malfunction of the active radar in july 2015 only the passive radiometer sensors still function and continue to provide land surface 0 5 cm sm estimates at a 36 km spatial resolution however sentinel 1 observations are expected to replace the malfunctioning radar but this alternative will be limited to areas where the smap and sentinel 1 observations overlap jagdhuber et al 2017 das et al 2018 by introducing a variety of high resolution auxiliary information the researchers have developed a number of downscaling methods such as statistical physical and hydrological based models to improve the coarse spatial resolutions of satellite sm products sánchez ruiz et al 2014 fang et al 2020 fang et al 2021 senanayake et al 2021 qu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 recently machine learning ml techniques have proved to be advantageous in dealing with complex nonlinear relationships between sm and sm related land surface variables more researchers have adopted ml methods to improve the performance of downscaling methods santi et al 2016 wei et al 2018 abowarda et al 2021 for instance abbaszadeh et al 2019 used a random forest rf algorithm to obtain a 1 km resolution smap sm with an average unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 47 m3 m3 qu et al 2021 found that rf and gaussian process regression gpr algorithms exhibited the highest accuracies and stabilities compared to physical modeling and geostatistical algorithms compared with these traditional shallow network architectures e g rf gpr deep learning dl can learn higher level deeper features of massive datasets zhao et al 2022 xu et al 2021 found that the convolutional neural network cnn algorithm achieves better results than the support vector machine svm and rf algorithms zhao et al 2022 found that the residual network resnet algorithm exhibits a superior ability to enhance spatial texture details compared to rf as it can meet the requirements of fitting sm to complex surfaces however the applications of dl to sm downscaling work are still lacking in addition fewer features i e ndvi lst and topography are contained in these dl downscaling algorithms which are not sufficient to characterize the complex sm conditions of the land surface as a result when generating higher resolution sm data the accuracy is reduced to some extent since they do not fully exploit their advantages in mining multiple features of massive data in this study we developed and evaluated a new dl algorithm to generate high resolution sm from smap observations the main motivations for this work are twofold first we explored the wide deep learning wdl algorithms as a possible alternative or supplement to the existing downscaling algorithms the wdl method has been successfully implemented in medicine the internet of things and industrial fields cheng et al 2016 xu et al 2021a wilson et al 2021 sree et al 2021 however it is not obvious whether the wdl method works equally well in remote sensing related sm retrieval studies given the large differences i e data types study objects etc between these fields second we investigated the potential of introducing features of climatic and land cover types to improve the dl method s performance since climate and landcover types have been shown to have a great influence on the spatial distribution of sm kim 2013 zhang et al 2019 de lannoy et al 2014 entekhabi et al 2014 schmugge 1980 they could be used to strengthen the connection between satellite sm and surface features in this proposed wdl downscaling method features of climates and landcover types were introduced in addition to the commonly used auxiliary features i e sm related indices smris lst topographic attributes and soil properties these features which were derived from different auxiliary datasets acquired over the conus during the annual unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 were used for the development and analysis of the applied downscaling method the in situ sm and precipitation data collected from 211 sites distributed in the international soil moisture network ismn in 2015 were used to evaluate the performance of the developed downscaling method 2 datasets 2 1 smap sm dataset the smap l3 sm p sm product served as the target data during the wdl model training process the smap l3 sm p brightness temperature data tbv tbh served as the 1st auxiliary dataset type input during the downscaling process to strengthen the correlation between the downscaling variables and smap sm the smap sm product is a daily composite product posted on a 36 km equal area scalable earth ease grid this product contains sm observations from both the descending 6 00 am and ascending 6 00 pm orbits to decrease the influence of seasonal variabilities in the downscaling model sabaghy et al 2018 peng et al 2017 and reduce the uncertainty of the smap sm product during frozen periods liu et al 2019 only datasets collected during the unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 were selected in addition we chose only the smap sm obtained at the 6 00 am overpass to reduce the observation errors caused by faraday rotations as well as those caused by the temperature differences between the soil and canopy entekhabi et al 2010 o neill et al 2015 these smap products were acquired from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa distributed activity archive center daac at the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data smap table 1 summaries the datasets used in this study 2 2 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis dataset modis lst and surface reflectance products as well as the smris derived from these two products are commonly used auxiliary datasets in sm downscaling methods hu et al 2020 wei et al 2019 kolassa et al 2018 in this study modis land surface reflectance lst and their derived smris served as the 2nd auxiliary dataset type in the sm downscaling method the daily modis terra lst product mod11a1 is published on a 1 km global grid wan et al 2015 the daily modis terra surface reflectance product mod09ga provides surface spectral reflectance estimations ranging from the visible to the mear infrared bands in a sinusoidal projection nine smri candidates were calculated using combinations of lst and various surface spectral reflectance bands as shown in table 2 these smri candidates can be divided into 1 drought indices the

wetness index twi abbaszadeh et al 2019 crow et al 2012 topographic attributes have been adopted in many sm downscaling studies ranney et al 2015 coleman and niemann 2013 in this study topographic attributes elevation slope and topographic complexity derived from the srtm dataset at a 90 m resolution were served as the 3rd auxiliary dataset type input in the downscaling method these data were provided by nasa jarvis et al 2008 and can be obtained from the file transfer protocol ftp site of the united states geological survey usgs 2 4 soil property dataset soil properties e g the soil clay content soil sand content and soil organic matter content dominate the spatial distribution of sm by affecting the water permeability infiltration rate and water storage capacity mattikalli et al 1998 soil properties have thus been frequently used as auxiliary dataset in many sm downscaling studies chakrabarti et al 2016 ranney et al 2015 shin and mohanty 2013 in this study soil properties the soil clay content soil bulk density soil organic carbon soil ph soil texture and soil sand content were selected as the 4th type of auxiliary dataset input in the downscaling method the soil property dataset was obtained from the land gis system https opengeohub org contribute training data openlandmap this system used in situ measurements and machine learning algorithms to map global soil properties at six depths 0 10 30 60 100 and 200 cm following a preliminary analysis the 10 cm soil property dataset which was most relevant to the smap sm product was finally selected 2 5 köppen climate classifications dataset köppen climate classification data peel et al 2007 served as the 5th auxiliary dataset type input to improve the performance of the applied downscaling method this global climate type classification dataset is referenced from the global historical climatology network ghcn version 2 0 dataset of monthly temperature and precipitation station records from 1901 to 2000 https people eng unimelb edu au mpeel koppen html the climate types in the conus are shown in fig 9 2 6 land cover the modis yearly land cover dataset mcd12q1 served as the 6th auxiliary dataset type input to improve the performance of the downscaling method the mcd12q1 product provides yearly global land cover types under six different classification schemes these land cover types are derived from the supervised classification of modis terra and aqua reflectance data we used the first classification system under which 16 land cover types were identified in the conus see fig 1 these data can be downloaded from nasa s earth data website for free https earthdata nasa gov 2 7 ismn measurements in situ sm data collected from 211 ismn sites over the conus during the period from april 1st to november 1st in 2015 fig 1 were used as an important reference dataset to evaluate the performance of the sm downscaling method the utilized ismn measurements were obtained from three sm monitoring networks the cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos u s climate reference network uscrn and soil climate analysis network scan https ismn geo tuwien ac at dorigo et al 2011 these sites comprise geographic regions with different climate types soil properties and land cover types thus allowing us to thoroughly evaluate the proposed downscaling method it must be mentioned that there are systematic differences between satellite and ground based sm measurements as well as discrepancies among different ground based sm networks these systemic differences include spatial representation measurement depth sm retrieval algorithm surface parameterization uncertainty and precipitation event sensitivity variations within the same pixel colliander et al 2017a crow et al 2012 discussions regarding the accuracies and uncertainties associated with different sm networks can be found in several studies by coopersmith et al 2016 and zreda et al 2012 table 3 provides a brief description of the sm networks used in this study 2 8 precipitation dataset many researchers have used precipitation data as an effective reference when estimating the accuracies of sm downscaling methods seneviratne et al 2010 abbaszadeh et al 2019 in this study the era5 daily total precipitation dataset with a 0 25 resolution served as another reference dataset when evaluating the proposed downscaling method era5 is the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf global climate and atmosphere reanalysis product this reanalysis product combines data derived from models and observations around the world to create a complete and consistent global dataset the era5 dataset contains atmospheric records such as air temperature total precipitation and surface pressure information since 1979 and can be obtained from https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp 3 methodology 3 1 data preparation and preprocessing the smap product was quality controlled and only values marked with the recommended retrieval quality were kept clouds and noise effects were removed from the mod09ga and mod11a1 products and only high quality pixels with were retained all datasets selected for use in our sm downscaling work were uniformly reprojected onto the world geodetic system wgs 1984 projection and cropped to the research region in the process of building the sm downscaling model to match the coarse resolution of the original smap sm product the auxiliary datasets the smap tb tbh tbv modis surface reflectance lst srtm topography soil property land cover types and climate classification products were upscaled to a 36 km resolution using the nearest neighbor interpolation method parker et al 1983 hay et al 1997 the nearest neighbor interpolation assignment does not change any cell values in the input raster datasets and functions for both categories and continuous value types therefore this method was applied during the upscaling aggregation process in this study 3 2 feature selection feature selection is the essential process applied in machine learning algorithms to select representative features and build robust models hall 1999 in this study a total of 30 variables were used as candidate features including 9 smris table 2 the lst 7 surface reflectance bands 6 soil properties 3 topographic attributes climate classifications land cover types and 2 smap tbs the feature selection process was based on the correlations between the dependent and independent variables in this process the original smap sm product with a 36 km resolution was considered the dependent variable while the 30 features were considered independent variables 3 3 downscaling framework based on the wide deep learning method in this research we proposed a new downscaling framework based on the wdl algorithm a schematic diagram of the proposed sm downscaling framework can be seen in fig 2 this framework mainly includes the following three steps 1 feature selection the optimal features were firstly selected from the 30 features derived from the 6 input auxiliary dataset types across the conus during the unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 2 training the selected features inputs were upscaled to a 36 km spatial resolution to match the spatial resolution of the original smap sm product the target data after which a coarse scale wdl model was trained 3 predicting the wdl model trained in the second step was transferred to the selected features of 1 km spatial resolution to generate the downscaled sm data 3 3 1 wdl method as a classic dl method the wdl algorithm was proposed by cheng et al 2016 unlike the commonly used deep neural network dnn model this wdl method combines the dnn model with a generalized linear model glm that contains a few features in the wdl method the dnn component has a proclivity for exploring and generalizing data patterns that have never or rarely occurred in the past whereas the glm is able to learn from patterns that have already appeared in historical data the wdl method combines the advantages of the dnn model and the generalized linear model glm to make the entire network structure more robust this method could be used to not only fully explore the nonlinear relationships within massively deep and high dimensional data via the dnn model but also employ the glm model to precisely fine tune the results thus making the modeling results more reasonable and accurate for the detailed process of the proposed wdl downscaling algorithm please refer to appendix a 1 in this study several features that exhibited the stronger correlations with smap sm were employed as glm input features in the wdl method forcing the model to place a greater emphasis on these features by giving them higher weights this process could improve the accuracy of the final modeling results more than that of only using the dnn model this assumption is verified in section 4 2 the dnn component of the wdl method contains three layers types the input layer hidden layer and output layer cybenko 1989 the number of neurons in the input layer is the same as the number of selected features whereas the number of neurons in the output layer is set to 1 in reference to the output target sm data the number of hidden layer neurons as well as the number of hidden layers are both determined by the complexity of the relationship between the inputs and outputs theoretically having more neurons and hidden layers could potentially improve the resulting estimation accuracy however excessive increases in the number of hidden layers of neurons may cause the training data to overfit meaning that the trained model would be less accurate when applied to other independent data we trained several sets of wdl models with the total numbers of hidden layers ranging from 2 to 5 and the total numbers of neurons in each hidden layer set to 16 32 64 or 128 for the dnn component we used a fully connected feedforward network in which all the neurons in the upper layer were linked to all the neurons in the next layer these connections were then assigned weights which each neuron used to calculate the synaptic weight of the weighted sum of all inputs plus the bias before applying the transfer function the neurons contained in the input and output layers used linear transfer functions while the neurons contained in the hidden layer used the typical tangent sigmoid transfer function 3 3 2 wdl model training to assess the functional relationship between the model inputs selected features and output targets smap sm an extensive and representative subset had to be trained this subset covered the entire conus region to the greatest possible extent and was called the training subset in this study a total of 578 896 pixels were extracted from the dataset images over the conus during the unfrozen season from 2015 to 2017 among these pixels the training validation and testing subsets accounted for 80 10 and 10 of the total pixels respectively the training and validation subsets were mainly used to train and fine tune the wdl model in which the validation subset was utilized to determine whether the wdl model weights resulted in overfitting during the process of model training the testing subset served as an independent dataset and was used to assess the fit of the final trained wdl model the training process involved the iterative optimization of the wdl synaptic weights to minimize the errors between the model outputs and target data when the mean square error mse between the wdl output and target data was 0 001 m3 m3 and the wdl model training process did not converge to a solution after a maximum threshold number of iterations here this threshold was set to 300 the training process was stopped upon each iteration the mse between the wdl model estimation and the target value smap sm of the validation subset was calculated when the wdl model did not improve after numerous iterations here the epoch was set to 10 the training process was terminated and the weight was returned to the best iteration record as the final solution here we applied the error backpropagation method rumelhart et al 1995 to update the weights after the training step was stopped the root mean square error rmse between the wdl model sm estimation value and the target value smap sm of the testing subset was calculated to evaluate whether the model fit and the model with the smallest rmse was selected as the optimal model 3 4 comparisons among models with several schemes to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed wdl downscaling scheme when introducing climate and land cover types we performed four schemes as comparisons these schemes are as follows 1 the wdl model in which climate and land cover types were introduced 2 the wdl model in which no climate or land cover types were introduced 3 the dnn model in which climate and land cover types were introduced and 4 the dnn model in which no climate or land cover types were introduced these four schemes employed the same training validation and testing subsets 3 5 evaluation method four statistical metrics including the pearson correlation coefficient r rmse ubrmse and bias eqs 1 4 willmott 1982 were used to evaluate the performance of the wdl model as well as the accuracy of the sm downscaling process r is a commonly used metric for measuring the correlation between two variables r values range from 1 to 1 the bias demonstrates whether data are overestimated positive or underestimated negative in the ideal case the bias value is close to 0 indicating relatively accurate results the ubrmse is the most commonly used metric for measuring smap product accuracies these metrics are calculated as follows 1 rmse e θ smap θ in s i t u 2 2 ubrmse e θ smap e θ smap θ in s i t u e θ in s i t u 2 3 bias e θ smap e θ in s i t u 4 r e θ smap e θ smap θ in s i t u e θ in s i t u σ smap σ in s i t u where e represents the mean operator θ in situ and θ smap refer to the in situ sm and smap sm respectively and σ smap and σ in situ are the standard deviations of the smap sm and in situ sm respectively 4 results 4 1 feature selection results it should be mentioned that we are most concerned about the generalization ability and accuracy of the proposed wdl downscaling model because dl algorithms are mostly based on massive data and use nonlinear activation functions there is no need to be excessively concerned about collinearities among variables as long as the features have independent physical definitions and are derived from independent data sources and there are no precise correlations among features r values close to 1 or 1 incorporating them will assist in reducing the dataset noise in the feature selection phase we first chose features that were acceptably correlated with smap sm here after a couple of tests we set the absolute r value greater than 0 2 as the acceptable threshold moreover when variables had high self correlations r 0 9 and were derived from the same data source an either or choice was made such as mpdi and pdi or evi and ndvi after the feature selection phase among the 30 established features 14 features were found to satisfy the criteria and were therefore selected to construct the wdl model the correlations between these selected features and smap sm as well as the inter correlations among these features are shown in table 4 and fig 3 respectively these features included 2 smris the ndvi and tvmdi 2 smap tbs the tbv and tbh 3 soil properties the soil clay content soil ph and soil organic carbon content 2 topographic attributes the elevation and slope the lst climate and land cover types and 2 surface reflectance bands modis bands 4 and 7 which correspond to the green band green and mid wave infrared mwir the selected 14 features were employed as input features in the dnn component of the wdl model among these selected features three features table 4 in bold that exhibited the strongest connections with smap sm were chosen as input features in the glm component of the wdl model to force the model to place more emphasis on these three features and give them higher weights 4 2 validation of the proposed downscaling method after training multiple wdl downscaling models we finally chose an optimal wdl model that consisted of 2 hidden layers in which there were 128 neurons in the first layer and 64 neurons in the second layer this wdl network was selected because it had improved accuracy and stability and adding more hidden layers or neurons did not improve its performance the performance of the wdl downscaling model is shown in fig 4 and the results demonstrate that the three subsets the training testing and validation subsets had similar values in terms of ubrmse and r metrics thus indicating that the optimal wdl model did not exhibit overfitting and was able to effectively generalize to data other than the training data in addition the r values for all three subsets were very high approximately 0 98 also the fitted line of the sm value predicted by this model the red line in fig 4 was very close to the 1 1 fitted line the dashed line indicating that this wdl downscaling model was able to learn the relationships between the features and target smap sm well at coarse resolution moreover the downscaling scheme in which climate and land cover types were introduced using the proposed wdl method was compared with several other downscaling schemes as shown in fig 5 the results demonstrated that the proposed wdl method for introducing climate and land cover type schemes was the most accurate in addition the results confirmed that the wdl downscaling method outperformed the widely used dnn model fig 5 demonstrates that the ubrmse value of the wdl model was 10 lower than that of the dnn model in the absence of climate and land cover types when climate and land cover types were added to both the wdl and dnn models the ubrmse of the wdl model was 8 lower than that of the dnn model in addition the results indicated that the performance of both the wdl and dnn models improved with the addition of climate and land cover information with the ubrmse values decreasing by 8 and 10 for the wdl and dnn models respectively 4 3 overall performance of the downscaled sm the downscaled sm data with 1 km resolution was verified using the in situ sm data collected from the ismn network over the conus from april 1st to november 1st 2015 all available in situ sm measurements are shown in fig 6 and the evaluation results are shown in figs 7 8 fig 7 displays the spatial distributions of the r and ubrmse values for all ismn sites the results reveal that over 60 of the sites corresponded to r values higher than 0 70 and more than 60 of the sites had ubrmse values below 0 04 m3 m3 moreover fig 7 a shows that overall high r values were observed between the downscaled sm and in situ sm in almost the entire conus region except for a few sites near the rocky mountains in mountainous and rugged topography the accuracy and reliability of microwave inversion products are relatively low partly due to the complexity of the surface roughness within the coverage of in situ instruments resulting in certain deviations in the measurements schmugge 1980 moreover remote sensing data collected in mountainous and topographically complex areas is often marked as low quality and discarded and this might decrease the ability of the wdl algorithm to capture the sm distribution in these areas during the training phase in flat areas far away from mountains the correlations are generally higher a taylor diagram 2001 was presented to show the performance comparisons of the downscaled and in situ sm for the different networks cosmos uscrn and uscan as shown in fig 8 this diagram combines three important statistical indicators the centered rmse r and standard deviation sdv ratio the black dot is regarded as a reference point at which all indicators are considered optimal the taylor diagram shows that the r values between the downscaled sm and in situ sm were over 0 7 for most sites moreover the sdv ratios of most scan and uscrn sites were lower than 1 indicating that the in situ sm had higher variability than the downscaled sm this was mostly due to the two networks being based on traditional point scale sm monitoring techniques that cannot represent downscaled sm at a 1 km spatial resolution scale collow et al 2012 therefore the sm variabilities resulting from the use of point scale measurements in these two networks were larger than those of the downscaled sm especially for sites with severe spatial heterogeneity e g varied topographies climate conditions soil properties vegetation or land cover types for cosmos sites on the other hand the average sm was acquired within a footprint of approximately 670 m in diameter duygu and akyurek 2019 this footprint range is closer to the spatial resolution of the downscaled sm thus resulting in less spatial variabilities compared to the scan and uscrn networks 4 4 downscaled sm performance over varied climate and land cover types in this section we evaluate the performance of the downscaled sm data in different climate and land cover types across the conus all 211 ismn sites were classified into three major climate categories and six major land cover types the specific classification references were mainly based on the results of zhang et al 2019 the evaluation results are presented in the form of boxplots in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 indicates that mean r values for all three climate regions were generally higher than 0 677 in addition the overall high r values were observed in the temperate climate region with average and median r values of 0 742 and 0 773 table a 2 respectively demonstrating that the downscaled sm data exhibited higher time series correlations in humid climates for the arid climate region it might be because of the inherently low sm in these extremely dry environments resulting in slight sm dynamic changes burgin et al 2017 making the ability of the model to capture these sm variations over time relatively poor in terms of the bias the arid climate region was observed to have an underestimated tendency while the continental climate region was found to have a relatively low bias that was close to zero fig 9c in terms of the rmse and ubrmse values the downscaled sm performed better in arid climate regions than in other climate regions fig 9 b d this may have been related to the relatively low vegetation attenuation in arid regions zhang et al 2019 fig 10 indicates that except for the two land cover types that contained an insufficient number of sites i e the 2 and 4 sites for the shrubland and non vegetated areas respectively the remaining land cover types i e forests woodlands grasslands and croplands all exhibited generally high r values with mean r values all above 0 675 table a 3 in terms of bias shrublands exhibited an overall underestimated tendency and grasslands exhibited a partially underestimated tendency with a mean bias of 0 029 m3 m3 and 0 006 m3 m3 table a 3 respectively whereas forests and woodlands exhibited an overestimated tendency positive bias in terms of the ubrmse values croplands exhibited the worst performance this may have been caused by the significant seasonal variations that occur in croplands during the crop irrigation harvest and bare soil periods kim 2013 jackson et al 2016 in addition although the number of sites representative of unvegetated areas was limited the rmse and ubrmse performances in these areas were generrally high 4 5 downscaled sm temporal dynamics to fully verify whether the downscaled sm could accurately reflect the temporally dynamic changes of sm over time 16 sites with varied surface cover types and climatic conditions were randomly chosen for analysis table 5 summarizes the detailed vegetation climate and soil properties information of these 16 sites fig 11 displays the geographic locations and surrounding environments of these sites fig 12 shows the time series analysis results of the smap sm and downscaled sm at these sites fig 12 demonstrates that the downscaled sm showed good temporal consistency with the in situ sm and was highly responsive to the precipitation data from fig 12 it can be seen that each precipitation event was accompanied by an obvious increase in the downscaled sm this indicates that the downscaled sm could accurately reflect the temporally dynamic variations that occur in in situ sm fig 13 displays the sm scatters at the 16 selected sites and the results show that the temporal consistency of the downscaled smap sm and in situ sm was strongly influenced by the climate type land cover type as well as soil properties for instance the downscaled sm in grasslands in temperate climates exhibited generally high r values e g buffalo jump lander lindsay watkinsville grassland and durham grassland with r values of 0 831 0 877 0 746 0 782 and 0 834 respectively which might be because grasslands are considered to be highly homogeneous and sensitive to sm changes during drought periods geruo et al 2017 the iowa validation site cropland generally had relatively low ubrmse values for both the downscaled and original smap sm with ubrmse values of 0 034 m3 m3 and 0 039 m3 m3 respectively in addition overestimation tendencies positive bias values were generally observed for woodland sites such as the millbrook site wabeno site and durham site e g a bias value of 0 209 m3 m3 was derived between the in situ sm and downscaled sm at the millbrook site for the gadsden and watkinsville sites which were located in humid subtropical grasslands and pastures with abundant precipitation throughout the year overestimation tendencies were observed this may be due to the main soil types around these sites being relatively well drained soils with high sand content e g the soil sand content at the watkinsville site was 60 and low clay content the soil clay content at the watkinsville site was 15 resulting in poor soil water retention following precipitation events moreover the sm values derived from point scale measurements cannot represent the average sm in the smap footprint range and this was also the cause of some deviation 4 6 downscaled sm spatial variability in this section we visually compare the spatial consistency between the original smap sm and the downscaled sm because of the short temporal variations in sm the downscaled sm was synthesized every seven days to obtain this 7 day synthesized sm image a 7 day mod09ga surface reflectance data was first synthesized wherein for each pixel a value was selected via the maximum ndvi value from all the acquisitions within the 7 day period then the 7 day mod11a1 data was synthesized utilizing a simple mean value method of all the corresponding lst pixels collected within that 7 day period fig 14 shows that the spatial distribution of the downscaled sm data was consistent with that of the original smap sm but the downscaled data provided more detailed spatial information the vegetation coverage and topographic attributes that represent the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface often lead to uncertainties in the spatial distribution of sm and these uncertainties affect the accuracy of downscaled sm piles et al 2011 to assess the extent to which the spatial distribution of the downscaled sm data reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface further visual inspections were performed in local areas fig 15 shows maps of the spatial distributions of the original smap and downscaled sm data over the states of arkansas and missouri during june 7th 13th 2015 the results indicate that the spatial pattern of the downscaled sm fig 15 b clearly reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the surface topography and vegetation status in addition the spatial patterns of the downscaled sm fig 15 b and original smap sm fig 15 a matched perfectly and the range of the downscaled sm data was wider than that of the original smap sm data 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of different scales to build the proposed wdl downscaling model the nearest neighbor sampling method was employed to upscale the high resolution input datasets to a 36 km resolution this preprocessing step however greatly smoothed the range of the input datasets for example the maximum and minimum elevation values at the 1 km resolution were 4295 m and 84 m respectively because of the smoothing effect the elevation range became 3928 m to 71 m when this dataset was upscaled to the 36 km coarse resolution similar phenomena must have existed in the other datasets since all datasets utilized in the construction of the model were smoothed and the extreme data were removed the extensiveness of the datapoints would be severely limited to a certain extent thus affecting the learning ability of the downscaling model afterward when the trained downscaling model was applied because the input datasets had finer resolutions of 1 km and contained greater spatial heterogeneity and richer spatial information some input dataset values that did not exist in the model training phase affected the model outputs furthermore scale differences also occurred during the verification phase when in situ sm data was used to assess the downscaled and original smap sm data that is mainly related to the unavoidable system differences between the satellite obversions and in situ sm datasets in addition to the differences among the various utilized in situ sm measurement networks crow et al 2012 colliander et al 2017a 5 2 impact of the auxiliary datasets used for the downscaling work from the perspective of obtaining effective sm coverage the downscaled sm data could not cover the entire conus this lack of coverage resulted from the absence of high resolution input datasets e g modis optical data which is susceptible to cloud and rain coverage downscaled sm data could be acquired only when all the high resolution input auxiliary datasets were available future efforts will focus more on fixing the losses associated with data issues and attempting to obtain a downscaled sm product that covers the entire study area 5 3 impact of the downscaling framework similar to most downscaling schemes park et al 2017 long et al 2019 our research was essentially based on exploring the relationships between variables e g lst surface spectral reflectance smris and other auxiliary information and satellite based smap sm satellite products to generate the downscaling model then the downscaled sm were obtained by applying the high resolution datasets to the generated downscaling model therefore inevitably the downscaled sm performance was affected by the uncertainties in the original coarse resolution sm products to a large extent wei et al 2018 long et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 in future research we will further explore the relationships between the downscaled sm and the ground based sm observations to alleviate this uncertainty problem and to make the downscaled sm as consistent with the in situ sm as possible 5 4 comparisons to other published sm downscaling methods the accuracy of downscaled soil moisture relies on the input auxiliary datasets and the downscaling method according to table 6 most downscaling studies based on physical hydrological and geostatistical models primarily use linear relationships to link surface variables to sm sánchez ruiz et al 2014 van der velde et al 2014 lorenz et al 2018 tagesson et al 2018 song et al 2019 ml methods e g svm rf and gradient boosted decision trees gbdt algorithms improve the performance of downscaling methods by fitting the complex nonlinear relationships between soil moisture and auxiliary surface parameters abbaszadeh et al 2019 wei et al 2018 hu et al 2020 in recent years dl methods have been shown to outperform traditional shallow network architectures e g svm and rf in exploring deeper nonlinear relationships between massive datasets and multiple features xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 however the application of dl methods to sm downscaling is still relatively lacking in addition these methods only use a few features of lst ndvi and topographic attributes ignoring the influence of soil attributes land cover and climate types however using only a few features cannot fully exploit the ability of dl methods to deal with deep nonlinear relationships among multiple features thus limiting further improvements in model accuracy a combination of all available data sources in dl methods is needed to generate highly accurate soil moisture products in this study we developed a new dl downscaling method based on the wdl algorithm and added land cover and climate type information in addition to the commonly used variables smirs lst topographic attributes and soil properties the results demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed wdl downscaling method with a mean ubrmse value of 0 041 m3 m3 is comparable to that of most published studies and even better in most cases table 6 e g abbaszadeh et al 2019 reported mean ubrmse values ranging from 0 040 0 047 m3 m3 and xu et al 2021 obtained a ubrmse of 0 052 m3 m3 however similar to other ml or dl methods the wdl method is also a black box that is difficult to explain im et al 2016 when the input samples are limited the ratio of the training and testing subsets as well as the number of hidden layers and neuron settings affect the final accuracy of the model 6 conclusions this study presented a framework based on the wdl algorithm to downscale the spatial resolution of the smap sm product from its original 36 km to a spatial resolution of 1 km using high resolution modis surface reflectance lst topographic attributes soil properties climate and land cover type information as auxiliary datasets the results demonstrate that the average ubrmse between the downscaled sm and in situ sm was 0 041 m3 m3 which basically satisfies the smap sm product accuracy requirement represented by a ubrmse value of approximately 0 04 m3 m3 the results of the sm spatial pattern analysis indicate that the downscaled sm not only retains the overall trend of the original smap sm but also provides more detailed and effective sm spatial information this research further confirms the superiority of introducing climate and land cover types to the proposed wdl downscaling scheme first our study results demonstrate that the wdl downscaling model outperformed the widely used dnn model in the absence of climate and land cover types the ubrmse of the wdl model was 10 lower than that of the dnn model whereas when climate and land cover types were added to both the wdl and dnn models the wdl s ubrmse became 8 lower than the dnn s furthermore introducing climate and land cover information improved the performance of both the wdl and dnn models with the ubrmse value decreasing by 8 and 10 in the wdl and dnn models respectively our proposed wdl downscaling method thus enriches and improves upon the existing downscaling models most of which are based on polynomial rf and nn algorithms additionally we explored the potential for obtaining reliable smris from the land surface spectral space the research results indicate that the tvmdi and ndvi are effective sm proxies in downscaling work it is worth mentioning that to our knowledge this is the first time that the tvmdi has been applied in large scale downscaling work and it was confirmed to be of great potential in sm retrieval work however considering that the relationships between sm and smris might be unstable and temporally varying smris evaluations are limited by dataset availabilities in this paper we applied smris only during the unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 in further research we will test whether these indices can also be applied during other periods furthermore the issue of data losses in areas with cloud or shadow coverage during the data pre progressing step will be fixed in the future to achieve a downscaled sm map that could cover the entire study area in conclusion the new sm downscaling framework proposed herein based on the wdl algorithm was shown to have high accuracy and good application prospects given that wdl algorithms have rarely been utilized and validated in sm retrieval or downscaling work in remote sensing related fields our findings are encouraging especially considering the complex topographic and climate

3438,soil moisture sm plays a critical role in drought monitoring agricultural management flood forecasting and other practical applications however the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of sm products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals approximately 25 55 km greatly hamper their local scale applications in this research we proposed an sm downscaling framework based on the wide deep learning wdl method to improve the spatial resolution of the level 3 daily composite of soil moisture active passive smap radiometer sm product l3 sm p in this method horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperature tbh and tbv respectively surface reflectance and land surface temperature lst topographic attributes soil properties climate types and landcover types collected in the continental united states conus during the annual unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the smap sm l3 sm p product from its original 36 km to 1 km precipitation and in situ sm measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the international soil moisture network ismn over the conus were utilized to validate the downscaled sm the results demonstrated that the correlation r between the downscaled and the in situ sm ranged from 0 325 to 0 997 the average r value was 0 715 the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse values ranged from 0 010 to 0 141 m3 m3 with an average ubrmse of 0 041 m3 m3 which meets the accuracy of smap sm requirement of ubrmse approximately 0 04 m 3 m3 the downscaled sm also showed good temporal consistency with the in situ sm and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data the downscaled sm not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original smap sm but also provides more detailed spatial sm variations keywords soil moisture downscaling smap wide deep learning method the continental united states 1 introduction soil moisture sm plays an indispensable role in global carbon terrestrial energy and water balance abbaszadeh et al 2019 jung et al 2017 and also provides valuable information for drought monitoring agricultural irrigation and water resource management martínez fernández et al 2016 colliander et al 2017a b renzullo et al 2014 however traditional ground based sm measurements lack spatiotemporal continuity collow et al 2012 microwave remote sensing techniques utilize wavelengths longer than the visible and infrared bands and these longer wavelengths are less affected by weather conditions e g clouds and precipitation which could thus supply massive spatiotemporally continuous global sm observations at a high revisitation frequency peng et al 2017 abbaszadeh et al 2019 at present many active and passive microwave sensors have been launched to acquire surface sm including the advanced microwave scanning radiometer on the earth observing system amsr e jackson et al 2010 sridhar et al 2013 soil moisture and ocean salinity smos jackson et al 2012 kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap sensors entekhabi et al 2010 inevitably these sensors have some drawbacks active sensors such as the european remote sensing ers satellite provide observed data that are considerably influenced by scattering from the land surface roughness and vegetation structures verhoest et al 2008 wagner et al 2013 in contrast passive microwave sensors have a certain ability to penetrate vegetation and are less sensitive to scattering however the coarse spatial resolutions of most passive microwave products approximately 25 55 km greatly limit their practical application piles et al 2011 entekhabi et al 2010 molero et al 2016 by combining passive and active sensors it seems possible to provide reliable sm at finer spatial resolutions the soil moisture active passive smap satellite was therefore designed to provide global scale sm estimates at a 9 km resolution by using both active radar backscatter and passive radiometer observations entekhabi et al 2010 mcnairn et al 2015 kim and lakshmi 2018 unfortunately due to a malfunction of the active radar in july 2015 only the passive radiometer sensors still function and continue to provide land surface 0 5 cm sm estimates at a 36 km spatial resolution however sentinel 1 observations are expected to replace the malfunctioning radar but this alternative will be limited to areas where the smap and sentinel 1 observations overlap jagdhuber et al 2017 das et al 2018 by introducing a variety of high resolution auxiliary information the researchers have developed a number of downscaling methods such as statistical physical and hydrological based models to improve the coarse spatial resolutions of satellite sm products sánchez ruiz et al 2014 fang et al 2020 fang et al 2021 senanayake et al 2021 qu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 recently machine learning ml techniques have proved to be advantageous in dealing with complex nonlinear relationships between sm and sm related land surface variables more researchers have adopted ml methods to improve the performance of downscaling methods santi et al 2016 wei et al 2018 abowarda et al 2021 for instance abbaszadeh et al 2019 used a random forest rf algorithm to obtain a 1 km resolution smap sm with an average unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 47 m3 m3 qu et al 2021 found that rf and gaussian process regression gpr algorithms exhibited the highest accuracies and stabilities compared to physical modeling and geostatistical algorithms compared with these traditional shallow network architectures e g rf gpr deep learning dl can learn higher level deeper features of massive datasets zhao et al 2022 xu et al 2021 found that the convolutional neural network cnn algorithm achieves better results than the support vector machine svm and rf algorithms zhao et al 2022 found that the residual network resnet algorithm exhibits a superior ability to enhance spatial texture details compared to rf as it can meet the requirements of fitting sm to complex surfaces however the applications of dl to sm downscaling work are still lacking in addition fewer features i e ndvi lst and topography are contained in these dl downscaling algorithms which are not sufficient to characterize the complex sm conditions of the land surface as a result when generating higher resolution sm data the accuracy is reduced to some extent since they do not fully exploit their advantages in mining multiple features of massive data in this study we developed and evaluated a new dl algorithm to generate high resolution sm from smap observations the main motivations for this work are twofold first we explored the wide deep learning wdl algorithms as a possible alternative or supplement to the existing downscaling algorithms the wdl method has been successfully implemented in medicine the internet of things and industrial fields cheng et al 2016 xu et al 2021a wilson et al 2021 sree et al 2021 however it is not obvious whether the wdl method works equally well in remote sensing related sm retrieval studies given the large differences i e data types study objects etc between these fields second we investigated the potential of introducing features of climatic and land cover types to improve the dl method s performance since climate and landcover types have been shown to have a great influence on the spatial distribution of sm kim 2013 zhang et al 2019 de lannoy et al 2014 entekhabi et al 2014 schmugge 1980 they could be used to strengthen the connection between satellite sm and surface features in this proposed wdl downscaling method features of climates and landcover types were introduced in addition to the commonly used auxiliary features i e sm related indices smris lst topographic attributes and soil properties these features which were derived from different auxiliary datasets acquired over the conus during the annual unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 were used for the development and analysis of the applied downscaling method the in situ sm and precipitation data collected from 211 sites distributed in the international soil moisture network ismn in 2015 were used to evaluate the performance of the developed downscaling method 2 datasets 2 1 smap sm dataset the smap l3 sm p sm product

strengthen the correlation between the downscaling variables and smap sm the smap sm product is a daily composite product posted on a 36 km equal area scalable earth ease grid this product contains sm observations from both the descending 6 00 am and ascending 6 00 pm orbits to decrease the influence of seasonal variabilities in the downscaling model sabaghy et al 2018 peng et al 2017 and reduce the uncertainty of the smap sm product during frozen periods liu et al 2019 only datasets collected during the unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 were selected in addition we chose only the smap sm obtained at the 6 00 am overpass to reduce the observation errors caused by faraday rotations as well as those caused by the temperature differences between the soil and canopy

wetness index twi abbaszadeh et al 2019 crow et al 2012 topographic attributes have been adopted in many sm downscaling studies ranney et al 2015 coleman and niemann 2013 in this study topographic attributes elevation slope and topographic complexity derived from the srtm dataset at a 90 m resolution were served as the 3rd auxiliary dataset type input in the downscaling method these data were provided by nasa jarvis et al 2008 and can be obtained from the file transfer protocol ftp site of the united states geological survey usgs 2 4 soil property dataset soil properties e g the soil clay

derived from the supervised classification of modis terra and aqua reflectance data we used the first classification system under which 16 land cover types were identified in the conus see fig 1 these

1st to november 1st in 2015 fig 1 were used as an important reference dataset to evaluate the performance of the sm downscaling method the utilized ismn measurements were obtained from three sm monitoring networks the cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos u s climate reference network uscrn and soil climate analysis network scan https ismn geo tuwien ac at dorigo et al 2011 these sites comprise geographic regions with different climate types soil properties and land cover types thus allowing us to thoroughly evaluate the proposed downscaling method it must be mentioned that there are systematic differences between satellite and ground based sm measurements as well as discrepancies among different ground based sm networks these systemic differences include spatial representation measurement depth sm retrieval algorithm surface parameterization uncertainty and precipitation event sensitivity variations within the same pixel colliander et al 2017a crow et al 2012 discussions regarding the accuracies and uncertainties associated with different sm networks can be found in several studies by coopersmith et al 2016 and zreda et al 2012 table 3 provides a brief description of the sm networks used in this study 2 8 precipitation dataset many researchers have used precipitation data as an effective reference when estimating the accuracies of sm downscaling methods seneviratne et al 2010 abbaszadeh et al 2019 in this study the era5 daily total precipitation dataset with a 0 25 resolution served as another reference dataset when evaluating the proposed downscaling method era5 is the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf global climate and atmosphere reanalysis product this reanalysis product combines data derived from models and observations around the world to create a complete and consistent global dataset the era5 dataset contains atmospheric records such as air temperature total precipitation and surface pressure information since 1979 and can be obtained from https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp 3 methodology 3 1 data preparation and preprocessing the smap product was quality controlled and only values marked with the recommended retrieval quality were kept clouds and noise effects were removed from the mod09ga and mod11a1 products and only high quality pixels with were retained all datasets selected for use in our sm downscaling work were uniformly reprojected onto the world geodetic system wgs 1984 projection and cropped to the research region in the process of building the sm downscaling model to match the coarse resolution of the original smap sm product the auxiliary datasets the smap tb tbh tbv modis surface reflectance lst srtm topography soil property land cover types and climate classification products were upscaled to a 36 km resolution using the nearest neighbor interpolation method parker et al 1983 hay et al 1997 the nearest neighbor interpolation assignment does not change any cell values in the input raster datasets and functions for both categories and continuous value types therefore this method was applied during the upscaling aggregation process in this study 3 2 feature selection feature selection is the essential process applied in machine learning algorithms to select representative features and build robust models hall 1999 in this study a total of 30 variables were used as candidate features including 9 smris table 2 the lst 7 surface reflectance bands 6 soil properties 3 topographic attributes climate classifications land cover types and 2 smap tbs the feature selection process was based on the correlations between the dependent and independent variables in this process the original smap sm product with a 36 km resolution was considered the dependent variable while the 30 features were considered independent variables 3 3 downscaling framework based on the wide deep learning method in this research we proposed a new downscaling framework based on the wdl algorithm a schematic diagram of the proposed sm downscaling framework can be seen in fig 2 this framework mainly includes the following three steps 1 feature selection the optimal features were firstly selected from the 30 features derived from the 6 input auxiliary dataset types across the conus during the unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 2 training the selected features inputs were upscaled to a 36 km spatial resolution to match the spatial resolution of the original smap sm product the target data after which a coarse scale wdl model was trained 3 predicting the wdl model trained in the second step was transferred to the selected features of 1 km spatial resolution to generate the downscaled sm data 3 3 1 wdl method as a classic dl method the wdl algorithm was proposed by cheng et al 2016 unlike the commonly used deep neural network dnn model this wdl method combines the dnn model with a generalized linear model glm that contains a few features in the wdl method the dnn component has a proclivity for exploring and generalizing data patterns that have never or rarely occurred in the past whereas the glm is able to learn from patterns that have already appeared in historical data the wdl method combines the advantages of the dnn model and the generalized linear model glm to make the entire network structure more robust this method could be used to not only fully explore the nonlinear relationships within massively deep and high dimensional data via the dnn model but also employ the glm model to precisely fine tune the results thus making the modeling results more reasonable and accurate for the detailed process of the proposed wdl downscaling algorithm please refer to appendix a 1 in this study several features that exhibited the stronger correlations with smap sm were employed as glm input features in the wdl method forcing the model to place a greater emphasis on these features by giving them higher weights this process could improve the accuracy of the final modeling results more than that of only using the dnn model this assumption is verified in section 4 2 the dnn component of the wdl method contains three layers types the input layer hidden layer and output layer cybenko 1989 the number of neurons in the input layer is the same as the number of selected features whereas the number of neurons in the output layer is set to 1 in reference to the output target sm data the number of hidden layer neurons as well as the number of hidden layers are both determined by the complexity of the relationship between the inputs and outputs theoretically having more neurons and hidden layers could potentially improve the resulting estimation accuracy however excessive increases in the number of hidden layers of neurons may cause the training data to overfit meaning that the trained model would be less accurate when applied to other independent data we trained several sets of wdl models with the total numbers of hidden layers ranging from 2 to 5 and the total numbers of neurons in each hidden layer set to 16 32 64 or 128 for the dnn component we used a fully connected feedforward network in which all the neurons in the upper layer were linked to all the neurons in the next layer these connections were then assigned weights which each neuron used to calculate the synaptic weight of the weighted sum of all inputs plus the bias before applying the transfer function the neurons contained in the input and output layers used linear transfer functions while the neurons contained in the hidden layer used the typical tangent sigmoid transfer function 3 3 2 wdl model training to assess the functional relationship between the model inputs selected features and output targets smap sm an extensive and representative subset had to be trained this subset covered the entire conus region to the greatest possible extent and was called the training subset in this study a total of 578 896 pixels were extracted from the dataset images over the conus during the unfrozen season from 2015 to 2017 among these pixels the training validation and testing subsets accounted for 80 10 and 10 of the total pixels respectively the training and validation subsets were mainly used to train and fine tune the wdl model in which the validation subset was utilized to determine whether the wdl model weights resulted in overfitting during the process of model training the testing subset served as an independent dataset and was used to assess the fit of the final trained wdl model the training process involved the iterative optimization of the wdl synaptic weights to minimize the errors between the model outputs and target data when the mean square error mse between the wdl output and target data was 0 001 m3 m3 and the wdl model training process did not converge to a solution after a maximum threshold number of iterations here this threshold was set to 300 the training process was stopped upon each iteration the mse between the wdl model estimation and the target value smap sm of the validation subset was calculated when the wdl model did not improve after numerous iterations here the epoch was set to 10 the training process was terminated and the weight was returned to the best iteration record as the final solution here we applied the error backpropagation method rumelhart et al 1995 to update the weights after the training step was stopped the root mean square error rmse between the wdl model sm estimation value and the target value smap sm of the testing subset was calculated to evaluate whether the model fit and the model with the smallest rmse was selected as the optimal model 3 4 comparisons among models with several schemes to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed wdl downscaling scheme when introducing climate and land cover types we performed four schemes as comparisons these schemes are as follows 1 the wdl model in which climate and land cover types were introduced 2 the wdl model in which no climate or land cover types were introduced 3 the dnn model in which climate and land cover types were introduced and 4 the dnn model in which no climate or land cover types were introduced these four schemes employed the same training validation and testing subsets 3 5 evaluation method four statistical metrics including the pearson correlation coefficient r rmse ubrmse and bias eqs 1 4 willmott 1982 were used to evaluate the performance of the wdl model as well as the accuracy of the sm downscaling process r is a commonly used metric for measuring the correlation between two variables r values range from 1 to 1 the bias demonstrates whether data are overestimated positive or underestimated negative in the ideal case the bias value is close to 0 indicating relatively accurate results the ubrmse is the most commonly used metric for measuring smap product accuracies these metrics are calculated as follows 1 rmse e θ smap θ in s i t u 2 2 ubrmse e θ smap e θ smap θ in s i t u e θ in s i t u 2 3 bias e θ smap e θ in s i t u 4 r e θ smap e θ smap θ in s i t u e θ in s i t u σ smap σ in s i t u where e represents the mean operator θ in situ and θ smap refer to the in situ sm and smap sm respectively and σ smap and σ in situ are the standard deviations of the smap sm and in situ sm respectively 4 results 4 1 feature selection results it should be mentioned that we are most concerned about the generalization ability and accuracy of the proposed wdl downscaling model because dl algorithms are mostly based on massive data and use nonlinear activation functions there is no need to be excessively concerned about collinearities among variables as long as the features have independent physical definitions and are derived from independent data sources and there are no precise correlations among features r values close to 1 or 1 incorporating them will assist in reducing the dataset noise in the feature selection phase we first chose features that were acceptably correlated with smap sm here after a couple of tests we set the absolute r value greater than 0 2 as the acceptable threshold moreover when variables had high self correlations r 0 9 and were derived from the same data source an either or choice was made such as mpdi and pdi or evi and ndvi after the feature selection phase among the 30 established features 14 features were found to satisfy the criteria and were therefore selected to construct the wdl model the correlations between these selected features and smap sm as well as the inter correlations among these features are shown in table 4 and fig 3 respectively these features included 2 smris the ndvi and tvmdi 2 smap tbs the tbv and tbh 3 soil properties the soil clay content soil ph and soil organic carbon content 2 topographic attributes the elevation and slope the lst climate and land cover types and 2 surface reflectance bands modis bands 4 and 7 which correspond to the green band green and mid wave infrared mwir the selected 14 features were employed as input features in the dnn component of the wdl model among these selected features three features table 4 in bold that exhibited the strongest connections with smap sm were chosen as input features in the glm component of the wdl model to force the model to place more emphasis on these three features and give them higher weights 4 2 validation of the proposed downscaling method after training multiple wdl downscaling models we finally chose an optimal wdl model that consisted of 2 hidden layers in which there were 128 neurons in the first layer and 64 neurons in the second layer this wdl network was selected because it had improved accuracy and stability and adding more hidden layers or neurons did not improve its performance the performance of the wdl downscaling model is shown in fig 4 and the results demonstrate that the three subsets the training testing and validation subsets had similar values in terms of ubrmse and r metrics thus indicating that the optimal wdl model did not exhibit overfitting and was able to effectively generalize to data other than the training data in addition the r values for all three subsets were very high approximately 0 98 also the fitted line of the sm value predicted by this model the red line in fig 4 was very close to the 1 1 fitted line the dashed line indicating that this wdl downscaling model was able to learn the relationships between the features and target smap sm well at coarse resolution moreover the downscaling scheme in which climate and land cover types were introduced using the proposed wdl method was compared with several other downscaling schemes as shown in fig 5 the results demonstrated that the proposed wdl method for introducing climate and land cover type schemes was the most accurate in addition the results confirmed that the wdl downscaling method outperformed the widely used dnn model fig 5 demonstrates that the ubrmse value of the wdl model was 10 lower than that of the dnn model in the absence of climate and land cover types when climate and land cover types were added to both the wdl and dnn models the ubrmse of the wdl model was 8 lower than that of the dnn model in addition the results indicated that the performance of both the wdl and dnn models improved with the addition of climate and land cover information with the ubrmse values decreasing by 8 and 10 for the wdl and dnn models respectively 4 3 overall performance of the downscaled sm the downscaled sm data with 1 km resolution was verified using the in situ sm data collected from the ismn network over the conus from april 1st to november 1st 2015 all available in situ sm measurements are shown in fig 6 and the evaluation results are shown in figs 7 8 fig 7 displays the spatial distributions of the r and ubrmse values for all ismn sites the results reveal that over 60 of the sites corresponded to r values higher than 0 70 and more than 60 of the sites had ubrmse values below 0 04 m3 m3 moreover fig 7 a shows that overall high r values were observed between the downscaled sm and in situ sm in almost the entire conus region except for a few sites near the rocky mountains in mountainous and rugged topography the accuracy and reliability of microwave inversion products are relatively low partly due to the complexity of the surface roughness within the coverage of in situ instruments resulting in certain deviations in the measurements schmugge 1980 moreover remote sensing data collected in mountainous and topographically complex areas is often marked as low quality and discarded and this might decrease the ability of the wdl algorithm to capture the sm distribution in these areas during the training phase in flat areas far away from mountains the correlations are generally higher a taylor diagram 2001 was presented to show the performance comparisons of the downscaled and in situ sm for the different networks cosmos uscrn and uscan as shown in fig 8 this diagram combines three important statistical indicators the centered rmse r and standard deviation sdv ratio the black dot is regarded as a reference point at which all indicators are considered optimal the taylor diagram shows that the r values between the downscaled sm and in situ sm were over 0 7 for most sites moreover the sdv ratios of most scan and uscrn sites were lower than 1 indicating that the in situ sm had higher variability than the downscaled sm this was mostly due to the two networks being based on traditional point scale sm monitoring techniques that cannot represent downscaled sm at a 1 km spatial resolution scale collow et al 2012 therefore the sm variabilities resulting from the use of point scale measurements in these two networks were larger than those of the downscaled sm especially for sites with severe spatial heterogeneity e g varied topographies climate conditions soil properties vegetation or land cover types for cosmos sites on the other hand the average sm was acquired within a footprint of approximately 670 m in diameter duygu and akyurek 2019 this footprint range is closer to the spatial resolution of the downscaled sm thus resulting in less spatial variabilities compared to the scan and uscrn networks 4 4 downscaled sm performance over varied climate and land cover types in this section we evaluate the performance of the downscaled sm data in different climate and land cover types across the conus all 211 ismn sites were classified into three major climate categories and six major land cover types the specific classification references were mainly based on the results of zhang et al 2019 the evaluation results are presented in the form of boxplots in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 indicates that mean r values for all three climate regions were generally higher than 0 677 in addition the overall high r values were observed in the temperate climate region with average and median r values of 0 742 and 0 773 table a 2 respectively demonstrating that the downscaled sm data exhibited higher time series correlations in humid climates for the arid climate region it might be because of the inherently low sm in these extremely dry environments resulting in slight sm dynamic changes burgin et al 2017 making the ability of the model to capture these sm variations over time relatively poor in terms of the bias the arid climate region was observed to have an underestimated tendency while the continental climate region was found to have a relatively low bias that was close to zero fig 9c in terms of the rmse and ubrmse values the downscaled sm performed better in arid climate regions than in other climate regions fig 9 b d this may have been related to the relatively low vegetation attenuation in arid regions zhang et al 2019 fig 10 indicates that except for the two land cover types that contained an insufficient number of sites i e the 2 and 4 sites for the shrubland and non vegetated areas respectively the remaining land cover types i e forests woodlands grasslands and croplands all exhibited generally high r values with mean r values all above 0 675 table a 3 in terms of bias shrublands exhibited an overall underestimated tendency and grasslands exhibited a partially underestimated tendency with a mean bias of 0 029 m3 m3 and 0 006 m3 m3 table a 3 respectively whereas forests and woodlands exhibited an overestimated tendency positive bias in terms of the ubrmse values croplands exhibited the worst performance this may have been caused by the significant seasonal variations that occur in croplands during the crop irrigation harvest and bare soil periods kim 2013 jackson et al 2016 in addition although the number of sites representative of unvegetated areas was limited the rmse and ubrmse performances in these areas were generrally high 4 5 downscaled sm temporal dynamics to fully verify whether the downscaled sm could accurately reflect the temporally dynamic changes of sm over time 16 sites with varied surface cover types and climatic conditions were randomly chosen for analysis table 5 summarizes the detailed vegetation climate and soil properties information of these 16 sites fig 11 displays the geographic locations and surrounding environments of these sites fig 12 shows the time series analysis results of the smap sm and downscaled sm at these sites fig 12 demonstrates that the downscaled sm showed good temporal consistency with the in situ sm and was highly responsive to the precipitation data from fig 12 it can be seen that each precipitation event was accompanied by an obvious increase in the downscaled sm this indicates that the downscaled sm could accurately reflect the temporally dynamic variations that occur in in situ sm fig 13 displays the sm scatters at the 16 selected sites and the results show that the temporal consistency of the downscaled smap sm and in situ sm was strongly influenced by the climate type land cover type as well as soil properties for instance the downscaled sm in grasslands in temperate climates exhibited generally high r values e g buffalo jump lander lindsay watkinsville grassland and durham grassland with r values of 0 831 0 877 0 746 0 782 and 0 834 respectively which might be because grasslands are considered to be highly homogeneous and sensitive to sm changes during drought periods geruo et al 2017 the iowa validation site cropland generally had relatively low ubrmse values for both the downscaled and original smap sm with ubrmse values of 0 034 m3 m3 and 0 039 m3 m3 respectively in addition overestimation tendencies positive bias values were generally observed for woodland sites such as the millbrook site wabeno site and durham site e g a bias value of 0 209 m3 m3 was derived between the in situ sm and downscaled sm at the millbrook site for the gadsden and watkinsville sites which were located in humid subtropical grasslands and pastures with abundant precipitation throughout the year overestimation tendencies were observed this may be due to the main soil types around these sites being relatively well drained soils with high sand content e g the soil sand content at the watkinsville site was 60 and low clay content the soil clay content at the watkinsville site was 15 resulting in poor soil water retention following precipitation events moreover the sm values derived from point scale measurements cannot represent the average sm in the smap footprint range and this was also the cause of some deviation 4 6 downscaled sm spatial variability in this section we visually compare the spatial consistency between the original smap sm and the downscaled sm because of the short temporal variations in sm the downscaled sm was synthesized every seven days to obtain this 7 day synthesized sm image a 7 day mod09ga surface reflectance data was first synthesized wherein for each pixel a value was selected via the maximum ndvi value from all the acquisitions within the 7 day period then the 7 day mod11a1 data was synthesized utilizing a simple mean value method of all the corresponding lst pixels collected within that 7 day period fig 14 shows that the spatial distribution of the downscaled sm data was consistent with that of the original smap sm but the downscaled data provided more detailed spatial information the vegetation coverage and topographic attributes that represent the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface often lead to uncertainties in the spatial distribution of sm and these uncertainties affect the accuracy of downscaled sm piles et al 2011 to assess the extent to which the spatial distribution of the downscaled sm data reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface further visual inspections were performed in local areas fig 15 shows maps of the spatial distributions of the original smap and downscaled sm data over the states of arkansas and missouri during june 7th 13th 2015 the results indicate that the spatial pattern of the downscaled sm fig 15 b clearly reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the surface topography and vegetation status in addition the spatial patterns of the downscaled sm fig 15 b and original smap sm fig 15 a matched perfectly and the range of the downscaled sm data was wider than that of the original smap sm data 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of different scales to build the proposed wdl downscaling model the nearest neighbor sampling method was employed to upscale the high resolution input datasets to a 36 km resolution this preprocessing step however greatly smoothed the range of the input datasets for example the maximum and minimum elevation values at the 1 km resolution were 4295 m and 84 m respectively because of the smoothing effect the elevation range became 3928 m to 71 m when this dataset was upscaled to the 36 km coarse resolution similar phenomena must have existed in the other datasets since all datasets utilized in the construction of the model were smoothed and the extreme data were removed the extensiveness of the datapoints would be severely limited to a certain extent thus affecting the learning ability of the downscaling model afterward when the trained downscaling model was applied because the input datasets had finer resolutions of 1 km and contained greater spatial heterogeneity and richer spatial information some input dataset values that did not exist in the model training phase affected the model outputs furthermore scale differences also occurred during the verification phase when in situ sm data was used to assess the downscaled and original smap sm data that is mainly related to the unavoidable system differences between the satellite obversions and in situ sm datasets in addition to the differences among the various utilized in situ sm measurement networks crow et al 2012 colliander et al 2017a 5 2 impact of the auxiliary datasets used for the downscaling work from the perspective of obtaining effective sm coverage the downscaled sm data could not cover the entire conus this lack of coverage resulted from the absence of high resolution input datasets e g modis optical data which is susceptible to cloud and rain coverage downscaled sm data could be acquired only when all the high resolution input auxiliary datasets were available future efforts will focus more on fixing the losses associated with data issues and attempting to obtain a downscaled sm product that covers the entire study area 5 3 impact of the downscaling framework similar to most downscaling schemes park et al 2017 long et al 2019 our research was essentially based on exploring the relationships between variables e g lst surface spectral reflectance smris and other auxiliary information and satellite based smap sm satellite products to generate the downscaling model then the downscaled sm were obtained by applying the high resolution datasets to the generated downscaling model therefore inevitably the downscaled sm performance was affected by the uncertainties in the original coarse resolution sm products to a large extent wei et al 2018 long et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 in future research we will further explore the relationships between the downscaled sm and the ground based sm observations to alleviate this uncertainty problem and to make the downscaled sm as consistent with the in situ sm as possible 5 4 comparisons to other published sm downscaling methods the accuracy of downscaled soil moisture relies on the input auxiliary datasets and the downscaling method according to table 6 most downscaling studies based on physical hydrological and geostatistical models primarily use linear relationships to link surface variables to sm sánchez ruiz et al 2014 van der velde et al 2014 lorenz et al 2018 tagesson et al 2018 song et al 2019 ml methods e g svm rf and gradient boosted decision trees gbdt algorithms improve the performance of downscaling methods by fitting the complex nonlinear relationships between soil moisture and auxiliary surface parameters abbaszadeh et al 2019 wei et al 2018 hu et al 2020 in recent years dl methods have been shown to outperform traditional shallow network architectures e g svm and rf in exploring deeper nonlinear relationships between massive datasets and multiple features xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 however the application of dl methods to sm downscaling is still relatively lacking in addition these methods only use a few features of lst ndvi and topographic attributes ignoring the influence of soil attributes land cover and climate types however using only a few features cannot fully exploit the ability of dl methods to deal with deep nonlinear relationships among multiple features thus limiting further improvements in model accuracy a combination of all available data sources in dl methods is needed to generate highly accurate soil moisture products in this study we developed a new dl downscaling method based on the wdl algorithm and added land cover and climate type information in addition to the commonly used variables smirs lst topographic attributes and soil properties the results demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed wdl downscaling method with a mean ubrmse value of 0 041 m3 m3 is comparable to that of most published studies and even better in most cases table 6 e g abbaszadeh et al 2019 reported mean ubrmse values ranging from 0 040 0 047 m3 m3 and xu et al 2021 obtained a ubrmse of 0 052 m3 m3 however similar to other ml or dl methods the wdl method is also a black box that is difficult to explain im et al 2016 when the input samples are limited the ratio of the training and testing subsets as well as the number of hidden layers and neuron settings affect the final accuracy of the model 6 conclusions this study presented a framework based on the wdl algorithm to downscale the spatial resolution of the smap sm product from its original 36 km to a spatial resolution of 1 km using high resolution modis surface reflectance lst topographic attributes soil properties climate and land cover type information as auxiliary datasets the results demonstrate that the average ubrmse between the downscaled sm and in situ sm was 0 041 m3 m3 which basically satisfies the smap sm product accuracy requirement represented by a ubrmse value of approximately 0 04 m3 m3 the results of the sm spatial pattern analysis indicate that the downscaled sm not only retains the overall trend of the original smap sm but also provides more detailed and effective sm spatial information this research further confirms the superiority of introducing climate and land cover types to the proposed wdl downscaling scheme first our study results demonstrate that the wdl downscaling model outperformed the widely used dnn model in the absence of climate and land cover types the ubrmse of the wdl model was 10 lower than that of the dnn model whereas when climate and land cover types were added to both the wdl and dnn models the wdl s ubrmse became 8 lower than the dnn s furthermore introducing climate and land cover information improved the performance of both the wdl and dnn models with the ubrmse value decreasing by 8 and 10 in the wdl and dnn models respectively our proposed wdl downscaling method thus enriches and improves upon the existing downscaling models most of which are based on polynomial rf and nn algorithms additionally we explored the potential for obtaining reliable smris from the land surface spectral space the research results indicate that the tvmdi and ndvi are effective sm proxies in downscaling work it is worth mentioning that to our knowledge this is the first time that the tvmdi has been applied in large scale downscaling work and it was confirmed to be of great potential in sm retrieval work however considering that the relationships between sm and smris might be unstable and temporally varying smris evaluations are limited by dataset availabilities in this paper we applied smris only during the unfrozen season april 1st to november 1st from 2015 to 2017 in further research we will test whether these indices can also be applied during other periods furthermore the issue of data losses in areas with cloud or shadow coverage during the data pre progressing step will be fixed in the future to achieve a downscaled sm map that could cover the entire study area in conclusion the new sm downscaling framework proposed herein based on the wdl algorithm was shown to have high accuracy and good application prospects given that wdl algorithms have rarely been utilized and validated in sm retrieval or downscaling work in remote sensing related fields our findings are encouraging especially considering the complex topographic and climate

3439,soil moisture sm is a key variable in the surface energy balance and water cycle and its spatiotemporal dynamics are of great significance to climate agriculture and other fields optical remote sensing has been widely used to estimate sm with relatively fine spatial resolution however optical observations are easily contaminated by clouds making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous sm over large regions in the present study a semimonthly sm dataset over the study area of the entire inner mongolia region with nearly full spatial coverage was derived from the synergistic use of china s feng yun fy geostationary fy 4a and polar orbit fy 3d observations following a previously developed trapezoid feature space in a pixel to pixel manner a preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types grassland and cropland in the study region where the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas and the soil moisture active passive smap sm products were provided as references the results indicated that the estimated sm was well correlated to the referenced sm datasets with a significant correlation coefficient varying from 0 5 to 0 8 furthermore for the grassland cropland unbiased root mean square errors of approximately 0 062 0 097 m3 m3 and 0 055 0 069 m3 m3 can be found when comparing the estimated sm with the cldas and the smap product respectively keywords soil moisture feng yun satellite data trapezoid feature space spatially continuous 1 introduction as one of the most active components in the water cycle and energy balance soil moisture sm deeply participates in a number of physicochemical processes between the atmosphere and earth peñuelas et al 1993 chauhan et al 2003 liu et al 2016 holzman et al 2014 mohamed et al 2019 on the one hand sm is emitted through surface runoff and evapotranspiration which directly affects the atmospheric water content leading to changes in climate and precipitation when the regulation system is out of balance it will cause droughts or floods on the other hand infiltration determines the amount of soil water content or ground water storage which directly affects the ability of plants to absorb water and the accumulation of nutrients as a result it is evident that sm not only directly influences the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere but also indirectly affects the sustainable development of society and human activities therefore increasing attention has been devoted to obtaining spatiotemporal sm dynamics moran et al 1994 kim et al 2013 he et al 2014 amazirh et al 2018 yadav et al 2020 traditional approaches often measure sm with sensors stored in soil layers advantages behind such approaches include less influence on atmospheric underlying surface conditions and relatively high accuracy however it commonly suffers from a major difficulty that traditional approaches are only available in a limited area due to the high land surface heterogeneity remote sensing provides an unprecedented alternative to estimate sm at regional or even global scales in the past few decades a number of algorithms have been developed to obtain sm with various satellite observations paloscia et al 2006 das et al 2010 mladenova et al 2014 leng et al 2016 reichle et al 2019 chaubell et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 2021 li et al 2021 currently optical and microwave observations are two main satellite data sources for estimating sm in general microwaves are more sensitive to the dielectric constant of water and soil making them more frequently used for obtaining sm specifically active microwave commonly exhibits high spatial resolution whereas the temporal resolution is poor nevertheless several active microwave based sm products such as the advanced scatterometer and the sentinel 1 surface soil moisture version 1 have been developed for various applications by contrast the superiorities of high temporal resolution and less influence by atmospheres have promoted the practicability of passive microwave based sm retrieval in recent decades as a consequence a number of passive microwave based sm products such as the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 have been developed for usage in various domains including global climate changes and water cycles champagne et al 2015 wigneron et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 to date the estimation of sm from passive microwave observations is still the mainstream and has been of great concern wigneron et al 2017 meng et al 2019 tong et al 2020 yao et al 2021 nevertheless passive microwaves still suffer from several limitations specifically due to the weak signal emission of the band sensitive to sm it can only be monitored by large area observations so that the spatial resolution of passive microwaves is generally coarse usually more than 25 km making passive microwave based sm products more feasible at the global scale in addition microwave remote sensing will cause the attenuation of high frequency sm signals so it is difficult to obtain sm in areas with high vegetation coverage furthermore subject to the noise from radio interference namely radio frequency interference rfi kerr et al 2012 observation gaps commonly occur on most of the currently available microwave based sm products in contrast optical remote sensing with higher spatial resolution 30 m to 5 km is more suitable for the study of watershed or even field scales in the past decade optical based land surface parameters from landsat with a high spatial resolution of 30 m to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with a medium resolution of 1 km have been widely used to estimate sm amani et al 2016 mobasheri et al 2016 babaeian et al 2018 xu et al 2018 mohseni and mokhtarzade 2020 han et al 2020 moreover many scholars have also tried to obtain sm from optical based geostationary satellite data with a spatial resolution of 3 to 5 km leng et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ghilain et al 2019 among these optical based sm retrieval approaches the trapezoid feature space method constituted by land surface temperature lst and fractional vegetation cover fvc denoted as lst fvc trapezoid hereafter has received the most attention in past decades leng et al 2017 2019 zhao et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 however because optical remote sensing is susceptible to clouds it is still a challenge to obtain sm under cloudy conditions following the trapezoid feature space method several previous investigations have been dedicated to determining sm estimates over cloudy pixels thus providing spatially continuous sm at high spatial resolution a possible way to obtain sm under cloudy pixels is to take advantage of atmospheric variables however the estimated sm over cloudy pixels commonly reveals a decreased accuracy compared to those over clear sky pixels leng et al 2017 2019 in the past few years a number of algorithms have been developed to restore ground pixel information especially for the most critical variable of lst in the trapezoid feature space method contaminated by clouds li et al 2013 martins et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however a major issue therein is that most of the currently available algorithms can only obtain an approximation of the theoretical cloud free lst rather than an estimate of the actual lst under cloudy conditions as a consequence the resorted lst over cloudy pixels commonly reveals larger uncertainties compared to those for clear sky pixels which will also affect the determination of sm with the trapezoid feature space method to overcome these difficulties following the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid feature space method from the synergistic use of geostationary satellite derived lst and polar orbit satellite derived fvc the present study aims to estimate a spatially continuous sm dataset from a novel perspective through the composition in the time dimension since the temporal composition can effectively increase the observation data as in the lst fvc trapezoid configuration lst is the most sensitive variable for sm variation and previous studies primarily use polar orbing satellite derived lst for the determination of sm it is well known that the local solar time would vary pixel to pixel due to the scanning mode of polar orbing satellites as a result it is most likely that sm retrievals for a study region are spatially incomparable hence the present study takes the advantage of geostationary satellite derived lst to estimate sm which is expected to obtain spatially comparable sm hence the motivation of the present study is not only to avoid unreliable sm estimates with restored lst data over cloudy pixels but also to be capable of providing spatially comparable sm since the geostationary satellite derived lst reveals the same observation time for each pixel the structure of this article is as follows section 2 introduces materials and methods section 3 and section 4 detail the results and discussion respectively section 5 summarizes the article 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area located between 37 24 n and 53 23 n in latitude and 97 12 e to 126 04 e in longitude inner mongolia was selected as the study area to obtain spatially complete sm in the present study fig 1 depicts the land covers of the study area it is obvious that the study area features various landscapes with temperate continental climates and cold temperate continental monsoon climates from west to east following the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of the study area the western inner mongolia is primarily with low ndvi value under 0 2 whereas the central part is mainly covered by grass with ndvi value between 0 2 and 0 6 as for the eastern inner mongolia high ndvi value can be observed since it is mainly dominated by forests these heterogeneities in land covers make the generation of spatially complete sm data essential for a better understanding of the atmospheric and water cycle systems as well as the sustainable development of livestock in this region since inner mongolia is one of the most significant regions for livestock whereas it is still under a situation of grassland degeneration with arid and semiarid climates 2 2 data descriptions table 1 shows the primary data used in the present study specifically the geostationary satellite of the fengyun fy 4a derived lst and the polar orbit satellite of the fy 3d derived ndvi are the main satellite data sources to estimate sm in the present study moreover atmospheric reanalysis including solar radiation wind speed air temperature and specific humidity was used to estimate the lsts under the four extreme conditions of dry bare soil full vegetation cover with zero water availability well watered full vegetation cover and saturated bare soil respectively following the algorithms proposed by moran et al 1994 the following subsections introduce the data in detail 2 2 1 fy data in the present study fy 4a geostationary satellite data were used as the main satellite data source to provide lst measurements the advanced geostationary radiation imager agri is a key instrument onboard the fy 4a which is capable of providing frequent observations every 15 to 30 min with a spatial resolution of 0 04 specifically a daily lst product with a spatial resolution of 0 04 from july to september 2020 was conducted to estimate sm in the present study in addition to fy 4a fy 3d is able to provide the ndvi with a temporal interval of 10 days and a spatial resolution of 0 05 ndvi was used to obtain fvc following the algorithm proposed by prihodko and goward 1997 the fy 4a lst data were resampled to 0 05 to match the ndvi data in the present investigation all fy data can be obtained from the national satellite meteorological centre of china http www nsmc org cn 2 2 2 cldas data cldas version 2 0 cldas v2 0 is the latest version provided by the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system which covers a period from 2017 to present with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 at hourly intervals in general the cldas dataset is developed using multisource observations and ensemble kalman filter data assimilation which outperforms other atmospheric products not only with higher spatiotemporal resolution but also with better data quality shi et al 2011 in the present study several essential atmospheric variables including solar radiation wind speed air temperature and specific humidity at the same time as fy 4a observations were used to determine the dry and wet edges of the lst fvc trapezoid except for the aforementioned atmospheric variables the cldas sm data at a depth of 5 cm were also obtained to assess the estimated results all these cldas data were resampled to 0 05 to meet the spatial resolution of the fy data specifically the cldas sm product was found to correlate well with in situ measurements which can severed as a valuable reference in practices liu et al 2021 wang and li 2020 2 2 3 smap data the soil moisture active passive smap is a satellite launched by nasa in 2015 that combines active and passive microwaves which can provide sm products with a spatial resolution of 3 9 and 36 km at present in this study the smap3l product smap enhanced l3 radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid soil moisture v004 obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https www nasa gov was used to evaluate the estimated sm with the proposed method to better assess the estimated results the smap sm data were also resampled to 0 05 following to several recent literatures the smap sm product generally outperforms other microwave based sm products which can be better used as a reference to assess the estimated sm in present study colliander et al 2017 ai yaari et al 2019 2 3 determination of sm from the lst fvc trapezoid following the traditional lst fvc trapezoid constituted by the configuration of the scatterplot in the two dimensional space leng et al 2017 proposed a pixel to pixel scheme of the lst fvc trapezoid for deriving sm compared to the traditional lst fvc trapezoid the pixel to pixel scheme makes each pixel have virtual dry and wet edges as a consequence sm retrieval for any target pixel is independent of other pixels fig 2 depicts the schematic diagram of the pixel to pixel lst fvc trapezoid specifically the four points of a b c and d represent dry bare soil full vegetation cover with zero water availability well watered full vegetation cover and saturated bare soil respectively the line connecting point a and point b is the dry edge with zero sm availability whereas the line connecting point c and point d is the wet edge with sufficient sm availability for a target pixel e g q and the corresponding virtual trapezoid constituted by points a b c and d point e and point f are assumed to be the corresponding points in dry and wet edges respectively with the assumption that sm varies linearly with lst under a given fvc condition sm for the target pixel e g q can be written as 1 θ soil m 0 θ max θ min θ min where θ soil is the volumetric sm content for pixel q m 0 is the sm availability and θ max andθ min are the maximum and minimum volumetric sm contents over the dry and wet edges respectively specifically θ max and θ min are determined as the field capacity and residual sm content respectively which are obtained following the study by zhang et al 2018 following the explanation by carlson 2007 the sm availability m 0 of the target pixel e g q can be written as 2 m 0 eq ef t e t e t q t f where eq and ef are the lengths between point e and point q and between point e and point f respectively t e t f and t q are the lsts for point e point f and target pixel q respectively it is evident that lsts for point e and point f should be first derived before the determination of the sm availability for the target pixel point e and point f have the same fvc as the target pixel but are located in the dry and wet edges respectively the lsts for point e and point f can be written as 3 t e t c max t s max f q t s max 4 t f t c min t s min f q t s min where f q is the fvc for the target pixel e g q t s max t c max t c min and t s min are the lsts for the four points of a b c and d to constitute the virtual trapezoid for the target pixel e g q specifically based on the principle of surface energy balance the lsts for the four points can be estimated following the algorithms proposed by moran et al 1994 2 4 sampling strategy and metrics for sm assessments in the present study due to the lack of ground in situ sm measurements over the study area a preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types grassland and cropland in inner mongolia where sm reanalysis data cldas and a microwave based sm product smap were used as references to assess the estimated sm with the proposed approach 200 random pixels for each of the two dominant land cover types grassland and cropland were selected over the study area fig 1 specifically the selected pixels should meet the requirements including general flat terrain with slopes less than 10 and the land use types of the pixel should be grassland or cropland according to the mcd12c1 data in general these preconditions guarantee minimum uncertainties in both the estimated sm and the referenced sm datasets leng et al 2019 finally since the sm estimated from the proposed approach and the resampled sm reference data cldas and smap are with the same spatial resolution of 0 05 direct comparison of the three sm datasets were conducted by extracting sm values at the same sampling pixels in present study three statistical metrics including the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias were used to assess the estimated sm with the referenced sm products the three statistical metrics can be written as follows 5 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 6 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 7 bias 1 n i 1 n y i x i where n is the number of sampling pixels x i and y i are the referenced sm products cldas or smap and estimated sm respectively x and y are the averages of the corresponding data 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal composition of sm because optical bands are susceptible to clouds various gaps commonly appear in instantaneous satellite images to obtain spatially continuous sm over a large region composed sm with different temporal scales as well as their spatial coverages were primarily investigated in the present study taking the study period of july to september 2020 as an example fig 3 depicts the spatial coverages of sm on a single day the first day for each month and temporal composited sm on 5 days the first to fifth day for each month 10 days the first to tenth day for each month and 15 days the first to fifteenth day for each month it is evident that large areas of missing sm data commonly appear in a single day due to cloud contamination on satellite optical channels however the spatial coverage would increase with increasing composing days table 2 table 3 and table 4 show the fraction of coverages for the valid pixels with 5 day 10 day and 15 day composited sm datasets respectively for the entire study period it is obvious that the 5 day composited sm data show that the coverage area accounts for approximately 75 96 of the entire area with an average spatial coverage of 88 in addition the spatial coverage of sm data synthesized over 10 days is approximately 80 97 where an average spatial coverage of 95 can be obtained although 5 or 10 days of synthetic data have a high spatial coverage it still cannot be called full spatial coverage because in some cases there will still be a coverage rate of less than 90 in contrast the space coverage of the semimonthly sm can be stabilized at more than 95 which can almost meet the requirements for sm data in practical applications therefore semimonthly synthesized data were selected in the present study for further analysis 3 2 assessments with sm reanalysis following the results presented in the previous section it is noteworthy that the spatial coverage of valid data with the semimonthly sm is stable and the fraction of coverages for the invalid sm retrieval can reach a high level of approximately 97 table 5 shows the accuracy statistics with respect to the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias for the comparison between the estimated semimonthly sm and the cldas sm product fig 4 depicts the scatterplot of estimated sm versus cldas product during the study period it is noteworthy that the cldas sm product was resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 05 to match the fy derived sm data following the results it is evident that the estimated sm was well correlated to the cldas sm data with overall significant correlation coefficients of approximately 0 603 and 0 545 over cropland and grassland respectively however the proposed approach also overestimates sm over cropland with a bias of 0 071 m3 m3 and over grassland with a bias of 0 032 m3 m3 specifically overestimation primarily appears when the sm content is high as a consequence an overall bias of 0 070 m3 m3 can be found for the grassland which is evidently better than that for cropland with an overall bias of 0 120 m3 m3 in general the accuracies over the two dominant land cover types were comparable to previous investigations sun et al 2017 leng et al 2019 notably the large rmse can be primarily attributed to the significant bias between the two sm datasets fig 5 depicts the unbiased rmse ubrmse between the estimated semimonthly sm and the cldas sm over the cropland and grassland for each investigated period the estimated semimonthly sm reveals a significantly lower ubrmse over grassland than that over cropland moreover it is evident that the ubrmse generally varies within a small range during the study period moreover overall averaged ubrmses of approximately 0 062 m3 m3 and 0 097 m3 m3 can be obtained for grassland and cropland respectively indicating that the proposed method is most likely to perform better over grassland than cropland 3 3 assessments with microwave sm product in addition to the assessments with the cldas sm data further evaluation of the estimated semimonthly sm with the smap sm product is further conducted table 6 shows the accuracy statistics of r rmse and bias between the two sm datasets during the study period the scatterplot of the estimated semimonthly sm versus smap sm product during the study period is presented in fig 6 it is noteworthy that the smap sm product was resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 05 to match the fy derived sm data as seen from the results the overall correlation coefficient on grassland is 0 682 and that over cropland is 0 828 it is obvious that better agreement can be found over cropland than over cropland which is similar to the assessment with the cldas sm data however the proposed method exhibits significant overestimation for both land cover types with biases of 0 139 m3 m3 over cropland and 0 121 m3 m3 for grassland due to the significant overestimation rmses of approximately 0 155 m3 m3 and 0 133 m3 m3 can be found for the two dominant land cover types fig 7 depicts the ubrmse between the estimated semimonthly sm and the smap sm over the cropland and grassland it is clear that the proposed method exhibits significant accuracy with ubrmses of approximately 0 04 0 06 m3 m3 and 0 04 0 08 m3 m3 over grassland and cropland respectively indicating reasonable accuracy for the proposed method moreover overall averaged ubrmses of approximately 0 055 m3 m3 and 0 069 m3 m3 can be obtained for grassland and cropland respectively in terms of ubrmse the results of the present study generally show comparable accuracy with previous investigations when comparing satellite derived sm with smap data colliander et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 on the difference composing periods according to previous investigations it is obvious that the spatial coverage of composed sm at 5 days 10 days and 15 days is different although composed sms with 5 or 10 days can also generally meet the requirements of a number of applications due to their relatively high spatial coverage it is still necessary to investigate the accuracy of these composed sms fig 8 depicts the ubrmse between the composed sm and smap cldas at different time scales on grassland and cropland during the study period it is obvious that compared with smap a decreased ubrmse can be found when assessing the estimated sm with cldas sm for the assessments with both smap and cldas it is evident that larger variances can be found for different composing periods over cropland which has further confirmed that generally better accuracy can be found over grassland than over cropland in particular for the assessment with cldas ubrmse over grassland reveals an average ubrmse of approximately 0 060 m3 m3 which is significantly lower than that over cropland with an average ubrmse of 0 090 m3 m3 moreover it is also obvious that with increasing composing period the ubrmse generally reveals a slightly decreasing trend over grassland which can also be seen from the assessment with smap for the grassland in addition to the high and stable spatial coverage at the semimonthly interval this is generally another reason that we selected the semimonthly sm in the present investigation nevertheless it is noteworthy that sm composed of other temporal intervals can also obtain acceptable accuracy despite their lower spatial coverage of valid sm data 4 2 error analysis due to the lack of ground in situ sm measurements and sm truth at a spatial resolution of 0 05 the present study takes advantage of the clads and smap sm datasets to assess the fy derived sm nevertheless it is noteworthy that both the resampled cldas and smap have the same spatial resolution as that of the fy derived sm dataset from this perspective it is also reasonable to provide a fair evaluation of the estimated sm data with the widely used sm reanalysis of cldas and smap sm products based on the two referenced sm datasets the preliminary assessments reveal an acceptable accuracy of the estimated sm which is generally comparable to most of the previous evaluations of satellite derived sm leng et al 2019 foucras et al 2020 nie et al 2020 nevertheless several main error sources still exist for the determination of the fy derived sm for the main factors in the lst fvc trapezoid errors in lst and fvc can directly affect the location of the target pixel within the corresponding virtual trapezoid thus leading to potential uncertainness for the determination of sm with the proposed method however no ground lst truth with a spatial resolution of 0 05 is currently available for the assessments of the lst derived from the fy 4a satellite and fvc estimated from the fy 3d it is inevitable that various degrees of errors are most likely to exist in the satellite derived parameters another error source is the possible errors in the atmospheric reanalysis it is known that the determination of dry and wet edges depends largely on atmospheric reanalysis which is used as an essential input to estimate lsts over extreme conditions representing dry bare soil full vegetation cover with zero water availability well watered full vegetation cover and saturated bare soil following the principle of surface energy balance a final error source could be the referenced sm datasets used to assess the estimated sm it is well known that various degrees of uncertainties could exist in both the reanalysis and microwave sm products primarily due to the assumptions made and data used in the algorithms to produce the products moreover different application scenarios can also lead to various performances of the aforementioned sm products it is noteworthy that anthropogenic factors such as the irrigation and farming activities can significantly disturb soil column as well as sm leading to the decreased accuracy over the cropland than grassland zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in addition the dominated crops over the study area are wheat and corn which reveal significantly more completed vegetation structure than grass as a consequence it is reasonable that different performances of sm retrieval can be found over cropland and grassland except for these it is noteworthy that the estimated sm reveals significant overestimation when comparing to smap sm product a possible reason can be the different penetration characteristics of optical and microwave wavelengths although the microwave can penetrate more than optical wavelengths the thermal measurements are usually recognized to reflect sm with much more soil depth holzman et al 2014 przeździecki and zawadzki 2020 as a consequence the estimated sm with the proposed method can potentially reveal an overestimation as shown in fig 6 besides it is also noteworthy that the cldas sm product used in present study is with a fixed depth of 5 cm which is also different from those obtained with the trapezoid based approach although sm is recognized to vary slightly within the surface layers 10 cm the different depths of sm measurements would also affect the assessments 4 3 advantages and limitations of the proposed method the present study has provided a framework to obtain a spatially continuous sm dataset through temporal composition at a semimonthly scale it is widely known that when estimating spatially continuous sm based on the lst fvc trapezoid it is a precondition to obtain lst under all weather conditions however due to the weak penetration ability of optical missions through clouds it is still a huge challenge to obtain actual lst over cloudy pixels at present previous investigations have tried to estimate sm over cloudy pixels by means of disaggregation from microwave based sm products or atmospheric reanalysis derived sm proxies it is noteworthy that sm obtained from such approaches reveals lower accuracy than the sm retrievals based on the lst fvc trapezoid over the clear sky pixels thus leading to an overall decreased accuracy of the satellite derived spatially completed sm additionally it is known that the observation time varies pixel to pixel and can reach a maximum difference of approximately 2 h for the same modis data as a consequence the inconsistent observation time of the widely used polar orbit satellite data can potentially lead to the incomparability of estimated sm over a large region moreover the transit time of satellite data is also different from the time of the atmospheric analysis since the latter is always created with fixed temporal intervals for all grids hence the time mismatch between satellite data and atmospheric analysis would also lead to uncertainties in sm retrievals in traditional approaches to this end the present study reveals several advantages of using geostationary satellite data to estimate sm first geostationary satellites can observe the earth at a fixed angle and time thus making the lsts for each pixel over the study area comparable the present study takes advantage of the lst fvc trapezoid derived model to obtain spatially continuous sm through temporal composition at the semimonthly scale which can decrease the uncertainties caused by the time mismatch between satellite images and auxiliary data moreover all the sms were estimated with the lst fvc trapezoid with a strong physical basis which is generally superior to the previous methods that take advantage of disaggregation or atmospheric reanalysis based sm proxies nevertheless the method proposed in the present study still has limitations as shown in fig 3 although most of the study region has valid sm with a composition period of 5 to 10 days the spatial coverage with a composition period of 15 days is obviously more convincing to represent the concept of spatially continuous sm this is also the reason that the semimonthly sm is generated in the present study nevertheless it is noteworthy that sm composition with fewer days is also feasible for most of the regions in the study area in addition it is necessary to strengthen the assessments of the estimated sm under different climate patterns and land use types in future developments specifically experiments with dense in situ sm measurements should be carried out to better validate the estimated sm 5 conclusion the present study takes advantage of the fy 4a geostationary satellite derived lst and the fy 3d polar orbit satellite derived fvc to produce a spatially continuous semimonthly sm dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 in inner mongolia specifically based on the pixel to pixel scheme of the lst fvc trapezoid method the estimated sm dataset with different composing periods was investigated to obtain the spatially continuous sm over the entire study area of inner mongolia the results indicate that the wider the time span is the larger and more stable the proportion of valid composed sms over the entire study area although sm composed of 5 or 10 days can generally fulfill the requirements for many practical applications semimonthly sm reveals a generally stable spatial coverage of valid sm based on the semimonthly sm data preliminary assessments of the estimated sm were conducted over two dominant land cover types of cropland and grassland where sm derived from the reanalysis data of cldas and microwave measurements of smap were taken as references due to the lack of ground sm truth at a spatial resolution of 0 05 the results indicate that although the proposed method can potentially overestimate sm over the study area a reasonable accuracy can be obtained where ubrmse within a range of 0 043 0 086 m3 m3 0 089 0 101 m3 m3 and 0 044 0 058 m3 m3 0 058 0 064 m3 m3 can be found between the estimated semimonthly sm and passive microwave reanalysis sm product for cropland and grassland respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

3439,soil moisture sm is a key variable in the surface energy balance and water cycle and its spatiotemporal dynamics are of great significance to climate agriculture and other fields optical remote sensing has been widely used to estimate sm with relatively fine spatial resolution however optical observations are easily contaminated by clouds making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous sm over large regions in the present study a semimonthly sm dataset over the study area of the entire inner mongolia region with nearly full spatial coverage was derived from the synergistic use of china s feng yun fy geostationary fy 4a and polar orbit fy 3d observations following a previously developed trapezoid feature space in a pixel to pixel manner a preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types grassland and cropland in the study region where the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas and the soil moisture active passive smap sm products were provided as references the results indicated that the estimated sm was well correlated to the referenced sm datasets with a significant correlation coefficient varying from 0 5 to 0 8 furthermore for the grassland cropland unbiased root mean square errors of approximately 0 062 0 097 m3 m3 and 0 055 0 069 m3 m3 can be found when comparing the estimated sm with the cldas and the smap product respectively keywords soil moisture feng yun satellite data trapezoid feature space spatially continuous 1 introduction as one of the most active components in the water cycle and energy balance soil moisture sm deeply participates in a number of physicochemical processes between the atmosphere and earth peñuelas et al 1993 chauhan et al 2003 liu et al 2016 holzman et al 2014 mohamed et al 2019 on the one hand sm is emitted through surface runoff and evapotranspiration which directly affects the atmospheric water content leading to changes in climate and precipitation when the regulation system is out of balance it will cause droughts or floods on the other hand infiltration determines the amount of soil water content or ground water storage which directly affects the ability of plants to absorb water and the accumulation of nutrients as a result it is evident that sm not only directly influences the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere but also indirectly affects the sustainable development of society and human activities therefore increasing attention has been devoted to obtaining spatiotemporal sm dynamics moran et al 1994 kim et al 2013 he et al 2014 amazirh et al 2018 yadav et al 2020 traditional approaches often measure sm with sensors stored in soil layers advantages behind such approaches include less influence on atmospheric underlying surface conditions and relatively high accuracy however it commonly suffers from a major difficulty that traditional approaches are only available in a limited area due to the high land surface heterogeneity remote sensing provides an unprecedented alternative to estimate sm at regional or even global scales in the past few decades a number of algorithms have been developed to obtain sm with various satellite observations paloscia et al 2006 das et al 2010 mladenova et al 2014 leng et al 2016 reichle et al 2019 chaubell et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 2021 li et al 2021 currently optical and microwave observations are two main satellite data sources for estimating sm in general microwaves are more sensitive to the dielectric constant of water and soil making them more frequently used for obtaining sm specifically active microwave commonly exhibits high spatial resolution whereas the temporal resolution is poor nevertheless several active microwave based sm products such as the advanced scatterometer and the sentinel 1 surface soil moisture version 1 have been developed for various applications by contrast the superiorities of high temporal resolution and less influence by atmospheres have promoted the practicability of passive microwave based sm retrieval in recent decades as a consequence a number of passive microwave based sm products such as the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 have been developed for usage in various domains including global climate changes and water cycles champagne et al 2015 wigneron et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 to date the estimation of sm from passive microwave observations is still the mainstream and has been of great concern wigneron et al 2017 meng et al 2019 tong et al 2020 yao et al 2021 nevertheless passive microwaves still suffer from several limitations specifically due to the weak signal emission of the band sensitive to sm it can only be monitored by large area observations so that the spatial resolution of passive microwaves is generally coarse usually more than 25 km making passive microwave based sm products more feasible at the global scale in addition microwave remote sensing will cause the attenuation of high frequency sm signals so it is difficult to obtain sm in areas with high vegetation coverage furthermore subject to the noise from radio interference namely radio frequency interference rfi kerr et al 2012 observation gaps commonly occur on most of the currently available microwave based sm products in contrast optical remote sensing with higher spatial resolution 30 m to 5 km is more suitable for the study of watershed or even field scales in the past decade optical based land surface parameters from landsat with a high spatial resolution of 30 m to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with a medium resolution of 1 km have been widely used to estimate sm amani et al 2016 mobasheri et al 2016 babaeian et al 2018 xu et al 2018 mohseni and mokhtarzade 2020 han et al 2020 moreover many scholars have also tried to obtain sm from optical based geostationary satellite data with a spatial resolution of 3 to 5 km leng et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ghilain et al 2019 among these optical based sm retrieval approaches the trapezoid feature space method constituted by land surface temperature lst and fractional vegetation cover fvc denoted as lst fvc trapezoid hereafter has received the most attention in past decades leng et al 2017 2019 zhao et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 however because optical remote sensing is susceptible to clouds it is still a challenge to obtain sm under cloudy conditions following the trapezoid feature space method several previous investigations have been dedicated to determining sm estimates over cloudy pixels thus providing spatially continuous sm at high spatial resolution a possible way to obtain sm under cloudy pixels is to take advantage of atmospheric variables however the estimated sm over cloudy pixels commonly reveals a decreased accuracy compared to those over clear sky pixels leng et al 2017 2019 in the past few years a number of algorithms have been developed to restore ground pixel information especially for the most critical variable of lst in the trapezoid feature space method contaminated by clouds li et al 2013 martins et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however a major issue therein is that most of the currently available algorithms can only obtain an approximation of the theoretical cloud free lst rather than an estimate of the actual lst under cloudy conditions as a consequence the resorted lst over cloudy pixels commonly reveals larger uncertainties compared to those for clear sky pixels which will also affect the determination of sm with the trapezoid feature space method to overcome these difficulties following the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid feature space method from the synergistic use of geostationary satellite derived lst and polar orbit satellite derived fvc the present study aims to estimate a spatially continuous sm dataset from a novel perspective through the composition in the time dimension since the temporal composition can effectively increase the observation data as in the lst fvc trapezoid configuration lst is the most sensitive variable for sm variation and previous studies primarily use polar orbing satellite derived lst for the determination of sm it is well known that the local solar time would vary pixel to pixel due to the scanning mode of polar orbing satellites as a result it is most likely that sm retrievals for a study region are spatially incomparable hence the present study takes the advantage of geostationary satellite derived lst to estimate sm which is expected to obtain spatially comparable sm hence the motivation of the present study is not only to avoid unreliable sm estimates with restored lst data over cloudy pixels but also to be capable of providing spatially comparable sm since the geostationary satellite derived lst reveals the same observation time for each pixel the structure of this article is as follows section 2 introduces materials and methods section 3 and section 4 detail the results and discussion respectively section 5 summarizes the article 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area located between 37 24 n and 53 23 n in latitude and 97 12 e to 126 04 e in longitude inner mongolia was selected as the study area to obtain spatially complete sm in the present study fig 1 depicts the land covers of the study area it is obvious that the study area features various landscapes with temperate continental climates and cold temperate continental monsoon climates from west to east following the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of the study area the western inner mongolia is primarily with low ndvi value under 0 2 whereas the central part is mainly covered by grass with ndvi value between 0 2 and 0 6 as for the eastern inner mongolia high ndvi value can be observed since it is mainly dominated by forests these heterogeneities in land covers make the generation of spatially complete sm data essential for a better understanding of the atmospheric and water cycle systems as well as the sustainable development of livestock in this region since inner mongolia is one of the most significant regions for livestock whereas it is still under a situation of grassland degeneration with arid and semiarid climates 2 2 data descriptions table 1 shows the primary data used in the present study specifically the geostationary satellite of the fengyun fy 4a derived lst and the polar orbit satellite of the fy 3d derived ndvi are the main satellite data sources to estimate sm in the present study moreover atmospheric reanalysis including solar radiation wind speed air temperature and specific humidity was used to estimate the lsts under the four extreme conditions of dry bare soil full vegetation cover with zero water availability well watered full vegetation cover and saturated bare soil respectively following the algorithms proposed by moran et al 1994 the following subsections introduce the data in detail 2 2 1 fy data in the present study fy 4a geostationary satellite data were used as the main satellite data source to provide lst measurements the advanced geostationary radiation imager agri is a key instrument onboard the fy 4a which is capable of providing frequent observations every 15 to 30 min with a spatial resolution of 0 04 specifically a daily lst product with a spatial resolution of 0 04 from july to september 2020 was conducted to estimate sm in the present study in addition to fy 4a fy 3d is able to provide the ndvi with a temporal interval of 10 days and a spatial resolution of 0 05 ndvi was used to obtain fvc following the algorithm proposed by prihodko and goward 1997 the fy 4a lst data were resampled to 0 05 to match the ndvi data in the present investigation all fy data can be obtained from the national satellite meteorological centre of china http www nsmc org cn 2 2 2 cldas data cldas version 2 0 cldas v2 0 is the latest version provided by the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system which covers a period from 2017 to present with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 at hourly intervals in general the cldas dataset is developed using multisource observations and ensemble kalman filter data assimilation which outperforms other atmospheric products not only with higher spatiotemporal resolution but also with better data quality shi et al 2011 in the present study several essential atmospheric variables including solar radiation wind speed air temperature and specific humidity at the same time as fy 4a observations were used to determine the dry and wet edges of the lst fvc trapezoid except for the aforementioned atmospheric variables the cldas sm data at a depth of 5 cm were also obtained to assess the estimated results all these cldas data were resampled to 0 05 to meet the spatial resolution of the fy data specifically the cldas sm product was found to correlate well with in situ measurements which can severed as a valuable reference in practices liu et al 2021 wang and li 2020 2 2 3 smap data the soil moisture active passive smap is a satellite launched by nasa in 2015 that combines active and passive microwaves which can provide sm products with a spatial resolution of 3 9 and 36 km at present in this study the smap3l product smap enhanced l3 radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid soil moisture v004 obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https www nasa gov was used to evaluate the estimated sm with the proposed method to better assess the estimated results the smap sm data were also resampled to 0 05 following to several recent literatures the smap sm product generally outperforms other microwave based sm products which can be better used as a reference to assess the estimated sm in present study colliander et al 2017 ai yaari et al 2019 2 3 determination of sm from the lst fvc trapezoid following the traditional lst fvc trapezoid constituted by the configuration of the scatterplot in the two dimensional space leng et al 2017 proposed a pixel to pixel scheme of the lst fvc trapezoid for deriving sm compared to the traditional lst fvc trapezoid the pixel to pixel scheme makes each pixel have virtual dry and wet edges as a consequence sm retrieval for any target pixel is independent of other pixels fig 2 depicts the schematic diagram of the pixel to pixel lst fvc trapezoid specifically the four points of a b c and d represent dry bare soil full vegetation cover with zero water availability well watered full vegetation cover and saturated bare soil respectively the line connecting point a and point b is the dry edge with zero sm availability whereas the line connecting point c and point d is the wet edge with sufficient sm availability for a target pixel e g q and the corresponding virtual trapezoid constituted by points a b c and d point e and point f are assumed to be the corresponding points in dry and wet edges respectively with the assumption that sm varies linearly with lst under a given fvc condition sm for the target pixel e g q can be written as 1 θ soil m 0 θ max θ min θ min where θ soil is the volumetric sm content for pixel q m 0 is the sm availability and θ max andθ min are the maximum and minimum volumetric sm contents over the dry and wet edges respectively specifically θ max and θ min are determined as the field capacity and residual sm content respectively which are obtained following the study by zhang et al 2018 following the explanation by carlson 2007 the sm availability m 0 of the target pixel e g q can be written as 2 m 0 eq ef t e t e t q t f where eq and ef are the lengths between point e and point q and between point e and point f respectively t e t f and t q are the lsts for point e point f and target pixel q respectively it is evident that lsts for point e and point f should be first derived before the determination of the sm availability for the target pixel point e and point f have the same fvc as the target pixel but are located in the dry and wet edges respectively the lsts for point e and point f can be written as 3 t e t c max t s max f q t s max 4 t f t c min t s min f q t s min where f q is the fvc for the target pixel e g q t s max t c max t c min and t s min are the lsts for the four points of a b c and d to constitute the virtual trapezoid for the target pixel e g q specifically based on the principle of surface energy balance the lsts for the four points can be estimated following the algorithms proposed by moran et al 1994 2 4 sampling strategy and metrics for sm assessments in the present study due to the lack of ground in situ sm measurements over the study area a preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types grassland and cropland in inner mongolia where sm reanalysis data cldas and a microwave based sm product smap were used as references to assess the estimated sm with the proposed approach 200 random pixels for each of the two dominant land cover types grassland and cropland were selected over the study area fig 1 specifically the selected pixels should meet the requirements including general flat terrain with slopes less than 10 and the land use types of the pixel should be grassland or cropland according to the mcd12c1 data in general these preconditions guarantee minimum uncertainties in both the estimated sm and the referenced sm datasets leng et al 2019 finally since the sm estimated from the proposed approach and the resampled sm reference data cldas and smap are with the same spatial resolution of 0 05 direct comparison of the three sm datasets were conducted by extracting sm values at the same sampling pixels in present study three statistical metrics including the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias were used to assess the estimated sm with the referenced sm products the three statistical metrics can be written as follows 5 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 6 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 7 bias 1 n i 1 n y i x i where n is the number of sampling pixels x i and y i are the referenced sm products cldas or smap and estimated sm respectively x and y are the averages of the corresponding data 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal composition of sm because optical bands are susceptible to clouds various gaps commonly appear in instantaneous satellite images to obtain spatially continuous sm over a large region composed sm with different temporal scales as well as their spatial coverages were primarily investigated in the present study taking the study period of july to september 2020 as an example fig 3 depicts the spatial coverages of sm on a single day the first day for each month and temporal composited sm on 5 days the first to fifth day for each month 10 days the first to tenth day for each month and 15 days the first to fifteenth day for each month it is evident that large areas of missing sm data commonly appear in a single day due to cloud contamination on satellite optical channels however the spatial coverage would increase with increasing composing days table 2 table 3 and table 4 show the fraction of coverages for the valid pixels with 5 day 10 day and 15 day composited sm datasets respectively for the entire study period it is obvious that the 5 day composited sm data show that the coverage area accounts for approximately 75 96 of the entire area with an average spatial coverage of 88 in addition the spatial coverage of sm data synthesized over 10 days is approximately 80 97 where an average spatial coverage of 95 can be obtained although 5 or 10 days of synthetic data have a high spatial coverage it still cannot be called full spatial coverage because in some cases there will still be a coverage rate of less than 90 in contrast the space coverage of the semimonthly sm can be stabilized at more than 95 which can almost meet the requirements for sm data in practical applications therefore semimonthly synthesized data were selected in the present study for further analysis 3 2 assessments with sm reanalysis following the results presented in the previous section it is noteworthy that the spatial coverage of valid data with the semimonthly sm is stable and the fraction of coverages for the invalid sm retrieval can reach a high level of approximately 97 table 5 shows the accuracy statistics with respect to the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias for the comparison between the estimated semimonthly sm and the cldas sm product fig 4 depicts the scatterplot of estimated sm versus cldas product during the study period it is noteworthy that the cldas sm product was resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 05 to match the fy derived sm data following the results it is evident that the estimated sm was well correlated to the cldas sm data with overall significant correlation coefficients of approximately 0 603 and 0 545 over cropland and grassland respectively however the proposed approach also overestimates sm over cropland with a bias of 0 071 m3 m3 and over grassland with a bias of 0 032 m3 m3 specifically overestimation primarily appears when the sm content is high as a consequence an overall bias of 0 070 m3 m3 can be found for the grassland which is evidently better than that for cropland with an overall bias of 0 120 m3 m3 in general the accuracies over the two dominant land cover types were comparable to previous investigations sun et al 2017 leng et al 2019 notably the large rmse can be primarily attributed to the significant bias between the two sm datasets fig 5 depicts the unbiased rmse ubrmse between the estimated semimonthly sm and the cldas sm over the cropland and grassland for each investigated period the estimated semimonthly sm reveals a significantly lower ubrmse over grassland than that over cropland moreover it is evident that the ubrmse generally varies within a small range during the study period moreover overall averaged ubrmses of approximately 0 062 m3 m3 and 0 097 m3 m3 can be obtained for grassland and cropland respectively indicating that the proposed method is most likely to perform better over grassland than cropland 3 3 assessments with microwave sm product in addition to the assessments with the cldas sm data further evaluation of the estimated semimonthly sm with the smap sm product is further conducted table 6 shows the accuracy statistics of r rmse and bias between the two sm datasets during the study period the scatterplot of the estimated semimonthly sm versus smap sm product during the study period is presented in fig 6 it is noteworthy that the smap sm product was resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 05 to match the fy derived sm data as seen from the results the overall correlation coefficient on grassland is 0 682 and that over cropland is 0 828 it is obvious that better agreement can be found over cropland than over cropland which is similar to the assessment with the cldas sm data however the proposed method exhibits significant overestimation for both land cover types with biases of 0 139 m3 m3 over cropland and 0 121 m3 m3 for grassland due to the significant overestimation rmses of approximately 0 155 m3 m3 and 0 133 m3 m3 can be found for the two dominant land cover types fig 7 depicts the ubrmse between the estimated semimonthly sm and the smap sm over the cropland and grassland it is clear that the proposed method exhibits significant accuracy with ubrmses of approximately 0 04 0 06 m3 m3 and 0 04 0 08 m3 m3 over grassland and cropland respectively indicating reasonable accuracy for the proposed method moreover overall averaged ubrmses of approximately 0 055 m3 m3 and 0 069 m3 m3 can be obtained for grassland and cropland respectively in terms of ubrmse the results of the present study generally show comparable accuracy with previous investigations when comparing satellite derived sm with smap data colliander et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 on the difference composing periods according to previous investigations it is obvious that the spatial coverage of composed sm at 5 days 10 days and 15 days is different although composed sms with 5 or 10 days can also generally meet the requirements of a number of applications due to their relatively high spatial coverage it is still necessary to investigate the accuracy of these composed sms fig 8 depicts the ubrmse between the composed sm and smap cldas at different time scales on grassland and cropland during the study period it is obvious that compared with smap a decreased ubrmse can be found when assessing the estimated sm with cldas sm for the assessments with both smap and cldas it is evident that larger variances can be found for different composing periods over cropland which has further confirmed that generally better accuracy can be found over grassland than over cropland in particular for the assessment with cldas ubrmse over grassland reveals an average ubrmse of approximately 0 060 m3 m3 which is significantly lower than that over cropland with an average ubrmse of 0 090 m3 m3 moreover it is also obvious that with increasing composing period the ubrmse generally reveals a slightly decreasing trend over grassland which can also be seen from the assessment with smap for the grassland in addition to the high and stable spatial coverage at the semimonthly interval this is generally another reason that we selected the semimonthly sm in the present investigation nevertheless it is noteworthy that sm composed of other temporal intervals can also obtain acceptable accuracy despite their lower spatial coverage of valid sm data 4 2 error analysis due to the lack of ground in situ sm measurements and sm truth at a spatial resolution of 0 05 the present study takes advantage of the clads and smap sm datasets to assess the fy derived sm nevertheless it is noteworthy that both the resampled cldas and smap have the same spatial resolution as that of the fy derived sm dataset from this perspective it is also reasonable to provide a fair evaluation of the estimated sm data with the widely used sm reanalysis of cldas and smap sm products based on the two referenced sm datasets the preliminary assessments reveal an acceptable accuracy of the estimated sm which is generally comparable to most of the previous evaluations of satellite derived sm leng et al 2019 foucras et al 2020 nie et al 2020 nevertheless several main error sources still exist for the determination of the fy derived sm for the main factors in the lst fvc trapezoid errors in lst and fvc can directly affect the location of the target pixel within the corresponding virtual trapezoid thus leading to potential uncertainness for the determination of sm with the proposed method however no ground lst truth with a spatial resolution of 0 05 is currently available for the assessments of the lst derived from the fy 4a satellite and fvc estimated from the fy 3d it is inevitable that various degrees of errors are most likely to exist in the satellite derived parameters another error source is the possible errors in the atmospheric reanalysis it is known that the determination of dry and wet edges depends largely on atmospheric reanalysis which is used as an essential input to estimate lsts over extreme conditions representing dry bare soil full vegetation cover with zero water availability well watered full vegetation cover and saturated bare soil following the principle of surface energy balance a final error source could be the referenced sm datasets used to assess the estimated sm it is well known that various degrees of uncertainties could exist in both the reanalysis and microwave sm products primarily due to the assumptions made and data used in the algorithms to produce the products moreover different application scenarios can also lead to various performances of the aforementioned sm products it is noteworthy that anthropogenic factors such as the irrigation and farming activities can significantly disturb soil column as well as sm leading to the decreased accuracy over the cropland than grassland zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in addition the dominated crops over the study area are wheat and corn which reveal significantly more completed vegetation structure than grass as a consequence it is reasonable that different performances of sm retrieval can be found over cropland and grassland except for these it is noteworthy that the estimated sm reveals significant overestimation when comparing to smap sm product a possible reason can be the different penetration characteristics of optical and microwave wavelengths although the microwave can penetrate more than optical wavelengths the thermal measurements are usually recognized to reflect sm with much more soil depth holzman et al 2014 przeździecki and zawadzki 2020 as a consequence the estimated sm with the proposed method can potentially reveal an overestimation as shown in fig 6 besides it is also noteworthy that the cldas sm product used in present study is with a fixed depth of 5 cm which is also different from those obtained with the trapezoid based approach although sm is recognized to vary slightly within the surface layers 10 cm the different depths of sm measurements would also affect the assessments 4 3 advantages and limitations of the proposed method the present study has provided a framework to obtain a spatially continuous sm dataset through temporal composition at a semimonthly scale it is widely known that when estimating spatially continuous sm based on the lst fvc trapezoid it is a precondition to obtain lst under all weather conditions however due to the weak penetration ability of optical missions through clouds it is still a huge challenge to obtain actual lst over cloudy pixels at present previous investigations have tried to estimate sm over cloudy pixels by means of disaggregation from microwave based sm products or atmospheric reanalysis derived sm proxies it is noteworthy that sm obtained from such approaches reveals lower accuracy than the sm retrievals based on the lst fvc trapezoid over the clear sky pixels thus leading to an overall decreased accuracy of the satellite derived spatially completed sm additionally it is known that the observation time varies pixel to pixel and can reach a maximum difference of approximately 2 h for the same modis data as a consequence the inconsistent observation time of the widely used polar orbit satellite data can potentially lead to the incomparability of estimated sm over a large region moreover the transit time of satellite data is also different from the time of the atmospheric analysis since the latter is always created with fixed temporal intervals for all grids hence the time mismatch between satellite data and atmospheric analysis would also lead to uncertainties in sm retrievals in traditional approaches to this end the present study reveals several advantages of using geostationary satellite data to estimate sm first geostationary satellites can observe the earth at a fixed angle and time thus making the lsts for each pixel over the study area comparable the present study takes advantage of the lst fvc trapezoid derived model to obtain spatially continuous sm through temporal composition at the semimonthly scale which can decrease the uncertainties caused by the time mismatch between satellite images and auxiliary data moreover all the sms were estimated with the lst fvc trapezoid with a strong physical basis which is generally superior to the previous methods that take advantage of disaggregation or atmospheric reanalysis based sm proxies nevertheless the method proposed in the present study still has limitations as shown in fig 3 although most of the study region has valid sm with a composition period of 5 to 10 days the spatial coverage with a composition period of 15 days is obviously more convincing to represent the concept of spatially continuous sm this is also the reason that the semimonthly sm is generated in the present study nevertheless it is noteworthy that sm composition with fewer days is also feasible for most of the regions in the study area in addition it is necessary to strengthen the assessments of the estimated sm under different climate patterns and land use types in future developments specifically experiments with dense in situ sm measurements should be carried out to better validate the estimated sm 5 conclusion the present study takes advantage of the fy 4a geostationary satellite derived lst and the fy 3d polar orbit satellite derived fvc to produce a spatially continuous semimonthly sm dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 in inner mongolia specifically based on the pixel to pixel scheme of the lst fvc trapezoid method the estimated sm dataset with different composing periods was investigated to obtain the spatially continuous sm over the entire study area of inner mongolia the results indicate that the wider the time span is the larger and more stable the proportion of valid composed sms over the entire study area although sm composed of 5 or 10 days can generally fulfill the requirements for many practical applications semimonthly sm reveals a generally stable spatial coverage of valid sm based on the semimonthly sm data preliminary assessments of the estimated sm were conducted over two dominant land cover types of cropland and grassland where sm derived from the reanalysis data of cldas and microwave measurements of smap were taken as references due to the lack of ground sm truth at a spatial resolution of 0 05 the results indicate that although the proposed method can potentially overestimate sm over the study area a reasonable accuracy can be obtained where ubrmse within a range of 0 043 0 086 m3 m3 0 089 0 101 m3 m3 and 0 044 0 058 m3 m3 0 058 0 064 m3 m3 can be found between the estimated semimonthly sm and passive microwave reanalysis sm product for cropland and grassland respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
