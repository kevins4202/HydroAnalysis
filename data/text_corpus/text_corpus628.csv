3140,predicting leachate pollutants is of prime importance in detecting the amount of pollution in water resources adjacent to sources of leakage in this study electrical conductivity ec as a physicochemical water pollution parameter with the possibility of portable measurement was used as an indicator of leachate quality for the tychy urbanowice operating and closed landfill complex in order to simulate landfill conditions two lysimeter experiments were conducted simultaneously using sensors mounted in the lysimeters from the end of november 2018 to the end of december 2019 ec waste temperature and waste moisture were measured for the open lysimeter and only waste moisture for the closed lysimeter additionally meteorological data obtained from the nearest synoptic station and soil moisture and temperature acquired from the gldas satellite were employed as external data to analyze various conditions thereafter artificial neural network ann neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and emotional ann eann models were developed to determine the parameters affecting the ec value recorded for the open lysimeter and subsequently predict the missing ec parameter of the closed lysimeter by employing the transfer learning method following that in order to improve the precision of ec predictions ensemble techniques were applied to the outputs of the models that were developed the results showed that the moisture of the lysimeters made a significant contribution to the ec value prediction it is worth mentioning that among ann anfis and eann the eann model yielded more precise results in ec estimation with the average dc above 0 80 and 0 90 for individual and ensembled modeling in both the training and verification phases respectively keywords landfill leachate

data 1 introduction the dependence of living organisms on water supplies has led many researchers to study the hazards related to water resources one of these hazards is leachate the most detrimental by product of municipal solid waste msw which is increasing drastically due to the rapid population growth urbanization consumerism and high end technology of this era therefore finding a proper disposal method for msw is one of the main concerns of urban management ostad ali askari 2022b regarding the waste management hierarchy the last option for msw management is disposal hence one of the safest and most economical approaches for disposing of msw is to dump it in a sanitary landfill white et al 1995 the leachate generated from msw is affected by the composition of the dumped waste the liquid infiltration and the physical chemical and biological reactions within the landfill uncontrolled migration of leachate would introduce highly contaminating and toxic chemicals into the adjacent environment resulting in the immediate pollution of soil and water supplies xie et al 2009 therefore leachate must be monitored appropriately and treated properly during the landfill operation and even after closure to diminish its environmental effects and health related issues ostad ali askari 2022b since studying leachate contamination of surface and groundwater supplies is costly and time consuming due to the need for laboratory experiments and sampling the use of dynamic tests such as lysimetric tests in conjunction with statistical approaches appears to be a feasible option lysimetric experiments are carried out for different purposes such as to assess the amount of irrigation required for cereals incrocci et al 2014 kasam et al 2016 ostad ali askari 2022a treder et al 2017 to indicate the composting effects on biodegradable waste elbl et al 2016 elbl et al 2015 plošek et al 2017 and to simulate the performance of landfill to reveal leachate quantity and the dynamics of contaminants dąbrowska et al 2019 leachate quality and quantity are related to several factors such as waste quantity initial waste moisture content landfill age and type and climatological conditions zhang et al 2013 the presence of soluble substances ions which indicates ec is influenced by the water content of landfill the higher the soluble materials in the leachate the higher the ec thus ec can be used as a contamination indicator in a leachate de sousa et al 2014 and can be measured using a simple method which employs portable sensors within the landfill site or the lysimeter despite the ease of testing ec in the field landfill settlement and employee safety make measurement costly and sensors are prone to malfunctioning during operation diverse approaches have been proposed during the last decades to assess the ec of landfill leachate by sampling methods and laboratory experiments chu et al 1994 assessed two landfill site leachates over ten months between 1990 and 1991 to analyze the properties of the leachate the results of the study showed a positive correlation between chemical oxygen demand cod and ec caused by short term dilution due to seasonal precipitation li and zeiss 2001 mentioned the importance of moisture content as one of the indispensable factors in optimizing the performance of landfill which impacts waste biodegradation rate and ec to establish this time domain reflectometry tdr was applied to determine the moisture content of landfill and it was revealed that ec and porosity are the dominant factors causing variation in moisture content abu rukah and osama 2001 studied the environmental impact of the el akader landfill site located in north jordan on the adjacent area by experimenting the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples regarding the results a potent correlation was seen between chlorine so 4 no 3 and ec in various studies electrical resistivity or ec in reverse has been used to estimate the relationship between moisture content temperature and ec guérin et al 2004 highlighted the imperative role of moisture content in the design and control of bioreactors they mentioned that electrical resistivity is dependent on both moisture and temperature consequently the ec could be used to monitor leachate diffusion and the affected area of the landfill by leachate recirculation due to the importance of moisture content in the biological degradation of bioreactors grellier et al 2006 utilized the electrical resistivity tomography ert method to measure the electrical resistance of leachate samples under two conditions a grained saturated medium and only leachate both tests confirmed the relationship between moisture temperature and ec the results demonstrated that with an increase in temperature of 1 c ec increases by 2 however the high concentration of the suspended material in the leachate reduced the dependence of the ec on temperature moreover the experience showed that a rise in the specific area of the granule media saturated with the same leachate led to a reduction in the effective bulk ec grellier et al 2007 generated a direct correlation between the moisture content of the msw and ec the results showed that the method applied to measure the electrical resistivity could be an influential approach for tracking the variation in moisture content of the msw and evaluating the efficiency of the leachate recirculation system in bioreactors as well as experimental models black box models such as artificial intelligence ai methods can be applied to discern the statistical relationship between various physicochemical parameters in a leachate abunama et al 2019 as well as leachate generation quantity the capability of data driven approaches such as artificial neural networks ann was validated in environmental engineering problems dealing with unclear physics and non linear conditions nourani 2012 lately to address the uncertainties in msw properties and processes in landfill the neuro fuzzy inference system anfis has been employed in relation to this karaca and özkaya 2006 developed an ann model for modeling leachate generation in a landfill site using the daily meteorological data and observed leachate rate the proposed model was able to significantly predict the daily leachate flow rate bagheri et al 2017 used ann and fuzzy logic to simulate the leachate leakage rate into the groundwater aquifer the results were an indicator of the efficiency of the obtained models for predicting and evaluating the impacts of a leachate abunama et al 2018 proposed an anfis model for predicting the leachate generation rate of a landfill site located in malesia by indicating the amount of the dumped waste precipitation and emitted landfill gases in another study abunama et al 2019 utilized a support vector machine svm and ann with a multi linear perceptron mlp to predict the leachate production amount of a landfill site in malesia several studies have assessed the impact of climatic factors on leachate generation however there has been no study from which to draw conclusions about the relationship between climatic factors like temperature and precipitation and leachate characteristics such as ec or moisture which is evaluated in this study moreover a new generation of anns named emotional ann eann was introduced combining artificial emotions with conventional ann khashman 2008 lotfi akbarzadeh t 2016 nourani 2017 which despite being used in various fields has not been used in seepage or leaching the first application of the eann model was by nourani 2017 on hydrological issues for rainfall runoff simulation in reservoirs which indicated the superiority of eann compared to classic ann in order to describe landfill leachate on site measurements are inevitable however landfills are faced with special structural conditions such as instability of slopes or lack of access to deep buried layers which threaten the possibility of on site measuring in this way installing sensors to record the physicochemical properties of landfills seems to be a time consuming and costly process therefore in this study lysimetric tests were conducted to simulate landfill conditions moreover ai based models including ann anfis and eann were developed to analyze the relationships between the recorded pollutant i e ec and hydro environmental parameters of the landfill takingmeteorological and satellite data into consideration due to technical and economic constraints it is usually impossible to collect data from all available lysimeters in landfill sites for some periods as was the case in this study of two lysimeters at the tychy urbanowice landfill site since the conditions of the lysimeters were equal in this instance the transfer learning tl method could be used to estimate the missing ec of the closed lysimeter by employing the models developed for the open lysimeter according to the review of technical literature to date the tl method has been applied in various fields of study pan yang 2010 weiss et al 2016 but it has not been applied in landfills or lysimeters as multiple diverse models would be employed in this study three ensemble techniques including simple averaging weighted averaging and neural ensemble were used to combine the predictions of the individual models and produce the final prediction the motivation for applying ensemble models is to decrease the prediction errors of models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the waste landfill complex with a waste sorting plant is located in the silesian voivodeship in the south eastern district of the city of tychy urbanowice in southern poland the complex of landfills is located in an area with little diversified morphology the area is a slightly lowered sandy plain with slight terrain denivelations the study area is situated in the central part of the upper silesian coal basin within the carpathian foredeep there are carboniferous locally triassic neogene miocene and quaternary sediments the most important of which is carboniferous the average annual air temperature in the area is 8 1 c the coldest month is january average 2 4 c the warmest month is july average 17 8 c and the average annual rainfall is 675 mm woś 2010 the group of landfills is located in a zone with a very low frequency of variation in the occurrence of individual types of weather the climate of the city can be strongly influenced by warm continental air masses precipitation is recorded throughout the year but it plays a dominant role in the summer months mainly in july about 40 of the annual rainfall the hydrogeological profile of the study area is represented by three multi aquifer formations quaternary triassic and carboniferous the sand or sandstone interlayer in the miocene clay complex is also waterlogged in places only the quaternary and carboniferous aquifers are of greater importance a shallow quaternary sand and gravel the thickness is about 10 m is subjected to the negative impact of the old landfill the aquifers under the quaternary are not endangered by anthropogenic influences due to the presence of poorly permeable miocene clays the lysimeter test stand is located next to the system of landfills in tychy urbanowice see fig 1 this system consists of two landfills an active one site i and an abandoned one sites ii iii the lysimeters were intended to simulate the operational phase of the inactive landfill and to show the differences in the leachate occurring due to the infiltration by precipitation water through the waste heap and the leachate generated by the frequently used technology of treating the waste with leachate the old unsealed site had been working before 1988 as a landfill site for building materials and was later transformed into a sanitary landfill this landfill site was closed in 1994 the new active part covers more than 7 ha and consists of two sealed landfill sites two lysimeters were filled with municipal waste with european waste code 19 05 99 this type of waste goes through the d5 neutralization process it is stored in landfills in a deliberately designed manner e g by being placed in sealed separate chambers which are covered and insulated the lysimeter experiment operated for about 400 days from the end of november 2018 until the end of december 2019 the initial measured moisture of the waste was 69 5 a stand pipe field lysimeter test was conducted within the area of the master waste and energy company the owner of the municipal waste landfill in tychy urbanowice the lysimeters were made of pvc pipe with a diameter of 0 42 m and a height of 1 8 m see fig 2 they were equipped with a drainage system composed of a drainage layer of gravel and bowls with a conical end connected to pvc ducts which drain leachates to the receiver from the surface the waste layer was not tightly covered with a filtration layer of gravel lysimeter i was supplied with distilled water with the leachate filled up to the volume of monthly precipitation afterwards to simulate the operating landfill condition the lysimeters were covered with several layers of perforated foil to restrict the supply of air covering the waste with layers of foil was intended to imitate the covers over the top of the waste dump the closed lysimeter lysimeter ii was recharged by rainfall or with distilled water with a volume equal to the average monthly rainfall calculated on the basis of rainfall volume measurements for this landfill in the period 2004 2009 with technology for treating the waste with leachate dąbrowska et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 the open lysimeter lysimeter i was equipped with two gs3 soil moisture temperature and ec sensors the second lysimeter lysimeter ii was equipped with two gs1 soil moisture sensors the sensors were installed in each of the lysimeters at depths of 0 6 m and 1 2 m recording of sensor data took place every hour and was recorded with an em50 basic logger communication with this logger was via a stereo to serial cable connected to a pc the datasets for the current research are comprised of data from two lysimeters internal data pszczyna synoptic station data and satellite data external data which are presented in table 1 the time series of the data are depicted in fig 3 a b and c as illustrated in fig 4 the data from the lysimeters were provided from four different ports namely port 1 and port 2 for the first lysimeter and port 3 and port 4 for the second installed lysimeter port 1 contains moisture data m i a inner temperature data for the lysimeter t i a and electrical conductivity data ec i a port 2 consists of moisture data m i b inner temperature data for the lysimeter t i b and electrical conductivity data ec i b port 3 and port 4 only provided moisture m ii a and respectively the local maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min mean temperature t mean minimum temperature at the ground t ground and precipitation p data were collected from pszczyna synoptic station soil temperature and moisture content were derived from four different bands of the gldas satellite for the region 19 0448e 50 0974 n 19 0532e 50 1014 n namely soil temperature 0 10 cm soil temperature 10 40 cm soil temperature 40 100 cm soil temperature 100 200 cm and soil moisture for the same depths soil moisture and temperature for the depths used in this study were produced with the giovanni online data system which is developed and maintained by the nasa ges disc and the gldas mission scientists 2 2 proposed methodology the relationships between the available data must be identified in order to identify the parameters affecting ec in this way correlation coefficient cc mutual information mi and ai based sensitivity analysis were applied to the available data to analyze the linear and non linear relationships between the parameters and to find the most efficient parameters to predict the ec of lysimeter i considering the models developed for lysimeter i the second lysimeter s missing data ec were estimated by application of the transfer learning method moreover to improve the precision of the developed models the ensemble modeling approach was applied as presented in fig 5 the proposed methodology is outlined in the following steps first step data analysis in the first step all lysimetric hourly and satellite 3 hourly data are converted to daily data since the synoptic station data is recorded daily considering that the tangent sigmoid as the activation function of the ai based models is between 0 and 1 these parameters were normalized to be mapped between 0 and 1 implementing eq 1 before feeding them into the ai based training network to increase the speed and performance of the model and prevent drastic weight reduction 1 x normalized x x min x max x min in this equation x normalized x x min and x max represent the normalized value input data minimum and maximum value of the data set respectively through the use of cc mi and ai based models the linear and non linear relationship between the internal lysimeter data and external data synoptic and satellite data was analyzed correspondingly in the next step the ec prediction model could be developed for lysimeter i based on the relationships identified between the data second step ec prediction regarding the results of the first step ann anfis and eann models were implemented to predict the ec of lysimeter i using the previously determined external parameters as inputs to the models by means of external data which are always available internal data that may have been missed can be obtained in the next step third step missing ec estimation in the previous steps cc and mi were used alongside the ai based models to analyze the linear and nonlinear relationships between the external parameters and inner moisture of lysimeter ii in the third step to evaluate the possibility of using the tl method lysimeter ii data were set as the inputs of the models developed for estimating lysimeter i s moisture as the inner moisture is the only recorded parameter for the second lysimeter when the possibility of using the tl method had been examined through the evaluation criteria the ec of the second lysimeter which was not recorded was estimated using the first lysimeter s already developed models afterwards the ensemble of ai models was developed in order to integrate the advantages of proposing ann anfis and eann models so that the precision of the estimation could be enhanced 2 3 artificial neural network ann the development of the ann utilized in data processing was inspired by biological neural networks seen in the human brain in other terms ann is composed of a series of interconnected processing units nodes capable of performing functions similar to those of a biological neural system in circumstances where understanding the governing relationships of a phenomenon proves to be challenging applying well established rules and methodologies may not be the best option thus researchers attempted to create an ai system that is similar to the human brain in terms of learning inventiveness and flexibility as biological systems are using current neural computing approaches ostad ali askari et al 2017 generally the structure of an ann can be divided into three layers the initial layer of the ann is related to the input data the second layer is known as the hidden layer and consists of hidden nodes parallel to each other where the number of hidden layers can vary in different issues the last layer output layer is the summation of the weighted inputs passed through the activation function in the hidden layer de gennaro et al 2013 nourani 2012 the three layer feed forward neural network ffnn structure with back propagation algorithm was utilized to predict the ec parameter since this structure has shown a better performance in environmental issues maier dandy 2000 due to the favorable rate of convergence the levenberg marquardt scheme of a back propagation algorithm was used to train the ann haykin 1994 kisi 2004 nourani 2012 respecting the data pre processing method scaling the data between 0 and 1 a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid tansig was used as an activation function nourani 2012 the number of hidden neurons as well as the epoch number are of pivotal importance in determining the proper structure of the ann model for this purpose the trial error procedure was conducted nourani et al 2019b 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the anfis model is composed of an adaptive ann and fuzzy logic fl in which the merits of both systems are implemented fuzzifier fuzzy data base and de fuzzifier are the three major components of each fuzzy system where the fuzzy rule base and the inference engine are the two fundamental components of a fuzzy data base afterwards the fuzzy inference engine does the analysis in this model data analysis is carried out via the fuzzy inference engine from which the takagi sugeno ts was employed in the current study the process of implementing various learning techniques of neural networks in the framework of a fuzzy inference system fis is defined as a neuro fuzzy simulation for this purpose the membership functions mfs are exploited as fuzzifiers of the inputs thus the gaussian membership function was employed to map the inputs between 0 and 1 different methods such as back propagation or least squares can be used to train the parameters related to the input and output mfs however in the anfis fuzzy language rules or conditional statements are defined to train the model rather than the weight adjustment fig 6 illustrates the 5 layers of the anfis structure in which two ts fuzzy if then rules are included as below r u l e 1 i f μ x i s a 1 a n d μ y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 r 1 r u l e 2 i f μ x i s a 2 a n d μ y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x 1 q 2 x 2 r 2 where a 1 a 2 and b 1 b 2 indicates the mfs of the input x and y p 1 q 1 r 1 and p 2 q 2 r 2 define the output function parameters nourani komasi 2013 the iteration epoch of the training phase in the anfis model is halted when the minimum error between the target and output of the model is reached 2 5 emotional ann eann the combination of artificial emotion and the conventional ann has led to a new generation called the eann in which hormones are produced to calibrate the node s performance within each node of the eann the information repeatedly changes between the input and output units furthermore these nodes can emit dynamic hormones namely h a h b and h c which are initialized first in the training process on the basis of input and output data before the hormones are modified in the learning phase illustrated in fig 7 moreover the generated hormonal coefficients influence the other node s units in the training phase the hormonal and neural paths are depicted as dotted and solid lines respectively in fig 7 the output of the ith node containing h a h b and h c is defined by eq 2 in the eann model nourani 2017 2 y i γ i h i h h h 1 f j β i h x i h h h 2 α i j h φ i j k h h x i j 3 μ i h ψ i h h h 4 in which the artificial hormones are calculated as nourani 2017 3 h h i h i h h a b c the implemented weights to the activation function f are indicted by the term 1 in eq 2 which contains the dynamic hormonal weight of h i h h h and the constant neural weight of γ i terms 2 and 3 declare the given weight to the summation function and x i j an input from the jth node of the former layer respectively the bias of the summation function containing the neural and the hormonal μ i and h ψ i h h h is defined with term 4 the coefficients of i h χ i h φ i j k and ψ i h are the controlling factors of the share of the overall hormonal level i e h h subsequently the hormonal feedback of the h i h is provided by the ith node output y i as eq 4 nourani 2017 4 h i h g l a n d i t y i h y i where the glandity factor is tuned in the training process the proper level of hormones can be developed for the glands to initialize the hormonal values of the h h various schemes can be utilized such as the average of the input vector of learning samples to derive the appropriate equivalence between the approximated and observed time series of the target the hormonal values must be updated through the learning process considering eq 3 and 4 and the network output y i 2 6 transfer learning machine learning as one of the most widely used branches of ai identifies and explores the processes and patterns that enable computers to learn and help humankind to choose the proper prevention or control policy shadabfar et al 2021 sioofy khoojine et al 2021 the goal of machine learning is for the computer to be able to gradually become more efficient in the task at hand and do so with increasing quantities of data data mining and machine learning have made major advances in many engineering fields in recent years there are common assumptions on which machine learning methods work and the basic premise of these methods is that training and test data have the same feature space shimodaira 2000 most statistical models have to be restructured when the distribution of data changes it is either impossible or not cost effective to recatch training data and restructure models in many practical applications so reducing the need for this practice seems to be reasonable in these cases model transfer or learning transfer between different domains that are connected by a high level domain may be desirable weiss et al 2016 in fact transferlearning is the ability of a system to recognize and apply previously learned knowledge and skills in this definition the transfer of learning is effected with the aim of extracting knowledge from one or more tasks and applying knowledge to a target task pan yang 2010 the present study uses the tl method to transfer the model governing the first lysimeter to the second lysimeter enabling ec data that has not been recorded in the second lysimeter to be estimated using the ai model developed for the first lysimeter because of the ability to apply the model from one system to another through the tl method discussed it is critical to determine whether both lysimeters and their governing conditions are the same the black box model of the first lysimeter can be used in the second lysimeter to estimate the ec if the similarity between the two systems is proven in other words when the conditions of the lysimeters are equal and the only different is their amount of precipitation received and also both lysimeters are the sub branches of the greater system landfills the tl method can be applied to transfer the developed models of the first lysimeter to the second lysimeter by implementing the second lysimeter s data as the inputs of the models to prove the governing conditions for the two lysimeters deterministic equations of the seepage phenomena are used since the landfill system is a sub branch of the surrounding environment and leachate production is a deterministic phenomenon even in lysimeters the advection dispersion equation ade equations for these two lysimeters can be written as 5 e c 1 t t e r m 1 v 1 e c 1 t e r m 2 d 1 2 e c 1 t e r m 3 i 1 t e c 2 t v 2 e c 2 d 2 2 e c 2 i 2 t in differential equations the left side of the equation represents the parameters of the system itself while the right side represents the external force which are external inputs i in this case synoptic and satellite data see fig 8 the left side of eq 5 consists of three terms the first term demonstrates the variation of ec proportion to time the second term includes velocity and ec gradient parameters the governing equation for the water flow velocity within the soil v can be defined as 6 v 1 k 1 h x v 2 k 2 h x in these equations k is dependent on soil type here waste type which is the same in both lysimeters on the other hand due to the proximity of the two lysimeters the term h x is equal in both lysimeters hence the second term of eq 5 is only dependent on ec the parameters in the third term include ec laplacian and diffusion coefficient d and d is constant in both lysimeters due to the equal conditions governing them therefore regarding the ade equation it could be assumed that parameters d and v are the same for both lysimeters and the only difference is whether it s open or closed which alters with the external situation the ec of each lysimeter is the function of i hence owing to the deterministic conditions governing eq 5 and step two ai based it could be said that ec is a function of external parameters affecting the lysimeters 7 e c 1 f k 1 d 1 i 1 f i 1 e c 2 f k 2 d 2 i 2 f i 2 where f is constant in both lysimeters simulation and prediction using ai have so far been performed based on historical data data required for network training where both training and testing data came from the same domain in certain situations a network could not be trained due to a lack of historical data in this case a network can be built using data from a domain associated with the target domain and transfer learning will then be implemented thus data for the training and target must be in different domains but connected by a high level domain to apply the transfer learning method based on the conditions of the lysimeters open or closed the only difference is in the amount of rain received and since the right side of the differential equation represents the external force to the system the other variables are assumed to be the same therefore it can be concluded that if the precipitation parameter over the test period entered into the system is considered to be a very low or zero value for the closed lysimeter and the soil moisture parameter is set to be the daily average of 6 years period of 2004 2009 corresponding to the available time series the trained models for the first lysimeter can be used to estimate the ec of the second lysimeter by the implementing the second lysimeter s data in the models 2 7 ensemble model in recent decades ensemble modeling has been one of the most significant advances in ai based models the main idea of this multi model method is to use the unique capabilities of each model to optimally estimate the data series pattern in other words ensemble methodsintegrate multiple learning models to achieve a betterpredictive performancethan could be obtained from any of the constituent learning models alone rokach 2010 zhang and peter 2003 a total of three ensemble techniques were employed a simple averaging method eq 8 a weighted averaging method weighted by dc validation values eq 9 and 10 and a neural ensemble model with the first two methods the results of ann anfis and eann models are linearly combined whereas with the third method eann is used as the kernel of the ensemble model due to its greater applicability although other ai based models may be utilized e g ann and anfis 8 f e c 1 n i 1 n f i e c 9 f e c i 1 n w i f i e c 10 w i dc i i 1 n dc i where f e c is the output of the ensembled model f i e c is the outputs of the individual models in this case ann anfis and eann n is the number of individually developed models and w i is the weight parameter determined based on the dc of individual models 2 8 evaluation criteria the performance of the developed models was evaluated be means of statistical criteria namely the determination coefficient dc and root mean square error rmse during both the training and verification phases the rmse is used to demonstrate the standard deviation between the predictors and the predictands which ranges from 0 to the closer the value is to 0 the more effective the prediction is the dc value runs between and 1 having a value of 1 indicates an excellent fit and the ability to predict the future accurately the equations of rmse and dc presented as follows 11 rmse i 1 n r i z i 2 n 12 dc 1 i 1 n r i z i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 where r i is the observed data lysimeters data z i is the model output r is the mean of observed data and n is the total number of outputs 3 results and discussion in this research the ffnn based models ffnn anfis and eann were implemented to accurately predict the ec parameter for the first lysimeter subsequently the tl method was employed to assess the second lysimeter s missing ec for this purpose as the proposed methodology entails distinct steps the results are provided and discussed in the steps as follows 3 1 results of data analysis there are two sources of moisture in a landfill one is external including precipitation runoff snowmelt and soil moisture while the other is internal namely the initial waste moisture along with moisture from biological reactions within the landfill since the tychy urbanowice landfill system contains both active and closed landfills two lysimeters were used to model their conditions for this modeling the first lysimeter active landfill model is designed to be open and allow moisture from both external and internal sources the lysimeter was charged with leachate to initiate the operating landfill condition whereas the second lysimeter inactive landfill model uses initial waste moisture and injected distilled water equal to the precipitation measured during the landfill operation the environmental parameters affecting the moisture of the landfill are atmospheric temperature and precipitation soil temperature and moisture precipitation or infiltrated soil moisture could lead to an increase in landfill leachate production and consequently higher the ec furthermore an increased temperature causes evaporation for instance in the summer which leads to a decrease in moisture however this increase in temperature can also increase the bacterial activity inside the landfill resulting in more leachate production and higher dissolved organic materials concentration considering that ec arises from ions in water ec consequently rises when bacterial activity increases as soluble materials increase in the leachate as does leachate production in view of the aforementioned sophisticated relations it is therefore necessary to examine not only the linear relationships cc but also the nonlinear relationships mi and ai to find the connection between moisture temperature and ec in the first step the cc feature extraction method was applied to discover the linear relationships between the external parameters and lysimetric data alongside this method mi was used to recognize the nonlinear relationships see table 2 then ai based models were developed to conduct the sensitivity analysis over external and internal parameters and to achieve the optimum structure of the ai networks i e number of hidden neurons training epoch number of membership functions membership function type and hormones therefore the effective parameters for moisture temperature and ec variation were obtained from this various combinations of available parameters as given in table 3 were prepared for sensitivity analysis via the ffnn anfis and eann methods considering the cc and mi results table 2 it can be seen that at depths of 100 cm to 200 cm the results demonstrated a strong correlation between the internal moisture content of the lysimeters and the soil moisture retrieved from the satellite as external data in addition as depth decreases the linear correlation gradually declines since some borderline factors such as evaporation affect the amount of moisture at these depths reducing the linear correlation therefore in ai based models of table 3 the soil moisture parameter in the depth ranges of 0 to 10 and 10 to 40 cm was excluded from the input combinations it is not only the infiltrated water that can impact the moisture content of the lysimeter but also initial waste moisture and chemical and biological reactions therefore temperature and moisture parameters should be included in the ai based models as the inputs in order to avoid the phenomenon of over training when time series are available for a relatively short period i e ai based models could not experience various seasons of different years the data can be randomized before being fed into the models thereafter the inputs of the network were normalized within the intervals of 0 and 1 due to the activation function s nature and to speed up the training and to diminish the disproportionate weighting determining the optimum structure for the ffnn plays a crucial role in training the network as does appropriate input selection for this purpose the trial error method was employed to detect the best structure for the ai models regarding the results of the sensitivity analysis between the lysimetric data it was clear that the moisture content of the lysimeters had a significant influence on the variation rate of the ec over time moreover since the temperature parameter is one of the key factors in the evaporation and reaction rate within the waste using the temperature and moisture of the lysimeters together as inputs increased the models performance by 5 3 and 3 4 for ffnn and 12 9 and 11 4 for both anfis and eann for the first and second port in each model respectively see table 3 based on the strong correlation between moisture ec external and inner temperature to reach the optimal input combination the relationships between the external parameters and the moisture content of the first lysimeter were investigated by employing the ffnn anfis and eann regarding the condition of the lysimeters it was expected that the precipitation parameter alone might not have a strong connection with the moisture parameter in the closed lysimeter the models developed demonstrated the same notion there was however an increase in model performance when the precipitation parameter was included in the input data set of the open lysimeter furthermore the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the soil moisture contents obtained from satellites within the depths of 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm have an acceptable correlation with the moisture content of the lysimeters hence if the synoptic station data were not available or sufficient the satellite data could be a viable alternative for this purpose since the satellites have covered almost all countries for over 70 years with regard to the results it was seen that satellite soil temperature data at depths of 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm t mean t max t min t 1 and t 2 have strong relationships with the temperature parameter of the lysimeter since maximum and minimum temperature can cause evaporation or freezing within the lysimeters t max and t min were added as inputs to improve the models performance finally in the case of including all the moisture related parameters i e synoptic and satellite moisture in the input combination considering the rolled out parameters alongside the temperature related ones the moisture content of the lysimeter was optimally estimated using ffnn anfis and eann for lysimeter i in port 1 a and port 2 b the summary of the results sensitivity analysis is presented in table 4 it is clear from the results obtained that the ec and the internal moisture and temperature of the lysimeters are closely related and effective external parameters also influence the internal parameters thus ec modeling requires both internal and external moisture and temperature which are used in the following steps 3 2 results of ec prediction based on the results of the previous step the internal moisture parameter is the dominant parameter affecting the ec changes moreover regarding the cc and the sensitivity analysis results provided in the first step the external parameters affecting internal moisture are also known therefore we developed a model for predicting ec with the same inputs as the optimum inputs from the previous step in order to model the ec of lysimeter i using the external parameters as one of the minor goals of this paper ai models were again developed to determine a relationship between the ec and selected external parameters hence the models developed on the basis of external inputs could be used when the measuring devices fail or the records are corrupted for any reason two combinations which led to higher accuracies in the previous step were selected to predict the ec parameter table 5 likewise in the past step to prevent overtraining the inputs were randomized with the same algorithm for each combination with regards to the developed models it could be observed that the overall performances dcs of the models under various conditions were above 0 80 for eann and anfis and 0 70 for ffnn in both the training and verification phases therefore in cases where the available landfill data are corrupted the attached sensors malfunction or landfill conditions make sampling and installation impossible i e the landfill is not sanitary or closed it is feasible to rely on external parameters e g meteorological station and satellite data to predict the ec parameter a proxy for leachate pollution furthermore according to table 5 it is clear that the eann models outperformed both the anfis and ffnn models 3 3 results of ec estimation the aim of this study is to use the tl method to transfer the model governing the lysimeter i to the lysimeter ii allowing the ec data that hasn t been recorded in the second lysimeter to be estimated using the developed ai model for the first lysimeter with the lysimetric monitoring conducted in an open area and in the vicinity of one another and considering the results of the first two steps it can be concluded that the lysimeter s system is a sub branch of the surrounding system moreover the results obtained in the first step indicate that changes in the ec parameter correlate strongly with the lysimeter s internal moisture and temperature as well furthermore considering the results of the trained ai models in the second step it may be concluded that the ec parameter can be derived directly using external parameters i e synoptic station and satellite data consequently the possibility of model transferring can be examined by employing an available parameter of the second lysimeter as the target of the models hence the possibility of model transfer from lysimeter i to lysimeter ii was assessed and approved see table 6 the results presented in table 6 show that ffnn anfis and eann with a dc above 0 8 are compatible with estimating the second lysimeter s moisture using the already trained models from the first lysimeter with regard to the conditions of the lysimeters open or closed the only difference is in the precipitation parameter therefore it can be concluded that if the precipitation parameter over the test period entered into the system is considered as a very low or zero value for the closed lysimeter and the soil moisture parameter is set to be the daily average of 6 years period of 2004 2009 corresponding to the operating years of the landfill the trained models for the first lysimeter can be used to estimate the ec of the second lysimeter to demonstrate this the ec for the second lysimeter was predicted using the first lysimeter s ec as the target of the models the results of the ec estimation for lysimeter ii are depicted in table 7 subsequently an ensemble of the most effective ai based models was developed in order to improve the results of the model three ensemble techniques were employed the results of ffnn anfis and eann models being linearly combined in the first two methods with the third method eann was used as the kernel of the ensemble model due to its greater applicability an ensemble of neural models was trained using the outputs of the three developed models as inputs see table 8 the data acquired from each of the individual ffnn anfis and eann models were used as inputs in the first layer of the neural ensemble models as the second layer the observed ec data served as the target data and the last layer was the output layer which yields estimated ec data known as neural ensemble model outputs according to the results presented in table 8 the first two techniques showed a slight improvement and the neural ensemble model surpasses all other models when predicting missing ec time series 4 conclusions in this paper the ec parameter as an indicator of landfill leachate pollution with the capability of portable measurements was estimated by implementing ann anfis and the eann a new generation of ann models with a few hormonal parameters for this purpose a lysimetric experiment was carried out with two lysimeters to simulate the operating and closed landfills of tychy urbanowice since the moisture and temperature inside the landfill or lysimeters can alter the ec parameter by affecting the rate of soluble materials inside the leachate cc mi and ai based models were utilized to analyze the relationships between these variables moreover external environmental parameters such as meteorological data and soil moisture showed a significant correlation with the ec parameter as they can affect the inner moisture and temperature of the landfill or lysimeter the results of the data analysis indicated that the inner moisture parameter is the dominant factor in ec fluctuations the data provided by the gldas are reliable and can be used in input data sets the moisture of the lysimeters could be predicted using external data external temperature and soil temperature revealed a potent relationship with the temperature of the lysimeters subsequently the ec parameters of the first lysimeter were estimated using satellite and synoptic data following this the missing ec parameters were simulated via the transfer learning method by employing all three aforementioned ai models finally the neural ensemble model was constructed based on the outputs of the three separate models i e ann anfis and eann which demonstrated a dc performance enhancement of almost 20 over the existing ai models for ec prediction in conclusion it should be noted that due to its hormonal parameters eann could lead to more precise estimations of ec and it is suggested that satellite soil moisture and temperature data be implemented because of their reliability and availability for almost all countries

3140,predicting leachate pollutants is of prime importance in detecting the amount of pollution in water resources adjacent to sources of leakage in this study electrical conductivity ec as a physicochemical water pollution parameter with the possibility of portable measurement was used as an indicator of leachate quality for the tychy urbanowice operating and closed landfill complex in order to simulate landfill conditions two lysimeter experiments were conducted simultaneously using sensors mounted in the lysimeters from the end of november 2018 to the end of december 2019 ec waste temperature and waste moisture were measured for the open lysimeter and only waste moisture for the closed lysimeter additionally meteorological data obtained from the nearest synoptic station and soil moisture and temperature acquired from the gldas satellite were employed as external data to analyze various conditions thereafter artificial neural network ann neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and emotional ann eann models were developed to determine the parameters affecting the ec value recorded for the open lysimeter and subsequently predict the missing ec parameter of the closed lysimeter by employing the transfer learning method following that in order to improve the precision of ec predictions ensemble techniques were applied to the outputs of the models that were developed the results showed that the moisture of the lysimeters made a significant contribution to the ec value prediction it is worth mentioning that among ann anfis and eann the eann model yielded more precise results in ec estimation with the average dc above 0 80 and 0 90 for individual and ensembled modeling in both the training and verification phases respectively keywords landfill leachate lysimeter artificial neural network ann neuro fuzzy inference system anfis emotional ann eann tychy urbanowice landfill complex poland data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the dependence of living organisms on water supplies has led many researchers to study the hazards related to water resources one of these hazards is leachate the most detrimental by product of municipal solid waste msw which is increasing drastically due to the rapid population growth urbanization consumerism and high end technology of this era therefore finding a proper disposal method for msw is one of the main concerns of urban management ostad ali askari 2022b regarding the waste management hierarchy the last option for msw management is disposal hence one of the safest and most economical approaches for disposing of msw is to dump it in a sanitary landfill white et al 1995 the leachate generated from msw is affected by the composition of the dumped waste the liquid infiltration and the physical chemical and biological reactions within the landfill uncontrolled migration of leachate would introduce highly contaminating and toxic chemicals into the adjacent environment resulting in the immediate pollution of soil and water supplies xie et al 2009 therefore leachate must be monitored appropriately and treated properly during the landfill operation and even after closure to diminish its environmental effects and health related issues ostad ali askari 2022b since studying leachate contamination of surface and groundwater supplies is costly and time consuming due to the need for laboratory experiments and sampling the use of dynamic tests such as lysimetric tests in conjunction with statistical approaches appears to be a feasible option lysimetric experiments are carried out for different purposes such as to assess the amount of irrigation required for cereals incrocci et al 2014 kasam et al 2016 ostad ali askari 2022a treder et al 2017 to indicate the composting effects on biodegradable waste elbl et al 2016 elbl et al 2015 plošek et al 2017 and to simulate the performance of landfill to reveal leachate quantity and the dynamics of contaminants dąbrowska et al 2019 leachate quality and quantity are related to several factors such as waste quantity initial waste moisture content landfill age and type and climatological conditions zhang et al 2013 the presence of soluble substances ions which indicates ec is influenced by the water content of landfill the higher the soluble materials in the leachate the higher the ec thus ec can be used as a contamination indicator in a leachate de sousa et al 2014 and can be measured using a simple method which employs portable sensors within the landfill site or the lysimeter despite the ease of testing ec in the field landfill settlement and employee safety make measurement costly and sensors are prone to malfunctioning during operation diverse approaches have been proposed during the last decades to assess the ec of landfill leachate by sampling methods and laboratory experiments chu et al 1994 assessed two landfill site leachates over ten months between 1990 and 1991 to analyze the properties of the leachate the results of the study showed a positive correlation between chemical oxygen demand cod and ec caused by short term dilution due to seasonal precipitation li and zeiss 2001 mentioned the importance of moisture content as one of the indispensable factors in optimizing the performance of landfill which impacts waste biodegradation rate and ec to establish this time domain reflectometry tdr was applied to determine the moisture content of landfill and it was revealed that ec and porosity are the dominant factors causing variation in moisture content abu rukah and osama 2001 studied the environmental impact of the el akader landfill site located in north jordan on the adjacent area by experimenting the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples regarding the results a potent correlation was seen between chlorine so 4 no 3 and ec in various studies electrical resistivity or ec in reverse has been used to estimate the relationship between moisture content temperature and ec guérin et al 2004 highlighted the imperative role of moisture content in the design and control of bioreactors they mentioned that electrical resistivity is dependent on both moisture and temperature consequently the ec could be used to monitor leachate diffusion and the affected area of the landfill by leachate recirculation due to the importance of moisture content in the biological degradation of bioreactors grellier et al 2006 utilized the electrical resistivity tomography ert method to measure the electrical resistance of leachate samples under two conditions a grained saturated medium and only leachate both tests confirmed the relationship between moisture temperature and ec the results demonstrated that with an increase in temperature of 1 c ec increases by 2 however the high concentration of the suspended material in the leachate reduced the dependence of the ec on temperature moreover the experience showed that a rise in the specific area of the granule media saturated with the same leachate led to a reduction in the effective bulk ec grellier et al 2007 generated a direct correlation between the moisture content of the msw and ec the results showed that the method applied to measure the electrical resistivity could be an influential approach for tracking the variation in moisture content of the msw and evaluating the efficiency of the leachate recirculation system in bioreactors as well as experimental models black box models such as artificial intelligence ai methods can be applied to discern the statistical relationship between various physicochemical parameters in a leachate abunama et al 2019 as well as leachate generation quantity the capability of data driven approaches such as artificial neural networks ann was validated in environmental engineering problems dealing with unclear physics and non linear conditions nourani 2012 lately to address the uncertainties in msw properties and processes in landfill the neuro fuzzy inference system anfis has been employed in relation to this karaca and özkaya 2006 developed an ann model for modeling leachate generation in a landfill site using the daily meteorological data and observed leachate rate the proposed model was able to significantly predict the daily leachate flow rate bagheri et al 2017 used ann and fuzzy logic to simulate the leachate leakage rate into the groundwater aquifer the results were an indicator of the efficiency of the obtained models for predicting and evaluating the impacts of a leachate abunama et al 2018 proposed an anfis model for predicting the leachate generation rate of a landfill site located in malesia by indicating the amount of the dumped waste precipitation and emitted landfill gases in another study abunama et al 2019 utilized a support vector machine svm and ann with a multi linear perceptron mlp to predict the leachate production amount of a landfill site in malesia several studies have assessed the impact of climatic factors on leachate generation however there has been no study from which to draw conclusions about the relationship between climatic factors like temperature and precipitation and leachate characteristics such as ec or moisture which is evaluated in this study moreover a new generation of anns named emotional ann eann was introduced combining artificial emotions with conventional ann khashman 2008 lotfi akbarzadeh t 2016 nourani 2017 which despite being used in various fields has not been used in seepage or leaching the first application of the eann model was by nourani 2017 on hydrological issues for rainfall runoff simulation in reservoirs which indicated the superiority of eann compared to classic ann in order to describe landfill leachate on site measurements are inevitable however landfills are faced with special structural conditions such as instability of slopes or lack of access to deep buried layers which threaten the possibility of on site measuring in this way installing sensors to record the physicochemical properties of landfills seems to be a time consuming and costly process therefore in this study lysimetric tests were conducted to simulate landfill conditions moreover ai based models including ann anfis and eann were developed to analyze the relationships between the recorded pollutant i e ec and hydro environmental parameters of the landfill takingmeteorological and satellite data into consideration due to technical and economic constraints it is usually impossible to collect data from all available lysimeters in landfill sites for some periods as was the case in this study of two lysimeters at the tychy urbanowice landfill site since the conditions of the lysimeters were equal in this instance the transfer learning tl method could be used to estimate the missing ec of the closed lysimeter by employing the models developed for the open lysimeter according to the review of technical literature to date the tl method has been applied in various fields of study pan yang 2010 weiss et al 2016 but it has not been applied in landfills or lysimeters as multiple diverse models would be employed in this study three ensemble techniques including simple averaging weighted averaging and neural ensemble were used to combine the predictions of the individual models and produce the final prediction the motivation for applying ensemble models is to decrease the prediction errors of models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the waste landfill complex with a waste sorting plant is located in the silesian voivodeship in the south eastern district of the city of tychy urbanowice in southern poland the complex of landfills is located in an area with little diversified morphology the area is a slightly lowered sandy plain with slight terrain denivelations the study area is situated in the central part of the upper silesian coal basin within the carpathian foredeep there are carboniferous locally triassic neogene miocene and quaternary sediments the most important of which is carboniferous the average annual air temperature in the area is 8 1 c the coldest month is january average 2 4 c the warmest month is july average 17 8 c and the average annual rainfall is 675 mm woś 2010 the group of landfills is located in a zone with a very low frequency of variation in the occurrence of individual types of weather the climate of the city can be strongly influenced by warm continental air masses precipitation is recorded throughout the year but it plays a dominant role in the summer months mainly in july about 40 of the annual rainfall the hydrogeological profile of the study area is represented by three multi aquifer formations quaternary triassic and carboniferous the sand or sandstone interlayer in the miocene clay complex is also waterlogged in places only the quaternary and carboniferous aquifers are of greater importance a shallow quaternary sand and gravel the thickness is about 10 m is subjected to the negative impact of the old landfill the aquifers under the quaternary are not endangered by anthropogenic influences due to the presence of poorly permeable miocene clays the lysimeter test stand is located next to the system of landfills in tychy urbanowice see fig 1 this system consists of two landfills an active one site i and an abandoned one sites ii iii the lysimeters were intended to simulate the operational phase of the inactive landfill and to show the differences in the leachate occurring due to the infiltration by precipitation water through the waste heap and the leachate generated by the frequently used technology of treating the waste with leachate the old unsealed site had been working before 1988 as a landfill site for building materials and was later transformed into a sanitary landfill this landfill site was closed in 1994 the new active part covers more than 7 ha and consists of two sealed landfill sites two lysimeters were filled with municipal waste with european waste code 19 05 99 this type of waste goes through the d5 neutralization process it is stored in landfills in a deliberately designed manner e g by being placed in sealed separate chambers which are covered and insulated the lysimeter experiment operated for about 400 days from the end of november 2018 until the end of december 2019 the initial measured moisture of the waste was 69 5 a stand pipe field lysimeter test was conducted within the area of the master waste and energy company the owner of the municipal waste landfill in tychy urbanowice the lysimeters were made of pvc pipe with a diameter of 0 42 m and a height of 1 8 m see fig 2 they were equipped with a drainage system composed of a drainage layer of gravel and bowls with a conical end connected to pvc ducts which drain leachates to the receiver from the surface the waste layer was not tightly covered with a filtration layer of gravel lysimeter i was supplied with distilled water with the leachate filled up to the volume of monthly precipitation afterwards to simulate the operating landfill condition the lysimeters were covered with several layers of perforated foil to restrict the supply of air covering the waste with layers of foil was intended to imitate the covers over the top of the waste dump the closed lysimeter lysimeter ii was recharged by rainfall or with distilled water with a volume equal to the average monthly rainfall calculated on the basis of rainfall volume measurements for this landfill in the period 2004 2009 with technology for treating the waste with leachate dąbrowska et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 the open lysimeter lysimeter i was equipped with two gs3 soil moisture temperature and ec sensors the second lysimeter lysimeter ii was equipped with two gs1 soil moisture sensors the sensors were installed in each of the lysimeters at depths of 0 6 m and 1 2 m recording of sensor data took place every hour and was recorded with an em50 basic logger communication with this logger was via a stereo to serial cable connected to a pc the datasets for the current research are comprised of data from two lysimeters internal data pszczyna synoptic station data and satellite data external data which are presented in table 1 the time series of the data are depicted in fig 3 a b and c as illustrated in fig 4 the data from the lysimeters were provided from four different ports namely port 1 and port 2 for the first lysimeter and port 3 and port 4 for the second installed lysimeter port 1 contains moisture data m i a inner temperature data for the lysimeter t i a and electrical conductivity data ec i a port 2 consists of moisture data m i b inner temperature data for the lysimeter t i b and electrical conductivity data ec i b port 3 and port 4 only provided moisture m ii a and respectively the local maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min mean temperature t mean minimum temperature at the ground t ground and precipitation p data were collected from pszczyna synoptic station soil temperature and moisture content were derived from four different bands of the gldas satellite for the region 19 0448e 50 0974 n 19 0532e 50 1014 n namely soil temperature 0 10 cm soil temperature 10 40 cm soil temperature 40 100 cm soil temperature 100 200 cm and soil moisture for the same depths soil moisture and temperature for the depths used in this study were produced with the giovanni online data system which is developed and maintained by the nasa ges disc and the gldas mission scientists 2 2 proposed methodology the relationships between the available data must be identified in order to identify the parameters affecting ec in this way correlation coefficient cc mutual information mi and ai based sensitivity analysis were applied to the available data to analyze the linear and non linear relationships between the parameters and to find the most efficient parameters to predict the ec of lysimeter i considering the models developed for lysimeter i the second lysimeter s missing data ec were estimated by application of the transfer learning method moreover to improve the precision of the developed models the ensemble modeling approach was applied as presented in fig 5 the proposed methodology is outlined in the following steps first step data analysis in the first step all lysimetric hourly and satellite 3 hourly data are converted to daily data since the synoptic station data is recorded daily considering that the tangent sigmoid as the activation function of the ai based models is between 0 and 1 these parameters were normalized to be mapped between 0 and 1 implementing eq 1 before feeding them into the ai based training network to increase the speed and performance of the model and prevent drastic weight reduction 1 x normalized x x min x max x min in this equation x normalized x x min and x max represent the normalized value input data minimum and maximum value of the data set respectively through the use of cc mi and ai based models the linear and non linear relationship between the internal lysimeter data and external data synoptic and satellite data was analyzed correspondingly in the next step the ec prediction model could be developed for lysimeter i based on the relationships identified between the data second step ec prediction regarding the results of the first step ann anfis and eann models were implemented to predict the ec of lysimeter i using the previously determined external parameters as inputs to the models by means of external data which are always available internal data that may have been missed can be obtained in the next step third step missing ec estimation in the previous steps cc and mi were used alongside the ai based models to analyze the linear and nonlinear relationships between the external parameters and inner moisture of lysimeter ii in the third step to evaluate the possibility of using the tl method lysimeter ii data were set as the inputs of the models developed for estimating lysimeter i s moisture as the inner moisture is the only recorded parameter for the second lysimeter when the possibility of using the tl method had been examined through the evaluation criteria the ec of the second lysimeter which was not recorded was estimated using the first lysimeter s already developed models afterwards the ensemble of ai models was developed in order to integrate the advantages of proposing ann anfis and eann models so that the precision of the estimation could be enhanced 2 3 artificial neural network ann the development of the ann utilized in data processing was inspired by biological neural networks seen in the human brain in other terms ann is composed of a series of interconnected processing units nodes capable of performing functions similar to those of a biological neural system in circumstances where understanding the governing relationships of a phenomenon proves to be challenging applying well established rules and methodologies may not be the best option thus researchers attempted to create an ai system that is similar to the human brain in terms of learning inventiveness and flexibility as biological systems are using current neural computing approaches ostad ali askari et al 2017 generally the structure of an ann can be divided into three layers the initial layer of the ann is related to the input data the second layer is known as the hidden layer and consists of hidden nodes parallel to each other where the number of hidden layers can vary in different issues the last layer output layer is the summation of the weighted inputs passed through the activation function in the hidden layer de gennaro et al 2013 nourani 2012 the three layer feed forward neural network ffnn structure with back propagation algorithm was utilized to predict the ec parameter since this structure has shown a better performance in environmental issues maier dandy 2000 due to the favorable rate of convergence the levenberg marquardt scheme of a back propagation algorithm was used to train the ann haykin 1994 kisi 2004 nourani 2012 respecting the data pre processing method scaling the data between 0 and 1 a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid tansig was used as an activation function nourani 2012 the number of hidden neurons as well as the epoch number are of pivotal importance in determining the proper structure of the ann model for this purpose the trial error procedure was conducted nourani et al 2019b 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the anfis model is composed of an adaptive ann and fuzzy logic fl in which the merits of both systems are implemented fuzzifier fuzzy data base and de fuzzifier are the three major components of each fuzzy system where the fuzzy rule base and the inference engine are the two fundamental components of a fuzzy data base afterwards the fuzzy inference engine does the analysis in this model data analysis is carried out via the fuzzy inference engine from which the takagi sugeno ts was employed in the current study the process of implementing various learning techniques of neural networks in the framework of a fuzzy inference system fis is defined as a neuro fuzzy simulation for this purpose the membership functions mfs are exploited as fuzzifiers of the inputs thus the gaussian membership function was employed to map the inputs between 0 and 1 different methods such as back propagation or least squares can be used to train the parameters related to the input and output mfs however in the anfis fuzzy language rules or conditional statements are defined to train the model rather than the weight adjustment fig 6 illustrates the 5 layers of the anfis structure in which two ts fuzzy if then rules are included as below r u l e 1 i f μ x i s a 1 a n d μ y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 r 1 r u l e 2 i f μ x i s a 2 a n d μ y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x 1 q 2 x 2 r 2 where a 1 a 2 and b 1 b 2 indicates the mfs of the input x and y p 1 q 1 r 1 and p 2 q 2 r 2 define the output function parameters nourani komasi 2013 the iteration epoch of the training phase in the anfis model is halted when the minimum error between the target and output of the model is reached 2 5 emotional ann eann the combination of artificial emotion and the conventional ann has led to a new generation called the eann in which hormones are produced to calibrate the node s performance within each node of the eann the information repeatedly changes between the input and output units furthermore these nodes can emit dynamic hormones namely h a h b and h c which are initialized first in the training process on the basis of input and output data before the hormones are modified in the learning phase illustrated in fig 7 moreover the generated hormonal coefficients influence the other node s units in the training phase the hormonal and neural paths are depicted as dotted and solid lines respectively in fig 7 the output of the ith node containing h a h b and h c is defined by eq 2 in the eann model nourani 2017 2 y i γ i h i h h h 1 f j β i h x i h h h 2 α i j h φ i j k h h x i j 3 μ i h ψ i h h h 4 in which the artificial hormones are calculated as nourani 2017 3 h h i h i h h a b c the implemented weights to the activation function f are indicted by the term 1 in eq 2 which contains the dynamic hormonal weight of h i h h h and the constant neural weight of γ i terms 2 and 3 declare the given weight to the summation function and x i j an input from the jth node of the former layer respectively the bias of the summation function containing the neural and the hormonal μ i and h ψ i h h h is defined with term 4 the coefficients of i h χ i h φ i j k and ψ i h are the controlling factors of the share of the overall hormonal level i e h h subsequently the hormonal feedback of the h i h is provided by the ith node output y i as eq 4 nourani 2017 4 h i h g l a n d i t y i h y i where the glandity factor is tuned in the training process the proper level of hormones can be developed for the glands to initialize the hormonal values of the h h various schemes can be utilized such as the average of the input vector of learning samples to derive the appropriate equivalence between the approximated and observed time series of the target the hormonal values must be updated through the learning process considering eq 3 and 4 and the network output y i 2 6 transfer learning machine learning as one of the most widely used branches of ai identifies and explores the processes and patterns that enable computers to learn and help humankind to choose the proper prevention or control policy shadabfar et al 2021 sioofy khoojine et al 2021 the goal of machine learning is for the computer to be able to gradually become more efficient in the task at hand and do so with increasing quantities of data data mining and machine learning have made major advances in many engineering fields in recent years there are common assumptions on which machine learning methods work and the basic premise of these methods is that training and test data have the same feature space shimodaira 2000 most statistical models have to be restructured when the distribution of data changes it is either impossible or not cost effective to recatch training data and restructure models in many practical applications so reducing the need for this practice seems to be reasonable in these cases model transfer or learning transfer between different domains that are connected by a high level domain may be desirable weiss et al 2016 in fact transferlearning is the ability of a system to recognize and apply previously learned knowledge and skills in this definition the transfer of learning is effected with the aim of extracting knowledge from one or more tasks and applying knowledge to a target task pan yang 2010 the present study uses the tl method to transfer the model governing the first lysimeter to the second lysimeter enabling ec data that has not been recorded in the second lysimeter to be estimated using the ai model developed for the first lysimeter because of the ability to apply the model from one system to another through the tl method discussed it is critical to determine whether both lysimeters and their governing conditions are the same the black box model of the first lysimeter can be used in the second lysimeter to estimate the ec if the similarity between the two systems is proven in other words when the conditions of the lysimeters are equal and the only different is their amount of precipitation received and also both lysimeters are the sub branches of the greater system landfills the tl method can be applied to transfer the developed models of the first lysimeter to the second lysimeter by implementing the second lysimeter s data as the inputs of the models to prove the governing conditions for the two lysimeters deterministic equations of the seepage phenomena are used since the landfill system is a sub branch of the surrounding environment and leachate production is a deterministic phenomenon even in lysimeters the advection dispersion equation ade equations for these two lysimeters can be written as 5 e c 1 t t e r m 1 v 1 e c 1 t e r m 2 d 1 2 e c 1 t e r m 3 i 1 t e c 2 t v 2 e c 2 d 2 2 e c 2 i 2 t in differential equations the left side of the equation represents the parameters of the system itself while the right side represents the external force which are external inputs i in this case synoptic and satellite data see fig 8 the left side of eq 5 consists of three terms the first term demonstrates the variation of ec proportion to time the second term includes velocity and ec gradient parameters the governing equation for the water flow velocity within the soil v can be defined as 6 v 1 k 1 h x v 2 k 2 h x in these equations k is dependent on soil type here waste type which is the same in both lysimeters on the other hand due to the proximity of the two lysimeters the term h x is equal in both lysimeters hence the second term of eq 5 is only dependent on ec the parameters in the third term include ec laplacian and diffusion coefficient d and d is constant in both lysimeters due to the equal conditions governing them therefore regarding the ade equation it could be assumed that parameters d and v are the same for both lysimeters and the only difference is whether it s open or closed which alters with the external situation the ec of each lysimeter is the function of i hence owing to the deterministic conditions governing eq 5 and step two ai based it could be said that ec is a function of external parameters affecting the lysimeters 7 e c 1 f k 1 d 1 i 1 f i 1 e c 2 f k 2 d 2 i 2 f i 2 where f is constant in both lysimeters simulation and prediction using ai have so far been performed based on historical data data required for network training where both training and testing data came from the same domain in certain situations a network could not be trained due to a lack of historical data in this case a network can be built using data from a domain associated with the target domain and transfer learning will then be implemented thus data for the training and target must be in different domains but connected by a high level domain to apply the transfer learning method based on the conditions of the lysimeters open or closed the only difference is in the amount of rain received and since the right side of the differential equation represents the external force to the system the other variables are assumed to be the same therefore it can be concluded that if the precipitation parameter over the test period entered into the system is considered to be a very low or zero value for the closed lysimeter and the soil moisture parameter is set to be the daily average of 6 years period of 2004 2009 corresponding to the available time series the trained models for the first lysimeter can be used to estimate the ec of the second lysimeter by the implementing the second lysimeter s data in the models 2 7 ensemble model in recent decades ensemble modeling has been one of the most significant advances in ai based models the main idea of this multi model method is to use the unique capabilities of each model to optimally estimate the data series pattern in other words ensemble methodsintegrate multiple learning models to achieve a betterpredictive performancethan could be obtained from any of the constituent learning models alone rokach 2010 zhang and peter 2003 a total of three ensemble techniques were employed a simple averaging method eq 8 a weighted averaging method weighted by dc validation values eq 9 and 10 and a neural ensemble model with the first two methods the results of ann anfis and eann models are linearly combined whereas with the third method eann is used as the kernel of the ensemble model due to its greater applicability although other ai based models may be utilized e g ann and anfis 8 f e c 1 n i 1 n f i e c 9 f e c i 1 n w i f i e c 10 w i dc i i 1 n dc i where f e c is the output of the ensembled model f i e c is the outputs of the individual models in this case ann anfis and eann n is the number of individually developed models and w i is the weight parameter determined based on the dc of individual models 2 8 evaluation criteria the performance of the developed models was evaluated be means of statistical criteria namely the determination coefficient dc and root mean square error rmse during both the training and verification phases the rmse is used to demonstrate the standard deviation between the predictors and the predictands which ranges from 0 to the closer the value is to 0 the more effective the prediction is the dc value runs between and 1 having a value of 1 indicates an excellent fit and the ability to predict the future accurately the equations of rmse and dc presented as follows 11 rmse i 1 n r i z i 2 n 12 dc 1 i 1 n r i z i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 where r i is the observed data lysimeters data z i is the model output r is the mean of observed data and n is the total number of outputs 3 results and discussion in this research the ffnn based models ffnn anfis and eann were implemented to accurately predict the ec parameter for the first lysimeter subsequently the tl method was employed to assess the second lysimeter s missing ec for this purpose as the proposed methodology entails distinct steps the results are provided and discussed in the steps as follows 3 1 results of data analysis there are two sources of moisture in a landfill one is external including precipitation runoff snowmelt and soil moisture while the other is internal namely the initial waste moisture along with moisture from biological reactions within the landfill since the tychy urbanowice landfill system contains both active and closed landfills two lysimeters were used to model their conditions for this modeling the first lysimeter active landfill model is designed to be open and allow moisture from both external and internal sources the lysimeter was charged with leachate to initiate the operating landfill condition whereas the second lysimeter inactive landfill model uses initial waste moisture and injected distilled water equal to the precipitation measured during the landfill operation the environmental parameters affecting the moisture of the landfill are atmospheric temperature and precipitation soil temperature and moisture precipitation or infiltrated soil moisture could lead to an increase in landfill leachate production and consequently higher the ec furthermore an increased temperature causes evaporation for instance in the summer which leads to a decrease in moisture however this increase in temperature can also increase the bacterial activity inside the landfill resulting in more leachate production and higher dissolved organic materials concentration considering that ec arises from ions in water ec consequently rises when bacterial activity increases as soluble materials increase in the leachate as does leachate production in view of the aforementioned sophisticated relations it is therefore necessary to examine not only the linear relationships cc but also the nonlinear relationships mi and ai to find the connection between moisture temperature and ec in the first step the cc feature extraction method was applied to discover the linear relationships between the external parameters and lysimetric data alongside this method mi was used to recognize the nonlinear relationships see table 2 then ai based models were developed to conduct the sensitivity analysis over external and internal parameters and to achieve the optimum structure of the ai networks i e number of hidden neurons training epoch number of membership functions membership function type and hormones therefore the effective parameters for moisture temperature and ec variation were obtained from this various combinations of available parameters as given in table 3 were prepared for sensitivity analysis via the ffnn anfis and eann methods considering the cc and mi results table 2 it can be seen that at depths of 100 cm to 200 cm the results demonstrated a strong correlation between the internal moisture content of the lysimeters and the soil moisture retrieved from the satellite as external data in addition as depth decreases the linear correlation gradually declines since some borderline factors such as evaporation affect the amount of moisture at these depths reducing the linear correlation therefore in ai based models of table 3 the soil moisture parameter in the depth ranges of 0 to 10 and 10 to 40 cm was excluded from the input combinations it is not only the infiltrated water that can impact the moisture content of the lysimeter but also initial waste moisture and chemical and biological reactions therefore temperature and moisture parameters should be included in the ai based models as the inputs in order to avoid the phenomenon of over training when time series are available for a relatively short period i e ai based models could not experience various seasons of different years the data can be randomized before being fed into the models thereafter the inputs of the network were normalized within the intervals of 0 and 1 due to the activation function s nature and to speed up the training and to diminish the disproportionate weighting determining the optimum structure for the ffnn plays a crucial role in training the network as does appropriate input selection for this purpose the trial error method was employed to detect the best structure for the ai models regarding the results of the sensitivity analysis between the lysimetric data it was clear that the moisture content of the lysimeters had a significant influence on the variation rate of the ec over time moreover since the temperature parameter is one of the key factors in the evaporation and reaction rate within the waste using the temperature and moisture of the lysimeters together as inputs increased the models performance by 5 3 and 3 4 for ffnn and 12 9 and 11 4 for both anfis and eann for the first and second port in each model respectively see table 3 based on the strong correlation between moisture ec external and inner temperature to reach the optimal input combination the relationships between the external parameters and the moisture content of the first lysimeter were investigated by employing the ffnn anfis and eann regarding the condition of the lysimeters it was expected that the precipitation parameter alone might not have a strong connection with the moisture parameter in the closed lysimeter the models developed demonstrated the same notion there was however an increase in model performance when the precipitation parameter was included in the input data set of the open lysimeter furthermore the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the soil moisture contents obtained from satellites within the depths of 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm have an acceptable correlation with the moisture content of the lysimeters hence if the synoptic station data were not available or sufficient the satellite data could be a viable alternative for this purpose since the satellites have covered almost all countries for over 70 years with regard to the results it was seen that satellite soil temperature data at depths of 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm t mean t max t min t 1 and t 2 have strong relationships with the temperature parameter of the lysimeter since maximum and minimum temperature can cause evaporation or freezing within the lysimeters t max and t min were added as inputs to improve the models performance finally in the case of including all the moisture related parameters i e synoptic and satellite moisture in the input combination considering the rolled out parameters alongside the temperature related ones the moisture content of the lysimeter was optimally estimated using ffnn anfis and eann for lysimeter i in port 1 a and port 2 b the summary of the results sensitivity analysis is presented in table 4 it is clear from the results obtained that the ec and the internal moisture and temperature of the lysimeters are closely related and effective external parameters also influence the internal parameters thus ec modeling requires both internal and external moisture and temperature which are used in the following steps 3 2 results of ec prediction based on the results of the previous step the internal moisture parameter is the dominant parameter affecting the ec changes moreover regarding the cc and the sensitivity analysis results provided in the first step the external parameters affecting internal moisture are also known therefore we developed a model for predicting ec with the same inputs as the optimum inputs from the previous step in order to model the ec of lysimeter i using the external parameters as one of the minor goals of this paper ai models were again developed to determine a relationship between the ec and selected external parameters hence the models developed on the basis of external inputs could be used when the measuring devices fail or the records are corrupted for any reason two combinations which led to higher accuracies in the previous step were selected to predict the ec parameter table 5 likewise in the past step to prevent overtraining the inputs were randomized with the same algorithm for each combination with regards to the developed models it could be observed that the overall performances dcs of the models under various conditions were above 0 80 for eann and anfis and 0 70 for ffnn in both the training and verification phases therefore in cases where the available landfill data are corrupted the attached sensors malfunction or landfill conditions make sampling and installation impossible i e the landfill is not sanitary or closed it is feasible to rely on external parameters e g meteorological station and satellite data to predict the ec parameter a proxy for leachate pollution furthermore according to table 5 it is clear that the eann models outperformed both the anfis and ffnn models 3 3 results of ec estimation the aim of this study is to use the tl method to transfer the model governing the lysimeter i to the lysimeter ii allowing the ec data that hasn t been recorded in the second lysimeter to be estimated using the developed ai model for the first lysimeter with the lysimetric monitoring conducted in an open area and in the vicinity of one another and considering the results of the first two steps it can be concluded that the lysimeter s system is a sub branch of the surrounding system moreover the results obtained in the first step indicate that changes in the ec parameter correlate strongly with the lysimeter s internal moisture and temperature as well furthermore considering the results of the trained ai models in the second step it may be concluded that the ec parameter can be derived directly using external parameters i e synoptic station and satellite data consequently the possibility of model transferring can be examined by employing an available parameter of the second lysimeter as the target of the models hence the possibility of model transfer from lysimeter i to lysimeter ii was assessed and approved see table 6 the results presented in table 6 show that ffnn anfis and eann with a dc above 0 8 are compatible with estimating the second lysimeter s moisture using the already trained models from the first lysimeter with regard to the conditions of the lysimeters open or closed the only difference is in the precipitation parameter therefore it can be concluded that if the precipitation parameter over the test period entered into the system is considered as a very low or zero value for the closed lysimeter and the soil moisture parameter is set to be the daily average of 6 years period of 2004 2009 corresponding to the operating years of the landfill the trained models for the first lysimeter can be used to estimate the ec of the second lysimeter to demonstrate this the ec for the second lysimeter was predicted using the first lysimeter s ec as the target of the models the results of the ec estimation for lysimeter ii are depicted in table 7 subsequently an ensemble of the most effective ai based models was developed in order to improve the results of the model three ensemble techniques were employed the results of ffnn anfis and eann models being linearly combined in the first two methods with the third method eann was used as the kernel of the ensemble model due to its greater applicability an ensemble of neural models was trained using the outputs of the three developed models as inputs see table 8 the data acquired from each of the individual ffnn anfis and eann models were used as inputs in the first layer of the neural ensemble models as the second layer the observed ec data served as the target data and the last layer was the output layer which yields estimated ec data known as neural ensemble model outputs according to the results presented in table 8 the first two techniques showed a slight improvement and the neural ensemble model surpasses all other models when predicting missing ec time series 4 conclusions in this paper the ec parameter as an indicator of landfill leachate pollution with the capability of portable measurements was estimated by implementing ann anfis and the eann a new generation of ann models with a few hormonal parameters for this purpose a lysimetric experiment was carried out with two lysimeters to simulate the operating and closed landfills of tychy urbanowice since the moisture and temperature inside the landfill or lysimeters can alter the ec parameter by affecting the rate of soluble materials inside the leachate cc mi and ai based models were utilized to analyze the relationships between these variables moreover external environmental parameters such as meteorological data and soil moisture showed a significant correlation with the ec parameter as they can affect the inner moisture and temperature of the landfill or lysimeter the results of the data analysis indicated that the inner moisture parameter is the dominant factor in ec fluctuations the data provided by the gldas are reliable and can be used in input data sets the moisture of the lysimeters could be predicted using external data external temperature and soil temperature revealed a potent relationship with the temperature of the lysimeters subsequently the ec parameters of the first lysimeter were estimated using satellite and synoptic data following this the missing ec parameters were simulated via the transfer learning method by employing all three aforementioned ai models finally the neural ensemble model was constructed based on the outputs of the three separate models i e ann anfis and eann which demonstrated a dc performance enhancement of almost 20 over the existing ai models for ec prediction in conclusion it should be noted that due to its hormonal parameters eann could lead to more precise estimations of ec and it is suggested that satellite soil moisture and temperature data be implemented because of their reliability and availability for almost all countries

research aims to assess the relationship between snowmelt runoff road presence and terrain instabilities affecting a landslide prone steep slope mountain meadow northern italy an innovative multi modeling approach was proposed to detect the alteration of snowmelt overflows due to the presence of the road and its relation with the activation of a shallow landslide the road role in altering snowmelt runoff was investigated both considering its presence and assuming its absence different hydrological and slope stability models were interactively considered starting from pre event als derived dem to compute predictive basin scale simulations results attested the key role played by the road in altering snowmelt runoff pathways as well as their combined contribution to the foreseen activation of the observed shallow landslide starting from on field observations conducted after the landslide triggering the accuracy of instabilities predictions was finally tested through the statistical computation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc roc and the cohen s kappa index respectively resulted around 0 9 and 0 6 this work could be a useful tool for

diverted water flows davison et al 2000 bogaard and greco 2016 the vertical translocation of water across soil strata induces an increase in upslope pore water pressure of the unsaturated layers hinds

take part in snow melting such as i spatial variability of snow cover ii elevation ranges inside the basin iii aspect iv slope v vegetation coverage vi wind vii precipitation and viii diurnal

availability of water at the surface obled and harder 1978 mullem et al 2004 therefore the interaction between snowmelt runoff henceforth called sr and road presence can be critically responsible for slope instabilities in the last decades the need to increase the understanding of complex hydrological and geomorphological phenomena translated into the development of specific coding and models therefore hydro geomorphological models become a powerful instrument for analyse landscapes evolution improve water management and prevent the occurrence of land degradation processes over time guo et

distribution of instability susceptibility areas within the basin finally the simulated water erosion model simwe mitasova et al 2013 was applied to detect spatial directions of snowmelt overflow looking at the specific land cover and hydraulic properties therefore srm ress and simwe models were jointly applied model outcomes were finally validated by specific statistical analysis the proposed

innovative low cost model based methodological workflow 2 study area the study area is a high steep slope mountain grassland located close to the mountain pordoi pass in trentino alto adige region northern italy fig 1 the considered watershed has an overall extension of 1 22 km2 an average slope equal to 26 9 between a minimum of 0 02 and a maximum of 88 4 and an average elevation equal to 2350 m a s l ranging from a minimum of 2010 m a s l and a maximum of 2924 m a s l the basin is characterized by the presence of rocky areas at the top while the remaining part is entirely covered by low grass so it can be with confidence defined as a mountain grassland system a paved road network is located inside the study area crossing the slope in the lower part the road has a total length of about 900 m and an average slope equal to 5 0 concrete manholes are located between the roadway and the upper slope at the bottom of the bank with a square section of sides ranging from 0 8 m and 1 4 m a local weather station located 800 m away from the watershed as the crow flies was used for meteorological data acquisition during field surveys conducted in 2020 a shallow landslide was observed its activation involved a structural failure of a road s section that overturned on the bank below several erosion zones were also detected on the upper zones of the entire grassland further revealing its susceptibility to the occurrence of land degradation phenomena such a watershed henceforth called ress watershed was used in soil stability simulations differently a sub basin called srm watershed was considered for snowmelt computation setting its outlet at the observed landslide s triggering area i e at the point of the road failure further upstream to the landslide area below the daily snowmelt rate was therefore obtained at the latter srm watershed covers an area of 0 08 km2 with an average elevation value equal to 2302 m a s l ranging from a minimum of 2210 m a s l i e the outlet location and a maximum of 2366 m a s l and an average slope equal to 21 8 between a minimum of 0 01 and a maximum of 88 0 srm watershed is almost entirely covered by low herbaceous grass except for a small rocky part further upstream field surveys conducted in 2020 after the landslide activation specifically during the snowmelt period also highlighted the relevance of the interaction between snowmelt runoff and road surface in this regard on field observations revealed the presence of constant snowmelt runoff coming from the residual melting snowpack flowing downstream along the grassy hillslope and hence intercepting the paved road fig 2 a d snowmelt overflows consequently turn out to fall from the roadway to the collapsed hillslope below fig 2e f 3 material and methods 3 1 data

a thorough theoretical overview of each model is presented in the provided supplementary documentation a table a 1 summarizes the computed model simulations while a summary of symbols and abbreviations is available in table a 2 3 1 1 overview of the observed landslide during field surveys the features of the observed landslide were manually measured by a surveyor tape to obtain an overview of its characteristics in addition an uncrewed aerial vehicle uav based field scale survey was conducted in 2020 in order to appreciate local geomorphological characteristics of the landslide surface the extension of the landslide zone is about 4155 m2 with a perimeter of 368 m and an average slope equal to 20 6 accordingly to the definitions proposed by dikau et al 1996 sidle and bogaard 2016 and thiery et al 2017 the observed landslide can be identified as a shallow translational landslide looking at both the steepness of the failure surface and its dimensions looking at fig 4 b the main scarp height ab is equal to 1 29 m the length of the road section over the landslide cd is 33 5 m the maximum width between landslide s flanks ef is equal to 53 5 m the length of the landslide zone from its crown to the respective toe gh is 123 m cruden and varnes 1996 the surface involved in the landslide activation was mainly covered by a low irregular herbaceous cover with the compresence of small rocks of a few centimeters in the upper part of the basin 3 1 2 als derived dem elaboration als surveys conducted in 2018 allowed to elaborating pre event dem at the catchment

applying specific classification tools and algorithms using the r studio lidr package roussel et al 2020 then to perform an accurate removal of potential residuals coming from errors affecting the automatic classification procedure the classified point cloud was manually filtered fig 3aiii through specific tools of the cloud compare software https www danielgm net in particular the point cloud was divided into slices of equal dimensions to efficiently remove the remaining small overground noises the dem resolution of 1 m was hence obtained from the processed point cloud through the grid terrain r studio package and the respective application of the classification based knnidw algorithm for spatial data interpolation roussel et al 2020 3 1 3 snowmelt runoff model srm table 2 shows input variables of srm whose description is detailed presented in the supplementary documentation a srm model is divided into meteorological fig 3bi and spatial data fig 3bii pre event dem was considered for daily snowmelt rate estimation for the 2018 snowmelt season fig 3biii following the suggestions provided by martinec et al 2008 the basin considered for snowmelt estimation was not divided into elevation zones given the fact that the elevation range between the outlet and the highest point of the watershed resulted lower than 500 m indicated by model s developers as the threshold for basin subdivision therefore the calculation of the hypsometric curve was not required moreover since the basin was not divided into zones no altitude adjustment in the function of zonal hypsometric mean elevation values was necessary martinec et al 2008 the daily maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and precipitation p values recorded by the weather station were considered for 2018 snow cover was estimated starting from satellites observations and the daily percentage of the snow covered area sca concerning the total extension of the basin was hence obtained in particular sca was mapped from landsat 8 data by applying the normalized index of differences in snow cover ndsi kour and patel 2013 kurakina et al 2020 for the considered year ndsi was hence calculated by eq 1 1 ndsi green s w i r green s w i r where green stands for the l8 band 3 and swir stands for the l8 short wave infrared band 6 a threshold value of ndsi 0 4 was used to automatically map the snow presence inside the basin dietz et al 2012 donmez et al 2021 daily snow cover was extrapolated from the acquired landsat 8 satellite data by using the interpolation method expressed by eq 2 kour and patel 2013 2 s n s 1 s 2 s 1 t 2 t 1 t m t 1 where sn is the snow cover on nth day s1 is the snow cover derived from the first image s2 is snow cover derived from the second image tn is the number of nth days t1 is the julian date of the first image and t2 is the julian date of the second image temperature lapse rate γ was obtained by looking at the availability of weather stations at different altitudes i e pordoi weather station located at 2154 m a s l and 0 57 km far away from the watershed and arabba station placed at 1642 m a s l and 5 km far away from the study area the temperature lapse rate was therefore calculated by dividing the difference between daily average temperatures measured at each weather station with their altitude range martinec et al 2008 following the suggestions provided by model developers the critical temperature tcrit was set equal to 3 c from may to jun 0 75 c in july and 0 c from august to march martinec et al 2008 these values resulted to be specifically suitable for mountain basins as also reported by uncertainty detection of srm input proposed by xiang et al 2009 the degree day factor a was obtained from the empirical relation expressed by eq 3 matinec 1960 3 a 1 1 ρ s ρ w where ρs is the density of the snow and ρw is the density of the water in particular ρs was determined following eq 4 pistocchi 2016 4 ρ s 0 2 0 001 d o y where doy represents the day number from the beginning of the snow season looking at the collected snowfall data and at the suggestions provided by model designers the rainfall contributing area rca was set equal to 1 from april to october and equal to 0 from november to march martinec et al 2008 the recession coefficient k is expressed by eq 5 5 k n 1 q n 1 q n x q n y where qn and qn 1 are daily measured discharge values x and y are parameters determined through linear regression analysis starting from measured discharge values since the absence of available historical discharge data at the basin s outlet x and y coefficients were set equal to 0 85 and 0 086 respectively therefore following the indications provided by martinec et al 2008 in agreement with the input setting proposed by similar applications of the model tahir et al 2011 panday et al 2014 the runoff coefficient for snow cs was set equal to 0 2 from jun to august and equal to 0 15 from september to may while the runoff coefficient for rain cr was 0 15 from july and august and equal to 0 10 from september to june the time lag l was set equal to 1 h since the absence of historical snowmelt hydrographs for the srm watershed the l parameter was set looking at its size and accordingly with model application in similar basins in agreement with the suggestions provided by martinec et al 2008 3 1 4 road erosion steady state model ress table 3 reports the inputs obtained for ress simulations we refer the reader s attention to the supplementary documentation a for details regarding the model the model needs dem without the presence of the road fig 3civ since the available als derived pre event elevation model was acquired after the road construction a novel smoothing procedure was developed to remove it therefore a scenario with the presence of the road yesroad scenario and a second one with its simulated absence noroad scenario were respectively considered for ress simulations dem was firstly clipped on the ress watershed boundaries and the road was masked creating a vector polygon following its edges successively euclidean buffers were created outside the top and the bottom side of the road polygon point features were therefore located at a fixed distance of 10 m along with them through the generate points along lines arcgis tool and elevation values from the dem were then extracted for each point the topo to raster interpolation was applied for the buffer zones through the topo to raster arcgis tool and then clipped on the original road mask previously designed in this way the interpolated surface was merged on the original elevation model through the arcgis mosaic to new raster tool setting the elevation values of the interpolated road mask as output cell values of the overlapping areas this specific interpolation method was adopted aiming to create a modified but hydrologically correct dem esri 2021 simulating the absence of the road and avoiding evident alteration of grassy zones included in the process a comparison between dems with and without the road is presented in fig a 1 every drainage system needed to be provided with x and y coordinates as well as with a value p ranging from 0 to 100 representing the portion of water flows diverted by it and routed out of the road looking at the location and the types of drainage systems along the road a constant value of 60 was set as p this value turned out to be the more suitable given the water deviation induced by drainage systems toward the hillslope under the road road width was measured equal to 4 m and the relative road cut depth describing the potential interception of each road cell at the foot of the upstream slope was set equal to the default value of 0 5 m according to on field measurements previously conducted in the same area borga et al 2002b borga et al 2005 tarolli et al 2008 tarolli et al 2011 geotechnical parameters were set looking at the respective average values detected across the catchment therefore soil depth was set equal to 0 5 m the internal friction angle ϕ to 35 the saturated soil density ρs to 1800 kgm 3 soil transmissivity t to 0 3 10 3 m2s 1 and soil cohesion cohs to 0 1 kg m 1s 2 additionally water density ρ w was 1000 kgm 3 while root cohesion cohr and vegetation surcharge w were set equal to 0 because of the mere presence of low herbaceous cover among the watershed kokutse et al 2016 fig 3ciii sr and rr peaks obtained with srm for the 2018 melting period were set as input in the ress model fig 3ci ii with a corresponding increment step equal to the default value of 1 mmh 1 in this regard the use of single sr and rr peaks calculated at the outlet of the srm watershed for the spatially predictive detection of slope instabilities relies on the assumption that is possible to create large scale predictive mapping of terrain failures starting from snowmelt values obtained at a specific point of interest placed inside the basin finally the d infinite flow direction algorithm tarboton 1997 was selected to let the model route subsurface multipath flows 3 1 5 simulated water erosion simwe the use of pre event dem for simwe application allowed the predictive analysis of the dynamics of road diverted sr overflows toward the below hillslope in particular sr discharge and flow depth intercepting the landslide area were estimated for both the yesroad and the noroad scenarios fig 3d simwe inputs are summarized in table 4 while accurate model description is presented in the supplementary documentation a maximum sr obtained for the 2018 melt season was considered as input for simwe modeling fig 3cii as similarly highlighted in the previous section such a set of a single srm derived sr peak value for the spatial modeling of road diverted sr dynamics at basin scale assumes the possibility to innovatively apply such a model by overtaking the use of spatially distributed water input as commonly propose in the available literature see section 5 1 moreover the excess rate was calculated by subtracting the infiltration rate mmh 1 from the snowmelt intensity peaks mmh 1 infiltration rates were set in function of the measurements of the hydraulic conductivity for each land type in line with previously conducted field measurements tarolli et al 2011 borga et al 2002b looking at tabular values for specific soil categories bunya et al 2010 hofierka et al 2018 pijl et al 2020 manning s n values were set equal to 0 045 for grassland 0 016 for the paved road and 0 099 for rocky areas located at the top of the watershed fig 3ciii 3 2 statistical validation of instability susceptibility mapping ress derived instability susceptibility maps were validated through the receiver operating characteristic roc analysis fig 3ei the magnitude of the agreement between predicted and observed instabilities was hence calculated by the cohen s kappa index fig 3eii lee et al 2007 pourghasemi et al 2012 vakhshoori and zare 2018 such statistical analysis was performed focusing on the grassy hillslope located downstream of the road aiming to support our outcomes regarding its interaction with sr dynamics in terms of landslide occurrence the predictive capabilities of ress model to foresee the activation of terrain failures were validated by looking at the key participation of the road in altering sr and rr overflow paths thus potentially encouraging the occurrence of hydro erosive phenomena the null hypothesis was defined in this case corresponding to the condition that the slope is not involved in soil instabilities it is therefore necessary to define whether it was correctly discarded in favor of the alternative one i e the presence of instabilities within the hillslope detected instabilities and stable zones were mapped and rasterized starting from uav derived 1 cm orthomosaic and post event field observations two classes i e stable and unstable were selected defining a classification threshold applied by distinguishing stable and unstable zones as similarly done in borga et al 2005 each raster cell of observations and modeled predictions were therefore assigned to one of the two selected classes classes overlay defined four types of pixels i e i true positives tp where observed unstable zones are predicted as unstable ii true negatives tn where observed stable cells are predicted as stable iii false positives fp where observed stable cells are predicted as unstable and iv false negatives fn where observed unstable cells are predicted as stable palacio cordoba et al 2020 vakhshoori and zare 2018 true positive rate tpr and false positive rates fpr were calculated following eq 6 and 7 6 tpr tp tp f n 7 fpr fp tn f p the values of the area under the roc curve auc finally express the model s ability to correctly classify those zones more or less susceptible to the occurrence of instabilities arcgis based spatial data modeller arcsdm geoprocessing tool was used for roc analysis and auc calculation auc values range between 0 failed prediction and 1 perfect prediction fawcett 2006 the predictive reliability of ress model was also tested by mapping the terrain instabilities observed downstream of the road on the ress derived map of critical sr and rr and therefore by comparing the proportion of the respective catchment area placed in each critical sr and rr interval to the corresponding fraction of the detected unstable zones the assessment of ress results translates in a larger divergence between observed degraded surfaces and the respective regions of the catchment corresponding to low values of critical sr and rr borga et al 2002 borga et al 2005 plausible inaccuracies arising from the post event identification of degraded regions were considered in this statistical procedure by associating the observed unstable zones to the low critical sr values computed in a 3x3 grid cell moving window borga et al 2002 this specifically allowed to consider the eventual detection of terrain instabilities occurred on zones defined by the model as relatively stable but initiated by the failure of a nearby grid characterized by low critical sr values borga et al 2005 cohen s kappa index cohen 1960 was calculated by eq 8 guzzetti et al 2006 8 k p c p e 1 p c where pc stands for the proportion of cells correctly classified as unstable or stable and pe stands for the proportion of cells for which the agreement between observations and predictions is expected by chance in particular pc and pe are expressed by the following eq 9 and 10 respectively 9 p c tp t n n 10 p e t p f n t p f p f p t n f n t n n 2 where n is the total number of pixels in the investigated zone cohen s k ranges between a minimum of 1 total disagreement between observed and predicted instabilities and a maximum of 1 perfect agreement between observed and predicted instabilities guzzetti et al 2006 4 results 4 1 snowmelt runoff computation simulations revealed that the melt period in 2018 was limited to may fig 5 c daily snowmelt values mm h resulted between a minimum of 1 09 mm h and a maximum of 11 36 mm h fig 5b and rain contributing to runoff rr resulted between a minimum of 2 08 mm h and a maximum of 62 8 mm h fig 5c in this regard the extraction of sr and rr peaks for the application of ress and simwe models was computed looking at those periods for 2018 4 2 slope stability analysis figs 6 and 7 represent the comparison of critical sr and rr for the yesroad and noroad scenarios fig 3cvii x starting from pre event srm outcomes the calculation of critical sr showed an increase in its values inside the landslide area for the noroad scenario fig 6b compared with the yesroad one fig 6a moreover road contribution in critical sr deviation toward the landslide surface is expressed by the calculation of the difference between noroad and yesroad critical sr fig 6c the presence of reddish pixels within the landslide surface represents those zones where this difference is greater this suggests that road presence induces an increase of the minimum sr able to potentially compromise the stability of the hillslope below similar results are appreciable by comparing the spatial variability of critical rr computed for the two scenarios fig 7a b respectively the difference between noroad and yesroad critical rr fig 7c supports such statements in this connection ress results for the yesroad condition highlight the distribution of lower critical rr values inside the landslide prone surface compared to the yesroad situation therefore the involvement of sr overflows in landslide activation results to be comparable with terrain instabilities encouraged by rr this further underlines the active contribution of snowmelt in landslide occurrence also suggesting the key role of the road in its critical deviation toward the unstable hillslope below fig 8 shows the comparison of the ri index fig 3cv vi calculated from the pre event critical sr fig 8a and critical rr fig 8b reddish colors of ri indicate unstable areas while blue colors represent stable ones besides the identification of local unconditionally unstable regions within the hillslope above the road the ress model particularly revealed the potential activation of land degradation dynamics in correspondence with the observed shallow landslide surface starting from pre event snowmelt computation fig 8a similarly the calculation of ri starting from critical rr mapping predicted the occurrence of terrain instabilities inside the landslide area fig 8b this firstly reveals as snowmelt overflows can actively contribute to triggering local land degradation processes and terrain instabilities 4 3 simwe simulations fig 9 shows the comparison between sr dynamics at the landslide zone for the yesroad and noroad scenarios in terms of water discharge and flow depth fig 3di iv starting from pre event dem simwe mapping of snowmelt directions revealed as sr flows downstream along the grassy bank in the direction of the road then water coming from the melting snowpack intercepts the roadway and moves along with it such road diverted snowmelt water successively falls to the unstable slope below crossing the surface involved in landslide activation fig 9a c fig 2d f the drainage systems located along the roadway seem to inefficiently catch sr which is diverted in such a way as to contribute to slope destabilization results also illustrate that a fraction of sr coming from the grassy hillslope upstream of the landslide converges in the direction of the manhole located at its trigger point yellow point in fig 9 in particular its water regulating capacity was revealed to be critically stressed by sr coming from the upper part of the basin this encourages its progressive overload which translates into sr deviation across the road and toward the landslide surface in this connection the maximum sr discharge and water depth at this specific point resulted equal to 1 06 m3s 1 and 0 33 m respectively sr flow directions elaborated for the noroad scenario in terms of water discharge and flow depth are shown in fig 9b d these simulations highlighted that in the supposed absence of the road sr coming from the upstream zones of the watershed would flow along the slope without evident deviations unlike what is observed in the yesroad one on the contrary the noroad scenario highlighted the critical deviation of sr outflows due to the ineffective water management of the manhole similarly to what was observed in the yesroad simulations 4 4 statistical analysis 4 4 1 snowmelt discharge and flow depth cross section the influence of road network on runoff overflows deviation was further investigated through the computation of a topographic cross section of snowmelt runoff discharge and flow depth values for the landslide area a transect line was therefore designed crosswise the landslide surface control points cps were placed along with it at an equal distance of 10 cm for a total of 30 cps fig a 2 for each cp simwe derived discharge and depth values of sr were respectively extracted fig 10 shows cross sections results regarding sr discharge fig 10a and water depth fig 10b for the yesroad and noroad scenarios looking at the presence of the road sr discharge and depth along the transect resulted higher than those extracted simulating its absence sr discharge and flow depth peaks of the noroad cross sections shown in fig 10 represent the fraction of snowmelt runoff coming from the upper hillslope and critically converging at the landslide aside from road presence 4 4 2 statistical validation of predicted instabilities post event field inspections allowed for detecting and localizing the failures that occurred in the study area in order to check the accuracy of predictive soil stability simulations by comparing such observations with model outcomes looking at the aims of the presented research post event field surveys were focused on both the shallow landslide and local instabilities triggered on the hillslope located downstream of the road therefore the validation of the ress derived prediction of soil instabilities was firstly computed by the calculation of the area under the roc curve auc for the section of the ress watershed under the roadway auc was calculated starting from the creation of the confusion matrix reported in table 5 in this regard the low percentage of fn and fp pixels highlighted the good potentiality of the ress model in predicting soil instabilities in particular due to sr overflows auc values resulted equal to 0 94 and 0 92 respectively for the forecast of sr and rr induced soil instabilities finally ress performance in the prediction of soil failures was expressed by the cohen s k index resulting equal to 0 58 and 0 55 respectively referring to sr and rr derived ress simulations the comparison of the observed unstable zones placed downstream of the road to the fraction of the respective catchment area for each critical pre event sr and rr interval is reported in the following tables 6 and 7 the assessment of ress model reliability was hence reflected by a larger difference between the proportion of instabilities that occurred within the lower critical sr and rr ranges critical sr 5 mm h critical rr 15 mm h or in those zones considered as unconditionally unstable and the percentage of the corresponding catchment area the proportion of instabilities that occurred within the lowest critical sr and rr ranges resulted respectively around 53 table 6 and 45 table 7 while the percentage of the corresponding catchment area respectively decreased to around 20 table 6 and 25 table 7 this suggests as the occurrence of instabilities mostly recurs in the sections of the watershed characterized by low critical sr values therefore predicted to be unstable 5 discussion this work investigates the interaction between road and snowmelt runoff in the activation of hillslope instabilities for this purpose a challenging predictive multi modeling approach was implemented through the adoption of three different models this allowed to quantify snowmelt runoff at the watershed scale and obtain a mapping of local terrain instabilities related to road induced surface water deviation several studies have been carried out regarding the single application of srm ress and simwe respectively focusing on snowmelt calculation ferguson 1999 eigdir 2003 tahir et al 2011 butt and bilal 2011 devi 2017 siemens et al 2021 landslide susceptibility mapping borga et al 2005 tarolli et al 2011 cordoba et al 2020 al umar et al 2020 and water overland flows arnone et al 2011 bogaard and greco 2016 zhao et al 2019 yang et al 2019 mauri et al 2022 however in this context the proposed multi modeling approach is novel this research additionally supports srm testing for small mountain watersheds in line with the analysis provided by rango and martinec 1979 brubaker et al 1996 debeer and pomeroy 2010 and gomez landesa and rango 2002 despite the availability of many researches about the role of roads and trails in the occurrence of land degradation dynamics such as landslides fu et al 2010 sidle and ziegler 2012 penna et al 2014 and erosion processes elliot et al 1999 salesa et al 2019 yu et al 2021 our work stands out from the scientific literature in that it proposes an innovative methodology able to forecast the activation of local instabilities at meters detail by analyzing the interaction between road snowmelt runoff and shallow landslides at the watershed scale differently from the accessible scientific investigations about soil stability dietrich et al 1992 montgomery and dietrich 1994 borga et al 2002a borga et al 2005 and water runoff dynamics in mountain environments cencetti et al 2005 fernandes et al 2017 koco 2011 pijl et al 2020 mauri et al 2022 the use of such models considering the simulated absence of infrastructures in a dem is in line with the innovative outcomes provided by mauri et al 2022 in this regard our results attest the validity of such a methodology not only for degraded agricultural areas but also for mountain ones in addition models application looking at post event conditions for the detection of evolutive dynamics affecting the degraded hillslope is a further groundbreaking aspect of our research as similarly highlighted by tague and band 2001 royer 2006 and buchanan et al 2013 our research further suggests that the inefficient location of drainage systems along the road has a key influence on critical snowmelt runoff alterations specific interventions aimed at correctly positioning drainage systems e g cross ditches gutters manholes pipes and culverts could be undertaken starting from our work this is in line with the outcomes recently provided by hearn and shakya 2017 reed and kite 2020 guo et al 2020 tshering et al 2020 and raga et al 2020 who highlighted the key relevance of drainage systems location and maintenance for efficiently routing water runoff along the roadway and toward the above hillslopes looking at the notable effects of climate change in increasing both snowmelt intensity and snowfall amounts in mountain regions rasmussen et al 2011 wi et al 2012 marshall et al 2020 ikeda et al 2021 our research further stresses the importance of considering superficial snowmelt dynamics in road planning and construction aiming to avoid the future occurrence of erosion and landslides events finally such a predictive spatially distributed analysis of land degradation dynamics affecting mountain hillslopes could be also considered for planning effective slope stability interventions 5 1 limitations some limitations have emerged during the simulations workflow first the selection of models inputs particularly affects the respective outcomes as for any physical models which makes this an issue aspect to be considered furthermore the detection of snow covered areas starting from satellites observations requires the exclusion of low quality images and those characterized by an excessive cloud cover this led to the availability of fewer valid input data for srm simulations moreover since the only availability of landsat 8 products for the considered year 30 m resolution images were used for snow coverage detection inside the basin in fact specific factors such as residual cloudiness inefficient covered area and error in images acquisition by satellites can jointly affect the quality of acquired data for input preparation this could potentially translate into bias and distortions in the resulting data interpolation specifically in analyzing snow presence close to terrain depressions and local surface alterations which certainly requires higher satellite resolution despite the possibility to run the srm model for ungauged basins martinec and rango 1986 the lack of historical snowmelt discharge measurement at the basin outlet prevents the validation of srm outcomes and therefore the detection of srm accuracy was not feasible additionally notwithstanding the evidences provided by models results and their respective statistical analysis a last potential limit could translate in having assumed the possibility to predict the spatial distribution of slope instabilities and detect the role of the road in diverting sr overflows starting from the computation of single sr and rr peaks at the basin outlet finally site specific geotechnical models could offer a more complete view of the mechanisms of the landslide that occurred downslope the roads a point that will be explored soon by the authors 6 conclusion this work proposes a multi modeling analysis of the interaction between snowmelt runoff and road presence in the activation of hillslope instabilities in a mountain watershed als derived dems served as the basis for computing predictive and post event basin scale soil stability simulations the role of snowmelt runoff in affecting surface destabilizations was highlighted by comparing models outcomes starting from the calculation of snowmelt runoff rainfall runoff and their joint contribution to water overflow dynamics the role of road network in altering surface snowmelt runoff was investigated both considering its presence and assuming its absence by a novel dem post processing procedure despite the highlighted limitations of the proposed innovative multi modeling approach results attested the key role played by the road in altering snowmelt runoff directions as well as its contribution in the foreseen likely activation of a shallow landslide statistical analysis validated the accuracy of instabilities predictions in this connection despite the unfeasible possibility to validate srm outcomes the computed statistics evinces the reliability of sr and rr simulation given the importance of model validations considering the objectives of our work it represents an interesting element to evaluate in applying the multi modelling methodology proposed in our research finally the relevance of inefficient water management by road drainage systems in potentially encouraging the occurrence of instabilities phenomena was also verified more investigations could be undertaken aiming to find out the optimal location of ditches and culverts able to efficiently intercept and collect water runoff analogously the proposed interactive application of srm ress and simwe models could be suitable for likewise investigating the interaction between snowmelt runoff and roads presence in larger mountain basins similar analysis could be therefore performed aiming to map terrain instabilities at both hillslope and watershed scale over time as well as in investigating such issue focusing on the presence of infrastructures at different altitude levels regionwide this work can be considered a useful tool for planning mitigation interventions able to reduce the occurrence of similar risk scenarios also looking at the effects of climate changes in this regard therefore valuable suggestions for developing and promoting efficient sustainable actions for mountain landscapes could be applied credit authorship contribution statement luca mauri conceptualization methodology data curation writing original

3141,the presence of roads in steep slope mountain areas is often linked with the occurrence of landslides and erosive dynamics the use of airborne laser scanning als derived high resolution topographic data increased the possibilities to better represent landscapes and related physical processes at the watershed scale additionally the adoption of topographically based hydrological models allows to simulating water overland flows and investigate the occurrence of specific degradative phenomena snowpack melting plays a primary role in altering superficial water dynamics in mountain landscapes but accurate investigation of the interaction between snowmelt runoff and human infrastructures such as roads and trails in the occurrence of hillslope failures is still obscure this research aims to assess the relationship between snowmelt runoff road presence and terrain instabilities affecting a landslide prone steep slope mountain meadow northern italy an innovative multi modeling approach was proposed to detect the alteration of snowmelt overflows due to the presence of the road and its relation with the activation of a shallow landslide the road role in altering snowmelt runoff was investigated both considering its presence and assuming its absence different hydrological and slope stability models were interactively considered starting from pre event als derived dem to compute predictive basin scale simulations results attested the key role played by the road in altering snowmelt runoff pathways as well as their combined contribution to the foreseen activation of the observed shallow landslide starting from on field observations conducted after the landslide triggering the accuracy of instabilities predictions was finally tested through the statistical computation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc roc and the cohen s kappa index respectively resulted around 0 9 and 0 6 this work could be a useful tool for planning mitigation interventions able to reduce the occurrence of similar risk scenarios also providing suggestions for developing and promoting efficient sustainable actions for mountain landscapes

et al 2013 salesa et al 2019 in this regard the relation between negative pore water pressure and soil shear strength primarily regulates the occurrence of landslides and erosive dynamics due to road diverted water flows davison et al 2000 bogaard and greco 2016 the vertical translocation of water across soil strata induces an increase in upslope pore water pressure of the unsaturated layers hinds et al 2021 such a loss of negative pore water pressure results in the reduction of both matric suctions and shear strength of soil which encourages soil weakening until the slope failure brand et al

take part in snow melting such as i spatial variability of snow cover ii elevation ranges inside the basin iii aspect iv slope v vegetation coverage vi wind vii precipitation and viii diurnal temperature variation ferguson 1999 pistocchi 2016 in addition water movements through the snowpack influences snowmelt dynamics according to the internal structure of the snow its conditions and the availability of water at the surface obled and harder 1978 mullem et al 2004 therefore the interaction between snowmelt runoff henceforth called sr and road presence can be critically responsible for slope instabilities in the last decades the need to increase the understanding of complex hydrological and geomorphological phenomena translated into the development of specific coding and models therefore hydro geomorphological models become a powerful instrument for analyse landscapes evolution improve water management and prevent the occurrence of land degradation processes over time guo et

detecting land degradative dynamics affecting the earth surface considering the above considerations a predictive analysis of the contribution of snowmelt runoff in the occurrence of hillslope instabilities in mountain basins is actually lacking in the scientific literature even more so the role played by roads in landslides activation due to snowmelt runoff deviation is still obscure this research aims therefore to investigate the interaction between snowmelt runoff road presence and hillslope instabilities affecting a landslides prone steep slope mountain meadow northern italy in this regard an innovative multi modeling approach is proposed looking at the aims of this research pre event 1 m resolution als derived dem digital elevation model dem was used for compute the proposed

2005 was consequently implemented looking at its capability to provide spatial mapping of the minimum rainfall intensity able to potentially compromise hillslope stability and the consequent distribution of instability susceptibility areas within the basin finally the simulated water erosion model simwe mitasova et al 2013 was applied to detect spatial directions of snowmelt overflow looking at the specific land cover and hydraulic properties therefore srm ress and simwe models were jointly applied model outcomes were finally validated by specific statistical analysis the proposed

innovative low cost model based methodological workflow 2 study area the study area is a high steep slope mountain grassland located close to the mountain pordoi pass in trentino alto adige region northern italy fig 1 the considered watershed has an overall extension of 1 22 km2 an average slope equal to 26 9 between a minimum of 0 02 and a maximum of 88 4 and an average elevation equal to 2350 m a s l ranging from a minimum of 2010 m a s l and a maximum of 2924 m a s l the basin is characterized by the presence of rocky areas at the top while the remaining part is entirely covered by low grass so it can be with confidence defined as a mountain grassland system a paved road network is located inside the study area crossing the slope in the lower part the road has a total length of about 900 m and an average slope equal to 5 0 concrete manholes are located between the roadway and the upper slope at the bottom of the bank with a square section of sides ranging from 0 8 m and 1 4 m a local weather station located 800 m away from the watershed as the crow flies was used for meteorological data acquisition during field surveys conducted in 2020 a shallow landslide was observed its activation involved a structural failure of a road s section that overturned on the bank below several erosion zones were also detected on the upper zones of the entire grassland further revealing its susceptibility to the occurrence of land degradation phenomena such a watershed henceforth called ress watershed was used in soil stability simulations differently a sub basin called srm watershed was considered for snowmelt computation setting its outlet at the observed landslide s triggering area i e at the point of the road failure further upstream to the landslide area below the daily

location and a maximum of 2366 m a s l and an average slope equal to 21 8 between a minimum of 0 01 and a maximum of 88 0 srm watershed is almost entirely covered by low herbaceous grass except for a small rocky part further upstream field surveys conducted in 2020 after the landslide activation specifically during the snowmelt period also highlighted the relevance of the interaction between snowmelt runoff and road surface in this regard on field observations revealed the presence of constant snowmelt runoff coming from the residual melting snowpack flowing downstream along the grassy hillslope and hence intercepting the paved road fig 2 a d snowmelt overflows consequently turn out to fall from the roadway to the collapsed hillslope below fig 2e f 3 material and methods 3 1 data

overview of its characteristics in addition an uncrewed aerial vehicle uav based field scale survey was conducted in 2020 in order to appreciate local geomorphological characteristics of the landslide surface the extension of the landslide zone is about 4155 m2 with a perimeter of 368 m and an average slope equal to 20 6 accordingly to the definitions proposed by dikau et al 1996 sidle and bogaard 2016 and thiery et al 2017 the observed landslide can be identified as a shallow translational landslide looking at both the steepness of the failure surface and its dimensions looking at fig 4 b the

input variables of srm whose description is detailed presented in the supplementary documentation a srm model is divided into meteorological fig 3bi and spatial data fig 3bii pre event dem was considered for daily snowmelt rate estimation for the 2018 snowmelt season fig 3biii following the suggestions provided by martinec et al 2008 the basin considered for snowmelt estimation was not divided into elevation zones given the fact that the elevation range between the outlet and the highest point of the watershed resulted lower than 500 m indicated by model s developers as the threshold for basin subdivision therefore the calculation of the hypsometric curve was not required moreover since the basin was not divided into zones no altitude adjustment in the function of zonal hypsometric mean elevation values was necessary martinec et al 2008 the daily maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and precipitation p values recorded by the weather station were considered for 2018 snow cover was estimated starting from satellites observations and the daily percentage of the snow covered area sca concerning the total extension of the basin was hence obtained in particular sca was mapped from landsat 8 data by applying the normalized index of differences in snow cover ndsi kour and patel 2013 kurakina et al 2020 for the considered year ndsi was hence calculated by eq 1 1 ndsi green s w i r green s w i r where green stands for the l8 band 3 and swir stands for the l8 short wave infrared band 6 a threshold value of ndsi 0 4 was used to automatically map the snow presence inside the basin dietz et al 2012 donmez et al 2021 daily snow cover was extrapolated from the acquired landsat 8 satellite data by using the interpolation method expressed by eq 2 kour and patel 2013 2 s n s 1 s 2 s 1 t 2 t 1 t m t 1 where sn is the snow cover on nth day s1 is the snow cover derived from the first image s2 is snow cover derived from the second image tn is the number of nth days t1 is the julian date of the first image and t2 is the julian date of the second image temperature lapse rate γ was obtained by looking at the availability of weather stations at different altitudes i e pordoi weather station located at 2154 m a s l and 0 57 km far away from the watershed and arabba station placed at 1642 m a s l and 5 km far away from the study area the temperature lapse rate was therefore calculated by dividing the difference between daily average temperatures measured at each weather station with their altitude range martinec et al 2008 following the suggestions provided by model developers the critical temperature tcrit was set equal to 3 c from may to jun 0 75 c in july and 0 c from august to march martinec et al 2008 these values resulted to be specifically suitable for mountain basins as also reported by uncertainty detection of srm input proposed by xiang et al 2009 the degree day factor a was obtained from the empirical relation expressed by eq 3 matinec 1960 3 a 1 1 ρ s ρ w where ρs is the density of the snow and ρw is the density of the water in particular ρs was determined following eq 4 pistocchi 2016 4 ρ s 0 2 0 001 d o y where doy represents the day number from the beginning of the snow season looking at the collected snowfall data and at the suggestions provided by model designers the rainfall contributing area rca was set equal to 1 from april to october and equal to 0 from november to march martinec et al 2008 the recession coefficient k is expressed by eq 5 5 k n 1 q n 1 q n x q n y where qn and qn 1 are daily measured discharge values x and y are parameters determined through linear regression analysis starting from measured discharge values since the absence of available historical discharge data at the basin s outlet x and y coefficients were set equal to 0 85 and 0 086 respectively therefore following the indications provided by martinec et al 2008 in agreement with the input setting proposed by similar applications of the model tahir et al 2011 panday et al 2014 the runoff coefficient for snow cs was set equal to 0 2 from jun to august and equal to 0 15 from september to may while the runoff coefficient for rain cr was 0 15 from july and august and equal to 0 10 from september to june the time lag l was set equal to 1 h since the absence of historical snowmelt hydrographs for the srm watershed the l parameter was set looking at its size and accordingly with model application in similar basins in agreement with the suggestions provided by martinec et al 2008 3 1 4 road erosion steady state model ress table 3 reports the inputs obtained for ress simulations we refer the reader s attention to the supplementary documentation a for details regarding the model the model needs dem without the presence of the road fig 3civ since the available als derived pre event elevation model was acquired after the road construction a novel smoothing procedure was developed to remove it therefore a scenario with the presence of the road yesroad scenario and a second one with its simulated absence noroad scenario were respectively considered for ress simulations dem was firstly clipped on the ress watershed boundaries and the road was masked creating a vector polygon following its edges successively euclidean buffers were created outside the top and the bottom side of the road polygon point features were therefore located at a fixed distance of 10 m along with them through the generate points along lines arcgis tool and elevation values from the dem were then extracted for each point the topo to raster interpolation was applied for the buffer zones through the topo to raster arcgis tool and then clipped on the original road mask previously designed in this way the interpolated surface was merged on the original elevation model through the arcgis mosaic to new raster tool setting the elevation values of the interpolated road mask as output cell values of the overlapping areas this specific interpolation method was adopted aiming to create a modified but hydrologically correct dem esri 2021 simulating the absence of the road and avoiding evident alteration of grassy zones included in the process a comparison between dems with and without the road is presented in fig a 1 every drainage system needed to be provided with x and y coordinates as well as with a value p ranging from 0 to 100 representing the portion of water flows diverted by it and routed out of the road looking at the location and the types of drainage systems along the road a constant value of 60 was set as p this value turned out to be the more suitable given the water deviation induced by drainage systems toward the hillslope under the road road width was measured equal to 4 m and the relative road cut depth describing the potential interception of each road cell at the foot of the upstream slope was set equal to the default value of 0 5 m according to on field measurements previously conducted in the same area borga et al 2002b borga et al 2005 tarolli et al 2008 tarolli et al 2011 geotechnical parameters were set looking at the respective average values detected across the catchment therefore soil depth was set equal to 0 5 m the internal friction angle ϕ to 35 the saturated soil density ρs to 1800 kgm 3 soil transmissivity t to 0 3 10 3 m2s 1 and soil cohesion cohs to 0 1 kg m 1s 2 additionally water density ρ w was 1000 kgm 3 while root cohesion cohr and vegetation surcharge w were set equal to 0 because of the mere presence of low herbaceous cover among the watershed kokutse et al 2016 fig 3ciii sr and rr peaks obtained with srm for the 2018 melting period were set as input in the ress model fig 3ci ii with a corresponding increment step equal to the default value of 1 mmh 1 in this regard the use of single sr and rr peaks calculated at the outlet of the srm watershed for the spatially predictive detection of slope instabilities relies on the assumption that is possible to create large scale predictive mapping of terrain failures starting from snowmelt values obtained at a specific point of interest placed inside the basin finally the d infinite flow direction algorithm tarboton 1997 was selected to let the model route subsurface multipath flows 3 1 5 simulated water erosion simwe the use of pre event dem for simwe application allowed the predictive analysis of the dynamics of road diverted sr overflows toward the below hillslope in particular sr discharge and flow depth intercepting the landslide area were estimated for both the yesroad and the noroad scenarios fig 3d simwe inputs are summarized in table 4 while accurate model description is presented in the supplementary documentation a maximum sr obtained for the 2018 melt season was considered as input for simwe modeling fig 3cii as similarly highlighted in the previous section such a set of a single srm derived sr peak value for the spatial modeling of road diverted sr dynamics at basin scale assumes the possibility to innovatively apply such a model by overtaking the use of spatially distributed water input as commonly propose in the available literature see section 5 1 moreover the excess rate was calculated by subtracting the infiltration rate mmh 1 from the snowmelt intensity peaks mmh 1 infiltration rates were set in function of the measurements of the hydraulic conductivity for each land type in line with previously conducted field measurements tarolli et al 2011 borga et al 2002b looking at tabular values for specific soil categories bunya et al 2010 hofierka et al 2018 pijl et al 2020 manning s n values were set equal to 0 045 for grassland 0 016 for the paved road and 0 099 for rocky areas located at the top of the watershed fig 3ciii 3 2 statistical validation of instability susceptibility mapping ress derived instability susceptibility maps were validated through the receiver operating characteristic roc analysis fig 3ei the magnitude of the agreement between predicted and observed instabilities was hence calculated by the cohen s kappa index fig 3eii lee et al 2007 pourghasemi et al 2012 vakhshoori and zare 2018 such statistical analysis was performed focusing on the grassy hillslope located downstream of the road aiming to support our outcomes regarding its interaction with sr dynamics in terms of landslide occurrence the predictive capabilities of ress model to foresee the activation of terrain failures were validated by looking at the key participation of the road in altering sr and rr overflow paths thus potentially encouraging the occurrence of hydro erosive phenomena the null hypothesis was defined in this case corresponding to the condition that the slope is not involved in soil instabilities it is therefore necessary to define whether it was correctly discarded in favor of the alternative one i e the presence of instabilities within the hillslope detected instabilities and stable zones were mapped and rasterized starting from uav derived 1 cm orthomosaic and post event field observations two classes i e stable and unstable were selected defining a classification threshold applied by distinguishing stable and unstable zones as similarly done in borga et al 2005 each raster cell of observations and modeled predictions were therefore assigned to one of the two selected classes classes overlay defined four types of pixels i e i true positives tp where observed unstable zones are predicted as unstable ii true negatives tn where observed stable cells are predicted as stable iii false positives fp where observed stable cells are predicted as unstable and iv false negatives fn where observed unstable cells are predicted as stable palacio cordoba et al 2020 vakhshoori and zare 2018 true positive rate tpr and false positive rates fpr were calculated following eq 6 and 7 6 tpr tp tp f n 7 fpr fp tn f p the values of the area under the roc curve auc finally express the model s ability to correctly classify those zones more or less susceptible to the occurrence of instabilities arcgis based spatial data modeller arcsdm geoprocessing tool was used for roc analysis and auc calculation auc values range between 0 failed prediction and 1 perfect prediction fawcett 2006 the predictive reliability of ress model was also tested by mapping the terrain instabilities observed downstream of the road on the ress derived map of critical sr and rr and therefore by comparing the proportion of the respective catchment area placed in each critical sr and rr interval to the corresponding fraction of the detected unstable zones the assessment of ress results translates in a larger divergence between observed degraded surfaces and the respective regions of the catchment corresponding to low values of critical sr and rr borga et al 2002 borga et al 2005 plausible inaccuracies arising from the post event identification of degraded regions were considered in this statistical procedure by associating the observed unstable zones to the low critical sr values computed in a 3x3 grid cell moving window borga et al 2002 this specifically allowed to consider the eventual detection of terrain instabilities occurred on zones defined by the model as relatively stable but initiated by the failure of a nearby grid characterized by low critical sr values borga et al 2005 cohen s kappa index cohen 1960 was calculated by eq 8 guzzetti et al 2006 8 k p c p e 1 p c where pc stands for the proportion of cells correctly classified as unstable or stable and pe stands for the proportion of cells for which the agreement between observations and predictions is expected by chance in particular pc and pe are expressed by the following eq 9 and 10 respectively 9 p c tp t n n 10 p e t p f n t p f p f p t n f n t n n 2 where n is the total number of pixels in the investigated zone cohen s k ranges between a minimum of 1 total disagreement between observed and predicted instabilities and a maximum of 1 perfect agreement between observed and predicted instabilities guzzetti et al 2006 4 results 4 1 snowmelt runoff computation simulations revealed that the melt period in 2018 was limited to may fig 5 c daily snowmelt values mm h resulted between a minimum of 1 09 mm h and a maximum of 11 36 mm h fig 5b and rain contributing to runoff rr resulted between a minimum of 2 08 mm h and a maximum of 62 8 mm h fig 5c in this regard the extraction of sr and rr peaks for the application of ress and simwe models was computed looking at those periods for 2018 4 2 slope stability analysis figs 6 and 7 represent the comparison of critical sr and rr for the yesroad and noroad scenarios fig 3cvii x starting from pre event srm outcomes the calculation of critical sr showed an increase in its values inside the landslide area for the noroad scenario fig 6b compared with the yesroad one fig 6a moreover road contribution in critical sr deviation toward the landslide surface is expressed by the calculation of the difference between noroad and yesroad critical sr fig 6c the presence of reddish pixels within the landslide surface represents those zones where this difference is greater this suggests that road presence induces an increase of the minimum sr able to potentially compromise the stability of the hillslope below similar results are appreciable by comparing the spatial variability of critical rr computed for the two scenarios fig 7a b respectively the difference between noroad and yesroad critical rr fig 7c supports such statements in this connection ress results for the yesroad condition highlight the distribution of lower critical rr values inside the landslide prone surface compared to the yesroad situation therefore the involvement of sr overflows in landslide activation results to be comparable with terrain instabilities encouraged by rr this further underlines the active contribution of snowmelt in landslide occurrence also suggesting the key role of the road in its critical deviation toward the unstable hillslope below fig 8 shows the comparison of the ri index fig 3cv vi calculated from the pre event critical sr fig 8a and critical rr fig 8b reddish colors of ri indicate unstable areas while blue colors represent stable ones besides the identification of local unconditionally unstable regions within the hillslope above the road the ress model particularly revealed the potential activation of land degradation dynamics in correspondence with the observed shallow landslide surface starting from pre event snowmelt computation fig 8a similarly the calculation of ri starting from critical rr mapping predicted the occurrence of terrain instabilities inside the landslide area fig 8b this firstly reveals as snowmelt overflows can actively contribute to triggering local land degradation processes and terrain instabilities 4 3 simwe simulations fig 9 shows the comparison between sr dynamics at the landslide zone for the yesroad and noroad scenarios in terms of water discharge and flow depth fig 3di iv starting from pre event dem simwe mapping of snowmelt directions revealed as sr flows downstream along the grassy bank in the direction of the road then water coming from the melting snowpack intercepts the roadway and moves along with it such road diverted snowmelt water successively falls to the unstable slope below crossing the surface involved in landslide activation fig 9a c fig 2d f the drainage systems located along the roadway seem to inefficiently catch sr which is diverted in such a way as to contribute to slope destabilization results also illustrate that a fraction of sr coming from the grassy hillslope upstream of the landslide converges in the direction of the manhole located at its trigger point yellow point in fig 9 in particular its water regulating capacity was revealed to be critically stressed by sr coming from the upper part of the basin this encourages its progressive overload which translates into sr deviation across the road and toward the landslide surface in this connection the maximum sr discharge and water depth at this specific point resulted equal to 1 06 m3s 1 and 0 33 m respectively sr flow directions elaborated for the noroad scenario in terms of water discharge and flow depth are shown in fig 9b d these simulations highlighted that in the supposed absence of the road sr coming from the upstream zones of the watershed would flow along the slope without evident deviations unlike what is observed in the yesroad one on the contrary the noroad scenario highlighted the critical deviation of sr outflows due to the ineffective water management of the manhole similarly to what was observed in the yesroad simulations 4 4 statistical analysis 4 4 1 snowmelt discharge and flow depth cross section the influence of road network on runoff overflows deviation was further investigated through the computation of a topographic cross section of snowmelt runoff discharge and flow depth values for the landslide area a transect line was therefore designed crosswise the landslide surface control points cps were placed along with it at an equal distance of 10 cm for a total of 30 cps fig a 2 for each cp simwe derived discharge and depth values of sr were respectively extracted fig 10 shows cross sections results regarding sr discharge fig 10a and water depth fig 10b for the yesroad and noroad scenarios looking at the presence of the road sr discharge and depth along the transect resulted higher than those extracted simulating its absence sr discharge and flow depth peaks of the noroad cross sections shown in fig 10 represent the fraction of snowmelt runoff coming from the upper hillslope and critically converging at the landslide aside from road presence 4 4 2 statistical validation of predicted instabilities post event field inspections allowed for detecting and localizing the failures that occurred in the study area in order to check the accuracy of predictive soil stability simulations by comparing such observations with model outcomes looking at the aims of the presented research post event field surveys were focused on both the shallow landslide and local instabilities triggered on the hillslope located downstream of the road therefore the validation of the ress derived prediction of soil instabilities was firstly computed by the calculation of the area under the roc curve auc for the section of the ress watershed under the roadway auc was calculated starting from the creation of the confusion matrix reported in table 5 in this regard the low percentage of fn and fp pixels highlighted the good potentiality of the ress model in predicting soil instabilities in particular due to sr overflows auc values resulted equal to 0 94 and 0 92 respectively for the forecast of sr and rr induced soil instabilities finally ress performance in the prediction of soil failures was expressed by the cohen s k index resulting equal to 0 58 and 0 55 respectively referring to sr and rr derived ress simulations the comparison of the observed unstable zones placed downstream of the road to the fraction of the respective catchment area for each critical pre event sr and rr interval is reported in the following tables 6 and 7 the assessment of ress model reliability was hence reflected by a larger difference between the proportion of instabilities that occurred within the lower critical sr and rr ranges critical sr 5 mm h critical rr 15 mm h or in those zones considered as unconditionally unstable and the percentage of the corresponding catchment area the proportion of instabilities that occurred within the lowest critical sr and rr ranges resulted respectively around 53 table 6 and 45 table 7 while the percentage of the corresponding catchment area respectively decreased to around 20 table 6 and 25 table 7 this suggests as the occurrence of instabilities mostly recurs in the sections of the watershed characterized by low critical sr values therefore predicted to be unstable 5 discussion this work investigates the interaction between road and snowmelt runoff in the activation of hillslope instabilities for this purpose a challenging predictive multi modeling approach was implemented through the adoption of three different models this allowed to quantify snowmelt runoff at the watershed scale and obtain a mapping of local terrain instabilities related to road induced surface water deviation several studies have been carried out regarding the single application of srm ress and simwe respectively focusing on snowmelt calculation ferguson 1999 eigdir 2003 tahir et al 2011 butt and bilal 2011 devi 2017 siemens et al 2021 landslide susceptibility mapping borga et al 2005 tarolli et al 2011 cordoba et al 2020 al umar et al 2020 and water overland flows arnone et al 2011 bogaard and greco 2016 zhao et al 2019 yang et al 2019 mauri et al 2022 however in this context the proposed multi modeling approach is novel this research additionally supports srm testing for small mountain watersheds in line with the analysis provided by rango and martinec 1979 brubaker et al 1996 debeer and pomeroy 2010 and gomez landesa and rango 2002 despite the availability of many researches about the role of roads and trails in the occurrence of land degradation dynamics such as landslides fu et al 2010 sidle and ziegler 2012 penna et al 2014 and erosion processes elliot et al 1999 salesa et al 2019 yu et al 2021 our work stands out from the scientific literature in that it proposes an innovative methodology able to forecast the activation of local instabilities at meters detail by analyzing the interaction between road snowmelt runoff and shallow landslides at the watershed scale differently from the accessible scientific investigations about soil stability dietrich et al 1992 montgomery and dietrich 1994 borga et al 2002a borga et al 2005 and water runoff dynamics in mountain environments cencetti et al 2005 fernandes et al 2017 koco 2011 pijl et al 2020 mauri et al 2022 the use of such models considering the simulated absence of infrastructures in a dem is in line with the innovative outcomes provided by mauri et al 2022 in this regard our results attest the validity of such a methodology not only for degraded agricultural areas but also for mountain ones in addition models application looking at post event conditions for the detection of evolutive dynamics affecting the degraded hillslope is a further groundbreaking aspect of our research as similarly highlighted by tague and band 2001 royer 2006 and buchanan et al 2013 our research further suggests that the inefficient location of drainage systems along the road has a key influence on critical snowmelt runoff alterations specific interventions aimed at correctly positioning drainage systems e g cross ditches gutters manholes pipes and culverts could be undertaken starting from our work this is in line with the outcomes recently provided by hearn and shakya 2017 reed and kite 2020 guo et al 2020 tshering et al 2020 and raga et al 2020 who highlighted the key relevance of drainage systems location and maintenance for efficiently routing water runoff along the roadway and toward the above hillslopes looking at the notable effects of climate change in increasing both snowmelt intensity and snowfall amounts in mountain regions rasmussen et al 2011 wi et al 2012 marshall et al 2020 ikeda et al 2021 our research further stresses the importance of considering superficial snowmelt dynamics in road planning and construction aiming to avoid the future occurrence of erosion and landslides events finally such a predictive spatially distributed analysis of land degradation dynamics affecting mountain hillslopes could be also considered for planning effective slope stability interventions 5 1 limitations some limitations have emerged during the simulations workflow first the selection of models inputs particularly affects the respective outcomes as for any physical models which makes this an issue aspect to be considered furthermore the detection of snow covered areas starting from satellites observations requires the exclusion of low quality images and those characterized by an excessive cloud cover this led to the availability of fewer valid input data for srm simulations moreover since the only availability of landsat 8 products for the considered year 30 m resolution images were used for snow coverage detection inside the basin in fact specific factors such as residual cloudiness inefficient covered area and error in images acquisition by satellites can jointly affect the quality of acquired data for input preparation this could potentially translate into bias and distortions in the resulting data interpolation specifically in analyzing snow presence close to terrain depressions and local surface alterations which certainly requires higher satellite resolution despite the possibility to run the srm model for ungauged basins martinec and rango 1986 the lack of historical snowmelt discharge measurement at the basin outlet prevents the validation of srm outcomes and therefore the detection of srm accuracy was not feasible additionally notwithstanding the evidences provided by models results and their respective statistical analysis a last potential limit could translate in having assumed the possibility to predict the spatial distribution of slope instabilities and detect the role of the road in diverting sr overflows starting from the computation of single sr and rr peaks at the basin outlet finally site specific geotechnical models could offer a more complete view of the mechanisms of the landslide that occurred downslope the roads a point that will be explored soon by the authors 6 conclusion this work proposes a multi modeling analysis of the interaction between snowmelt runoff and road presence in the activation of hillslope instabilities in a mountain watershed als derived dems served as the basis for computing predictive and post event basin scale soil stability simulations the role of snowmelt runoff in affecting surface destabilizations was highlighted by comparing models outcomes starting from the calculation of snowmelt runoff rainfall runoff and their joint contribution to water overflow dynamics the role of road network in altering surface snowmelt runoff was investigated both considering its presence and assuming its absence by a novel dem post processing procedure despite the highlighted limitations of the proposed innovative multi modeling approach results attested the key role played by the road in altering snowmelt runoff directions as well as its contribution in the foreseen likely activation of a shallow landslide statistical analysis validated the accuracy of instabilities predictions in this connection despite the unfeasible possibility to validate srm outcomes the computed statistics evinces the reliability of sr and rr simulation given the importance of model validations considering the objectives of our work it represents an interesting element to evaluate in applying the multi modelling methodology proposed in our research finally the relevance of inefficient water management by road drainage systems in potentially encouraging the occurrence of instabilities phenomena was also verified more investigations could be undertaken aiming to find out the optimal location of ditches and culverts able to efficiently intercept and collect water runoff analogously the proposed interactive application of srm ress and simwe models could be suitable for likewise investigating the interaction between snowmelt runoff and roads presence in larger mountain basins similar analysis could be therefore performed aiming to map terrain instabilities at both hillslope and watershed scale over time as well as in investigating such issue focusing on the presence of infrastructures at different altitude levels regionwide this work can be considered a useful tool for planning mitigation interventions able to reduce the occurrence of similar risk scenarios also looking at the effects of climate changes in this regard therefore valuable suggestions for developing and promoting efficient sustainable actions for mountain landscapes could be applied credit authorship contribution statement luca mauri conceptualization methodology data curation writing original

3142,studied region chokai volcano is composed of low permeability andesite lava a snowfall influenced hydrological setting that has been little studied study focus snowfall there is expected to decrease due to climate change and expanded quarrying along its southern foot to evaluate the effects of future environmental changes on the groundwater discharged from springs at the feet of lava flows which is used for agriculture and domestic purposes we used isotopic hadrochemical geologic meteorological and topographic information to elucidate the recharge area major recharge season and underground flow of spring waters and surface waters at chokai new hydrogeological insights for the region groundwater and surface water are of nacl type with high deuterium excess values indicating a strong contribution of atmospheric deposition of sea salt aerosols during winter altitude indicators based on water h and o isotopic compositions and chloride ion concentrations suggest that the foothill springs are recharged mainly on gentle slopes below 700 m elevation this area is generally covered with volcanic sediments which contain wetlands and perched aquifers that continuously supply groundwater to the underlying lava through fractures and voids without thorough mixing in the lava aquifer anticipated decreases in snowfall and the removal of surface rocks may adversely affect not only the foothill springs supplied by snowmelt and the rice cultivation that depends on them but also the wetland ecosystem keywords groundwater volcano recharge elevation water isotopic composition snow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction climate change associated with global warming is expected to reduce snowfall and accelerate the melting of snow in mountains at mid to high latitudes where snowfall is the main source of surface water leading to reduced groundwater recharge and adverse agricultural effects barnett et al 2005 fyfe et al 2017 however the regional impacts on climate change vary with some regions expected to see reduced snowfall bormann et al 2018 and others to see increased annual precipitation and a corresponding increase in groundwater recharge wu et al 2020 in snow rich areas where cities and agricultural users rely on groundwater from mountains hydrological information on the area and periods of recharge is essential for the sustainable use of groundwater volcanic mountains offer groundwater investigations a distinctive set of research problems groundwater at the foot of a volcano flows out to the surface as gravitational flow or artesian water many groundwater studies have been conducted on marine volcanic islands where surface water resources are scarce and sustainable water uses are needed hydrogeological models of basaltic volcanoes have been presented for the hawaiian islands ingebritsen and scholl 1993 canary islands custodio 2007 and mayotte island lachassagne et al 2014 and have been refined for other basaltic volcanoes where the recharge of groundwater has been characterized using the h and o isotopic compositions of precipitation alongside hydrometeorological data bertrand et al 2010 hildenbrand et al 2005 lee et al 1999 prada et al 2016 scholl et al 1996 scholl et al 2002 although there is comparatively little research on andesitic volcanoes which are typical of island arcs and continental margins groundwater studies have also incorporated various hydrogeochemical methods such as the h and o isotopic compositions of groundwater parisi et al 2011 toulier et al 2019 however because most groundwater studies in volcanic settings focus on tropical and warm regions the contribution of snowfall to groundwater has not yet been fully evaluated at volcanoes lava clinker fissures tuff breccia and scoria with generally high permeability serve as aquifers and fine grained volcanic ash and lake sediments as impermeable layers hahn et al 1997 kumai 1982 parisi et al 2011 toulier et al 2019 however the distributions of these features are uneven and vary depending on the volcano compared to basaltic lava andesitic lava is more compact and less permeable except for fractures andesitic lavas of quaternary age have porosities of 5 70 and estimated hydraulic conductivities of about 10 16 10 10 m2 farquharson et al 2015 yokoyama and takeuchi 2009 nonetheless groundwater flow in lava settings which is controlled by different factors affecting permeability such as the distributions of voids and large and small cracks as well as their mutual relationships is poorly known many case studies are required to construct hydrogeological models of volcanoes custodio 2007 but few studies have addressed groundwater processes i e from recharge to flow to discharge at andesitic volcanoes especially those dominated by lava in addition to variations in volcanic materials environmental factors affecting groundwater recharge at volcanoes such as weather vegetation and soil moisture vary greatly depending on elevation season and topography wet precipitation is generally abundant at high elevations and in summer evapotranspiration is strong due to active vegetation and surface runoff during heavy rainfall whereas in winter evapotranspiration is low and snow is abundant earman et al 2006 lee et al 1999 parisi et al 2011 because snow melts slowly it penetrates the subsurface more effectively than rain and makes a greater contribution to groundwater recharge earman et al 2006 winograd et al 1998 however the geochemistry of groundwater is generally stable whereas precipitation has large temporal variations moreover snow unlike rainfall changes its δ18o and δ2h values until it melts earman et al 2006 these findings show that other methods in addition to the h and o isotopic compositions of water need to be explored to estimate the area and season of volcanic groundwater recharge chloride ions cl are a conservative tracer and although the chloride mass balance method has widely been used to estimate groundwater recharge bresciani et al 2014 but it has rarely been combined with h and o isotopic data the sustainable use of groundwater at snow laden andesitic volcanoes which are poorly studied requires hydrogeological models integrating meteorological topographical and a wide range of hydrochemical data the japanese archipelago is a typical island arc and its 107 volcanoes which account for 7 of the world s active volcanoes erupt mainly andesite average annual rainfall in japan is 1700 mm about twice the world average and 62 of japan s land area is in cold regions receiving abundant snow chokai volcano a quaternary stratovolcano producing dominantly basaltic andesite lava flows hayashi 1984a is in northeastern japan along the sea of japan a climatic zone that receives heavy winter snowfall fig 1 this zone is the center of rice cultivation in japan and most irrigation water originates from mountain snowmelt as global warming proceeds the amount of snowfall in japan is predicted to decrease in low elevations but remain unchanged or increase at high elevations at temperatures far below freezing kawase 2019 kawase et al 2020 yamaguchi et al 2011 flood damage caused by rain on snow events is also highly dependent on elevation freudiger et al 2014 and is expected to increase with global warming ohba and kawase 2020 thus identifying recharge elevations and assessing the contribution of snow to foothill springs is indispensable for sustainable groundwater use chokai volcano is designated as a quasi national park and its few inhabitants exert almost no influence on groundwater and river water in these aspects chokai is a suitable site for hydrogeological studies of groundwater at snow laden and lava dominant andesitic volcanoes however although hydrochemical precipitation data are important for identifying groundwater recharge areas the heavy winter snowfall at chokai makes it difficult to collect continuous precipitation data in the highlands where year round meteorological observations are not conducted this difficulty can be overcome by the method of mulligan et al 2011 and yasuhara et al 1997 yasuhara et al 2017 which identifies groundwater recharge areas in the mountains by analyzing the h and o isotopic compositions of spring waters in small watersheds with short flow paths nonetheless previous studies employing the isotopic compositions of water have shown a rain shadow effect in which the origin of water vapor in the mountains differs between the windward and leeward sides scholl et al 1996 scholl et al 2002 in studies of inland japanese volcanoes the isotopic compositions of precipitation and spring water differ considerably depending on the slope direction asai et al 2009 yasuhara et al 1997 yasuhara et al 2017 we focused our study on the southwestern slope of chokai fig 1 where this meteorological and topographical effect is considered minimal this paper presents h and o isotopic compositions and major dissolved ion concentrations including cl of spring water well water surface water wetland water and precipitation in this area by analyzing these data together with geological geomorphological and meteorological information we then elucidate 1 the main recharge season and 2 the mean recharge elevation area for foothill springs and 3 the groundwater quality formation process we integrate the obtained results to propose a conceptual hydrogeological model of chokai volcano and evaluate the effect of snow and land modification on foothill springs 2 target area and hydrogeological information 2 1 target area agriculture and other human activities are significant in the plains and adjoining gentle slope southwest of chokai in yuza town in yamagata prefecture where surface water derived from copious springs at the feet of lava flows is widely used as irrigation and drinking water fig 2 a the yoshideyama area south southwest of chokai is representative of mountain foot springs fig 2b there springs emerge at the tips of lava flows in many places one of these the dohhara waterfall is a tourist attraction and high quality water source with an annual discharge of about one million tons scattered wetlands and surface waters in the thick volcanic sediments that mantle the gentle slopes of lava flows are associated with groundwater flowing from perched aquifers these areas support an invaluable ecosystem comprising many plants and animals including bears and endangered species such as the tree frog zhangixalus arboreus for these reasons the yoshideyama area is designated as a forest conservation area in yamagata prefecture at the quarry in the western part of the yoshideyama area spring water flows from cracks in the exposed lavas the impact of expanded quarrying on the aquifer is of concern to the downstream area where groundwater from the lava is used for drinking and irrigation misuda 2018 the upper reaches of the yoshideyama area extend to nearly 2000 m elevation and are accessible by road we targeted mainly the yoshideyama area because it is crucial for groundwater conservation and is most appropriate for evaluating the hydrogeological process affecting foothill springs 2 2 geology and geomorphology of chokai volcano chokai volcano 39 05 57 n 140 02 56 e summit elevation 2236 m above sea level is an elliptical stratovolcano 26 km long from east to west and 14 km long from north to south fig 1 its volcanic edifice overlies volcanic and sedimentary rocks of miocene to pleistocene age hayashi 1984a nakano and tsuchiya 1992 the volcano is mainly composed of basaltic andesite lava flows with few high permeability pyroclastic rocks such as scoria and tuff breccia volcanic activity at chokai can be divided into three stages based on eruption age the distribution of volcanic ejecta petrological characteristics and k ar ages ban et al 2001 hayashi 1984a nakano and tsuchiya 1992 stage i activity occurred near the center of the current volcano during 600 160 ka building an ancestral edifice of lava flows stage i volcanic ejecta are exposed in the eastern part of the volcano their volume of 47 km3 represents 64 of the total volume of chokai stage ii materials 160 20 ka are abundant in the western part of the edifice including the study area and cover the basement rock and stage i materials stage ii lavas effused from several craters that contain lava domes formed by post eruption lava intrusions about 90 ka the summit area collapsed forming a horseshoe shaped caldera that opens to the southwest called the western caldera fig 2 stage ii is subdivided into early iia and iib and late activities iic and iid relative to this event stage ii lava flows are thinner than those of stage i being several tens of meters to 100 m thick in general and reaching a maximum thickness of 300 m the total volume of stage ii materials is estimated at 22 km3 stage iii began after 20 ka and includes the most recent activity a phreatic eruption in 1974 hayashi 1984a a horseshoe shaped caldera opening to the north formed in approximately 466 bce mitsutani 2001 when lahars were generated in the northwestern part of the edifice minami et al 2019 stage iii is subdivided into stages iiia and iiib relative to this caldera forming event the volume of stage iii volcanic rocks is 4 3 km3 the summit lava dome shinzan was formed by the latest magmatic eruptions which occurred from 1800 to 1804 ce nakano and tsuchiya 1992 the hydraulic conditions of groundwater and surface water are influenced by topography as well as geology chokai generally has steep slopes 10 above 600 700 m and gentler slopes about 5 at lower elevations fig 3 near the center of the edifice are especially steep slopes about 30 and low permeability dikes uneven lava dominated topography lava levees lava waves is well developed in the stage ii and iii deposits volcanic colluvium in the troughs between lava waves forms an environment suitable for the formation of perched aquifers the lava flows end in cliffs where groundwater issues from clinker and fractures in the lava 2 3 geology and geomorphology of the yoshideyama area the yoshideyama area is southwest of the western caldera fig 2 the downstream part of the area consists of debris flow deposits generated by the caldera forming event hayashi 1984a after the caldera formation the nakanosawa lavas were erupted and flowed southwest from the nabemori crater at 1500 m elevation near the caldera rim these lavas are divided into the minaminokomai lavas stage iic and the mansukedo lava stage iid nakano and tsuchiya 1992 the minaminokomai lavas comprise at least three lava flows each averaging 80 m in thickness atop a tuff breccia hayashi 1984a they extend down to about 300 m elevation in the southwestern area and about 200 m elevation in the southern area the mansukedo lava erupted from the same site covers the minaminokomai lava down to about 500 m elevation and is 20 40 m thick nakano and tsuchiya 1992 both lavas have similar chemical compositions the senjogahara area at the head of the western caldera contains scoria and lava from both eruptive periods the minaminokomai and mansukedo lavas are flanked by two streams the minaminokomai stream on the east and the minamiore stream on the northwest fig 2a 2b the courses of these streams reflect the distribution and topography of two lava flows between 1500 and 650 m elevation both streams run south to southwest separated by 200 300 m this narrow area has an average slope of 18 and contains well developed lava levees and fissures outside the caldera and below about 650 m where the minaminokomai lavas spread into a fan shape the streams diverge and run along or near the fan s edges here we refer to the yoshideyama area as this lower region below 650 m lava waves are well developed on the gentle slopes between 325 and 475 m elevation on the minaminokomai lavas fig 2c volcaniclastic sediments deposited in the troughs of these lava waves reach 30 m in thickness there scattered wetlands occur with areas of about 2000 40 000 m2 the cliff at the lower end of the minaminokomai lavas is topped by a gently sloping plateau like terrain that is locally called mount yoshideyama because it looks like a mountain from the plain below fig 3 2 4 hydrology groundwater and surface water the daily discharge of chokai springs ranges from 10 to 104 t ogasawara 2005 it exceeds 103 t at several sites nos 10 14 and 29 32 in fig 2 but is about 10 102 t at most sites most springs discharge from clinker or fractures at the cliffs at the ends of lava flows at elevations that range from 10 to 500 m but are mostly below 200 m figs 2 3 because these springs yield water of stable temperature and quality they are used not only for daily life and agriculture but also for salmon farming springs in the talus area just below the terminal cliffs of the lava flows produce water with the same origin springs occasionally emerge at higher elevations from lava joints and the scoria layer the springs at the end of the minaminokomai lava flows lie at about 200 m elevation at the southern foot of the flow and 313 325 m elevation at the western foot of the flow they are termed the south springs nos 5 16 in figs 2 3 and the west springs nos 1 4 respectively the dohhara waterfall no 14 in fig 2b discharges from a lava cave east of the south springs at the quarry no 1 fig 2b at the east edge of the west springs sometimes more than 600 l min of water is discharged through a perforated pipe both groups of springs flow south southwest and are used as domestic and agricultural water sources in the quarry lava flows are distributed beneath a layer of volcanic colluvium 20 40 m thick the lower parts of fresh gray andesite lava flows contain bodies of reddish brown weathered andesite 2 to 3 m thick and about 20 m wide groundwater springs issue from fractures with apertures of about 1 cm in the weathered andesite which is more fragile and permeable than fresh andesite we distinguished three water types in this study surface waters of chokai volcano originate mainly from springs in lava flows the depths of the stream cut valleys generally exceed 10 m and sometimes 200 m groundwater from lava bedrock and surface water originating from it are classified as type 1 type 2 waters are spring and surface waters from perched aquifers in the volcanic colluvium that overlie lava flows volcanic clasts larger than 1 m are common below the tips of lava flows suggestive of origins from clinker or other lava masses type 2 waters are present in rock masses and sediments derived from the mansukedo lava flow near the center of yoshideyama at around 450 m elevation figs 2 3 minaminokomai lavas are widely covered with volcanic sediments and small wetlands in the troughs of lava waves around 300 450 m the presence of wetlands indicates the presence of a perched aquifer water at the surface of wetlands was classified as wetland water type wt regardless of the presence or absence of flow in a 30 000 m2 area in the northern and eastern parts of the quarry springs and surface water from perched aquifers type 2 are distributed on steep slopes and surface water in the eastern part of the quarry can be traced to nearby wetlands the type 2 water in the yoshideyama area is derived from the shallow perched aquifers near recharge areas some type 2 surface waters are ephemeral these include surface water flowing in volcanic sediments atop lavas above 1400 m elevations in the western caldera where snow yields meltwater until summer lake chokai no 71 in fig 2a a caldera lake bordered by lava cliffs appeared to be taking in large amounts of snowmelt in the summer when we sampled the lake in the western part of chokai volcano the valley of the ushiwatari river is underdeveloped with a depth less than 5 m stream water there flows over gravel and sediment covering lava flows and was also classified as type 2 surface water 2 5 meteorology precipitation and wind annual wet precipitation near the summit of chokai has been estimated to reach 12 000 mm tsuchiya 1990 in particular the western caldera accumulates abundant snow and it has been estimated that above 1000 m elevation half of the total wet precipitation occurs as snowfall tsuchiya 1983 weather observations in japan by the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas have been conducted at about 1300 locations since 1976 japan meteorological agency 2021 but this heavy snowfall has precluded year round meteorological observations at high elevations on chokai since 2011 daily precipitation has been monitored only from june to october at two high elevation sites on the volcano s southwestern slope by yamagata prefecture yamagata prefecture 2021 sannotaki site 2 in fig 1 752 m elevation and ohdaira site c in fig 1 999 m observations from 2011 to 2020 at 10 stations around chokai fig 1 obtained from amedas and yamagata prefecture show that daily precipitation amounts at the southern sites are strongly correlated with correlation coefficients exceeding 0 8 among the five southwestern most sites 1 2 3 b and c in contrast to weaker correlations 0 6 0 8 among the three northernmost sites fig 4 a this result indicates that the southern slopes of chokai are likely to receive precipitation from almost the same water vapor source monthly precipitation amounts at seven southern sites have similar seasonal variations with peaks in july fig 4b particularly at gakkohgawa dam site b fig 1 and kamikusatsu site 1 where precipitation is recorded throughout the year monthly precipitation changes are similar to those at the high elevation sites sannotaki site 2 and ohdaira site c if the high elevation sites have the same annual precipitation pattern as sites b and 1 then the annual precipitation near the western caldera is estimated to be 7000 mm at 1600 m elevation and 8000 mm near the summit although this is less than the previous estimate of 12 000 mm tsuchiya 1983 it nevertheless represents a considerable amount of precipitation in the form of winter snow at chokai wind direction and speed have been monitored by amedas at two coastal sites sakata site 4 and nikaho site 6 and two inland sites sasunabe site 5 and yajima site 7 fig 1 the predominant winds are northwesterly to southwesterly in coastal areas and northwesterly to westerly in inland areas fig 5 northwesterly to westerly winds become dominant in winter wind speeds are higher in coastal areas than in inland areas and higher in winter december february than in summer june september fig 5 the average speed of northwesterly to southwesterly winds at sakata reaches more than 4 m s these results indicate that the contribution of sea salt aerosols ssas from the sea of japan is strong during the winter in coastal areas 3 research method and analysis we collected samples of spring water stream water and wetland water on the southern slope of chokai volcano mainly during spring to autumn from september 2010 to october 2011 spring water was collected at 38 sites well water at 2 sites stream water at 38 sites during baseflow periods and wetland water at 7 sites wetland water was stagnant except at one site no 79 fig 2b where it was draining from the wetland to investigate changes in water quality at the same location we sampled 25 springs 16 streams and 4 wetlands from two to six times due to its young age chokai volcano has not experienced extensive erosion and most springs do not correspond to a distinct watershed however six spring water sites nos 16 17 18 20 21 and 27 in fig 2 have small watersheds that were characterized using kashmir software sugimoto 2002 the average elevation ae of each watershed was calculated from cross sections and the area enclosed by contour lines at 10 m intervals spring water from the same scoria layer was present in two adjacent locations at 1397 and 1401 m elevation nos 20 and 21 fig 2a which we grouped as one site in addition shallow unconfined wells are scattered at elevations of 10 20 m along the coast of yuza town on the inland side of a set of low hills about 1 km wide and with a maximum elevation of 61 m and an average elevation of about 30 m fig 1 it is clear from the topography and characteristic water quality see section 4 3 that the water in these wells is derived from hill precipitation samples of shallow well water at two sites nos 34 and 35 fig 2a from this slope were grouped as one site because their average recharge elevations were almost the same we estimate the error of the aes for groundwater at individual sites to be within 20 m the watershed information for each spring water and well water is given in appendix fig a 1 we collected wet precipitation samples at about monthly intervals from 2010 to 2011 from three sites fig 1 at different elevations the roof of the town office building at 30 m elevation site a gakkohgawa dam at 211 m elevation site b and ohdaira at 999 m elevation site c although sampling at ohdaira was limited to june to october because snow cover made the site inaccessible at other times sampling at each site followed the acid rain sampling method of the ministry of the environment with the use of a water sampler similar to the acid rain filtration type sampling device advantec acdr047 advantec tokyo japan to prevent contamination the sampler was mounted 2 m above the surface and used a polypropylene funnel with an opening diameter of 200 mm on which a ping pong ball was placed plus a filter of 0 80 μm pore diameter membrane filter a080a047a advantec tokyo japan samples were conveyed to a 20 l plastic container through a 1 5 m long pfa tube the container was covered with a reflector to reduce the internal temperature changes sampled water was filtered using a disposable cellulose acetate filter pore size 0 2 μm dismic25cs020a5 advantec tokyo japan before storing in prewashed polyethylene bottles concentrations of cl no3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k were determined by ion chromatography ic3000 dionex co with analytical accuracy better than 5 concentrations of hco3 were estimated from the difference in the concentrations of total cations and anions the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water were determined by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds using a spectrophotometer l2120i picarro inc isotopic compositions are expressed in permil with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow2 and the analytical uncertainty 1σ was 0 2 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h all analyses were carried out at the research institute for humanity and nature kyoto japan analytical data for groundwater surface water and wetland water are listed in appendix table a 1 data for wet precipitation in appendix table a 2 and monthly precipitation data compiled from daily data at seven sites at chokai in appendix table a 3 4 results 4 1 isotopic compositions of wet precipitation our wet precipitation samples did not show clear seasonal variations in δ18o and δ2h although the deuterium excess value defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was high in winter december march low in summer june august and intermediate in spring and autumn fig 6 a these results are consistent with previous studies according to tanoue et al 2013 seasonal changes in the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation in japan do not always depend on the climate region as classified based on precipitation and hours of sunlight whereas the d value is high in winter and low in summer in all seven of their climate regions our study area lies in the climate region along the sea of japan side in northern japan which includes the akita and ajigasawa observation sites to the north of the study area sites d and e respectively in fig 1 the d value of precipitation shows a distinct seasonal variation in this climate region the large amount of snowfall that characterizes this climate region is derived from water vapor with a very high d value generated by the rapid evaporation of warm seawater in the sea of japan lee et al 1999 pfahl and sodemann 2014 waseda and nakai 1983 in contrast to seasonal changes long term changes in the h and o isotopic values of precipitation in all regions are reported to be small tanoue et al 2013 secular changes in the isotopic compositions of precipitation in the kanto and chubu regions of central japan have not been significant yabusaki et al 2016 monthly average precipitation isotopic compositions have been reported for the periods 1982 1991 in akita kawaraya et al 2000 and 2003 2006 in ajigasawa hasegawa et al 2014 appendix table a 4 these are converted to multi year seasonal changes in fig 6a although this study was for only one year our δ18o and δ2h values are very similar to the long term seasonal averages fig 6a the summer precipitation line δ2h 7 92 δ18o 8 45 for this climate region including the akita and ajigasawa sites is not much different from the global meteoric water line gmwl but it is notably lower than the corresponding winter precipitation line δ2h 8 14 δ18o 26 7 fig 6b therefore the seasonal variation of precipitation d values in this climatic region is sufficiently large to be applied to evaluate the main groundwater recharge periods 4 2 isotopic compositions of groundwater and surface water the h and o isotopic compositions of groundwater and surface water in this study area fall between the values of winter and summer precipitation indicating that these waters are of meteoric origin fig 6a however the compositions differ depending on the water type fig 6b the d values of type 1 spring water and surface water are high and consistent 21 33 1 11 and 21 63 1 60 respectively they distinctly differ from the average d values of summer precipitation 8 45 and are closer to those of winter precipitation 26 7 indicating that winter precipitation is the dominant source except for dohhara waterfall type 1 spring water shows small changes in isotopic compositions especially small changes in δ2h at the same site fig 6b in contrast wetland water sites showed large changes in δ18o and δ2h fig 6b wetlands are rich in aquatic plants but they have few trees and are open to the atmosphere this environment therefore responds sensitively to the direct input of wet precipitation with a wide range of isotopic compositions which explains the large isotopic changes in wetland water most wetland waters had higher δ18o values than nearby springs and surface waters and some had low d values of 15 or less fig 6b this result indicates that wetland water was stagnant such that the surface layer was affected by evaporation and by spring autumn rainfall with low d values the type 2 surface waters in the yoshideyama area had lower average d values 16 4 than type 1 surface waters because there were no wetlands upstream from these sample locations except for two samples nos 65 and 66 fig 2b these low d values did not reflect evaporation but the contribution of precipitation during spring to autumn when the water was sampled this interpretation is consistent with the ephemeral occurrence of type 2 surface waters which originated from perched aquifers four samples of type 2 surface water nos 69 72 fig 2a and one wetland water no 85 fig 2a collected at elevations above 1100 m in summer had δ18o 10 5 indicative of high elevations of these two samples nos 69 and 70 had low d values 12 4 and 13 4 respectively indicating a strong contribution from summer precipitation the other three samples nos 71 72 and 85 had high d values 21 4 25 6 they were surface water from a snow covered wetland no 85 surface water in the caldera lake fed by snowmelt no 71 and stream water in a watershed with residual snow no 72 thus showing strong effects from winter precipitation type 2 surface water thus was strongly affected by precipitation at the time of sampling and by the surrounding environment samples of type 1 surface water plotted almost on the same line as type 1 spring water fig 6b supporting a common groundwater source during baseflow periods most spring waters had higher isotopic compositions than surface waters suggestive of lower elevations in their recharge areas the wide seasonal variations of the isotopic compositions of wet precipitation are reflected in the isotopic variations of wetland water but these variations are moderated by infiltration from type 2 groundwater in perched aquifers to the type 1 groundwater in andesite lava precipitation from different seasons appears to blend during underground infiltration and subsequent flow 4 3 hydrochemistry na was the dominant cation and cl the dominant anion in most of the waters in the study area appendix table a 1 which thus was classified as nacl type when plotted on a trilinear piper diagram almost none were of the cahco3 type typical of freshwater fig 7 wet precipitation had dissolved ion concentrations that varied greatly with the location and season similar to their isotopic compositions with na the dominant cation and cl the dominant anion appendix table a 2 although precipitation at the town office and the gakkohgawa dam sites had na and cl concentrations that were more than 10 times higher in winter than in summer the cl na ratio 1 71 0 12 was consistently close to that of seawater 1 80 likewise the concentration of mg2 the second most abundant cation in seawater was high in winter precipitation the cl mg2 ratio 14 8 14 2 in wet precipitation although it varied widely on average was almost the same as that of seawater 14 9 because the main component of ssas has the same ionic composition as seawater lewis and schwartz 2004 it is evident that ssas contribute significantly to groundwater and surface water in this area these well waters had cl concentrations 27 3 and 22 1 mg l and na concentrations 15 3 and 10 0 mg l three times higher than the annual precipitation weighted cl and na concentrations 7 02 and 4 00 mg l respectively of precipitation at the nearby town office site these even exceeded the highest cl and na concentrations in winter precipitation at the town office 20 8 and 11 3 mg l respectively the wetland water samples in the yoshideyama area had δ18o and δ2h values showing the influence of precipitation during spring to autumn when the ssa concentration was low however their average cl and na concentrations 10 9 and 6 1 mg l respectively exceeded both the annual precipitation weighted concentrations 3 07 and 1 76 mg l respectively and the concentrations in winter precipitation 7 5 9 4 and 4 4 5 7 mg l respectively at the nearby gakkohgawa dam these results indicates that groundwater and surface water contain cl and na derived from airborne sea salt in addition to wet precipitation winds are strong during winter in coastal areas fig 5 the average daily wind speed at sakata is 3 m s in summer which corresponds to the generation of whitecaps and 6 m s in winter often reaching 7 to 11 m s speeds at which large sea salt particles are injected into the marine boundary layer o dowd et al 1997 considering this wind information it is evident that in the study area ssas deposited on trees and soil especially during winter dissolve in wet precipitation and enter the groundwater the high ssa contribution characterizing waters of this area is consistent with the isotopic evidence showing a strong contribution from winter precipitation therefore well waters with very high cl and na concentrations are derived from precipitation with high ssa concentrations in the coastal hills on the trilinear diagram wetland waters have much larger proportions of na k and cl and smaller ca2 proportions than groundwater and surface water samples indicating strong contributions of wet precipitation and airborne ssas fig 7 type 2 waters are comparatively rich in nacl owing to the ssa component although the proportions of na k and cl are smaller than those of wetland waters type 1 waters are lower in cl and higher in ca2 and hco3 than type 2 waters chokai andesite is much richer in ca than in na k fig 7 the compositional difference among water types indicates that as precipitation infiltrates into the volcanic sediments and underlying lava a large amount of ca is dissolved through chemical weathering by carbonic acid and organic acids this process accounts for the characteristics of type 1 groundwater flowing in andesite lava as opposed to type 2 groundwater in volcanic sediments originating partly from wetland water that is strongly affected by atmospheric deposition thus the chemical differences in groundwater between shallow perched aquifers in volcanic sediments and deep aquifers in lava are consistent with the isotopic results 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of snowmelt water to groundwater annual precipitation weighted δ18o and δ2h values at the town office and the gakkohgawa dam sites align with those of precipitation at akita and ajigasawa where long term monthly data are reported fig 6b type 1 water has d values above this line indicating a greater contribution from winter precipitation winter snowfall in the western caldera area above 1000 m elevation is estimated to account for half of the annual rainfall tsuchiya 1983 but has not been measured data from lower sites show that the ratio of winter december february precipitation to annual precipitation ranges from 0 23 to 0 28 at kamikusazu sakata and gakkohgawa dam in southwestern chokai appendix table a 3 where daily and monthly precipitations are well correlated fig 4 even if the winter period extends to november march the ratio of winter to annual precipitation is less than half 0 40 0 45 at the three sites appendix table a 3 changes of monthly precipitation amounts at the high elevation sites of sannotaki and ohdaira where precipitation data are available only for june october are similar to those of the low elevation sites and the correlation with precipitation at each site is strong fig 4 it is likely from these results that the contribution of winter precipitation to type 1 water is not strongly affected by the proportion of snow to rainfall snowfall is uncommon from may to october even at high elevations the weighted δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation from may to october 2011 at the three precipitation sites decrease with increasing elevation indicating an altitude effect fig 6b each value lies near the summer precipitation line at these sites may october precipitation amounts to about half the annual total 0 49 0 55 in appendix table a 3 thus the precipitation amount from november to april including winter is likewise almost half the annual total if groundwater is formed from precipitation only from november to april the precipitation weighted d value during this period is 21 1 in akita and 21 8 in ajigasawa which are in close agreement with the d values av 21 33 of type 1 groundwaters given that type 1 water is contributed by precipitation during all seasons this result indicates that snow rich winter precipitation more effectively infiltrates groundwater than rainwater during other seasons the average d value of type 1 spring water 21 33 is high and does not share the large seasonal variation of precipitation the subsurface infiltration effect of snowmelt relative to that of rainwater or snowmelt efficiency fsnow can be evaluated by comparing the precipitation weighted d values assuming that precipitation during the snow season is snow and precipitation during other seasons is rain if the ratio of precipitation amount rpa during the snowfall season to the total precipitation amount is frpa s and the ratio of precipitation during other seasons is frps ns then fsnow is 1 fsnow 21 33 σdns frps ns σds frps s where ds and dns are the d values of precipitation during the snowfall and non snowfall periods respectively the value of fsnow is unity when the subsurface infiltration effects of snow and rain are the same assuming that the snowfall season extends from december to february fsnow is 2 28 at the town office and 2 50 at gakkohgawa dam both are higher than the values of 2 26 for akita and 1 62 for ajigasawa but even the latter two sites have fsnow values well above unity the ratio of precipitation amount during this period to annual precipitation is 0 21 at akita and 0 29 at ajigasawa corresponding to those of the two sites in the study area this correspondence supports our assessment of snowmelt efficiency for type 1 water from long term monthly data for both sites an fsnow value of 2 0 suggests that snow has twice the subsurface infiltration efficiency of rain even if precipitation from november to march is assumed to be entirely snowfall the fsnow value is 1 75 at akita and 1 42 at ajigasawa these results suggest that the effect of snow on groundwater recharge exceeds that of rain by at least 40 and in some cases is about twice as much in areas with a large seasonal variation of precipitation d values the subsurface infiltration effect of snow on rain which was difficult to estimate in previous studies earman et al 2006 winograd et al 1998 can be evaluated quantitatively in contrast at cheju island south of the sea of japan the isotopic composition of groundwater nearly equals the mean precipitation weighted annual isotopic composition despite precipitation having a large seasonal variation in d values as at chokai lee et al 1999 this island is mainly composed of highly permeable basalt which allows even strong rains to easily percolate chokai volcano is covered with vegetation from late spring to autumn and rainwater during this season returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration as in other areas including cheju island lee et al 1999 however in chokai s largely of andesite lava with low hydraulic conductivity rainfall heavier than 50 mm per hour which sometimes occurs during summer to autumn is likely to generate surface runoff that directly discharges into streams in contrast snow more easily penetrates the ground than rainwater because it melts gradually and releases water slowly rainfall infiltrating through snowpack also penetrates the ground more readily further studies are needed to quantify permeability in these different circumstances but it is clear at chokai volcano that winter snow more effectively infiltrates groundwater than rainfall 5 2 recharge area 5 2 1 recharge elevation index of spring water the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation at gakkohgawa dam which is weighted by precipitation amount over the 2010 2011 year are lower than those of precipitation at the town office at lower elevation fig 6b the precipitation weighted isotopic compositions during the period may october decreases as the site elevation rises from the town office to gakkohgawa dam to ohdaira from a to c respectively in fig 6b reflecting the effect of altitude on the δ18o and δ2h values of wet precipitation however the δ18o δ2h and d values of the two coastal well water samples average 8 31 45 3 and 21 2 respectively differ from those of the annual weighted precipitation at the nearby town office 8 15 51 1 and 14 0 respectively the no3 concentration of this well water 50 mg l is extremely high appendix table a 1 indicating that it is strongly influenced by the chemical fertilizers mukherjee and singh 2022 used on the vegetable farms in the coastal hills thus well water is clearly recharged locally although the recharge elevation of the well water 40 m is close to that of the precipitation site 27 m the notable difference between the isotopic compositions of the two waters suggests isotopic fractionation during the underground infiltration of precipitation in the study area the use of spring waters from small basins mulligan et al 2011 yasuhara et al 1997 yasuhara et al 2017 rather than precipitation is suitable for estimating the recharge elevation of groundwater we determined the watershed elevation range for mountain foot spring waters at five sites nos 16 17 18 20 21 and 27 in fig 2a and appendix fig a 1 fig 8 shows the relationship between the average elevation ae in meters of six small watersheds fivc spring waters and one coastal well water and the δ18o in δ2h in cl concentration in mg l and electrical conductivities ecs in μs cm of their groundwaters in the groundwater of these watersheds δ18o and δ2h decreased by 0 21 and 1 63 per 100 m respectively similar to rates determined elsewhere clark and fritz 1997 the watershed aes of groundwater at six sites was related to δ18o and δ2h in the groundwater by 2 ae 472 08 δ18o 4040 4 r2 0 96 3 ae 61 388 δ2h 2908 9 r2 0 96 ae was related to the cl concentration cl by 4 ae 1 9058 104cl 1 7651 r 2 0 99 or by 5 ae 1795 exp 0 14318 cl r 2 0 93 the cl concentrations of rainwater and associated groundwater are known to decrease as a power function of distance from the coast bresciani et al 2014 in the study area the cl concentration was about 25 mg l in well water about 500 m from the coast and about 10 mg l in the spring water and type 2 surface water of the yoshideyama area about 10 km from the coast in contrast the cl concentrations of mountain foot spring waters tended to decrease with increasing elevation being higher than 11 mg l at elevations below 100 m 5 14 mg l at 100 500 m and below 5 mg l above 1000 m appendix table a 1 the generation of ssas which delivers airborne cl and na increases with wind speed over the ocean and the maritime distribution of ssas declines steeply with altitude being a factor of 10 smaller at 2 km altitude murphy et al 2019 thus ssas appear to decrease exponentially with altitude over the ocean but whether this is true over land areas is unclear from may to september when the wind off the sea of japan was weak the cl concentration in wet precipitation was similar at the town office and gakkohgawa dam sites 0 5 3 mg l which differ in distance from the coast by 6 km and in elevation by about 180 m but was less than 0 5 mg l at the ohdaira site at 999 m elevation appendix table a 2 the contribution of ssas to chokai volcano although strong in winter decreases with elevation and distance from the coast regardless of the season resulting in an exponential or power law decrease of cl concentrations in spring waters with elevation because the water in this area is of the nacl type with a high ssa component the ecs of spring waters in small watersheds also decreased with elevation as 6 ae 8 4152105ecsw 1 7899 r 2 0 90 or 7 ae 990 79 exp 0 011951ec r 2 0 58 this relationship is consistent with the increase in precipitation and the decrease of the ssa contribution with increasing elevation the average recharge elevations ares of groundwater obtained from each equation are listed in appendix table a 5 it is reasonable to estimate the are value of groundwater from the cl concentration and ec value using equations 4 and 6 which are strongly correlated with ae however despite having only one site to estimate ae at elevations above 500 m even small changes in the cl concentration or ec value result in large changes in ae values fig 8c d this indicates that the reliability of the ae value estimated from the cl concentration and ec value becomes lower at elevations above 600 700 m because of this uncertainty in the altitudinal change in ssas we also estimated ares of groundwater using equation 5 based on the strong correlation of cl concentration with ae 5 2 2 evaluation of the recharge elevation index of spring water the isotopic compositions and dissolved ion concentrations in spring waters from the end of the lava flow are variable differing by more than the analytical errors even at the same site the six samples of spring water from the dohhara waterfall no 14 have an exceptionally wide variation of 0 86 in δ18o 4 in δ2h 1 92 mg l in cl concentration and 8 3 μs cm in ec corresponding to variations in are of 406 246 169 and 148 m respectively nevertheless the averages of the are values for the six samples estimated from δ18o δ2h cl concentration and ec are much more consistent 636 624 591 and 569 m respectively indicating that are values for a site are more reliably determined by the average of multiple samples than single samples the ares for type 1 spring water estimated using δ18o and δ2h range from 200 to 1200 m and the two are values differ by no more than 100 m for individual samples fig 9 a likewise the ares for spring water estimated using cl concentrations and ecs are nearly the same fig 9b except for high elevation sites where these estimates have low reliability however the are values at a given site differ depending on the indicator used most are values for the mountain foot springs range from 300 to 700 m in the yoshideyama area corresponding to differences of 1 08 in δ18o 9 02 to 10 10 5 96 in δ2h 52 31 to 58 27 5 15 mg l in cl concentration 12 71 to 7 56 mg l and 25 6 μs cm in ec 84 4 to 58 8 μs cm the analytical errors for δ18o 0 2 and δ2h 1 correspond to elevation errors of 94 m and 61 m respectively whereas the analytical error for cl concentration 5 corresponds to an elevation error of about 30 m because spring waters with ares lower than 700 m are predominant in the study area cl concentrations and ec values are more sensitive to elevation than δ18o and δ2h in these low elevation areas where their values change markedly fig 8 because type 1 surface water is very similar to type 1 groundwater both in terms of water isotopic compositions fig 6 and water qualities fig 7 δ18o δ2h cl concentration and ec value in surface water can support estimates of the average watershed elevation awe at a given site the awes estimated from the four indicators appendix table a 5 were almost the same for the two type 1 waters although the agreement was poorer for stream water than for spring water fig 9 this close agreement reflects the fact that type 1 stream water represents base flow in which the groundwater component is dominant however for type 2 waters the agreement of ares or awes from the different indicators was less good values based on δ18o were generally lower than those based on δ2h fig 9a summer precipitation owing to its low d values had larger δ18o than δ2h values compared to annual average precipitation fig 6b accordingly samples of type 2 water with a large contribution of summer rainwater had higher are or awe values from δ18o than from δ2h the agreement between are and awe values based on cl concentrations eq 4 and on ec values eq 6 was poor fig 9b similar to δ18o and δ2h we attribute this difference to ssa concentrations and ec values of precipitation being lower in summer than winter appendix table a 2 most of the waters for which the ares and awes vary with different indicators show the influence of rainfall in the season when the water was sampled such as type 2 surface waters since δ18o and δ2h are both indicators based on water molecules they yield closely consistent are values fig 9a however because the δ2h values of type 1 waters vary over a smaller range than δ18o values in the study area fig 6b it is preferable to estimate are or awe from δ2h rather than δ18o as is commonly done for type 1 water the are and awe values based on cl concentrations eq 4 agree well with those based on ec value eq 6 except at high elevations where both indicators have low sensitivity fig 9b of the two equations based on cl concentration equation 5 is more sensitive at high elevations than equation 4 fig 8c for type 1 water from the western low elevation area within about 4 km of the coast are values obtained from cl concentrations eq 5 are clearly lower than those from δ2h fig 9c suggesting that one indicator alone is inaccurate in estimating are or awe the average are or awe values for type 1 water obtained from combined δ2h and cl concentrations eqs 3 and 5 agree well with those based on all four indicators eqs 2 3 4 and 6 as shown by the tightly clustered data points in fig 9d these values of type 2 water in the yoshideyama area are only about 100 m higher than those of the sample site appendix table a 5 this is consistent with the origin of type 2 water described in section 2 4 in a perched aquifer near the sample site furthermore despite the large contribution of precipitation during the sampling season the average awe values of most wetland waters obtained from δ2h and cl concentrations are within about 150 m of the sampling site elevation appendix table a 5 these results indicate that the combined use of two indicators eqs 3 and 5 or four indicators eqs 2 3 4 and 6 is most effective for estimating the elevations of groundwater recharge and source watersheds of surface waters the are and awe values from the two indicators eqs 3 and 5 agree closely in the yoshideyama area and the western caldera area at high elevations fig 9c because this area lies within a narrow range of distance from the coast 8 11 km but contains a large range of elevations 1800 m this agreement indicates the strong elevation dependence of water vapor and ssas that inference is consistent with the view of kirchner et al 2010 that cl concentrations and water isotopic compositions in stream water can be used as conservative tracers in catchments due to their similar behaviors chloride ion concentrations in atmospheric deposition decrease rapidly as a power function of distance from the coast reported in some cases to be nearly constant at about 10 km bresciani et al 2014 in the marine boundary layer the amount of ssas is well correlated with that of water vapor with both decreasing with altitude murphy et al 2019 it is likely then that in mountains near the sea where both ssa contributions and elevation differences are large the concentration of cl in precipitation decreases with altitude 5 2 3 recharge area of spring water in yoshideyama area the are values for spring waters from the end of the lava flow in the yoshideyama area are 219 697 m from δ18o 302 631 m from δ2h 291 591 m from cl concentration and 300 574 m from ec they signify that the spring water is recharged mainly from the gently sloping area below 700 m elevation in the fan formed by the minaminokomai and mansukedo lava flows figs 2 and 3 fig 10 shows the average recharge area of the spring waters assuming that the flow direction is parallel to that of the lava flow these are values ranged from 300 to 600 m the mean awe value estimated from δ2h and cl eqs 3 and 5 in the minaminokomai stream which flows on the east side of the yoshideyama area is 1064 m at the upstream site 490 m elevation and 1128 m at the downstream site 140 m elevation fig 10 in the minamiore stream which flows on the northwest side the awe is 898 m at the upstream site 626 m elevation and 660 m at the downstream site 114 m elevation even at their lowest sites both streams have awe values higher than the highest are values of the mountain foot spring water in the yoshideyama area even at their lowest sites both streams have awe values higher than the highest are values of the mountain foot spring water in the yoshideyama area these results indicate that recharge from both streams to the lava aquifer in the yoshideyama area is small at most both streams flow through eroded lava and recharge from the minaminokomai stream to the yoshideyama aquifer is unlikely below 400 m elevation because the valley there is deeper than 100 m the geomorphology and the water quality of the uppermost surface water of the yoshideyama area support the view that the yoshideyama foothill springs are mainly recharged from the lower reaches of the minaminokomai and mansukedo lava flows below 700 m elevation the hydraulic conductivity of andesite in a volcano varies greatly depending on many factors including age and the distribution of pyroclastic rocks lava flows weathering and hydrothermal alteration asai et al 2009 toulier et al 2019 vittecoq et al 2019 nonetheless the yoshideyama area and the upper western caldera are composed largely of lava flows younger than 20 ka and their geochemical and physical properties are homogeneous these simple geological conditions are probably the reason why the awe of streams and the are of springs are separated by topography in areas such as the yoshideyama area i e at similar distances from the coast cl concentrations ec values and water isotopic compositions can be used together to identify groundwater recharge elevations with a high degree of accuracy further improving the accuracy of these methods requires comprehensive studies that include topographical and geological data as well as water quality indicators the springs in the mountain foot groups are close to each other in location and elevation suggesting that they share the same aquifer however in the west springs the δ18o δ2h cl concentration and ec values increase at three sites from west to east they increase even more in the drainage from the quarry about 200 m east of the easternmost spring in this group accordingly the are value decreases eastward in the west springs discharging from the same lava flow fig 10 in the south springs these indicator values tend to increase between the western site and the eastern dohhara waterfalls site with a decrease in the middle although the watershed of each spring water cannot be specified from the topography like the surface streams these differences in water quality even at similar elevations suggest that groundwater generated by infiltration into the lava flow at different areas is not fully mixed within the aquifer before it is discharged of the springs in this area the dohhara waterfall spring issuing from the lava cave is unique in that it has the largest volume of water and the greatest variation in water quality the velocity of the groundwater in the large fissures here must be much higher than in the lava voids elsewhere the are of this spring about 600 m lies near the narrow area where the minamiore minaminokomai and the kokesawa streams diverge and these surface waters may enter the lava through volcanic sediments the groundwater originating from these streams mixes with groundwater derived from precipitation at the lower elevation which may explain the large fluctuations in the water quality of the dohhara spring if this is the case and for the conservation of the dohhara spring misuda 2018 it is necessary to evaluate the contribution from these stream waters at around 600 m to the lava aquifer in the yoshideyama area 5 3 formation model of spring water from the fractures in andesite lava even outside the yoshideyama area most ares of type 1 spring waters are below 700 m whereas the awe of major rivers is above 600 m even in the plains fig 10 this result is consistent with the fact that on chokai volcano the headwaters of 32 rivers extend up to an average elevation of about 1300 m and a maximum of 2100 m the volcano s southern slope has a topographical inflection around 600 700 m elevation with steep slopes above and gentle slopes below figs 2 and 3 because the upper slopes consist largely of andesite lava with low permeability precipitation at those elevations is less likely to infiltrate and more likely to flow over bedrock and thin sediments this difference in surface environment appears to explain the difference between the high awe values of rivers and the low are values of mountain foot springs because the highlands tend to shed precipitation as runoff without penetrating deep into the subsurface river water in the plains has a higher source elevation even when spring water mixes with it in the foothills in contrast the gentle slope at lower elevations has many recesses and deposits of large lava masses and sediments which provide favorable environments for infiltration wetlands are more likely to form in the presence of less permeable sediments and perched aquifers form in sediment layers beneath wetlands and above impermeable lava surfaces many voids in quaternary andesitic lavas farquharson et al 2015 yokoyama and takeuchi 2009 are connected to large and small cracks and can become aquifers it is likely that type 2 perched groundwater in volcanic sediments infiltrates into voids and small cracks in the lava sometimes through larger cracks such as joints and discharges as type 1 spring water through large cracks and clinker at the end of lava flows fig 11 this view would also explain why type 1 waters from andesitic lavas have smaller variability and higher ca2 and hco3 concentrations than the type 2 waters of perched aquifer origin in volcanic sediments considering basalt volcanoes with high permeability it has been reported that local perched aquifers lie above impermeable layers at high altitudes in the hawaiian islands ingebritsen and scholl 1993 elsewhere a continuous basal aquifer from high to low elevations has been proposed for the canary islands custodio 2007 and a discontinuous aquifer regardless of elevation for mayotte island lachassagne et al 2014 although our study area has few high elevation examples the west and south springs in the yoshideyama area are located at almost the same elevation fig 3 given the porosity of quaternary andesite lava about 10 on average farquharson et al 2015 yokoyama and takeuchi 2009 these foothill springs are likely to constitute a continuous basal aquifer fig 11 the differences in are values within the west or south springs fig 10 indicate that they vary in their recharge areas or their mix of sources groundwater in lava exists in highly permeable fractures or low permeability interstitial voids if the fractures are well connected to each other groundwater mixing will increase and the water quality in the aquifer will become homogeneous however the difference in spring water quality at different sites suggests that groundwater flows through fractures discharge without thorough mixing in the lava aquifer this difference is rather consistent with the model by lachassagne et al 2014 in which aquifers are discontinuous and separated by aquicludes the observations at the quarry may suggest that the fractured and surrounding weathered andesites with their high porosities may function as an aquifer and the surrounding fresh andesite as an impermeable layer as shown in fig 11 mountain foot spring water discharges from basal aquifers in lava flows that receive infiltrating wet precipitation at different elevations on gentle slopes type 1 groundwater from different elevations that infiltrated through sediment layers would contribute to the basal aquifer but to a degree that varies depending on the spring these differences may account for the observed variation in water quality and are values the discontinuity of the basal aquifer within the lava suggests that the groundwater resource is limited lachassagne et al 2014 this suggestion is consistent with the finding in section 2 3 that most of the daily discharges of mountain foot springs are as low as 10 to 102 t even with high annual precipitation of about 3000 mm the lower slopes of chokai volcano are limited in groundwater resources indicating that this area is susceptible to environmental changes on the east side of the quarry groundwater from higher elevations appears to flow south southwest through the lava accordingly the extension of quarrying to the east could damage the lava aquifer and decrease the discharge of the south springs at lower elevation which are in urgent need of conservation misuda 2018 further the removal of sediments overlying lava by quarrying could reduce infiltration into bedrock and adversely affect the sustainability of wetlands which play an important role in hydrological processes hayashi et al 2016 and ecosystem services de groot et al 2018 the impact of climate change on groundwater resources is an acute concern in places such as the middle east and the southwestern united states where aquifers depend on mountain snow famiglietti 2014 wu et al 2020 this concern is heightened by the growing knowledge that snowmelt infiltrates more effectively than rainwater snowfall amount decreases as altitude decreases in the annapurna range in the nepal himalaya putkonen 2004 snowfall in japan is predicted to decrease at lower elevations where temperatures are higher kawase 2019 kawase et al 2013 2020 yamaguchi et al 2011 the lower parts of lava flows which are the main recharge area of the mountain foot springs cover a larger area than the upper slopes and are more susceptible to a decrease in snowfall a decrease in snowfall would add to the effect of quarrying on these springs with a limited groundwater resource 6 conclusions we classified spring waters and surface waters on the southwest side of chokai volcano into type 1 derived from groundwater in lava with low permeability and type 2 derived from perched aquifers in soil and sediments above the lava both waters are of the nacl type and have high d values due to large snowfall and ssa contributions in winter but type 1 water has smaller variations in water quality and higher ca concentrations derived from the andesite lava we used chloride ion and electrical conductivity in addition to water isotopic compositions to examine the recharge zones of foothill springs and the hydrologic processes from precipitation to groundwater in the yoshideyama area where both types of water are widely distributed the evidence shows that type 1 spring waters at the foot of the mountain are recharged from the area of gentle slopes downstream from the lava compared to higher areas with steep slopes and thin sediments the gentle slopes with large areas and thick sediment deposits in the troughs of lava waves are more favorable for infiltration of rainwater and especially snowmelt that feeds the foothill springs snowfall contribution to groundwater was estimated to be several 10 to twice as high as rainfall in mountainous areas at similar distances from the coast the combination of cl concentrations and water isotopic compositions yields a more accurate estimate of groundwater recharge elevations the water quality and are of the foothill springs vary locally even where the discharge elevations are similar and the groundwater appears to undergo minimal exchange of water between permeable fractures in the lava the linkage though unclear between fast flow in the fractures and slow groundwater in the lava voids is an important hydrogeological aspect of lava aquifers this study clarifies the role of hitherto undocumented factors affecting groundwater in fractured andesitic lava in cold regions such as the form of precipitation rain or snow and the presence and permeability of sediment overlying the lava for the sustainable use of groundwater from snow topped andesitic volcanoes the effects on the water cycle of land alteration and precipitation changes due to global warming need to be comprehensively studied with consideration of local geology topography and meteorology future monitoring of mountain foot springs and rain and snow along with detailed petrographic investigation of volcanic sections by boring will help clarify the hydrology of groundwater in lava with its many unknowns as well as the

3142,studied region chokai volcano is composed of low permeability andesite lava a snowfall influenced hydrological setting that has been little studied study focus snowfall there is expected to decrease due to climate change and expanded quarrying along its southern foot to evaluate the effects of future environmental changes on the groundwater discharged from springs at the feet of lava flows which is used for agriculture and domestic purposes we used isotopic hadrochemical geologic meteorological and topographic information to elucidate the recharge area major recharge season and underground flow of spring waters and surface waters at chokai new hydrogeological insights for the region groundwater and surface water are of nacl type with high deuterium excess values indicating a strong contribution of atmospheric deposition of sea salt aerosols during winter altitude indicators based on water h and o isotopic compositions and chloride ion concentrations suggest that the foothill springs are recharged mainly on gentle slopes below 700 m elevation this area is generally covered with volcanic sediments which contain wetlands and perched aquifers that continuously supply groundwater to the underlying lava through fractures and voids without thorough mixing in the lava aquifer anticipated decreases in snowfall and the removal of surface rocks may adversely affect not only the foothill springs supplied by snowmelt and the rice cultivation that depends on them but also the wetland ecosystem keywords groundwater volcano recharge elevation water isotopic composition snow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction climate change associated with global warming is expected to reduce snowfall and accelerate the melting of snow in mountains at mid to high latitudes where snowfall is the main source of surface water leading to reduced groundwater recharge and adverse agricultural effects barnett et al 2005 fyfe et al 2017 however the regional impacts on climate change vary with some regions expected to see reduced snowfall bormann et al 2018 and others to see increased annual precipitation and a corresponding increase in groundwater recharge wu et al 2020 in snow rich areas where cities and agricultural users rely on groundwater from mountains hydrological information on the area and periods of recharge is essential for the sustainable use of groundwater volcanic mountains offer groundwater investigations a distinctive set of research problems groundwater at the foot of a volcano flows out to the surface as gravitational flow or artesian water many groundwater studies have been conducted on marine volcanic islands where surface water resources are scarce and sustainable water uses are needed hydrogeological models of basaltic volcanoes have been presented for the hawaiian islands ingebritsen and scholl 1993 canary islands custodio 2007 and mayotte island lachassagne et al 2014 and have been refined for other basaltic volcanoes where the recharge of groundwater has been characterized using the h and o isotopic compositions of precipitation alongside hydrometeorological data bertrand et al 2010 hildenbrand et al 2005 lee et al 1999 prada et al 2016 scholl et al 1996 scholl et al 2002 although there is comparatively little research on andesitic volcanoes which are typical of island arcs and continental margins groundwater studies have also incorporated various hydrogeochemical methods such as the h and o isotopic compositions of groundwater parisi et al 2011 toulier et al 2019 however because most groundwater studies in volcanic settings focus on tropical and warm regions the contribution of snowfall to groundwater has not yet been fully evaluated at volcanoes lava clinker fissures tuff breccia and scoria with generally high permeability serve as aquifers and fine grained volcanic ash and lake sediments as impermeable layers hahn et al 1997 kumai 1982 parisi et al 2011 toulier et al 2019 however the distributions of these features are uneven and vary depending on the volcano compared to basaltic lava andesitic lava is more compact and less permeable except for fractures andesitic lavas of quaternary age have porosities of 5 70 and estimated hydraulic conductivities of about 10 16 10 10 m2 farquharson et al 2015 yokoyama and takeuchi 2009 nonetheless groundwater flow in lava settings which is controlled by different factors affecting permeability such as the distributions of voids and large and small cracks as well as their mutual relationships is poorly known many case studies are required to construct hydrogeological models of volcanoes custodio 2007 but few studies have addressed groundwater processes i e from recharge to flow to discharge at andesitic volcanoes especially those dominated by lava in addition to variations in volcanic materials environmental factors affecting groundwater recharge at volcanoes such as weather vegetation and soil moisture vary greatly depending on elevation season and topography wet precipitation is generally abundant at high elevations and in summer evapotranspiration is strong due to active vegetation and surface runoff during heavy rainfall whereas in winter evapotranspiration is low and snow is abundant earman et al 2006 lee et al 1999 parisi et al 2011 because snow melts slowly it penetrates the subsurface more effectively than rain and makes a greater contribution to groundwater recharge earman et al 2006 winograd et al 1998 however the geochemistry of groundwater is generally stable whereas precipitation has large temporal variations moreover snow unlike rainfall changes its δ18o and δ2h values until it melts earman et al 2006 these findings show that other methods in addition to the h and o isotopic compositions of water need to be explored to estimate the area and season of volcanic groundwater recharge chloride ions cl are a conservative tracer and although the chloride mass balance method has widely been used to estimate groundwater recharge bresciani et al 2014 but it has rarely been combined with h and o isotopic data the sustainable use of groundwater at snow laden andesitic volcanoes which are poorly studied requires hydrogeological models integrating meteorological topographical and a wide range of hydrochemical data the japanese archipelago is a typical island arc and its 107 volcanoes which account for 7 of the world s active volcanoes erupt mainly andesite average annual rainfall in japan is 1700 mm about twice the world average and 62 of japan s land area is in cold regions receiving abundant snow chokai volcano a quaternary stratovolcano producing dominantly basaltic andesite lava flows hayashi 1984a is in northeastern japan along the sea of japan a climatic zone that receives heavy winter snowfall fig 1 this zone is the center of rice cultivation in japan and most irrigation water originates from mountain snowmelt as global warming proceeds the amount of snowfall in japan is predicted to decrease in low elevations but remain unchanged or increase at high elevations at temperatures far below freezing kawase 2019 kawase et al 2020 yamaguchi et al 2011 flood damage caused by rain on snow events is also highly dependent on elevation freudiger et al 2014 and is expected to increase with global warming ohba and kawase 2020 thus identifying recharge elevations and assessing the contribution of snow to foothill springs is indispensable for sustainable groundwater use chokai volcano is designated as a quasi national park and its few inhabitants exert almost no influence on groundwater and river water in these aspects chokai is a suitable site for hydrogeological studies of groundwater at snow laden and lava dominant andesitic volcanoes however although hydrochemical precipitation data are important for identifying groundwater recharge areas the heavy winter snowfall at chokai makes it difficult to collect continuous precipitation data in the highlands where year round meteorological observations are not conducted this difficulty can be overcome by the method of mulligan et al 2011 and yasuhara et al 1997 yasuhara et al 2017 which identifies groundwater recharge areas in the mountains by analyzing the h and o isotopic compositions of spring waters in small watersheds with short flow paths nonetheless previous studies employing the isotopic compositions of water have shown a rain shadow effect in which the origin of water vapor in the mountains differs between the windward and leeward sides scholl et al 1996 scholl et al 2002 in studies of inland japanese volcanoes the isotopic compositions of precipitation and spring water differ considerably depending on the slope direction asai et al 2009 yasuhara et al 1997 yasuhara et al 2017 we focused our study on the southwestern slope of chokai fig 1 where this meteorological and topographical effect is considered minimal this paper presents h and o isotopic compositions and major dissolved ion concentrations including cl of spring water well water surface water wetland water and precipitation in this area by analyzing these data together with geological geomorphological and meteorological information we then elucidate 1 the main recharge season and 2 the mean recharge elevation area for foothill springs and 3 the groundwater quality formation process we integrate the obtained results to propose a conceptual hydrogeological model of chokai volcano and evaluate the effect of snow and land modification on foothill springs 2 target area and hydrogeological information 2 1 target area agriculture and other human activities are significant in the plains and adjoining gentle slope southwest of chokai in yuza town in yamagata prefecture where surface water derived from copious springs at the feet of lava flows is widely used as irrigation and drinking water fig 2 a the yoshideyama area south southwest of chokai is representative of mountain foot springs fig 2b there springs emerge at the tips of lava flows in many places one of these the dohhara waterfall is a tourist attraction and high quality water source with an annual discharge of about one million tons scattered wetlands and surface waters in the thick volcanic sediments that mantle the gentle slopes of lava flows are associated with groundwater flowing from perched aquifers these areas support an invaluable ecosystem comprising many plants and animals including bears and endangered species such as the tree frog zhangixalus arboreus for these reasons the yoshideyama area is designated as a forest conservation area in yamagata prefecture at the quarry in the western part of the yoshideyama area spring water flows from cracks in the exposed lavas the impact of expanded quarrying on the aquifer is of concern to the downstream area where groundwater from the lava is used for drinking and irrigation misuda 2018 the upper reaches of the yoshideyama area extend to nearly 2000 m elevation and are accessible by road we targeted mainly the yoshideyama area because it is crucial for groundwater conservation and is most appropriate for evaluating the hydrogeological process affecting foothill springs 2 2 geology and geomorphology of chokai volcano chokai volcano 39 05 57 n 140 02 56 e summit elevation 2236 m above sea level is an elliptical stratovolcano 26 km long from east to west and 14 km long from north to south fig 1 its volcanic edifice overlies volcanic and sedimentary rocks of miocene to pleistocene age hayashi 1984a nakano and tsuchiya 1992 the volcano is mainly composed of basaltic andesite lava flows with few high permeability pyroclastic rocks such as scoria and tuff breccia volcanic activity at chokai can be divided into three stages based on eruption age the distribution of volcanic ejecta petrological characteristics and k ar ages ban et al 2001 hayashi 1984a nakano and tsuchiya 1992 stage i activity occurred near the center of the current volcano during 600 160 ka building an ancestral edifice of lava flows stage i volcanic ejecta are exposed in the eastern part of the volcano their volume of 47 km3 represents 64 of the total volume of chokai stage ii materials 160 20 ka are abundant in the western part of the edifice including the study area and cover the basement rock and stage i materials stage ii lavas effused from several craters that contain lava domes formed by post eruption lava intrusions about 90 ka the summit area collapsed forming a horseshoe shaped caldera that opens to the southwest called the western caldera fig 2 stage ii is subdivided into early iia and iib and late activities iic and iid relative to this event stage ii lava flows are thinner than those of stage i being several tens of meters to 100 m thick in general and reaching a maximum thickness of 300 m the total volume of stage ii materials is estimated at 22 km3 stage iii began after 20 ka and includes the most recent activity a phreatic eruption in 1974 hayashi 1984a a horseshoe shaped caldera opening to the north formed in approximately 466 bce mitsutani 2001 when lahars were generated in the northwestern part of the edifice minami et al 2019 stage iii is subdivided into stages iiia and iiib relative to this caldera forming event the volume of stage iii volcanic rocks is 4 3 km3 the summit lava dome shinzan was formed by the latest magmatic eruptions which occurred from 1800 to 1804 ce nakano and tsuchiya 1992 the hydraulic conditions of groundwater and surface water are influenced by topography as well as geology chokai generally has steep slopes 10 above 600 700 m and gentler slopes about 5 at lower elevations fig 3 near the center of the edifice are especially steep slopes about 30 and low permeability dikes uneven lava dominated topography lava levees lava waves is well developed in the stage ii and iii deposits volcanic colluvium in the troughs between lava waves forms an environment suitable for the formation of perched aquifers the lava flows end in cliffs where groundwater issues from clinker and fractures in the lava 2 3 geology and geomorphology of the yoshideyama area the yoshideyama area is southwest of the western caldera fig 2 the downstream part of the area consists of debris flow deposits generated by the caldera forming event hayashi 1984a after the caldera formation the nakanosawa lavas were erupted and flowed southwest from the nabemori crater at 1500 m elevation near the caldera rim these lavas are divided into the minaminokomai lavas stage iic and the mansukedo lava stage iid nakano and tsuchiya 1992 the minaminokomai lavas comprise at least three lava flows each averaging 80 m in thickness atop a tuff breccia hayashi 1984a they extend down to about 300 m elevation in the southwestern area and about 200 m elevation in the southern area the mansukedo lava erupted from the same site covers the minaminokomai lava down to about 500 m elevation and is 20 40 m thick nakano and tsuchiya 1992 both lavas have similar chemical compositions the senjogahara area at the head of the western caldera contains scoria and lava from both eruptive periods the minaminokomai and mansukedo lavas are flanked by two streams the minaminokomai stream on the east and the minamiore stream on the northwest fig 2a 2b the courses of these streams reflect the distribution and topography of two lava flows between 1500 and 650 m elevation both streams run south to southwest separated by 200 300 m this narrow area has an average slope of 18 and contains well developed lava levees and fissures outside the caldera and below about 650 m where the minaminokomai lavas spread into a fan shape the streams diverge and run along or near the fan s edges here we refer to the yoshideyama area as this lower region below 650 m lava waves are well developed on the gentle slopes between 325 and 475 m elevation on the minaminokomai lavas fig 2c volcaniclastic sediments deposited in the troughs of these lava waves reach 30 m in thickness there scattered wetlands occur with areas of about 2000 40 000 m2 the cliff at the lower end of the minaminokomai lavas is topped by a gently sloping plateau like terrain that is locally called mount yoshideyama because it looks like a mountain from the plain below fig 3 2 4 hydrology groundwater and surface water the daily discharge of chokai springs ranges from 10 to 104 t ogasawara 2005 it exceeds 103 t at several sites nos 10 14 and 29 32 in fig 2 but is about 10 102 t at most sites most springs discharge from clinker or fractures at the cliffs at the ends of lava flows at elevations that range from 10 to 500 m but are mostly below 200 m figs 2 3 because these springs yield water of stable temperature and quality they are used not only for daily life and agriculture but also for salmon farming springs in the talus area just below the terminal cliffs of the lava flows produce water with the same origin springs occasionally emerge at higher elevations from lava joints and the scoria layer the springs at the end of the minaminokomai lava flows lie at about 200 m elevation at the southern foot of the flow and 313 325 m elevation at the western foot of the flow they are termed the south springs nos 5 16 in figs 2 3 and the west springs nos 1 4 respectively the dohhara waterfall no 14 in fig 2b discharges from a lava cave east of the south springs at the quarry no 1 fig 2b at the east edge of the west springs sometimes more than 600 l min of water is discharged through a perforated pipe both groups of springs flow south southwest and are used as domestic and agricultural water sources in the quarry lava flows are distributed beneath a layer of volcanic colluvium 20 40 m thick the lower parts of fresh gray andesite lava flows contain bodies of reddish brown weathered andesite 2 to 3 m thick and about 20 m wide groundwater springs issue from fractures with apertures of about 1 cm in the weathered andesite which is more fragile and permeable than fresh andesite we distinguished three water types in this study surface waters of chokai volcano originate mainly from springs in lava flows the depths of the stream cut valleys generally exceed 10 m and sometimes 200 m groundwater from lava bedrock and surface water originating from it are classified as type 1 type 2 waters are spring and surface waters from perched aquifers in the volcanic colluvium that overlie lava flows volcanic clasts larger than 1 m are common below the tips of lava flows suggestive of origins from clinker or other lava masses type 2 waters are present in rock masses and sediments derived from the mansukedo lava flow near the center of yoshideyama at around 450 m elevation figs 2 3 minaminokomai lavas are widely covered with volcanic sediments and small wetlands in the troughs of lava waves around 300 450 m the presence of wetlands indicates the presence of a perched aquifer water at the surface of wetlands was classified as wetland water type wt regardless of the presence or absence of flow in a 30 000 m2 area in the northern and eastern parts of the quarry springs and surface water from perched aquifers type 2 are distributed on steep slopes and surface water in the eastern part of the quarry can be traced to nearby wetlands the type 2 water in the yoshideyama area is derived from the shallow perched aquifers near recharge areas some type 2 surface waters are ephemeral these include surface water flowing in volcanic sediments atop lavas above 1400 m elevations in the western caldera where snow yields meltwater until summer lake chokai no 71 in fig 2a a caldera lake bordered by lava cliffs appeared to be taking in large amounts of snowmelt in the summer when we sampled the lake in the western part of chokai volcano the valley of the ushiwatari river is underdeveloped with a depth less than 5 m stream water there flows over gravel and sediment covering lava flows and was also classified as type 2 surface water 2 5 meteorology precipitation and wind annual wet precipitation near the summit of chokai has been estimated to reach 12 000 mm tsuchiya 1990 in particular the western caldera accumulates abundant snow and it has been estimated that above 1000 m elevation half of the total wet precipitation occurs as snowfall tsuchiya 1983 weather observations in japan by the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas have been conducted at about 1300 locations since 1976 japan meteorological agency 2021 but this heavy snowfall has precluded year round meteorological observations at high elevations on chokai since 2011 daily precipitation has been monitored only from june to october at two high elevation sites on the volcano s southwestern slope by yamagata prefecture yamagata prefecture 2021 sannotaki site 2 in fig 1 752 m elevation and ohdaira site c in fig 1 999 m observations from 2011 to 2020 at 10 stations around chokai fig 1 obtained from amedas and yamagata prefecture show that daily precipitation amounts at the southern sites are strongly correlated with correlation coefficients exceeding 0 8 among the five southwestern most sites 1 2 3 b and c in contrast to weaker correlations 0 6 0 8 among the three northernmost sites fig 4 a this result indicates that the southern slopes of chokai are likely to receive precipitation from almost the same water vapor source monthly precipitation amounts at seven southern sites have similar seasonal variations with peaks in july fig 4b particularly at gakkohgawa dam site b fig 1 and kamikusatsu site 1 where precipitation is recorded throughout the year monthly precipitation changes are similar to those at the high elevation sites sannotaki site 2 and ohdaira site c if the high elevation sites have the same annual precipitation pattern as sites b and 1 then the annual precipitation near the western caldera is estimated to be 7000 mm at 1600 m elevation and 8000 mm near the summit although this is less than the previous estimate of 12 000 mm tsuchiya 1983 it nevertheless represents a considerable amount of precipitation in the form of winter snow at chokai wind direction and speed have been monitored by amedas at two coastal sites sakata site 4 and nikaho site 6 and two inland sites sasunabe site 5 and yajima site 7 fig 1 the predominant winds are northwesterly to southwesterly in coastal areas and northwesterly to westerly in inland areas fig 5 northwesterly to westerly winds become dominant in winter wind speeds are higher in coastal areas than in inland areas and higher in winter december february than in summer june september fig 5 the average speed of northwesterly to southwesterly winds at sakata reaches more than 4 m s these results indicate that the contribution of sea salt aerosols ssas from the sea of japan is strong during the winter in coastal areas 3 research method and analysis we collected samples of spring water stream water and wetland water on the southern slope of chokai volcano mainly during spring to autumn from september 2010 to october 2011 spring water was collected at 38 sites well water at 2 sites stream water at 38 sites during baseflow periods and wetland water at 7 sites wetland water was stagnant except at one site no 79 fig 2b where it was draining from the wetland to investigate changes in water quality at the same location we sampled 25 springs 16 streams and 4 wetlands from two to six times due to its young age chokai volcano has not experienced extensive erosion and most springs do not correspond to a distinct watershed however six spring water sites nos 16 17 18 20 21 and 27 in fig 2 have small watersheds that were characterized using kashmir software sugimoto 2002 the average elevation ae of each watershed was calculated from cross sections and the area enclosed by contour lines at 10 m intervals spring water from the same scoria layer was present in two adjacent locations at 1397 and 1401 m elevation nos 20 and 21 fig 2a which we grouped as one site in addition shallow unconfined wells are scattered at elevations of 10 20 m along the coast of yuza town on the inland side of a set of low hills about 1 km wide and with a maximum elevation of 61 m and an average elevation of about 30 m fig 1 it is clear from the topography and characteristic water quality see section 4 3 that the water in these wells is derived from hill precipitation samples of shallow well water at two sites nos 34 and 35 fig 2a from this slope were grouped as one site because their average recharge elevations were almost the same we estimate the error of the aes for groundwater at individual sites to be within 20 m the watershed information for each spring water and well water is given in appendix fig a 1 we collected wet precipitation samples at about monthly intervals from 2010 to 2011 from three sites fig 1 at different elevations the roof of the town office building at 30 m elevation site a gakkohgawa dam at 211 m elevation site b and ohdaira at 999 m elevation site c although sampling at ohdaira was limited to june to october because snow cover made the site inaccessible at other times sampling at each site followed the acid rain sampling method of the ministry of the environment with the use of a water sampler similar to the acid rain filtration type sampling device advantec acdr047 advantec tokyo japan to prevent contamination the sampler was mounted 2 m above the surface and used a polypropylene funnel with an opening diameter of 200 mm on which a ping pong ball was placed plus a filter of 0 80 μm pore diameter membrane filter a080a047a advantec tokyo japan samples were conveyed to a 20 l plastic container through a 1 5 m long pfa tube the container was covered with a reflector to reduce the internal temperature changes sampled water was filtered using a disposable cellulose acetate filter pore size 0 2 μm dismic25cs020a5 advantec tokyo japan before storing in prewashed polyethylene bottles concentrations of cl no3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k were determined by ion chromatography ic3000 dionex co with analytical accuracy better than 5 concentrations of hco3 were estimated from the difference in the concentrations of total cations and anions the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water were determined by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds using a spectrophotometer l2120i picarro inc isotopic compositions are expressed in permil with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow2 and the analytical uncertainty 1σ was 0 2 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h all analyses were carried out at the research institute for humanity and nature kyoto japan analytical data for groundwater surface water and wetland water are listed in appendix table a 1 data for wet precipitation in appendix table a 2 and monthly precipitation data compiled from daily data at seven sites at chokai in appendix table a 3 4 results 4 1 isotopic compositions of wet precipitation our wet precipitation samples did not show clear seasonal variations in δ18o and δ2h although the deuterium excess value defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was high in winter december march low in summer june august and intermediate in spring and autumn fig 6 a these results are consistent with previous studies according to tanoue et al 2013 seasonal changes in the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation in japan do not always depend on the climate region as classified based on precipitation and hours of sunlight whereas the d value is high in winter and low in summer in all seven of their climate regions our study area lies in the climate region along the sea of japan side in northern japan which includes the akita and ajigasawa observation sites to the north of the study area sites d and e respectively in fig 1 the d value of precipitation shows a distinct seasonal variation in this climate region the large amount of snowfall that characterizes this climate region is derived from water vapor with a very high d value generated by the rapid evaporation of warm seawater in the sea of japan lee et al 1999 pfahl and sodemann 2014 waseda and nakai 1983 in contrast to seasonal changes long term changes in the h and o isotopic values of precipitation in all regions are reported to be small tanoue et al 2013 secular changes in the isotopic compositions of precipitation in the kanto and chubu regions of central japan have not been significant yabusaki et al 2016 monthly average precipitation isotopic compositions have been reported for the periods 1982 1991 in akita kawaraya et al 2000 and 2003 2006 in ajigasawa hasegawa et al 2014 appendix table a 4 these are converted to multi year seasonal changes in fig 6a although this study was for only one year our δ18o and δ2h values are very similar to the long term seasonal averages fig 6a the summer precipitation line δ2h 7 92 δ18o 8 45 for this climate region including the akita and ajigasawa sites is not much different from the global meteoric water line gmwl but it is notably lower than the corresponding winter precipitation line δ2h 8 14 δ18o 26 7 fig 6b therefore the seasonal variation of precipitation d values in this climatic region is sufficiently large to be applied to evaluate the main groundwater recharge periods 4 2 isotopic compositions of groundwater and surface water the h and o isotopic compositions of groundwater and surface water in this study area fall between the values of winter and summer precipitation indicating that these waters are of meteoric origin fig 6a however the compositions differ depending on the water type fig 6b the d values of type 1 spring water and surface water are high and consistent 21 33 1 11 and 21 63 1 60 respectively they distinctly differ from the average d values of summer precipitation 8 45 and are closer to those of winter precipitation 26 7 indicating that winter precipitation is the dominant source except for dohhara waterfall type 1 spring water shows small changes in isotopic compositions especially small changes in δ2h at the same site fig 6b in contrast wetland water sites showed large changes in δ18o and δ2h fig 6b wetlands are rich in aquatic plants but they have few trees and are open to the atmosphere this environment therefore responds sensitively to the direct input of wet precipitation with a wide range of isotopic compositions which explains the large isotopic changes in wetland water most wetland waters had higher δ18o values than nearby springs and surface waters and some had low d values of 15 or less fig 6b this result indicates that wetland water was stagnant such that the surface layer was affected by evaporation and by spring autumn rainfall with low d values the type 2 surface waters in the yoshideyama area had lower average d values 16 4 than type 1 surface waters because there were no wetlands upstream from these sample locations except for two samples nos 65 and 66 fig 2b these low d values did not reflect evaporation but the contribution of precipitation during spring to autumn when the water was sampled this interpretation is consistent with the ephemeral occurrence of type 2 surface waters which originated from perched aquifers four samples of type 2 surface water nos 69 72 fig 2a and one wetland water no 85 fig 2a collected at elevations above 1100 m in summer had δ18o 10 5 indicative of high elevations of these two samples nos 69 and 70 had low d values 12 4 and 13 4 respectively indicating a strong contribution from summer precipitation the other three samples nos 71 72 and 85 had high d values 21 4 25 6 they were surface water from a snow covered wetland no 85 surface water in the caldera lake fed by snowmelt no 71 and stream water in a watershed with residual snow no 72 thus showing strong effects from winter precipitation type 2 surface water thus was strongly affected by precipitation at the time of sampling and by the surrounding environment samples of type 1 surface water plotted almost on the same line as type 1 spring water fig 6b supporting a common groundwater source during baseflow periods most spring waters had higher isotopic compositions than surface waters suggestive of lower elevations in their recharge areas the wide seasonal variations of the isotopic compositions of wet precipitation are reflected in the isotopic variations of wetland water but these variations are moderated by infiltration from type 2 groundwater in perched aquifers to the type 1 groundwater in andesite lava precipitation from different seasons appears to blend during underground infiltration and subsequent flow 4 3 hydrochemistry na was the dominant cation and cl the dominant anion in most of the waters in the study area appendix table a 1 which thus was classified as nacl type when plotted on a trilinear piper diagram almost none were of the cahco3 type typical of freshwater fig 7 wet precipitation had dissolved ion concentrations that varied greatly with the location and season similar to their isotopic compositions with na the dominant cation and cl the dominant anion appendix table a 2 although precipitation at the town office and the gakkohgawa dam sites had na and cl concentrations that were more than 10 times higher in winter than in summer the cl na ratio 1 71 0 12 was consistently close to that of seawater 1 80 likewise the concentration of mg2 the second most abundant cation in seawater was high in winter precipitation the cl mg2 ratio 14 8 14 2 in wet precipitation although it varied widely on average was almost the same as that of seawater 14 9 because the main component of ssas has the same ionic composition as seawater lewis and schwartz 2004 it is evident that ssas contribute significantly to groundwater and surface water in this area these well waters had cl concentrations 27 3 and 22 1 mg l and na concentrations 15 3 and 10 0 mg l three times higher than the annual precipitation weighted cl and na concentrations 7 02 and 4 00 mg l respectively of precipitation at the nearby town office site these even exceeded the highest cl and na concentrations in winter precipitation at the town office 20 8 and 11 3 mg l respectively the wetland water samples in the yoshideyama area had δ18o and δ2h values showing the influence of precipitation during spring to autumn when the ssa concentration was low however their average cl and na concentrations 10 9 and 6 1 mg l respectively exceeded both the annual precipitation weighted concentrations 3 07 and 1 76 mg l respectively and the concentrations in winter precipitation 7 5 9 4 and 4 4 5 7 mg l respectively at the nearby gakkohgawa dam these results indicates that groundwater and surface water contain cl and na derived from airborne sea salt in addition to wet precipitation winds are strong during winter in coastal areas fig 5 the average daily wind speed at sakata is 3 m s in summer which corresponds to the generation of whitecaps and 6 m s in winter often reaching 7 to 11 m s speeds at which large sea salt particles are injected into the marine boundary layer o dowd et al 1997 considering this wind information it is evident that in the study area ssas deposited on trees and soil especially during winter dissolve in wet precipitation and enter the groundwater the high ssa contribution characterizing waters of this area is consistent with the isotopic evidence showing a strong contribution from winter precipitation therefore well waters with very high cl and na concentrations are derived from precipitation with high ssa concentrations in the coastal hills on the trilinear diagram wetland waters have much larger proportions of na k and cl and smaller ca2 proportions than groundwater and surface water samples indicating strong contributions of wet precipitation and airborne ssas fig 7 type 2 waters are comparatively rich in nacl owing to the ssa component although the proportions of na k and cl are smaller than those of wetland waters type 1 waters are lower in cl and higher in ca2 and hco3 than type 2 waters chokai andesite is much richer in ca than in na k fig 7 the compositional difference among water types indicates that as precipitation infiltrates into the volcanic sediments and underlying lava a large amount of ca is dissolved through chemical weathering by carbonic acid and organic acids this process accounts for the characteristics of type 1 groundwater flowing in andesite lava as opposed to type 2 groundwater in volcanic sediments originating partly from wetland water that is strongly affected by atmospheric deposition thus the chemical differences in groundwater between shallow perched aquifers in volcanic sediments and deep aquifers in lava are consistent with the isotopic results 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of snowmelt water to groundwater annual precipitation weighted δ18o and δ2h values at the town office and the gakkohgawa dam sites align with those of precipitation at akita and ajigasawa where long term monthly data are reported fig 6b type 1 water has d values above this line indicating a greater contribution from winter precipitation winter snowfall in the western caldera area above 1000 m elevation is estimated to account for half of the annual rainfall tsuchiya 1983 but has not been measured data from lower sites show that the ratio of winter december february precipitation to annual precipitation ranges from 0 23 to 0 28 at kamikusazu sakata and gakkohgawa dam in southwestern chokai appendix table a 3 where daily and monthly precipitations are well correlated fig 4 even if the winter period extends to november march the ratio of winter to annual precipitation is less than half 0 40 0 45 at the three sites appendix table a 3 changes of monthly precipitation amounts at the high elevation sites of sannotaki and ohdaira where precipitation data are available only for june october are similar to those of the low elevation sites and the correlation with precipitation at each site is strong fig 4 it is likely from these results that the contribution of winter precipitation to type 1 water is not strongly affected by the proportion of snow to rainfall snowfall is uncommon from may to october even at high elevations the weighted δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation from may to october 2011 at the three precipitation sites decrease with increasing elevation indicating an altitude effect fig 6b each value lies near the summer precipitation line at these sites may october precipitation amounts to about half the annual total 0 49 0 55 in appendix table a 3 thus the precipitation amount from november to april including winter is likewise almost half the annual total if groundwater is formed from precipitation only from november to april the precipitation weighted d value during this period is 21 1 in akita and 21 8 in ajigasawa which are in close agreement with the d values av 21 33 of type 1 groundwaters given that type 1 water is contributed by precipitation during all seasons this result indicates that snow rich winter precipitation more effectively infiltrates groundwater than rainwater during other seasons the average d value of type 1 spring water 21 33 is high and does not share the large seasonal variation of precipitation the subsurface infiltration effect of snowmelt relative to that of rainwater or snowmelt efficiency fsnow can be evaluated by comparing the precipitation weighted d values assuming that precipitation during the snow season is snow and precipitation during other seasons is rain if the ratio of precipitation amount rpa during the snowfall season to the total precipitation amount is frpa s and the ratio of precipitation during other seasons is frps ns then fsnow is 1 fsnow 21 33 σdns frps ns σds frps s where ds and dns are the d values of precipitation during the snowfall and non snowfall periods respectively the value of fsnow is unity when the subsurface infiltration effects of snow and rain are the same assuming that the snowfall season extends from december to february fsnow is 2 28 at the town office and 2 50 at gakkohgawa dam both are higher than the values of 2 26 for akita and 1 62 for ajigasawa but even the latter two sites have fsnow values well above unity the ratio of precipitation amount during this period to annual precipitation is 0 21 at akita and 0 29 at ajigasawa corresponding to those of the two sites in the study area this correspondence supports our assessment of snowmelt efficiency for type 1 water from long term monthly data for both sites an fsnow value of 2 0 suggests that snow has twice the subsurface infiltration efficiency of rain even if precipitation from november to march is assumed to be entirely snowfall the fsnow value is 1 75 at akita and 1 42 at ajigasawa these results suggest that the effect of snow on groundwater recharge exceeds that of rain by at least 40 and in some cases is about twice as much in areas with a large seasonal variation of precipitation d values the subsurface infiltration effect of snow on rain which was difficult to estimate in previous studies earman et al 2006 winograd et al 1998 can be evaluated quantitatively in contrast at cheju island south of the sea of japan the isotopic composition of groundwater nearly equals the mean precipitation weighted annual isotopic composition despite precipitation having a large seasonal variation in d values as at chokai lee et al 1999 this island is mainly composed of highly permeable basalt which allows even strong rains to easily percolate chokai volcano is covered with vegetation from late spring to autumn and rainwater during this season returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration as in other areas including cheju island lee et al 1999 however in chokai s largely of andesite lava with low hydraulic conductivity rainfall heavier than 50 mm per hour which sometimes occurs during summer to autumn is likely to generate surface runoff that directly discharges into streams in contrast snow more easily penetrates the ground than rainwater because it melts gradually and releases water slowly rainfall infiltrating through snowpack also penetrates the ground more readily further studies are needed to quantify permeability in these different circumstances but it is clear at chokai volcano that winter snow more effectively infiltrates groundwater than rainfall 5 2 recharge area 5 2 1 recharge elevation index of spring water the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation at gakkohgawa dam which is weighted by precipitation amount over the 2010 2011 year are lower than those of precipitation at the town office at lower elevation fig 6b the precipitation weighted isotopic compositions during the period may october decreases as the site elevation rises from the town office to gakkohgawa dam to ohdaira from a to c respectively in fig 6b reflecting the effect of altitude on the δ18o and δ2h values of wet precipitation however the δ18o δ2h and d values of the two coastal well water samples average 8 31 45 3 and 21 2 respectively differ from those of the annual weighted precipitation at the nearby town office 8 15 51 1 and 14 0 respectively the no3 concentration of this well water 50 mg l is extremely high appendix table a 1 indicating that it is strongly influenced by the chemical fertilizers mukherjee and singh 2022 used on the vegetable farms in the coastal hills thus well water is clearly recharged locally although the recharge elevation of the well water 40 m is close to that of the precipitation site 27 m the notable difference between the isotopic compositions of the two waters suggests isotopic fractionation during the underground infiltration of precipitation in the study area the use of spring waters from small basins mulligan et al 2011 yasuhara et al 1997 yasuhara et al 2017 rather than precipitation is suitable for estimating the recharge elevation of groundwater we determined the watershed elevation range for mountain foot spring waters at five sites nos 16 17 18 20 21 and 27 in fig 2a and appendix fig a 1 fig 8 shows the relationship between the average elevation ae in meters of six small watersheds fivc spring waters and one coastal well water and the δ18o in δ2h in cl concentration in mg l and electrical conductivities ecs in μs cm of their groundwaters in the groundwater of these watersheds δ18o and δ2h

groundwater by 2 ae 472 08 δ18o 4040 4 r2 0 96 3 ae 61 388 δ2h 2908 9 r2 0 96 ae was related to the cl concentration cl by 4 ae 1 9058 104cl 1 7651 r 2 0 99 or by 5 ae 1795 exp 0 14318 cl r 2 0 93 the cl concentrations of rainwater and associated groundwater are known to decrease as a power function of distance from the coast bresciani et al 2014 in the study area the cl concentration was about 25 mg l in well water about 500 m from the coast and about 10 mg l in the spring water and type 2 surface water of the yoshideyama area about 10 km from the coast in contrast the cl concentrations of mountain foot spring waters tended to decrease with increasing elevation being higher than 11 mg l at elevations below 100 m 5 14 mg l at 100 500 m and below 5 mg l above 1000 m appendix table a 1 the generation of ssas which delivers airborne cl and na increases with wind speed over the ocean and the maritime distribution of ssas declines steeply with altitude being a factor of 10 smaller at 2 km altitude murphy et al 2019 thus ssas appear to decrease exponentially with altitude over the ocean but whether this is true over land areas is unclear from may to september when the wind off the sea of japan was weak the cl concentration in wet precipitation was similar at the town office and gakkohgawa dam sites 0 5 3 mg l which differ in distance from the coast by 6 km and in elevation by about 180 m but was less than 0 5 mg l at the ohdaira site at 999 m elevation appendix table a 2 the contribution of ssas to chokai volcano although strong in winter decreases with elevation and distance from the coast regardless of the season resulting in an exponential or power law decrease of cl concentrations in spring waters with elevation because the water in this area is of the nacl type with a high ssa component the ecs of spring waters in small watersheds also decreased with elevation as 6 ae 8 4152105ecsw 1 7899 r 2 0 90 or 7 ae 990 79 exp 0 011951ec r 2 0 58 this relationship is consistent with the increase in precipitation and the decrease of the ssa contribution with increasing elevation the average recharge elevations ares of groundwater obtained from each equation are listed in appendix table a 5 it is reasonable to estimate the are value of groundwater from the cl concentration and ec value using equations 4 and 6 which are strongly correlated with ae however despite having only one site to estimate ae at elevations above 500 m even small changes in the cl concentration or ec value result in large changes in ae values fig 8c d this indicates that the reliability of the ae value estimated from the cl concentration and ec value becomes lower at elevations above 600 700 m because of this uncertainty in the altitudinal change in ssas we also estimated ares of groundwater using equation 5 based on the strong correlation of cl concentration with ae 5 2 2 evaluation of the recharge elevation index of spring water the isotopic compositions and dissolved ion concentrations in spring waters from the end of the lava flow are variable differing by more than the analytical errors even at the same site the six samples of spring water from the dohhara waterfall no 14 have an exceptionally wide variation of 0 86 in δ18o 4 in δ2h 1 92 mg l in cl concentration and 8 3 μs cm in ec corresponding to variations in are of 406 246 169 and 148 m respectively nevertheless the averages of the are values for the six samples estimated from δ18o δ2h cl concentration and ec are much more consistent 636 624 591 and 569 m respectively indicating that are values for a site are more reliably determined by the average of multiple samples than single samples the ares for type 1 spring water estimated using δ18o and δ2h range from 200 to 1200 m and the two are values differ by no more than 100 m for individual samples fig 9 a likewise the ares for spring water estimated using cl concentrations and ecs are nearly the same fig 9b except for high elevation sites where these estimates have low reliability however the are values at a given site differ depending on the indicator used most are values for the mountain foot springs range from 300 to 700 m in the yoshideyama area corresponding to differences of 1 08 in δ18o 9 02 to 10 10 5 96 in δ2h 52 31 to 58 27 5 15 mg l in cl concentration 12 71 to 7 56 mg l and 25 6 μs cm in ec 84 4 to 58 8 μs cm the analytical errors for δ18o 0 2 and δ2h 1 correspond to elevation errors of 94 m and 61 m respectively whereas the analytical error for cl concentration 5 corresponds to an elevation error of about 30 m because spring waters with ares lower than 700 m are predominant in the study area cl concentrations and ec values are more sensitive to elevation than δ18o and δ2h in these low elevation areas where their values change markedly fig 8 because type 1 surface water is very similar to type 1 groundwater both in terms of water isotopic compositions fig 6 and water qualities fig 7 δ18o δ2h cl concentration and ec value in surface water can support estimates of the average watershed elevation awe at a given site the awes estimated from the four indicators appendix table a 5 were almost the same for the two type 1 waters although the agreement was poorer for stream water than for spring water fig 9 this close agreement reflects the fact that type 1 stream water represents base flow in which the groundwater component is dominant however for type 2 waters the agreement of ares or awes from the different indicators was less good values based on δ18o were generally lower than those based on δ2h fig 9a summer precipitation owing to its low d values had larger δ18o than δ2h values compared to annual average precipitation fig 6b accordingly samples of type 2 water with a large contribution of summer rainwater had higher are or awe values from δ18o than from δ2h the agreement between are and awe values based on cl concentrations eq 4 and on ec values eq 6 was poor fig 9b similar to δ18o and δ2h we attribute this difference to ssa concentrations and ec values of precipitation being lower in summer than winter appendix table a 2 most of the waters for which the ares and awes vary with different indicators show the influence of rainfall in the season when the water was sampled such as type 2 surface waters since δ18o and δ2h are both indicators based on water molecules they yield closely consistent are values fig 9a however because the δ2h values of type 1 waters vary over a smaller range than δ18o values in the study area fig 6b it is preferable to estimate are or awe from δ2h rather than δ18o as is commonly done for type 1 water the are and awe values based on cl concentrations eq 4 agree well with those based on ec value eq 6 except at high elevations where both indicators have low sensitivity fig 9b of the two equations based on cl concentration equation 5 is more sensitive at high elevations than equation 4 fig 8c for type 1 water from the western low elevation area within about 4 km of the coast are values obtained from cl concentrations eq 5 are clearly lower than those from δ2h fig 9c suggesting that one indicator alone is inaccurate in estimating are or awe the average are or awe values for type 1 water obtained from combined δ2h and cl concentrations eqs 3 and 5 agree well with those based on all four indicators eqs 2 3 4 and 6 as shown by the tightly clustered data points in fig 9d these values of type 2 water in the yoshideyama area are only about 100 m higher than those of the sample site appendix table a 5 this is consistent with the origin of type 2 water described in section 2 4 in a perched aquifer near the sample site furthermore despite the large contribution of precipitation during the sampling season the average awe values of most wetland waters obtained from δ2h and cl concentrations are within about 150 m of the sampling site elevation appendix table a 5 these results indicate that the combined use of two indicators eqs 3 and 5 or four indicators eqs 2 3 4 and 6 is most effective for estimating the elevations of groundwater recharge and source watersheds of surface waters the are and awe values from the two indicators eqs 3 and 5 agree closely in the yoshideyama area and the western caldera area at high elevations fig 9c because this area lies within a narrow range of distance from the coast 8 11 km but contains a large range of elevations 1800 m this agreement indicates the strong elevation dependence of water vapor and ssas that inference is consistent with the view of kirchner et al 2010 that cl concentrations and water isotopic compositions in stream water can be used as conservative tracers in catchments due to their similar behaviors chloride ion concentrations in atmospheric deposition decrease rapidly as a power function of distance from the coast reported in some cases to be nearly constant at about 10 km bresciani et al 2014 in the marine boundary layer the amount of ssas is well correlated with that of water vapor with both decreasing with altitude murphy et al 2019 it is likely then that in mountains near the sea where both ssa contributions and elevation differences are large the concentration of cl in precipitation decreases with altitude 5 2 3 recharge area of spring water in yoshideyama area the are values for spring waters from the end of the lava flow in the yoshideyama area are 219 697 m from δ18o 302 631 m from δ2h 291 591 m from cl concentration and 300 574 m from ec they signify that the spring water is recharged mainly from the gently sloping area below 700 m elevation in the fan formed by the minaminokomai and mansukedo lava flows figs 2 and 3 fig 10 shows the average recharge area of the spring waters assuming that the flow direction is parallel to that of the lava flow these are values ranged from 300 to 600 m the mean awe value estimated from δ2h and cl eqs 3 and 5 in the minaminokomai stream which flows on the east side of the yoshideyama area is 1064 m at the upstream site 490 m elevation and 1128 m at the downstream site 140 m elevation fig 10 in the minamiore stream which flows on the northwest side the awe is 898 m at the upstream site 626 m elevation and 660 m at the downstream site 114 m elevation even at their lowest sites both streams have awe values higher than the highest are values of the mountain foot spring water in the yoshideyama area even at their lowest sites both streams have awe values higher than the highest are values of the mountain foot spring water in the yoshideyama area these results indicate that recharge from both streams to the lava aquifer in the yoshideyama area is small at most both streams flow through eroded lava and recharge from the minaminokomai stream to the yoshideyama aquifer is unlikely below 400 m elevation because the valley there is deeper than 100 m the geomorphology and the water quality of the uppermost surface water of the yoshideyama area support the view that the yoshideyama foothill springs are mainly recharged from the lower reaches of the minaminokomai and mansukedo lava flows below 700 m elevation the hydraulic conductivity of andesite in a volcano varies greatly depending on many factors including age and the distribution of pyroclastic rocks lava flows weathering and hydrothermal alteration asai et al 2009 toulier et al 2019 vittecoq et al 2019 nonetheless the yoshideyama area and the upper western caldera are composed largely of lava flows younger than 20 ka and their geochemical and physical properties are homogeneous these simple geological conditions are probably the reason why the awe of streams and the are of springs are separated by topography in areas such as the yoshideyama area i e at similar distances from the coast cl concentrations ec values and water isotopic compositions can be used together to identify groundwater recharge elevations with a high degree of accuracy further improving the accuracy of these methods requires comprehensive studies that include topographical and geological data as well as water quality indicators the springs in the mountain foot groups are close to each other in location and elevation suggesting that they share the same aquifer however in the west springs the δ18o δ2h cl concentration and ec values increase at three sites from west to east they increase even more in the drainage from the quarry about 200 m east of the easternmost spring in this group accordingly the are value decreases eastward in the west springs discharging from the same lava flow fig 10 in the south springs these indicator values tend to increase between the western site and the eastern dohhara waterfalls site with a decrease in the middle although the watershed of each spring water cannot be specified from the topography like the surface streams these differences in water quality even at similar elevations suggest that groundwater generated by infiltration into the lava flow at different areas is not fully mixed within the aquifer before it is discharged of the springs in this area the dohhara waterfall spring issuing from the lava cave is unique in that it has the largest volume of water and the greatest variation in water quality the velocity of the groundwater in the large fissures here must be much higher than in the lava voids elsewhere the are of this spring about 600 m lies near the narrow area where the minamiore minaminokomai and the kokesawa streams diverge and these surface waters may enter the lava through volcanic sediments the groundwater originating from these streams mixes with groundwater derived from precipitation at the lower elevation which may explain the large fluctuations in the water quality of the dohhara spring if this is the case and for the conservation of the dohhara spring misuda 2018 it is necessary to evaluate the contribution from these stream waters at around 600 m to the lava aquifer in the yoshideyama area 5 3 formation model of spring water from the fractures in andesite lava even outside the yoshideyama area most ares of type 1 spring waters are below 700 m whereas the awe of major rivers is above 600 m even in the plains fig 10 this result is consistent with the fact that on chokai volcano the headwaters of 32 rivers extend up to an average elevation of about 1300 m and a maximum of 2100 m the volcano s southern slope has a topographical inflection around 600 700 m elevation with steep slopes above and gentle slopes below figs 2 and 3 because the upper slopes consist largely of andesite lava with low permeability precipitation at those elevations is less likely to infiltrate and more likely to flow over bedrock and thin sediments this difference in surface environment appears to explain the difference between the high awe values of rivers and the low are values of mountain foot springs because the highlands tend to shed precipitation as runoff without penetrating deep into the subsurface river water in the plains has a higher source elevation even when spring water mixes with it in the foothills in contrast the gentle slope at lower elevations has many recesses and deposits of large lava masses and sediments which provide favorable environments for infiltration wetlands are more likely to form in the presence of less permeable sediments and perched aquifers form in sediment layers beneath wetlands and above impermeable lava surfaces many voids in quaternary andesitic lavas farquharson et al 2015 yokoyama and takeuchi 2009 are connected to large and small cracks and can become aquifers it is likely that type 2 perched groundwater in volcanic sediments infiltrates into voids and small cracks in the lava sometimes through larger cracks such as joints and discharges as type 1 spring water through large cracks and clinker at the end of lava flows fig 11 this view would also explain why type 1 waters from andesitic lavas have smaller variability and higher ca2 and hco3 concentrations than the type 2 waters of perched aquifer origin in volcanic sediments considering basalt volcanoes with high permeability it has been reported that local perched aquifers lie above impermeable layers at high altitudes in the hawaiian islands ingebritsen and scholl 1993 elsewhere a continuous basal aquifer from high to low elevations has been proposed for the canary islands custodio 2007 and a discontinuous aquifer regardless of elevation for mayotte island lachassagne et al 2014 although our study area has few high elevation examples the west and south springs in the yoshideyama area are located at almost the same elevation fig 3 given the porosity of quaternary andesite lava about 10 on average farquharson et al 2015 yokoyama and takeuchi 2009 these foothill springs are likely to constitute a continuous basal aquifer fig 11 the differences in are values within the west or south springs fig 10 indicate that they vary in their recharge areas or their mix of sources groundwater in lava exists in highly permeable fractures or low permeability interstitial voids if the fractures are well connected to each other groundwater mixing will increase and the water quality in the aquifer will become homogeneous however the difference in spring water quality at different sites suggests that groundwater flows through fractures discharge without thorough mixing in the lava aquifer this difference is rather consistent with the model by lachassagne et al 2014 in which aquifers are discontinuous and separated by aquicludes the observations at the quarry may suggest that the fractured and surrounding weathered andesites with their high porosities may function as an aquifer and the surrounding fresh andesite as an impermeable layer as shown in fig 11 mountain foot spring water discharges from basal aquifers in lava flows that receive infiltrating wet precipitation at different elevations on gentle slopes type 1 groundwater from different elevations that infiltrated through sediment layers would contribute to the basal aquifer but to a degree that varies depending on the spring these differences may account for the observed variation in water quality and are values the discontinuity of the basal aquifer within the lava suggests that the groundwater resource is limited lachassagne et al 2014 this suggestion is consistent with the finding in section 2 3 that most of the daily discharges of mountain foot springs are as low as 10 to 102 t even with high annual precipitation of about 3000 mm the lower slopes of chokai volcano are limited in groundwater resources indicating that this area is susceptible to environmental changes on the east side of the quarry groundwater from higher elevations appears to flow south southwest through the lava accordingly the extension of quarrying to the east could damage the lava aquifer and decrease the discharge of the south springs at lower elevation which are in urgent need of conservation misuda 2018 further the removal of sediments overlying lava by quarrying could reduce infiltration into bedrock and adversely affect the sustainability of wetlands which play an important role in hydrological processes hayashi et al 2016 and ecosystem services de groot et al 2018 the impact of climate change on groundwater resources is an acute concern in places such as the middle east and the southwestern united states where aquifers depend on mountain snow famiglietti 2014 wu et al 2020 this concern is heightened by the growing knowledge that snowmelt infiltrates more effectively than rainwater snowfall amount decreases as altitude decreases in the annapurna range in the nepal himalaya putkonen 2004 snowfall in japan is predicted to decrease at lower elevations where temperatures are higher kawase 2019 kawase et al 2013 2020 yamaguchi et al 2011 the lower parts of lava flows which are the main recharge area of the mountain foot springs cover a larger area than the upper slopes and are more susceptible to a decrease in snowfall a decrease in snowfall would add to the effect of quarrying on these springs with a limited groundwater resource 6 conclusions we classified spring waters and surface waters on the southwest side of chokai volcano into type 1 derived from groundwater in lava with low permeability and type 2 derived from perched aquifers in soil and sediments above the lava both waters are of the nacl type and have high d values due to large snowfall and ssa contributions in winter but type 1 water has smaller variations in water quality and higher ca concentrations derived from the andesite lava we used chloride ion and electrical conductivity in addition to water isotopic compositions to examine the recharge zones of foothill springs and the hydrologic processes from precipitation to groundwater in the yoshideyama area where both types of water are widely distributed the evidence shows that type 1 spring waters at the foot of the mountain are recharged from the area of gentle slopes downstream from the lava compared to higher areas with steep slopes and thin sediments the gentle slopes with large areas and thick sediment deposits in the troughs of lava waves are more favorable for infiltration of rainwater and especially snowmelt that feeds the foothill springs snowfall contribution to groundwater was estimated to be several 10 to twice as high as rainfall in mountainous areas at similar distances from the coast the combination of cl concentrations and water isotopic compositions yields a more accurate estimate of groundwater recharge elevations the water quality and are of the foothill springs vary locally even where the discharge elevations are similar and the groundwater appears to undergo minimal exchange of water between permeable fractures in the lava the linkage though unclear between fast flow in the fractures and slow groundwater in the lava voids is an important hydrogeological aspect of lava aquifers this study clarifies the role of hitherto undocumented factors affecting groundwater in fractured andesitic lava in cold regions such as the form of precipitation rain or snow and the presence and permeability of sediment overlying the lava for the sustainable use of groundwater from snow topped andesitic volcanoes the effects on the water cycle of land alteration and precipitation changes due to global warming need to be comprehensively studied with consideration of local geology topography and meteorology future monitoring of mountain foot springs and rain and snow along with detailed petrographic investigation of volcanic sections by boring will help clarify the hydrology of groundwater in lava with its many unknowns as well as the

3143,the changes in precipitation pattern provide an understanding on the hydroclimatic response to global warming during the anthropocene the present study investigates sources of precipitation moisture for the indian monsoon and the local environmental mechanisms controlling its distribution over the southwest coast of india this is achieved by the characterization of stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in rainwater samples collected from a high humid tropical setting swarna madisal river basin of the western ghats south india and another station further south bakrabail southern edge of nethravati river basin this study contributes to the detailed investigation on rainwater isotopic composition and microclimate characteristics which is lacking in the humid west coast region the rainwater isotopic composition of coast was close to that of the arabian sea water and reflected the first condensate of vapours which were originally formed under fast evaporation at the nearby ocean in inland location the higher d excess values reflect continental moisture recycling evapotranspiration has led to higher kinetic fractionation effect in the inland region the isotopic storm effect during winter monsoon season suggested the rain distribution from saturated air masses formed under deep convective effect in the bay of bengal the overall local meteoric water line lmwl in the swarna madisal basin was found to be δ2h 7 2 δ18o 7 5 r2 0 98 further south the lmwl of bakrabail was δ2h 8 19 δ18o 16 1 r2 0 98 for annual observation and displayed minimal variability for inter seasonal slopes 7 73 for summer monsoon 8 48 for winter monsoon and 8 36 for pre monsoon and intercepts 15 6 for summer monsoon 17 8 for winter monsoon and 15 5 for pre monsoon in regions of vegetation dominance and humid climate the prevailing local air mass masked the rain out effect of marine air mass as well as the amount effect which support microclimatic settings at the local precipitation sites in southwest india the time and space variability of regional moisture circulation in controlling atmospheric water balance has been deduced in this study thus the high efficacy of stable isotopes in tracing the manifestation of microclimate in the humid tropics has been demonstrated keywords stable isotope precipitation indian summer monsoon ism local

forms the bloodstream of earth s biosphere with precipitation being its prime source ripl 2003 the response of precipitation to global warming has been unprecedented during the anthropocene falkenmark et al 2019 giorgi et al 2019 rocha et al 2015 chen and zhou 2015 the climate change response is strongly reflected in the tropics as it experiences higher precipitation from nearby oceans as well as increasing anthropogenic pressure thus the investigation on long term precipitation characteristics in tropical regions is pertinent this can provide a better understanding of the impact of climate change on the earth s hydrological cycle the present study highlights the need for determining the rainfall isotopic characteristics at local and regional scales in humid tropics to better understand the river basin hydrology during the anthropocene 1 1 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water the introduction of mass spectrometric techniques during the early 1950s resulted in the use of lighter elements as environmental isotope tracers in understanding the watershed hydrology and its relation to the geological processes craig 1961 epstein and mayeda 1953 accordingly the radiogenic isotopes like tritium 3h and carbon 14 were used as dating tools while the stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h formed the ideal tracers for moisture origin that contributed to water bodies in the earth system froelich et al 1998 the international atomic energy agency iaea has been persistently working since 1961 on method improvements for mass spectrometric techniques and its applications in novel earth system studies the iaea in coordination with the world meteorological organization wmo has developed global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip and global network for isotopes in rivers gnir to regularly monitor δ2h and δ18o values respectively in global precipitation and rivers based on their dataset the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 explaining the relationship between isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in freshwater samples was demonstrated by craig 1961 the intercept 10 in gmwl represented the excess of deuterium in short d excess or d dansgaard 1964 relative to oxygen resulting from a single stage evaporation of ocean water at an average relative humidity of 85 merlivat and jouzel 1979 clark and fritz 1997 this was later redefined as δ2h 8 13 δ18o 10 8 by rozanski et al 1993 the deuterium excess i e d δ2h 8 δ18o has been a successful parameter in exploring the influence of various secondary processes affecting the water moisture source signatures from local to global scale dansgaard 1964 gat and matsui 1991 ingraham and taylor 1991 salati et al 1979 tripti et al 2016 wolf et al 2020 the d excess value is often an indication of climatic condition during primary evaporation higher kinetic fractionation of 2h than 18o rather than the rain out process along the travel path dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 craig et al 1963 this is because the rate of kinetic isotope fractionation defining the magnitude of d excess is dependent on the relative humidity at the evaporation site which has inverse relationship dansgaard 1964 gat and airey 2006 rozanski et al 1993 in general the d excess of ocean water is close to 0 while that for the precipitation resulting from the diffusion of vapour from evaporated ocean water is close to 10 any deviation in this d excess value indicates the additional diffusivity of vapour from land surface evaporation or evapotranspiration like that from the water body soil or vegetation contributing to the atmospheric moisture this knowledge has led to the use of δ2h δ18o and d excess values as global water tracers to fingerprint the monsoon moisture source surface and sub

2019 yadava et al 2004 1 2 fingerprinting the moisture sources of rainwater most of the isotope ratio variabilities of oxygen and hydrogen in water are observed due to the natural distribution of relative abundance of their isotopes epstein and mayeda 1953 the mass dependent isotope fractionation occurs due to the varying bond energy reactive rate or the diffusivity of isotopologues containing light abundant 1h and 16o and heavy rare 2h 17o and 18o isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen bowen et al 2019 and references there in this fractionation is mainly driven during the phase change from vapour to liquid or solid form water and vice versa under equilibrium or non equilibrium condition craig and gordon 1965 gat 1996 the precipitation is generally known to be controlled by the equilibrium fractionation where the lighter isotopes preferentially get accumulated in the higher energy vapour phase while the heavier isotopes condensates as downpour water leaving behind the remaining vapour much enriched with lighter isotopes than the original vapour which is further defined by the rainout history or the rayleigh distillation the non equilibrium diffusivities of the vapour to from the condensate evaporated location are reflected in the dual isotope δ2h and δ18o relationship between oxygen and hydrogen in water friedman 1953 this is because of i the difference in their relative fractionation factors as hydrogen undergoes eight times stronger fractionation than oxygen during the equilibrium phase change and ii diffusion leading to sub equal shift in oxygen and hydrogen composition the effective vapour phase change is well predictable with the d excess value dansgaard 1964 as defined in the section 1 1 1 3 study objectives and tools the global extreme precipitation has intensified during the anthropocene madakumbura et al 2021 while the tropics and sub tropics of the northern hemisphere experienced relatively drier climate than that of the southern hemisphere zhang et al 2007 this can pose significant impact on the socio economy and indirect health effects in the tropics thus it is necessary to fingerprint the sources of precipitation moisture and regularly monitor the regional hydrological cycle during the anthropocene the isotopic characteristics of rainwater has been a useful tool in identifying the monsoon uncertainty and to determine the impact of climate change on regional water resources in the tropics the present study focuses on the characterisation of rainwater using stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in the swarna madisal river basin having its drainage in a humid tropical setting of the western ghats mountain belt south india the objective is to investigate the sources of monsoon moisture in the eastern coast of arabian sea and their variability over the tropical rain forest region of the western ghats further the spatial three stations in swarna madisal basin and at bakrabail and temporal daily and monthly scales variations in stable isotopic composition of rainwater have been studied to understand i the interplay between different oceanic moisture origins ii pattern of rain out history rayleigh distillation or orographic rain effect iii effect of tropical storm events cyclone depression in the northern indian ocean and iv influence of terrestrial land surface dynamics on incoming maritime monsoon vapour i e effect of vegetation and water body on evapotranspiration evaporation the questions on the induction of microclimatic condition between west coast of india and the western ghats as well as the time and space of continental moisture recycling contributing to atmospheric water balance in the region have been addressed in this study though the rainfall amount provided details regarding the mesoscale seasonal weather condition the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater provide greater insights to the regional convective activity the inference from this study can be used further in better understanding the complex hydrological cycle in humid tropical river basins of south india where there is usually limited to no meteorological stations for direct climatic observations in this study the stable isotopic composition of rainwater has not been used simply as a tracer for the condensation history of atmospheric vapour which display interconnection between climate and hydrology but also to explore the interconnection between ecohydrology i e forest ecology hydrology and microclimate manifestation in humid tropics of south india using the secondary d excess parameter 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the swarna madisal river basin which has its drainage system in the western part of the western ghats south india has been chosen as the area of interest for this study fig 1 a detailed description of this river basin has been provided in earlier reported studies tripti et al 2013 tripti et al 2016 briefly the swarna river originates at an elevation of 1100 m asl whereas madisal river at 900 m asl in the mountain belt of western ghats south india these two rivers merge at kallianpur close to udupi karnataka before debouching to the arabian sea they cover a total basin area of about 853 sq km between the high altitude mountains of the western ghats in the eastern edge and the arabian sea in the western edge the lithology is comprised of dominant granitic gneissic terrain with patches of lateritic soils while alluvial soils along the coast the river basin provides a unique setting for the study of rainwater characteristics as it covers a humid tropical region experiencing highest rainfall in south india and adjacent to the location agumbe receiving second highest rainfall long term in the country after the region of cherrapunji meghalaya in the brahmaputra basin gunnell 1997 the region experienced seasonal rainfall due to the monsoon circulation variability over the northern indian ocean gadgil 2003 the rainfall amount in each of the studied locations are obtained from the nearest meteorology stations within the basin data from irrigation department government of karnataka the total annual rainfall in the basin for the sampling year was 4561 mmm fig 2 the region exhibits warm temperature during most seasons with the range of 20 35 c and the relative humidity is usually between 70 and 95 fig 2 the tropical evergreen forest of the western ghats dominates the upper catchment region with minor anthropogenic impact while the agricultural lands dominate the midstream and downstream region of the basin accordingly the built up areas were restricted to the downstream region near udupi town with no major industries developed within the basin during the sampling period the meteorological and physiographic conditions in the study area provide a unique setting to demonstrate the possibility of microclimate conditions as well as to fingerprint the time and space of moisture recycling contribution to the water balance in the region the samples of rain water were collected on a daily basis event rainfall at three locations in the swarna madisal river basin fig 1 during 2012 this includes rain samples from hebri upstream region n 14 manipal small town near coast n 12 and santhekatte station in onshore coastal belt n 14 in addition the rainwater samples from nearby locations outside the basin like agumbe n 2 during 2012 and the monthly bulk samples n 11 at bakrabail further south of the basin during 2013 were also collected to fingerprint the moisture source in the southwest coast of india the sampling stations were located few meters m from the main road in most of the locations except for bakrabail which was covered by higher vegetation both from deep forest and agricultural lands the rainfall amount of daily rainwater in these stations was considered based on the available data for nearest locations like kuchur though outside the madisal basin for hebri puttige for manipal udupi for santhekatte and mangalore for bakrabail observational station the samples of rainwater were collected and preserved in air tight polypropylene pp bottles for the measurement of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen the sample collection storage and further analysis were all carried out following the standard iaea procedures involved in rainwater study and maximum care was taken to avoid any error possibility during sampling analysis on the generated dataset the collected samples were pooled for analysis in each station to provide a representative subset of monsoon rain events in the studied river basin considering the available resources for this work despite there is limitation on the number of event sampling in each station of the swarna madisal river basin the analysed samples were representative sub set of the regional monsoon covering both high and low rainfall amounts in all three stations further the winter monsoon rain characteristics events are usually limited in this part of india discussed in section 3 1 and section 4 1 the winter monsoon rain signatures for the study period have also been recorded in this work thus the uncertainty associated with sub sampling is minimal in the studied river basin for the sampling period 2 2 analytical measurements the unfiltered rainwater samples were analysed for physico chemical conditions like temperature ph conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen soon after sample collection using hach make multi parameter apparatus connected with respective probes the aliquots of selected rainwater samples were analysed for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen using isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms available in ecolab toulouse precision 0 2 for δ18o and 1 8 for δ2h vsmow as standard reference material tripti et al 2019 in earlier reported study tripti et al 2016 only the average values of δ2h and δ18o in rainwater were provided for tracing the river water and groundwater interaction in the basin the isotopic data of individual rainwater samples have been reported and discussed in detail in this study there is a minor difference in earlier reported average values and this study only in rainwater of swarna madisal basin due to the usage of rainfall amount of the corresponding sampling date in obtaining the weighted mean values however the overall rainwater isotopic trend had no much difference the obtained isotopic results were reported in delta δ notation as defined below epstein and mayeda 1953 craig 1961 and in per mil unit obtained with reference to vienna standard mean oceanic water v smow by iaea δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard represent the ratios of heavy rare abundant isotopes to light more abundant isotopes in the sample of interest and the reference standard respectively 2 3 statistical analysis and modelling the land use land cover information fig 3 for the swarna madisal river basin was derived by integrating qgis mapping tools with the secondary data from bhuvan platform nrsc government of india an air mass backward trajectory model was used to fingerprint the origin of the monsoon moisture that contributed to the atmospheric water and constrain the possible atmospheric condition during rain event the program for hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit model developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was run for the selected dates of rainwater sampling in three stations fig 4 the backward trajectories for the air masses in the model was run for three days to fingerprint the sources of monsoon moisture and its seasonal variability and to track the path before its reach to the sample location this also assists in identifying if any short term severe storm event generally the case of cyclonic impact during winter monsoon over the indian sub continent has influenced the rainwater moisture prior to its fall in the swarna madisal river basin of the western ghats the correlation analysis was carried out to determine the variability of stable isotopic composition of rainwater with relative humidity pan evaporation signature for air temperature rainfall amount distance from sea and elevation 3 results the data obtained for rainfall amount and the stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h measured in rainwater obtained from the humid tropical setting of south india are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 amount of rainfall in three tropical observational sites of southwest india the amount of precipitation has a significant effect on its regional water geochemical isotopic characteristics this warrants a detailed assessment on the rainfall amount variability temporal and spatial in the studied river basin before characterizing its isotopic systematics the monthly data of rainfall amount obtained for three observational locations of swarna madisal river basin has been presented to assess the rainfall occurrence variability during the study period fig 2 the rainfall amount varied between 431 and 1211 mm seasonal total of about 3463 mm during summer monsoon season june september 0 180 mm seasonal total of 239 mm during winter monsoon season october january and 0 71 mm seasonal total of 108 mm during the drier pre monsoon season february april in santhekatte similarly the rainfall amount for the manipal station varied between 409 and 1552 mm seasonal total of about 3826 mm during summer monsoon 0 104 mm seasonal total amount of 198 mm during winter monsoon and 0 113 mm seasonal total of 117 mm during the drier pre monsoon the rainfall amount in hebri varied between 638 and 1865 mm seasonal total of about 4678 mm during summer monsoon 0 123 mm seasonal total amount of 199 mm during winter monsoon and 0 65 mm seasonal total of 71 mm during the drier pre monsoon there was no recorded rainfall during january march in all three observed stations and the same status was during december except for manipal where there was a minimal 1 mm rainfall the spatial variability of annual rainfall amount in the studied tropical region presents 3810 mm in the coast santhekatte to 4948 mm in the inland hebri for the sampling period the overall average rainfall in the basin during sampling year with six rain gauge observatories was 4560 mm while for the five year annual average it was 5300 mm in addition the annual rainfall amount in the nearby locations outside the basin were as follows 3170 mm during 2012 and 3545 mm during 2013 in bakrabail further south of the basin and 7171 mm in agumbe inland high altitude mountain site close to hebri during 2012 3 2 physico chemical parameters and stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in tropical rainwater fingerprinting the moisture source of rainwater and its control by secondary processes for eg evaporation and transpiration during its transport pathway within the continental river basins is necessary to understand the role of rainwater in the tropical hydrology for this the data on stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen along with its physico chemical parameters have been presented in this section the in situ measurements for physico chemical parameters of rainwater in selected samples of manipal were as follows the temperature of rainwater in manipal was ranging between 23 3 and 27 c with an average of 25 3 c while the measured ph varied from 4 9 to 7 2 units and the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the rainwater samples were ranging from 7 7 to 8 6 mg l the δ2h and δ18o values obtained for selected rainwater samples n 54 in the swarna madisal basin and nearby locations bakrabail and agumbe are given in supplementary table 1 refer supplementary material file the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater in santhekatte varied from 6 3 to 0 2 average 2 73 2 and 34 5 to 0 2 average 15 8 13 respectively with d excess value ranging from 1 5 to 16 1 average 6 5 3 for manipal the δ18o and δ2h varied from 15 6 to 1 4 average 4 29 4 06 and 107 1 to 0 4 average 23 3 30 respectively with d excess value ranging from 5 6 to 17 6 average 11 1 4 the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater for hebri was in the range of 4 3 to 0 9 average 3 0 1 and 27 9 to 0 4 average 12 7 8 respectively with d excess value ranging from 3 7 to 18 4 average 11 0 4 the rainwater of the swarna madisal river basin showed an annual mean isotopic composition of 3 3 0 8 for δ18o 17 3 5 5 for δ2h and 9 4 2 9 for d excess in the measured samples in the studied river basin note that the annual mean has been provided based on isotopic data of different precipitation range covers high and low daily rainfall rather than total rain events thus the rain amount weighted mean isotopic compositions have been considered to draw further inference the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater were estimated to be 3 65 0 3 for δ18o 20 72 2 for δ2h and 8 5 1 for d excess in santhekatte whereas it was 3 9 0 3 for δ18o 21 4 2 for δ2h and 10 1 0 7 for d excess in manipal and 2 7 0 3 for δ18o 9 3 1 for δ2h and 12 6 2 for d excess in hebri for the summer monsoon season the amount weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater were estimated to be 3 7 0 3 for δ18o 20 9 2 for δ2h and 8 5 1 for d excess in santhekatte whereas it was 2 9 0 3 for δ18o 13 6 2 for δ2h and 9 5 1 for d excess in manipal and 2 7 0 3 for δ18o 9 4 1 for δ2h and 12 5 2 for d excess in hebri as most 85 of the analysed samples were from the summer monsoon season the average values with standard deviation of only that season have been provided the weighted mean composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin during the summer monsoon season was 3 1 0 5 for δ18o 14 6 6 for δ2h and 10 2 2 for d excess however it has to be noted that the two sampled locations were close to the coast the monthly bulk rainwater samples of bakrabail were representative of all seasons the measured δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater in bakrabail varied from 8 4 to 0 6 average 4 1 2 5 and 52 6 to 14 0 average 17 6 20 8 respectively with d excess value ranging from 9 4 to 19 0 average 15 3 2 7 the amount weighted monthly bulk rainwater samples of bakrabail showed that the average values of δ18o δ2h and d excess were 2 8 0 3 6 3 1 and 16 5 2 respectively for the study period the seasonal weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in bakrabail were as follows 2 6 0 2 for δ18o 4 3 2 3 for δ2h and 16 8 2 8 for d excess during summer monsoon 3 9 1 7 for δ18o 15 2 6 for δ2h and 15 9 7 8 for d excess during winter monsoon season and 4 5 1 for δ18o 23 4 6 6 for δ2h and 12 8 2 7 for d excess during pre monsoon season 3 3 statistical analysis of rainwater isotopic data the correlation analysis was carried out to understand the relationship between the rainwater isotopic composition and various environmental factors in bakrabail as well as the swarna madisal river basin the correlation coefficient r value obtained for bakrabail as well as three locations of the studied river basin have been provided in supplementary table 2 and supplementary table 3 respectively along with description refer supplementary material file in general the correlation coefficients suggest that there was minimal effect of synoptic weather controls on the isotopic composition of rainwater while the rain out effect due to inland transport or higher elevation was also masked in the humid region of south india which are further assessed for the influence of microclimatic condition in the following section 4 discussion the global warming and anthropogenic climate forcing have led to the changes in atmospheric circulation and its subsequent reflection in the regional precipitation the rainfall amount the moisture source variability local regional dominance for rainwater and the factors governing microclimate manifestation in the humid tropical regions of southwest india have been discussed in detail in the following sub sections 4 1 monsoon rainfall amount variability at sampling sites in southwest india there is a notable spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the rainfall amount within the basin fig 2 the swarna madisal river basin received relatively lower annual rainfall in the coast santhekatte than inland locations manipal hebri during the sampling period the higher annual rainfall amount in the inland region is due to the orographic effect posed by the high altitude mountains of the western ghats towards the southwesterly trade winds carrying indian summer monsoon ism moisture from the arabian sea and equatorial indian ocean tawde and singh 2015 this has resulted in higher relative humidity in the inland region than the coast there is a strong seasonality in the amount of rainfall for the swarna madisal basin as assessed from the monthly rainfall variability during the sampling period fig 2 the three observed rainwater locations experienced higher rainfall during the summer monsoon season compared to other seasons characterized by winter monsoon or dry spell it was found that the rainfall amount was highest during august in all three locations of the basin for the sampling year the observed seasonal rainfall trends in these three tropical stations are similar to that in the southwestern part or the peninsular india the rainfall amount during the sampling period showed the influence of dual monsoon variability in the river basin with higher summer monsoon 93 and lower winter monsoon 5 effect this is because of the close proximity of the studied locations in the swarna madisal basin to the northern indian ocean specifically its geographical location in the eastern coast of arabian sea which contributes to 85 of monsoon moisture to the indian west coast and peninsular india india meteorological department government of india the shifting of inter tropical convergence zone itcz associated with irregular thermal heating of the ocean water hosts non uniform distribution of the indian monsoon which eventually leads to the creation of seasons characterised by dual monsoonal systems gadgil 2003 as a result the southwest monsoon winds carry moisture from these oceanic regions to the west coast of india and its neighbouring countries during wet summer monsoon season whereas the moisture carried by the northeast winds originating mainly from the bay of bengal reaches the indian west coast after its long traverse over the continent during the winter monsoon season sikka and gadgil 1980 rao and goswami 1988 gadgil 2003 eventually there is higher monsoon moisture input to the swarna madisal basin and bakrabail station during summer monsoon while lesser moisture reaches the river basin during winter monsoon except for the stronger cyclones this is also supported by the dual monsoon circulation pattern observed by the air mass backward trajectory shown in fig 4 there is a clear difference in seasonal monsoon circulation contributing to rainfall in observed stations the air mass backward trajectory demonstrates that the monsoon moisture from the arabian sea and the equatorial indian ocean reaches the sampling location during summer monsoon also called southwest monsoon during the winter monsoon also called northeast monsoon the moisture originating from the bay of bengal initially passes over the continent through southeast coast of india and then reaches the sampling locations fig 4 the cyclonic storm effect is usually relatively minimal in this basin or in the west coast than in the east coast of india the severe cyclonic storm was not observed for the sampling year during winter monsoon season which was the second time in the recorded monsoon circulation history of northern indian ocean after 2005 india meteorological department the northern indian ocean encountered two cyclonic storms murjan with arabian sea origin during october 22 26 and nilam with bay of bengal origin during october 28 november 01 and three deep depressions one from arabian sea origin and two from bay of bengal origin during the winter monsoon season in 2012 however the influence of these storms was found to be minimal in india during sampling year except for the nilam cyclone and the deep depression over bay of bengal during november 17 19 accordingly the swarna madisal river basin experienced higher rainfall due to these storm events impact during the winter monsoon season compared to pre monsoon season further the impacts of these synoptic and local monsoonal circulations on the source moisture variability of precipitation in the studied tropical regions have been traced using stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater 4 2 stable isotopic composition of rainwater in southwest coast of india the inferences drawn from the stable isotopic composition of rainwater in south india and other tropical regions as well as that of the river and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats have allowed to discuss the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h and d excess variability in rainwater of the swarna madisal river basin in this section the overall average values for amount weighted isotopic composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin were 3 44 0 6 for δ18o 17 15 7 for δ2h and 10 4 2 for d excess with the representative of three stations i e santhekatte in shoreline manipal close to coast and hebri inland the rainwater oxygen isotope ratios δ18o 3 1 0 5 excluding one storm effect sample were similar to the reported average values for river water δ18o 3 09 0 05 and groundwater δ18o 3 11 0 02 in the swarna madisal basin tripti et al 2016 the average value of amount weighted δ18o reported for the rainwater further south in bakrabail during 2013 was 2 84 0 3 this study calicut during 2005 2007 was 3 5 0 3 and 1997 2007 was 2 9 0 2 warrier et al 2010 kochi during 2015 2016 was 3 62 0 3 weighted mean value calculated from aneesh et al 2019 thiruvananthapuram also called trivandrum during 2009 2010 was 4 9 0 7 weighted mean values calculated from hameed et al 2016 while during june 2010 december 2013 was 3 7 3 2 rahul and ghosh 2018 and for the kerala stretch during 2012 was 2 84 1 6 lekshmy et al 2014 the rainwater isotopic characteristics in these regions have demonstrated the dominance of monsoon moisture provenance due to the seasonal itcz variability i e moisture from the equatorial northern indian ocean and southern part of arabian sea during the summer monsoon season while the winter monsoon moisture is mainly from the bay of bengal provenance over south india the rainwater of these southern regions provides an insight to the rainwater isotopic characteristics in the swarna madisal basin this is because the southwesterly winds carrying summer monsoon moisture to the studied tropical river basin generally passes through the similar regional stretch from its oceanic source and experiences similar seasonal monsoon circulation pattern as represented by the air mass backward trajectory fig 4 also the river and groundwater in the tropical monsoonal river basins usually demonstrate the precipitation isotopic signature as it forms the main water recharge source component and also the terrestrial hydrological compartments in the tropics experience relatively less evaporation effect under high humid conditions compared to mid latitude temperate regions the seasonal dissemination of rainwater isotopic characteristics may further provide an insight to the rainwater vapour source and the major secondary processes impacting the source signals 4 3 seasonal rainwater isotopic variability in humid tropical river basin of southwest india the seasonal itcz variability over the indian ocean formulates the arabian sea and the bay of bengal as two distinct seasonal provenance platform for the indian monsoon moisture mooley and shukla 1987 webster et al 1998 gadgil 2003 with their unique isotopic signatures bhattacharya et al 2003 warrier et al 2010 breitenbach et al 2010 singh et al 2010 achyuthan et al 2013 deshpande et al 2013 in south india the rainwater of calicut the nearest gnip station to bakrabail station and the swarna madisal basin in the west coast of india indicated a clear dual monsoon isotopic effect with lower d excess values corresponding to higher oxygen isotope ratios during summer monsoon season while the higher d excess values corresponded to lower oxygen isotope ratios during winter monsoon season warrier et al 2010 the temporal variability of rainwater δ18o and d excess in bakrabail station and the three sampled locations in the swarna madisal basin have been plotted to understand the seasonal isotopic variability of tropical rainwater in humid regions fig 5 the seasonal isotopic difference for the weighted mean values of rainwater in observed stations were assessed to realize the dual monsoon moisture effect the monthly rainwater of bakrabail station displayed a clear seasonal trend with higher δ18o values during summer monsoon season and lower δ18o values during winter monsoon season similar to calicut dual monsoon isotopic signature nearest gnip station warrier et al 2010 the seasonal δ18o variability of rainwater in bakrabail reflected the control of prevailing air masses over the region which is further supported by the hysplit backward trajectory fig 4 the seasonal isotopic difference showed 1 8 and 15 7 depletion for heavy isotopes in δ18o and δ2h respectively during the winter monsoon relative to that of summer monsoon in bakrabail the relatively higher δ18o and δ2h values for rainwater of bakrabail were observed during summer monsoon due to the moisture trade winds from the equatorial indian ocean and adjacent arabian sea the winter monsoonal rains from the depressions and severe cyclonic storms over the bay of bengal resulted in lower isotopic composition for the observed period however the d excess values did not show much variability between seasons and remained higher than 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 throughout the study period the secondary processes led to high d excess under kinetic fractionation effect this is possible due to the continental source moisture contribution to the condensing vapour in the wetter soil annual rainfall of 3500 mm and higher vegetation agricultural land dense forest covered region the intense continental moisture recycling over the middle region of kerala have been reported earlier hameed et al 2016 the higher regional recycling ratio 0 16 of maximum and a subsequent higher recycled precipitation 1 5 mm day have been reported over the indian sub continent during summer monsoon pathak et al 2014 the increased convective rain characteristics during recent decades has also been reported for the west coast of india sreenath et al 2022 the measured rainwater isotopic composition of bakrabail exhibited the following relative seasonal trend high d excess 16 6 and high δ18o values 3 46 for summer monsoon high d excess 15 3 and low δ18o 5 26 values for winter monsoon and relatively low d excess 14 1 and high δ18o 3 90 values during pre monsoon season the relatively higher δ18o values during summer monsoon and pre monsoon could be due to seasonally heavy isotope enriched ism contribution and minor impact from sub cloud evaporation effect on falling rain drop respectively clark and fritz 1997 whereas the higher d excess reflected the recycled moisture contribution from the continent to the atmospheric vapour under warm temperature 25 c and high relative humidity 85 in regional tropical settings salati et al 1979 the rainwater d excess of summer monsoon was slightly higher than that of winter monsoon due to higher local moisture recycling the climatic characteristics of relatively wetter condition higher rainfall amount coupled with warm temperature usually 25 30 c during summer monsoon than during winter monsoon limited rainfall provides sufficient moisture medium for local recycling in the presence of dense vegetation agriculture lands forest and water bodies and further lead to local precipitation effect however the d excess remained always greater than 10 craig 1961 and 14 warrier et al 2010 this indicates the dominant contribution of terrestrially recycled moisture source craig and gordon 1965 zimmermann et al 1967 to the rainwater isotopic composition in bakrabail station similar observations were reported for the tropical forest ecosystems of amazon and congo basins salati et al 1979 sonntag et al 1979 gat and matsui 1991 niger delta ohwoghere asuma et al 2021 and other tropical regions influenced by similar indian monsoon circulation pattern like that in ethiopia and kenya levin et al 2009 the plot of stable isotope ratios of oxygen and d excess values as a function of time daily scale for the sampled rainwater in two locations coast near the eastern arabian sea and inland at foothills of the western ghats of the swarna madisal basin does not represent the isotopic seasonal trend dual monsoon isotopic pattern which is in contrast to the observed seasonality for the calicut rainwater however the rainwater of manipal few km away from coast still displayed the seasonality from dual monsoonal precipitation system of indian monsoon in its isotopic composition fig 5 the lower d excess values corresponded to higher oxygen isotope ratios and vice versa within the same season for rainwater of santhekatte the measured values of δ18o δ2h and d excess in most samples of coastal rainwater were close to isotopic composition of water from the eastern arabian sea δ18o 0 2 δ2h 0 7 and d excess 1 2 tripti et al 2016 for the study period few rainwater samples in santhekatte exhibited much lower δ18o than its average value for the study period and they displayed higher depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen than that of the calicut rainwater during summer monsoon season the d excess values of these samples were also higher than that of the calicut this indicates that the coastal rainwater close to the arabian sea did not show a clear summer monsoon isotopic effect summer monsoon enriched δ18o and δ2h values during the study period as observed elsewhere in the west coast the relatively lower isotopic composition depleted in 2h and 18o of three rainwater samples in santhekatte during summer monsoon is due to the large scale convective activity at the oceanic moisture source region which was also reported for the same period further south in kerala stretch lekshmy et al 2014 moreover the sample of early winter monsoon october was influenced by the air mass from nearby arabian sea as observed from the backward trajectory not drawn here which further supports the observation of less seasonality in santhekatte the rainwater samples of manipal showed lower d excess values corresponding to higher oxygen isotope ratios and vice versa throughout the study period similar to that of coastal rainwater santhekatte however the relatively lower δ18o values and higher d excess of rainwater during april and october than that of june september represented higher depletion of heavy isotopes of oxygen 18o and hydrogen 2h in rainwater of pre monsoon and winter monsoon seasons compared to summer monsoon season in manipal following the dual monsoon seasonal trend for calicut rainwater δ18o moreover the extreme lower δ18o with extreme higher d excess values of the two rainwater samples april and october in manipal indicated the stronger seasonal storm effect deep depression cyclone at oceanic source india meteorological department the observed lower isotopic composition of rainwater from the effect of deep depression low pressure system was also reported for rainwater in the kerala stretch during the same period lekshmy et al 2015 the rainwater samples of hebri inland region displayed lower d excess values with higher oxygen isotope ratios and vice versa during summer monsoon season while the higher d excess values corresponded with higher oxygen isotope ratios during winter monsoon season fig 5 these inland rainwater samples exhibited less effect of seasonality on the δ18o and d excess trend the temporal isotopic variability of rainwater in hebri reflected the higher effect of continental recycled moisture on the condensing vapour this is possible due to evaporation from wetter soils and inland water bodies while there exists also the high evapotranspiration at the foothills of the evergreen forest of the western ghats the higher evapotranspiration over the continent is often the case in high rainfall region having dense forest and agricultural vegetation hsieh et al 1998 transpiration forms the largest water output flux in the tropical ecosystem and has higher contribution to the continental atmospheric vapour jasechko et al 2013 there are studies supporting vapour isotopic enrichment from evaporation of wet soils zimmermann et al 1967 walker et al 1988 as well as transpiration dubbert et al 2014 few inland rainwater samples n 3 of september represented sea water composition of the eastern arabian sea this indicates that the marine source vapour for these rainwater samples did not undergo major rainout of heavy isotopes before reaching the condensation location at hebri this is possible considering the short river length aerial distance for the marine moisture transport pathway in the swarna madisal basin thus there is a continuous availability of higher marine moisture in the basin which potentially mask the rainout effect in the inland region for the rainwater samples of swarna madisal river basin having higher δ18o and lower d excess i e close to eastern arabian sea water isotopic composition δ18o 0 2 and d excess 1 2 it may be representative of first condensate from marine source vapours which were formed under fast evaporation at the nearby ocean travelled over a short distance or sub cloud evaporation of falling rain drop dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 clark and fritz 1997 similar lower d excess were also reported during the summer monsoon in other tropical regions warrier et al 2010 chakraborty et al 2016 rahul and ghosh 2018 wolf et al 2020 few rainwater samples of relatively high elevation locations manipal n 2 and hebri n 1 showed much lower d excess with lower δ18o values during the wet summer monsoon daily rainfall amount around 40 mm the low δ18o represents the lower mean condensate temperature in the inland local scale for the less rained out marine source vapours dansgaard 1964 while the low d excess reflects partial sub cloud evaporation effect on the falling rain drop the seasonal rainwater isotopic trend allows a clear source tracking of monsoon moisture and its evolution along the travel path in the swarna madisal basin with limited dual monsoon isotopic effect though for the year 2012 no rainfall occurrence was recorded during january march and december in the three chosen locations of the study basin the inter annual rainwater samples or the monthly bulk may help to identify any further dominant seasonal trend in the isotopic composition of rainwater however the observations from interannual variability 2011 2013 of surface and sub surface water in the swarna madisal basin also exhibited no much seasonal isotopic trend seasonal δ18o difference 0 07 for river water and 0 03 for groundwater further south the river and groundwater of the larger nethravati gurupur basin demonstrated observable seasonal isotopic variability seasonal δ18o difference 0 5 0 6 tripti et al 2016 interestingly another southwest river basin chaliyar which hosts the calicut gnip station exhibited lower seasonal δ18o difference of about 1 for groundwater compared to that about 3 for river water hameed et al 2015 while there was a significant seasonal isotopic variability in calicut rainwater seasonal difference in δ18o 4 5 warrier et al 2010 hameed et al 2016 in addition it was reported that the contribution from evaporated rainwater in this case due to canopy interception resulted in higher δ18o values of highland region groundwater in chaliyar river basin which further limited the isotopic elevation effect thus the observed limited seasonal effect on rainwater isotopic composition in the swarna madisal basin is due to two main factors i the river basin hosts continuous availability of monsoon moisture from the arabian sea warrier et al 2010 as it forms the wettest region annual rainfall amount of 3000 6000 mm in the west coast and ii the climate of this region exhibits warm temperature 25 35 c and high relative humidity 70 99 along with dense vegetation which supports higher terrestrial moisture recycling in these humid tropical river basins gat and matsui 1991 bu et al 2018 moreover the region receives only limited winter monsoon 5 10 from north easterly winds carrying bay of bengal moisture except for the strong storms developed by oceanic low pressure systems with characteristic lower isotopic composition i e rain extremely depleted in 2h and 18o 4 4 secondary processes governing tropical rainwater isotopic composition the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in the condensing vapour may undergo variable fractionation due to the effect of secondary processes like evaporation or evapotranspiration during its continental evolution high evapotranspiration has been reported elsewhere in the tropics schellekens et al 2000 the basin characteristics of a humid tropical zone with evergreen forest and warm climate settings support the isotopic fractionation of the incoming oceanic monsoon moisture by secondary processes effect as reported for the tropical river basins in africa and south america salati et al 1979 sonntag et al 1979 this can be identified from the relationship of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios fig 6 and fig 7 and the magnitude of d excess fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 it can be observed from the relationship of δ18o and δ2h values that most rainwater samples 95 in the swarna madisal basin were either above 47 5 or below 47 5 the global meteoric water line gmwl forming two distinct groups and only few samples 5 were falling on the gmwl fig 7 the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater samples in two stations santhekatte and manipal close to the arabian sea were mostly below or on the gmwl while that in the inland station hebri at the foothills of the western ghats were above the gmwl indicating influence of different meteorological conditions at the moisture source region however the air mass backward trajectory indicates the similar seasonal oceanic moisture sources for these stations which further suggests the higher isotopic control by secondary processes at the local precipitation site 4 4 1 local meteoric water line lmwl in humid tropics of south india the local meteoric water line lmwl obtained from the linear relationship of δ18o and δ2h in local rainwater indicates the different source moisture contribution and its fluctuation at the condensing region the lmwl obtained for the precipitation in india further referred as imwl has the slope of 7 93 0 06 and intercept of 9 94 0 51 kumar et al 2010 whereas that for the nearest gnip station calicut cmwl has the slope of 7 6 and intercept of 10 4 warrier et al 2010 the lmwls for the humid tropical regions of southwest india obtained in this study suggests that except the manipal station to some extent the remaining three stations didn t reflect the simple oceanic disturbance and rather had significant regional hydrological control craig 1961 which has been discussed in detail in this section however considering the limitation of short term sampling in the swarna madisal basin the lmwls were deduced to explain each sample isotopic characteristics further labelled as two groups group 1 for samples below gmwl and group 2 for samples above gmwl rather than general meteoric line in the studied river basin the lmwl obtained for the rainwater of bakrabail further referred as bmwl fig 6 and table 1 showed slightly higher slope 8 19 than that of gmwl cmwl and imwl indicating relatively low condensation temperature in humid tropics of southwest india eventually the bmwl falls above the gmwl and cmwl in the plot of δ18o and δ2h relationship fig 6 a the bmwl also displayed higher intercept 16 1 than that of gmwl imwl and cmwl this indicated the dominant contribution from continental recycled vapours i e evaporation of wet soils and transpiration of heavy isotope enriched soil water by plants further referred as evapotranspiration than atmospheric moisture from maritime craig and gordon 1965 allison et al 1985 leaney et al 1985 flanagan and ehleringer 1991 roden and ehleringer 1999 barbour et al 2004 this is possible considering the higher vegetation covered lands in bakrabail which also supports the misty condition during summer and winter monsoons like in other tropical montane cloud forest ecosystem rhodes et al 2006 scholl et al 2009 for example in altiplano yungas transect bolivia gonfiantini et al 2001 the lmwl was δ2h 8 01 0 08 δ18o 15 2 0 7 for the 132 monthly data points while that in the central vietnam wolf et al 2020 the lmwl during wet winter monsoon october november and relatively dry period december may was δ2h 8 5 0 6 δ18o 16 3 3 similarly the lmwl in eastern puerto rico scholl and murphy 2014 was found to be δ2h 8 2 δ18o 14 r2 0 98 while in the monteverde costa rica rhodes et al 2006 the lmwl was δ2h 8 6 δ18o 14 3 and in the san francisco catchment southern ecuador windhorst et al 2013 the lmwl was δ2h 8 31 δ18o 14 5 the continuous availability of recycled moisture during both monsoon seasons in bakrabail permitted higher terrestrial convective effect on vapour source of rainwater while the sub cloud evaporation effect on the condensing vapour was minimal for the study period under humid condition the seasonal lmwls of bakrabail were also similar to that observed in other tropical montane cloud forest ecosystems with slope 8 close to gmwl while the intercept is much higher 16 the lmwl of summer monsoon referred as sm lmwl in fig 6 a had slightly lower slope than gmwl indicating warm temperature effect of the tropics even during wet season however the higher intercept indicated higher moisture recycling the lmwl of pre monsoon referred as pm lmwl in fig 6 a showed higher slope indicating lower condensation temperature than summer monsoon while the intercept was similar to that of summer monsoon indicating convective effect this suggests that the low condensation temperature for the rainwater in bakrabail during dry pre monsoon season might have been temporarily imposed by the large convective activity at the oceanic scale than that over the continent it has to be noted that the lowest rainwater isotopic composition observed in the region was for pre monsoon this further supports the observation that the local high temperature of the dry season was overridden by the higher rainfall occurred due to low pressure systems depressions developed in the ocean the lmwl of winter monsoon referred as wm lmwl in fig 6 a displayed relatively higher slope and intercept than other two seasons suggesting lower condensation temperature and maximum moisture recycling process in the region thus it can be inferred that the microclimatic condition was unique at the local scale with the availability of higher recycled moisture compared to the large scale climate setting based on the observed isotopic relationship fig 6 b and fig 7 it can be inferred that the three locations in the swarna madisal river basin exhibited different source meteorological conditions for monsoon moisture which are reflected by two distinct meteoric water lines and are placed parallel to the gmwl the description of lmwls in individual stations of the swarna madisal basin are given in supplementary material file the two groups of samples along with their local meteoric water lines fig 7 allowed to fingerprint the secondary processes effect on the original oceanic source vapours in the humid tropics of southwest india the overall lmwl obtained by combining all stations in the swarna madisal river basin was similar to local meteoric water line of hebri hmwl with slope of 6 98 and intercept 5 9 r2 0 95 indicating that the condensing vapours were an admixture of original oceanic vapours and terrestrially recycled moisture this was supported by the two groups which indicated similar slopes 7 40 and 7 56 for their lmwls while the intercept was lower 3 38 for lmwl 1 and higher 11 5 for lmwl 2 the overall lmwl 1 of the swarna madisal river basin was similar to that of the cameroon rainwater with five year observation slope 7 32 0 21 and intercept 4 9 1 4 gonfiantini et al 2001 and that of the daily precipitation during summer monsoon in central usa with two year observation slope 7 53 0 26 and intercept 2 07 1 49 tian et al 2018 while the overall lmwl 2 of the basin was similar to other tropical regions with higher intercept for the overall rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin the lmwl monthly mean was found to be δ2h 7 19 δ18o 7 54 r2 0 98 fig 6 b and the lmwl event scale for the identified two groups fig 7 were i lmwl 1 δ2h 7 40 δ18o 3 38 r2 0 96 ii lmwl 2 δ2h 7 56 δ18o 11 53 r2 0 99 the climate change impact on the precipitation during the anthropocene can result in uncertainty of the meteoric water lines at local to global scales the increased frequency of depressions and cyclonic storms in the tropical oceanic region as well as the prolonged drought have been arbitrary irrespective of the season during the recent decades consequently this has a substantial effect on the obtained local meteoric water lines the rainwater samples in the studied monsoon dominated tropical river basin swarna madisal basin of southwest india indicated two distinct lines within the same station which were parallel to global meteoric water line and independent of seasons thus the study suggests that the meteoric water line in the tropical stations can be defined as an integrated isotopic reflection of local and regional moisture along with its synoptic seasonal change 4 4 2 deuterium excess variability in tropical rainwater of south india the d excess values of precipitation vary with the meteorological conditions at the moisture source region and kinetic fractionation during evaporation and is independent of kinetic fractionation during condensation or the atmospheric processes effect dansgaard 1964 merlivat and jouzel 1979 gat 1980 thus the magnitude of d excess fig 8 and its relationship with δ18o fig 9 and fig 10 of rainwater are useful in identifying the dominance of evaporation or moisture recycling effect froelich et al 2008 the continental moisture recycling process may dominate either due to the natural terrestrial moisture feedback mechanisms or the higher anthropogenic pressure few studies reported higher isotopic variability in the highly vegetated tropics due to evapotranspiration like that in amazon salati et al 1979 and congo sonntag et al 1979 basins while in the temperate mid latitude regions transpiration did not result in much isotopic variability zimmermann et al 1967 the evergreen and deciduous forest vegetation and water bodies in upstream and midstream region supports higher evapotranspiration the evaporation and evapotranspiration of moisture from the wetter soils of these tropical forests forest runoff water δ18o 2 7 d excess 10 5 tripti et al 2018 can lead to mixing of re evaporated vapours which are characteristics of relatively higher d excess values than the original atmospheric vapour zimmermann et al 1967 the higher anthropogenic pressure also leads to terrestrial moisture contribution to the atmospheric vapour at the condensation site this contribution is mainly from the agricultural lands 30 of land use land cover in this basin spread across the river basin for example the dominant paddy cultivation in the basin provides a platform for the moisture with heavier isotopic composition paddy field water δ18o 1 6 d excess 3 5 tripti et al 2018 to escape from vegetation covered standing water in the form of evapotranspiration moreover the high humid condition 75 95 and the smaller area of the river basin provides a strong convective platform for the higher distribution of these recycled evapotranspiration vapours with relative enrichment of 2h and 18o than the original atmospheric vapours from incoming maritime the terrestrial convective activity is reflected by the higher δ18o corresponding with higher d excess values of rainwater for hebri and manipal than santhekatte shoreline in the swarna madisal basin the higher d excess values i e around 20 were also observed for river and groundwater in the same river basin tripti et al 2013 tripti et al 2016 tripti et al 2018 as well as further south in nethravati gurupur river basin lambs et al 2011 gurumurthy et al 2015 tripti et al 2013 tripti et al 2016 tripti et al 2018 and chaliyar basin hameed et al 2015 which hosts the gnip calicut station this further supports the observation of contribution from the terrestrially recycled moisture to the natural water resources rain river and groundwater in the humid tropical river basins of southwest india the rainwater in hebri shows annual and summer monsoon weighted mean isotopic composition similar to the forest runoff while that of summer monsoon rainwater in manipal also reflected the same this suggests higher effect of transpiration rather than evaporation in the swarna madisal river basin most of the rainwater samples 53 in the swarna madisal river basin exhibited d excess values in the range of 10 18 while the remaining samples were in the range of 1 10 fig 8 this clearly indicated that the rainwater in the basin was generated from the vapours which were subjected to different kinetic isotopic fractionation either during evaporation at oceanic source region or evapotranspiration in the continental river basin the details of magnitude and distribution frequency of d excess in individual stations are given in supplementary material file in general the d excess in santhekatte coast rainwater supported the observation of fast evaporation from nearby sea as well as sub cloud evaporation effect while the inland rainwater hebri bakrabail supported higher terrestrial moisture recycling effect in the swarna madisal river basin the higher d excess values usually with lower or higher δ18o of rainwater represented respectively the impact of large scale convective activity over the oceanic source region or the higher continental moisture recycling effect on the stable isotopes of condensing moisture respectively fig 9 and fig 10 the rainwater of santhekatte showed a sharp decrease in d excess value with increase in δ18o indicating the significance of dominant isotopic diffusion process r2 0 6 fig 9 similar inverse relation but with a relatively lower slope was observed for rainwater of manipal r2 0 4 and calicut r2 0 4 the decrease in d excess with increase in δ18o was not significant r2 0 01 for the rainwater of hebri the bakrabail rainwater displayed increase in d excess value with δ18o indicating the dominant continental recycling effect on the incoming oceanic source moisture r2 0 1 fig 9 assuming the data points of santhekatte as reference for δ18o d excess deviation for strong rain drop evaporation effect it can be identified that the rainwater of manipal and calicut reflected low rain drop evaporation effect due to strong storm effect during winter monsoon while the rainwater of hebri and bakrabail reflected the orographic cloud condensate and evapotranspiration effects thus it can be inferred that the coastal site experienced higher sub cloud evaporation effect even in the humid tropical regions the global climate change has led to uncertainty in the fraction of advected oceanic monsoon moisture contributing to precipitation this necessitates the study on fingerprinting the regions exhibiting higher moisture recycling over the continent it has been reported that about 34 of moisture recycling occurs over the tropical amazon while the global average over the land is around 10 trenberth 1999 the fraction of precipitation contributed from continental evaporation over south india is reported to be about 30 van der ent et al 2010 the relationship between d excess and δ18o values both weighted mean of rainwater in different regions over southwest india have been plotted to further disseminate the possible source mixing and secondary process effects on the monsoon vapours fig 10 a and 10 b in the simple scatter plot for the annual data observation fig 10 a the rainwater of santhekatte which mainly composed summer monsoon samples was considered as a reference end member for summer monsoon ism while the rainwater of trivandrum composing both ism and winter monsoon iwm samples was considered as an end member for combined effect of ism and iwm and the rainwater of bakrabail as an end member for moisture recycling effect in southwest india the rainwater of agumbe at high altitude of the western ghats was considered as end member for rainfall from orographic cloud effect with limitation due to few representative samples it was found that the orographic precipitation and continental recycling had significant effects liotta et al 2006 on the stable isotopic composition of rainwater in hebri which is located at the foothills of agumbe in the windward side the rainwater of manipal was in the range of ism iwm effect due to the influence of strong storm effect in winter monsoon for the sampling year the rainwater of calicut and kochi were in centre of three component mixing from ism iwm and orographic rainfall and showed relatively lesser effect from moisture recycling the overall rainwater isotopic composition of the swarna madisal basin in the source mixing analysis plot demonstrated that around 80 of monsoon moisture was under the influence of direct ism and orographic rainfall in the region similar to that observed by the rainfall amount while about 15 was controlled by the continental recycling effect at the precipitation site and 5 by the winter monsoon for the annual scale fig 10 a similarly the scatter plot of secondary process dissemination during the summer monsoon season fig 10 b showed that the moisture source for coastal rainwater of santhekatte has undergone low rain out effect 0 27 decrease in δ18o for 660 km during its transport from southern location of trivandrum entry point in southwest coast of india for ism it also reflected that the condensing rain was subjected to slight sub cloud evaporation effect at the precipitation site as reflected by the relatively low d excess in santhekatte the rainwater of manipal and calicut shows influence of both marine moisture and orographic rainfall while that of hebri reflects both orographic rainfall and local moisture recycling effects the overall rainwater isotopic composition during summer monsoon reflects combined effect of orographic rainfall under ism influence as well as terrestrial moisture recycling this study pinpoints that large amount of terrestrially recycled moisture contributes to the inland precipitation in the tropical river basins of southwest india experiencing high humid condition in fig 10 a when the rainwater of one storm effect was excluded in the swarna madisal basin the overall weighted mean composition shifted to the range of ism and orographic cloud effect in addition the d excess was around 10 indicating that the observed continental moisture recycling in the studied river basin had higher effect from transpiration rather than evaporation gat and matsui 1991 further this was verified by comparison with the river water and groundwater in the basin it was observed that the annual rainwater excluding one event of cyclone and inter annual average δ18o of river water and groundwater displayed similar values indicating minimal evaporation effect on the hydrological compartments in the basin while there was a 10 higher variability in the d excess values of latter indicating the effect of evapotranspired moisture contribution which led to the excess of deuterium in river water and groundwater compared to their recharged source of rainwater however this observation has to be considered with limitations as there is no availability of fractions between evaporation and transpiration contributing to evapotranspiration in the region the observed pan evaporation in the mid region of the basin measured at ajekar is about 21 for annual and 8 for summer monsoon while for bakrabail it was 29 for annual and 6 for summer monsoon however the water bodies 15 and built up area 3 covered lesser region than the forest 45 and agricultural crops lands 30 suggesting higher proportion of evapotranspiration rather than direct evaporation in the swarna madisal river basin fig 3 this suggests that the water balance in the swarna madisal basin is maintained by evapotranspiration in the presence of dense vegetation 75 in the region rather than direct evaporation process in the swarna madisal basin the two stations of manipal coast but less possible effect from sea breeze relative to santhekatte and hebri inland were considered to pinpoint the actual moisture recycling contribution these two stations covered much 85 of regional area in the basin the santhekatte rainwater in the shoreline was considered as the region indicating the onset signature incoming moisture of monsoon rainfall in the basin before undergoing much recycling over the continent the study hypothesizes the following isotopic empirical model to be potential to explain the continental moisture recycling observed in the tropical river basins of south india during summer monsoon continental moisture recycling f in d i d c 2 d o d g 100 where di dc do and dg represent the weighted mean d excess values of inland here hebri coastal manipal onset santhekatte and global 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 rainwater respectively while the fraction of 1 f provided the oceanic moisture contribution these fractions can be accounted with limitations as factor like sub cloud evaporation has not been accounted still much useful where there are no meteorological observatory stations to feed the data required for highly complex existing fractionation models it has been estimated that about 28 5 of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin was contributed from the continental moisture recycling in the region while among the individual stations it was 16 for manipal and 41 for hebri when one strong storm effect sample was excluded it further decreases to 3 in manipal and 14 in the swarna madisal river basin therefore this model estimation may be considered with limitation with event rainfall observation and further the monthly observation may provide the robust output the estimated moisture recycling fraction to local rainfall in the swarna madisal was also validated by the two component mixing model which yields the similar output this is supported by the pan evaporation in the basin which indicates 20 of precipitation undergoes evaporation however this fraction may coincide with evapotranspiration rather than direct evaporation as region is widely covered by vegetation 75 and exhibits fewer exposed waterbodies and barren lands 15 the higher continental moisture recycling contribution of about 80 range 30 42 during pre monsoon to 83 during summer monsoon was obtained for bakrabail station with monthly observations this unique response of continent to the atmospheric water balance at local scales between the eastern arabian sea and the western ghats suggests the manifestation of microclimate conditions in south india further the relationship of isotopic data with environmental meteorological and geographical conditions may reflect the local microclimate to mesoscale convective effect on the rainwater source composition 4 5 isotopic storm effect induced by the tropical oceanic convective systems the depressions and cyclones which originated from the bay of bengal during sampling period demonstrated the isotopic storm effect or the extreme event effect on the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin and bakrabail station particularly during the winter monsoon season the isotopic storm effect was observed in manipal for the sampling of october 21st with significant depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen and higher d excess value the δ18o value for this rainwater exhibited the lowest recorded value of 15 6 in the station which is estimated to be about 12 3 lower than the remaining rainwater average similarly the δ2h value also showed the lowest recorded value of 107 4 which is about 91 4 lower than the remaining rainwater average measured in the station such extreme isotopic depletion represents that the vapour for this rainwater was highly saturated which is often the case under cyclonic impact lawrence and gedzelman 1996 gedzelman et al 2003 coplen et al 2008 good et al 2015 li et al 2020 the observed isotopic composition was similar to that of intense storm reported for the tropics formed under kinetic fractionation between these vapours and seawater leading to depletion by upto 15 for vapour δ18o lawrence et al 2004 the first depression of the winter monsoon season in 2012 was reported by the india meteorological department for the date of october 10th which occurred in bay of bengal this was followed by the cyclonic storms during october 22 26 western part of arabian sea and october 28 november 01 bay of bengal the depression of october 10th was developed in bay of bengal as a remnant of severe cyclonic storm gaemi that occurred over the pacific ocean india meteorological department however the effect was seen much towards the north eastern part of india and bangladesh rather than the study area which suggests less memory effect moreover the inland rainwater sampled at hebri on the previous day did not represent this extreme isotopic depletion the observed lowest δ18o and δ2h values of october 21st in manipal station is due to the early storm signatures from the later appeared cyclones either of the western arabian sea murjan or bay of bengal nilam the cyclone track of murjan shows less effect on the sampling region however the air mass backward trajectory confirms the bay of bengal moisture origin to this rainwater the seasonal average of rainwater isotopic composition in bakrabail displayed relatively lower δ18o and δ2h values during winter monsoon than summer monsoon the winter monsoon for the rainwater sampling year in bakrabail exhibited rainfall under the influence of severe storms from the bay of bengal the moisture contribution from the severe cyclonic storm helen very severe cyclonic storm lehar followed by a depression all during november and a very severe cyclonic storm madi during december in bay of bengal have resulted in significant depletion in heavy isotopes of rainwater in bakrabail during the winter monsoon season the effect of cyclone phailin was relatively lesser on the rainwater isotopic composition during october the air mass trajectories not drawn here and cyclone tracks india meteorological department also support the possible moisture contribution from these severe cyclonic storms of november and december and lesser effect during october under the influence of storm effect in bakrabail the heavy isotope depletion in rainwater during december was relatively higher of about 3 1 for δ18o and 24 9 for δ2h when compared to october while that during november is about 2 5 for δ18o and 23 2 for δ2h the isotopic storm effect was also reported for the same period november in the highlands of the western ghats at ooty with extreme depletion in heavy isotopes of two rainwater and nearby surface and sub surface water tripti et al 2019 however the bakrabail rainwater was enriched with heavy isotopes by an average of about 11 1 in δ18o and 82 5 in δ2h when compared to rainwater of ooty for the monsoon affected by same tropical storms during november the observed isotopic difference could be due to the monthly cumulative observation of rainwater in bakrabail when compared to event sampling in ooty which is also supported by the higher cumulative isotopic composition of surface and surface water of ooty moreover the moisture travelling over a long distance from the bay of bengal may also lose much of its airmass amount on its traverse over the higher mountains of the western ghats before reaching the west coast of india leading to absence of rainout effect lekshmy et al 2015 however the observation of event rainfall sampling in manipal for isotopic storm effect showed similar isotopic composition as that of the ooty rainwater but from a different cyclone during previous sampling year though both had moisture from bay of bengal origin thus the heavy isotope enrichment of rainwater in bakrabail relative to ooty which were impacted by the same cyclonic storm could be due to the difference in monthly bulk and event sampling as well as higher continental moisture recycling effect rather than the traversing moisture loss the higher moisture recycling is supported by the higher d excess value than that of winter monsoon d excess 14 warrier et al 2010 observed in gnip calicut station similarly the monthly bulk effect is supported by lower isotopic composition of rainwater during december which recorded one rainfall though lowest unrecorded rainfall occurred effectively compared to november which had higher mixing from different rain events 4 6 relationship of rainwater isotopic composition with environmental conditions in the humid tropics the effect of temperature on regional rainwater composition can be studied with the seasonal isotopic variability rainfall amount effect and elevation effect dansgaard 1964 the isotopic composition of water spring river and groundwater long term regional water representatives along the west coast and the western ghats demonstrated low temperature effect δδ18o δt 0 016 c r2 0 004 δδ2h δt 0 5 c r2 0 1 and δd excess δt 0 47 c r2 0 06 for the low relief mountains 700 m asl while a significant high temperature effect δδ18o δt 0 65 c r2 0 7 δδ2h δt 3 4 c r2 0 5 and δd excess δt 1 8 c r2 0 6 was observed for the higher altitude mountains 1900 m asl influenced by strong storms as reported in earlier study tripti et al 2019 the reported study exhibited overall intermediate temperature effect δδ18o δt 0 36 c r2 0 8 δδ2h δt 2 5 c r2 0 8 and δd excess δt 0 38 c r2 0 2 along mountain ranges of south west coast and high altitude of the western ghats india for the region covering 120 km width inland from the arabian sea west to east transect coastal stretch of 500 km north to south transect and elevation between 2 m and 2300 m above msl the limited seasonal isotopic variability as explained in earlier section section 4 3 supports low temperature effect in the swarna madisal river basin the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in three stations along the swarna madisal river basin during summer monsoon shows that the rainfall originated from the orographic clouds which represented the early stage condensate formed at temperatures near the land surface and typically they are characterized by enriched heavy stable isotopic composition ingraham and matthews 1988 rhodes et al 2006 2010 scholl et al 2007 rather than the depletion from amount effect rain out effect and elevation effect dansgaard 1964 the correlation analysis of isotopic composition with pan evaporation showed negative low r values indicating poor temperature effect except for the pre monsoon in the swarna madisal basin the low temperature effect suggests higher amount effect in the tropics rozanski et al 1993 further the detailed analysis of rainfall amount distance to sea and elevation of the sampling locations can provide insights to the local temperature effect in the humid tropics if any and is discussed in the following sub sections 4 6 1 amount effect on rainwater isotopic composition the reconstruction of past monsoon from palaeo archives tree rings speleothem marine sediments carbonates etc to understand the earth s long term climate has been carried out with the assumption of rainfall amount effect the amount effect is defined as the progressive depletion of heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation with the increase in amount of regional precipitation dansgaard 1964 the amount effect suggests a decrease in δ18o by 1 5 for the global observation dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 and 1 4 for the tropics 30 ns latitudes kurita 2013 per 100 mm of rainfall amount the amount effect on the rainwater isotopic composition of tropical islands displayed a slope of 0 02 per mm for δ18o rozanski et al 1993 however for the low elevation tropical regions the slope has always remained lower due to higher evapotranspiration effect salati et al 1979 gat and matsui 1991 gonfiantini et al 2001 the isotopic composition of water spring water river water and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats showed an overall positive amount effect with slope of 0 06 for δ18o r2 0 2 0 41 for δ2h r2 0 2 and 0 05 for d excess r2 0 03 per 100 mm of rainfall due to the prevailing orographic precipitation and continental moisture recycling effect in the region tripti et al 2019 the relationship of stable isotopic composition of rainwater with rainfall amount is explored in the swarna madisal river basin to understand the possible amount effect in the humid tropical river basin of the western ghats and its narrow west coast south india fig 11 the relationship between rainfall amount and unweighted rainwater isotopic compositions of all three station in the swarna madisal river basin on event scale showed inverse linear trend with slope of 0 34 for δ18o r2 0 003 and 0 95 for δ2h r2 0 001 per 100 mm which represented general amount effect fig 11 a the slope improved slightly to 0 6 per mm for δ18o r2 0 02 and 2 5 for δ2h r2 0 01 per 100 mm when one sample of cyclonic storm effect in manipal was excluded not drawn here for the event scale rainwater samples in individual station not drawn here of the swarna madisal basin the rainfall amount vs δ18o unweighted values trend displayed the general negative amount effect in santhekatte slope δδ18o δp 0 019 mm 1 and δδ2h δp 0 102 mm 1 both r2 0 2 while the slightly positive amount effect was observed in manipal δδ18o δp 0 02 mm 1 and δδ2h δp 0 106 mm 1 both r2 0 1 and hebri δδ18o δp 0 004 mm 1 r2 0 1 and δδ2h δp 0 056 mm 1 r2 0 1 for the annual observation in three tropical stations the general amount effect was reflected in the coastal rainwater santhekatte while the higher terrestrial vapour recycling and the first condensate of orographic cloud masked the amount effect in inland regions hebri and manipal as observed elsewhere in the humid tropics salati et al 1979 sonntag et al 1979 scholl et al 2007 scholl et al 2009 the difference in isotopic amount effect within the small river basin of the humid tropics fingerprints the occurrence of microclimatic conditions between the west coast and western ghats south india the inverse relationship between total sampled rainfall amount and weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin during the ism reflected significant amount effect in the studied humid tropical river basin fig 11 b the overall amount effect in the swarna madisal basin during ism exhibited an observable change in δ18o by 0 21 r2 0 7 while δ2h changed by 2 03 r2 0 5 and d excess by 0 36 r2 0 1 per 100 mm of rainfall amount the correlation analysis of isotopic composition with rainfall amount also showed negative r values for the overall basin as well as coastal rainwater while the positive r values were exhibited for inland stations bakrabail manipal and hebri demonstrating prevailing local moisture effect on incoming maritime composition for the monthly rainwater of bakrabail there was an observable change in δ18o and δ2h by 0 24 and 2 1 respectively per 100 mm increase in rainfall amount suggesting positive amount effect r2 0 2 fig 12 a the seasonal trend for the relationship of δ18o with rainfall amount in bakrabail station exhibited change by 0 004 0 015 and 0 024 per mm respectively during the summer monsoon r2 0 55 ism winter monsoon r2 0 99 iwm and pre monsoon r2 0 1 pre ism period fig 12 b the negative amount effect during pre monsoon season was due to the large scale oceanic convective activity rather than local amount effect as explained earlier in section 4 4 1 the rainwater of bakrabail showed positive amount effect for annual summer monsoon and winter monsoon observations similar to annual observation of manipal and hebri indicating higher distribution of terrestrially recycled vapours in the humid tropical vegetation zones further the observed positive δ18o change with rainfall amount i e slope δ18o δp in bakrabail was similar to that in hebri 0 003 mm 1 this study and gnip calicut 0 003 0 001 mm 1 warrier et al 2010 while it was lower than that of mangalore 0 008 0 002 mm 1 yadava et al 2007 the δ18o δp values of the observed rainwater stations in this study were also in the range obtained for rainwater from the southern stretches of kerala δ18o δp 0 009 to 0 004 mm 1 and sri lanka δ18o δp 0 023 to 0 001 mm 1 which are largely influenced by ism lekshmy et al 2015 4 6 2 continental effect on rainwater isotopic composition the continental effect is defined as the progressive depletion of heavy isotopes 18o and 2h respectively of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation as the monsoon air mass traverse over the continent dansgaard 1964 the continental effect formulates heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen present in source vapour to fall down as rain droplets during the first condensate near the coast while the remaining vapour reaching more inland locations are enriched with their lighter isotopes 16o and 1h globally there has been variable isotopic gradients for continental effect depending on the topography geographical location season and climate the observed continental effect resulted in isotopic gradient of about 0 2 to 0 4 in δ18o for global observation dansgaard 1964 0 075 in δ18o for the tropical amazon basin salati et al 1979 0 3 in δ18o for southern patogonean andes stern and blisniuk 2002 0 33 in δ18o for europe sonntag et al 1979 rozanski et al 1993 3 3 and 1 5 in δ2h during winter and summer monsoon respectively in central europe rozanski et al 1982 and 2 4 in δ18o and 20 in δ2h for colder season in adriatic pannonian region while the same region represented no significant continental effect for the summer monsoon and rest of the year kern et al 2020 all gradients with respect to per 100 km the isotopic study on the spring river water and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats tripti et al 2019 demonstrated intermediate continental effect slope was 0 02 for δ18o r2 0 2 and 0 23 for δ2h r2 0 3 per km for inland distance of 45 km from coast for the low relief regions 700 m asl the overall gradient with a width covering 120 km between the arabian sea coast and different high altitude mountain ranges in the western ghats demonstrated higher continental effect with slope of 3 5 for δ18o r2 0 6 and 27 4 for δ2h r2 0 6 per 100 km the d excess exhibited higher values throughout the western stretch of the western ghats which posed no significant continental effect from coast to inland the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin during summer monsoon fig 13 shows that the inland location hebri exhibits higher δ18o and δ2h values than that of the coastal location santhekatte this demonstrates the reduced continental isotope gradient in rainwater of the studied humid tropical river basin during ism the relationship of weighted mean rainwater isotopic composition in the swarna madisal river basin with its location distance from the eastern arabian sea coast demonstrated that there is an increase in δ18o by 0 029 per km r2 0 65 δ2h by 0 38 per km r2 0 84 and d excess by 0 15 per km r2 0 99 in western part of the western ghats fig 13 similar positive but low isotopic gradient was observed for annual weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in the basin excluding one extreme event sample not drawn here however the measured annual average isotopic composition demonstrated not drawn here an isotopic lapse rate of 0 003 per km for δ18o r2 0 025 0 12 per km for δ2h r2 0 97 and 0 14 per km for d excess r2 0 55 the positive continental effect i e inverse general trend reflected by the rainwater isotopic composition in this humid tropical river basin of southwest india is due to the recycling of atmospheric moisture by evapotranspiration ingraham and taylor 1991 ingraham and craig 1993 rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 araguás araguás et al 1998 winnick et al 2014 and the rainwater originating from the heavy isotopes 18o and 2h enriched first condensate of orographic cloud similar to other tropical mountain forest ecosystem ingraham and matthews 1988 scholl et al 2007 rhodes et al 2006 this observation is supported by the geographical location of the studied river basin considering the high altitude western ghats in the eastern edge of the basin which provides orographic barrier to the high amount of incoming monsoon moisture from the arabian sea and equatorial indian ocean also the inland region is dominated by the evergreen forest vegetation triggering canopy interaction and transpiration and wetter soils triggering evaporation which supports higher evapotranspiration thus it can be suggested that the continental effect on rainwater isotopic composition in the tropical mountainous river basins is largely controlled by the prevailing local air mass rather than the rain out effect of marine air mass this observation reflects the dominance of microclimate in the regional tropics between the west coast and the western ghats south india 4 6 3 elevation effect on rainwater isotopic composition continental deformation landscape evolution and climate have been studied with the elevation changes in the earth s surface chamberlain and poage 2000 luo et al 2011 the stable isotopic proxies have been useful in determining palaeo elevation or the palaeo altimetry of the orogenic belts as well as in identifying the recharge site elevation for groundwater in a geographical location siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 chamberlain et al 1999 poage and chamberlain 2001 araguás araguás et al 1998 gonfiantini et al 2001 blisniuk and stern 2005 the isotopic elevation effect also called the altitude effect is defined as the decrease in stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation when the air mass adiabatically rises to a cooler higher elevation gradient dansgaard 1964 as a result the high elevation mountains exhibit lower isotopic composition of precipitation with inverse relationship between δ18o or δ2h in regional water and elevation of the location the global relationship investigated a vertical isotopic gradient of 0 28 for δ18o varies between 0 5 and 0 15 except for the extreme latitudes between 1 14 and 0 64 while for global higher elevation 5000 m which included himalayas was 0 41 per 100 m and 0 24 per 100 m for himalayas only and 1 5 for δ2h varies between 5 and 1 per 100 m of elevation above msl chamberlain and poage 2000 poage and chamberlain 2001 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 holdsworth et al 1991 the evidence of isotopic elevation effect on the spring water river water and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats showed an isotopic lapse rate of 0 09 in δ18o per 100 m above msl for elevation upto 2050 m asl while at the higher elevation 2050 m asl an isotopic lapse rate of 2 5 in δ18o per 100 m above msl was observed under the influence of cyclonic storm tripti et al 2019 the overall isotopic gradient was 0 18 for δ18o and 1 5 for δ2h both r2 0 7 per 100 m of 2 2300 m asl in the western ghats and its west coast south india the gradient between the lowest 2 m asl and highest 2300 m asl points in the western stretch of western ghats showed an isotopic lapse rate of 0 31 for δ18o per 100 m tripti et al 2019 similar to global isotopic lapse rate while it was 0 41 per 100 m asl for the well water between 400 and 1000 m in southwest india deshpande et al 2003 the isotopic elevation effect on rainwater was explored in the swarna madisal basin to understand the temperature induced rain out process adiabatic cooling during uplift in humid tropical regions of south india it was noted that the weighted mean δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater showed positive linear relationship with elevation in the swarna madisal river basin during summer monsoon fig 14 as all three sampling sites in the basin were in low relief regions 100 m the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater from agumbe at the immediate north eastern edge of the basin having elevation of 650 m asl was also considered to obtain an overall isotopic lapse rate in the western part of the western ghats the relationship of sampling site elevation with weighted mean rainwater isotopic composition during the summer monsoon fig 14 demonstrated that there is an increase in δ18o by 0 18 per 100 m above msl r2 0 69 δ2h by 1 8 per 100 m above msl r2 0 59 and d excess by 0 31 per 100 m above msl r2 0 24 for the low relief regions the increase in d excess with elevation has been reported for tropical precipitation gonfiantini et al 2001 the positive elevation effect on rainwater isotopic composition in this humid tropical river basin of southwest india is due to i the first rain condensate from orographic cloud at the foothills of the western ghats which is characteristic of heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen than the incoming rained out marine vapours and ii higher moisture recycling in the region which is supported by higher vegetation high rainfall and warm temperature of the humid tropics the terrestrial recycling effect and the orographic effect has led to lower isotopic elevation effect in different tropical regions like the isotopic lapse rate of 0 12 per 100 m in puerto rico scholl et al 2009 and 0 09 to 0 18 per 100 m in south india deshpande et al 2003 resmi et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 for δ18o moreover the global observation suggests negligible isotopic elevation effect for the low relief regions due to simultaneous effect of different regional environmental factors poage and chamberlain 2001 this supports the influence of microclimatic conditions in humid tropical river basins of the western ghats thus it is important to consider the local meteorological and environmental conditions while determining the palaeo altimetry and the mean elevation of groundwater recharge sites in the mountainous tropical river basins 4 7 comparison of rainwater isotopic inference in wetter regions of india and global tropics using stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater as a tool to fingerprint the oceanic moisture sources and governing local secondary processes the integrated complex effect of geographical vicinity to the arabian sea and low latitude tropics geomorphological evergreen tropical forest ecosystem and orographic upliftment of trade winds by the high altitude mountains of the western ghats and anthropogenic standing water bodies and vegetation covered agricultural lands factors on the rainwater characteristics of humid tropics has been demonstrated in this study the rapid pace of change in tropical forest ecosystem during the anthropocene necessitates the study of natural and anthropogenic impact on the source components of hydrological cycle in humid tropical river basins bruijnzeel et al 2011 lion et al 2017 the indian monsoon mainly controlled by the monsoon moisture from the northern indian ocean has been a major controlling factor of the summer monsoon and winter monsoon rains over several immediate neighbouring countries of india the rainfall variability over these tropical regions forms a primary factor to understand the possible influence of global climate change over the indian sub continent the critical observations on the isotopic fingerprinting of rainwater sources at different locations over the wetter regions of indian west coast northeast regions highest rainfall region in india and other global tropical sites and their controlling factors have been described in this section the reported data available on tropical rainwater isotopic characteristics covering representative locations and the new rainwater data generated from this work have been compiled in table 1 based on the studied rainwater over the humid regions of india and other global tropical regions it is concluded that most regions showcased higher control of precipitation moisture isotopic characteristics by continental factors like evapotranspiration and sub cloud evaporation rather than seasonality this is crucial considering high stress on continental landmass in humid tropical regions during the anthropocene hence this study highlights the need to carry out much robust investigation of rainwater at local to regional scales to better understand the climate change impact on tropical hydrology and sustainable development of water resources in the developing tropics this study also highlights the need for a long term investigation on stable isotopic composition of rainwater in the humid tropics before the global implication in regional palaeoclimate to account for the uncertainty as well as for the sustainable water resource management 5 conclusions the present study investigated the moisture sources to monsoonal rainfall in humid tropical river basin of the western ghats swarna madisal river basin and further south in bakrabail southwest coast of india the integrated approach of stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen and the computed d excess parameter for rainwater has been inferred as a successful tool in fingerprinting the moisture sources for rain and its governing secondary processes in the studied river basin the stable isotopic distribution of rainwater within the swarna madisal river basin demonstrated the unique role of geographical high maritime vapour input due to close vicinity of the eastern arabian sea and windward side of the western ghats geomorphological evapotranspiration from evergreen tropical forest ecosystem and orographic monsoon uplift by the high altitude mountains of the western ghats and anthropogenic evaporation from standing water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation covered agricultural lands factors in controlling source vapours of rainwater in the developing tropical monsoon climatic zone of south india in this study the strong influence of microclimate on the tropical rainwater isotopic composition has been fingerprinted between the west coast and the western ghats south india the oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of coastal rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin showed dominance of marine vapour source from the nearby arabian sea and the equatorial indian ocean the stable isotopic compositions of rainwater were altered during the inland transport of original marine vapours by the recycled vapours from the continental moisture contribution the event scale rainwater isotopic composition did not represent clear seasonality in the swarna madisal river basin however the isotopic storm effect was observed during the winter monsoon northeast monsoon season in manipal with extreme depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen the rainwater of bakrabail demonstrated a strong effect of seasonality on the monthly δ18o variability but its d excess variability was controlled largely by the continental moisture recycling effect the parallel placing of two local meteoric water lines lmwl in the swarna madisal river basin above and below the gmwl suggests that the moisture for rainwater from the indian monsoon in the studied region was generated under two distinct meteorological conditions at the source region however the higher d excess and higher intercept of lmwl cannot be attributed to the low humidity at the oceanic moisture source region in this case and rather indicated continental recycled moisture sources even under high humid condition in southwest india the rainfall amount effect negative in santhekatte and positive in manipal and hebri was not significant on event scale rainwater of three individual tropical stations in the swarna madisal river basin during the study period however there was a significant amount effect on the overall weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater during ism in the studied tropical river basin the monthly rainwater oxygen isotopic composition unweighted values of bakrabail demonstrated positive amount effect for annual observation ism observation and winter monsoon observation whereas it showed significant negative amount effect during the drier pre monsoon season the significant positive continental and elevation effects were also observed on the weighted mean isotopic compositions of rainwater during ism in the swarna madisal river basin the effective control of rainwater isotopic compositions by these environmental conditions supports the inference on dominance of orographic rainfall input and continental recycled vapour source for inland rainwater in the studied humid tropical regions of south india the isotopic findings of rainwater suggested that the monsoon vapour was not only controlled by the evaporation at the oceanic source but also by the moisture recycling processes at precipitation site in the continent this study clearly pinpoints the specific timing and region of higher moisture recycling effect on atmospheric water balance in the river basins of southwest india and the presence of microclimatic conditions the recycled moisture flux in the humid tropical region of southwest india is accounted with limitations to be around 15 to 80 based on simple end member mixing analysis and empirical model thus this study on the rainwater isotopic composition provides an insight into evaporation and condensation processes not only at ocean atmosphere boundary but also to the evapotranspiration and condensation processes at the land atmosphere boundary layer which further adds to the knowledge on the regional scale convective activity in the humid tropics this investigation highlights the need to consider the humid tropical regions which are under immense stress of land use land cover changes

3143,the changes in precipitation pattern provide an understanding on the hydroclimatic response to global warming during the anthropocene the present study investigates sources of precipitation moisture for the indian monsoon and the local environmental mechanisms controlling its distribution over the southwest coast of india this is achieved by the characterization of stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in rainwater samples collected from a high humid tropical setting swarna madisal river basin of the western ghats south india and another station further south bakrabail southern edge of nethravati river basin this study contributes to the detailed investigation on rainwater isotopic composition and microclimate characteristics which is lacking in the humid west coast region the rainwater isotopic composition of coast was close to that of the arabian sea water and reflected the first condensate of vapours which were originally formed under fast evaporation at the nearby ocean in inland location the higher d excess values reflect continental moisture recycling evapotranspiration has led to higher kinetic fractionation effect in the inland region the isotopic storm effect during winter monsoon season suggested the rain distribution from saturated air masses formed under deep convective effect in the bay of bengal the overall local meteoric water line lmwl in the swarna madisal basin was found to be δ2h 7 2 δ18o 7 5 r2 0 98 further south the lmwl of bakrabail was δ2h 8 19 δ18o 16 1 r2 0 98 for annual observation and displayed minimal variability for inter seasonal slopes 7 73 for summer monsoon 8 48 for winter monsoon and 8 36 for pre monsoon and intercepts 15 6 for summer monsoon 17 8 for winter monsoon and 15 5 for pre monsoon in regions of vegetation dominance and humid climate the prevailing local air mass masked the rain out effect of marine air mass as well as the amount effect which support microclimatic settings at the local precipitation sites in southwest india the time and space variability of regional moisture circulation in controlling atmospheric water balance has been deduced in this study thus the high efficacy of stable isotopes in tracing the manifestation of microclimate in the humid tropics has been demonstrated keywords stable isotope precipitation indian summer monsoon ism local meteoric water line lmwl amount effect tropical ecohydrology data availability data used for this research has been presented in main article as well as supplementary material 1 introduction water forms the bloodstream of earth s biosphere with precipitation being its prime source ripl 2003 the response of precipitation to global warming has been unprecedented during the anthropocene falkenmark et al 2019 giorgi et al 2019 rocha et al 2015 chen and zhou 2015 the climate change response is strongly reflected in the tropics as it experiences higher precipitation from nearby oceans as well as increasing anthropogenic pressure thus the investigation on long term precipitation characteristics in tropical regions is pertinent this can provide a better understanding of the impact of climate change on the earth s hydrological cycle the present study highlights the need for determining the rainfall isotopic characteristics at local and regional scales in humid tropics to better understand the river basin hydrology during the anthropocene 1 1 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water the introduction of mass spectrometric techniques during the early 1950s resulted in the use of lighter elements as environmental isotope tracers in understanding the watershed hydrology and its relation to the geological processes craig 1961 epstein and mayeda 1953 accordingly the radiogenic isotopes like tritium 3h and carbon 14 were used as dating tools while the stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h formed the ideal tracers for moisture origin that contributed to water bodies in the earth system froelich et al 1998 the international atomic energy agency iaea has been persistently working since 1961 on method improvements for mass spectrometric techniques and its applications in novel earth system studies the iaea in coordination with the world meteorological organization wmo has developed global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip and global network for isotopes in rivers gnir to regularly monitor δ2h and δ18o values respectively in global precipitation and rivers based on their dataset the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 explaining the relationship between isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in freshwater samples was demonstrated by craig 1961 the intercept 10 in gmwl represented the excess of deuterium in short d excess or d dansgaard 1964 relative to oxygen resulting from a single stage evaporation of ocean water at an average relative humidity of 85 merlivat and jouzel 1979 clark and fritz 1997 this was later redefined as δ2h 8 13 δ18o 10 8 by rozanski et al 1993 the deuterium excess i e d δ2h 8 δ18o has been a successful parameter in exploring the influence of various secondary processes affecting the water moisture source signatures from local to global scale dansgaard 1964 gat and matsui 1991 ingraham and taylor 1991 salati et al 1979 tripti et al 2016 wolf et al 2020 the d excess value is often an indication of climatic condition during primary evaporation higher kinetic fractionation of 2h than 18o rather than the rain out process along the travel path dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 craig et al 1963 this is because the rate of kinetic isotope fractionation defining the magnitude of d excess is dependent on the relative humidity at the evaporation site which has inverse relationship dansgaard 1964 gat and airey 2006 rozanski et al 1993 in general the d excess of ocean water is close to 0 while that for the precipitation resulting from the diffusion of vapour from evaporated ocean water is close to 10 any deviation in this d excess value indicates the additional diffusivity of vapour from land surface evaporation or evapotranspiration like that from the water body soil or vegetation contributing to the atmospheric moisture this knowledge has led to the use of δ2h δ18o and d excess values as global water tracers to fingerprint the monsoon moisture source surface and sub surface water interaction ecohydrological source partitioning storm effect irrigation return flow hydroclimatic pattern presence of palaeowater in the watersheds and paleoclimate reconstruction berry et al 2017 gao et al 2021 kendall and coplen 2001 kirkels et al 2020 kumar et al 2010 lambs et al 2005 négrel et al 2011 ramesh and sarin 1992 rhodes et al 2010 sánchez murillo et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 yadava et al 2004 1 2 fingerprinting the moisture sources of rainwater most of the isotope ratio variabilities of oxygen and hydrogen in water are observed due to the natural distribution of relative abundance of their isotopes epstein and mayeda 1953 the mass dependent isotope fractionation occurs due to the varying bond energy reactive rate or the diffusivity of isotopologues containing light abundant 1h and 16o and heavy rare 2h 17o and 18o isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen bowen et al 2019 and references there in this fractionation is mainly driven during the phase change from vapour to liquid or solid form water and vice versa under equilibrium or non equilibrium condition craig and gordon 1965 gat 1996 the precipitation is generally known to be controlled by the equilibrium fractionation where the lighter isotopes preferentially get accumulated in the higher energy vapour phase while the heavier isotopes condensates as downpour water leaving behind the remaining vapour much enriched with lighter isotopes than the original vapour which is further defined by the rainout history or the rayleigh distillation the non equilibrium diffusivities of the vapour to from the condensate evaporated location are reflected in the dual isotope δ2h and δ18o relationship between oxygen and hydrogen in water friedman 1953 this is because of i the difference in their relative fractionation factors as hydrogen undergoes eight times stronger fractionation than oxygen during the equilibrium phase change and ii diffusion leading to sub equal shift in oxygen and hydrogen composition the effective vapour phase change is well predictable with the d excess value dansgaard 1964 as defined in the section 1 1 1 3 study objectives and tools the global extreme precipitation has intensified during the anthropocene madakumbura et al 2021 while the tropics and sub tropics of the northern hemisphere experienced relatively drier climate than that of the southern hemisphere zhang et al 2007 this can pose significant impact on the socio economy and indirect health effects in the tropics thus it is necessary to fingerprint the sources of precipitation moisture and regularly monitor the regional hydrological cycle during the anthropocene the isotopic characteristics of rainwater has been a useful tool in identifying the monsoon uncertainty and to determine the impact of climate change on regional water resources in the tropics the present study focuses on the characterisation of rainwater using stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in the swarna madisal river basin having its drainage in a humid tropical setting of the western ghats mountain belt south india the objective is to investigate the sources of monsoon moisture in the eastern coast of arabian sea and their variability over the tropical rain forest region of the western ghats further the spatial three stations in swarna madisal basin and at bakrabail and temporal daily and monthly scales variations in stable isotopic composition of rainwater have been studied to understand i the interplay between different oceanic moisture origins ii pattern of rain out history rayleigh distillation or orographic rain effect iii effect of tropical storm events cyclone depression in the northern indian ocean and iv influence of terrestrial land surface dynamics on incoming maritime monsoon vapour i e effect of vegetation and water body on evapotranspiration evaporation the questions on the induction of microclimatic condition between west coast of india and the western ghats as well as the time and space of continental moisture recycling contributing to atmospheric water balance in the region have been addressed in this study though the rainfall amount provided details regarding the mesoscale seasonal weather condition the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater provide greater insights to the regional convective activity the inference from this study can be used further in better understanding the complex hydrological cycle in humid tropical river basins of south india where there is usually limited to no meteorological stations for direct climatic observations in this study the stable isotopic composition of rainwater has not been used simply as a tracer for the condensation history of atmospheric vapour which display interconnection between climate and hydrology but also to explore the interconnection between ecohydrology i e forest ecology hydrology and microclimate manifestation in humid tropics of south india using the secondary d excess parameter 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the swarna madisal river basin which has its drainage system in the western part of the western ghats south india has been chosen as the area of interest for this study fig 1 a detailed description of this river basin has been provided in earlier reported studies tripti et al 2013 tripti et al 2016 briefly the swarna river originates at an elevation of 1100 m asl whereas madisal river at 900 m asl in the mountain belt of western ghats south india these two rivers merge at kallianpur close to udupi karnataka before debouching to the arabian sea they cover a total basin area of about 853 sq km between the high altitude mountains of the western ghats in the eastern edge and the arabian sea in the western edge the lithology is comprised of dominant granitic gneissic terrain with patches of lateritic soils while alluvial soils along the coast the river basin provides a unique setting for the study of rainwater characteristics as it covers a humid tropical region experiencing highest rainfall in south india and adjacent to the location agumbe receiving second highest rainfall long term in the country after the region of cherrapunji meghalaya in the brahmaputra basin gunnell 1997 the region experienced seasonal rainfall due to the monsoon circulation variability over the northern indian ocean gadgil 2003 the rainfall amount in each of the studied locations are obtained from the nearest meteorology stations within the basin data from irrigation department government of karnataka the total annual rainfall in the basin for the sampling year was 4561 mmm fig 2 the region exhibits warm temperature during most seasons with the range of 20 35 c and the relative humidity is usually between 70 and 95 fig 2 the tropical evergreen forest of the western ghats dominates the upper catchment region with minor anthropogenic impact while the agricultural lands dominate the midstream and downstream region of the basin accordingly the built up areas were restricted to the downstream region near udupi town with no major industries developed within the basin during the sampling period the meteorological and physiographic conditions in the study area provide a unique setting to demonstrate the possibility of microclimate conditions as well as to fingerprint the time and space of moisture recycling contribution to the water balance in the region the samples of rain water were collected on a daily basis event rainfall at three locations in the swarna madisal river basin fig 1 during 2012 this includes rain samples from hebri upstream region n 14 manipal small town near coast n 12 and santhekatte station in onshore coastal belt n 14 in addition the rainwater samples from nearby locations outside the basin like agumbe n 2 during 2012 and the monthly bulk samples n 11 at bakrabail further south of the basin during 2013 were also collected to fingerprint the moisture source in the southwest coast of india the sampling stations were located few meters m from the main road in most of the locations except for bakrabail which was covered by higher vegetation both from deep forest and agricultural lands the rainfall amount of daily rainwater in these stations was considered based on the available data for nearest locations like kuchur though outside the madisal basin for hebri puttige for manipal udupi for santhekatte and mangalore for bakrabail observational station the samples of rainwater were collected and preserved in air tight polypropylene pp bottles for the measurement of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen the sample collection storage and further analysis were all carried out following the standard iaea procedures involved in rainwater study and maximum care was taken to avoid any error possibility during sampling analysis on the generated dataset the collected samples were pooled for analysis in each station to provide a representative subset of monsoon rain events in the studied river basin considering the available resources for this work despite there is limitation on the number of event sampling in each station of the swarna madisal river basin the analysed samples were representative sub set of the regional monsoon covering both high and low rainfall amounts in all three stations further the winter monsoon rain characteristics events are usually limited in this part of india discussed in section 3 1 and section 4 1 the winter monsoon rain signatures for the study period have also been recorded in this work thus the uncertainty associated with sub sampling is minimal in the studied river basin for the sampling period 2 2 analytical measurements the unfiltered rainwater samples were analysed for physico chemical conditions like temperature ph conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen soon after sample collection using hach make multi parameter apparatus connected with respective probes the aliquots of selected rainwater samples were analysed for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen using isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms available in ecolab toulouse precision 0 2 for δ18o and 1 8 for δ2h vsmow as standard reference material tripti et al 2019 in earlier reported study tripti et al 2016 only the average values of δ2h and δ18o in rainwater were provided for tracing the river water and groundwater interaction in the basin the isotopic data of individual rainwater samples have been reported and discussed in detail in this study there is a minor difference in earlier reported average values and this study only in rainwater of swarna madisal basin due to the usage of rainfall amount of the corresponding sampling date in obtaining the weighted mean values however the overall rainwater isotopic trend had no much difference the obtained isotopic results were reported in delta δ notation as defined below epstein and mayeda 1953 craig 1961 and in per mil unit obtained with reference to vienna standard mean oceanic water v smow by iaea δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard represent the ratios of heavy rare abundant isotopes to light more abundant isotopes in the sample of interest and the reference standard respectively 2 3 statistical analysis and modelling the land use land cover information fig 3 for the swarna madisal river basin was derived by integrating qgis mapping tools with the secondary data from bhuvan platform nrsc government of india an air mass backward trajectory model was used to fingerprint the origin of the monsoon moisture that contributed to the atmospheric water and constrain the possible atmospheric condition during rain event the program for hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit model developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was run for the selected dates of rainwater sampling in three stations fig 4 the backward trajectories for the air masses in the model was run for three days to fingerprint the sources of monsoon moisture and its seasonal variability and to track the path before its reach to the sample location this also assists in identifying if any short term severe storm event generally the case of cyclonic impact during winter monsoon over the indian sub continent has influenced the rainwater moisture prior to its fall in the swarna madisal river basin of the western ghats the correlation analysis was carried out to determine the variability of stable isotopic composition of rainwater with relative humidity pan evaporation signature for air temperature rainfall amount distance from sea and elevation 3 results the data obtained for rainfall amount and the stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h measured in rainwater obtained from the humid tropical setting of south india are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 amount of rainfall in three tropical observational sites of southwest india the amount of precipitation has a significant effect on its regional water geochemical isotopic characteristics this warrants a detailed assessment on the rainfall amount variability temporal and spatial in the studied river basin before characterizing its isotopic systematics the monthly data of rainfall amount obtained for three observational locations of swarna madisal river basin has been presented to assess the rainfall occurrence variability during the study period fig 2 the rainfall amount varied between 431 and 1211 mm seasonal total of about 3463 mm during summer monsoon season june september 0 180 mm seasonal total of 239 mm during winter monsoon season october january and 0 71 mm seasonal total of 108 mm during the drier pre monsoon season february april in santhekatte similarly the rainfall amount for the manipal station varied between 409 and 1552 mm seasonal total of about 3826 mm during summer monsoon 0 104 mm seasonal total amount of 198 mm during winter monsoon and 0 113 mm seasonal total of 117 mm during the drier pre monsoon the rainfall amount in hebri varied between 638 and 1865 mm seasonal total of about 4678 mm during summer monsoon 0 123 mm seasonal total amount of 199 mm during winter monsoon and 0 65 mm seasonal total of 71 mm during the drier pre monsoon there was no recorded rainfall during january march in all three observed stations and the same status was during december except for manipal where there was a minimal 1 mm rainfall the spatial variability of annual rainfall amount in the studied tropical region presents 3810 mm in the coast santhekatte to 4948 mm in the inland hebri for the sampling period the overall average rainfall in the basin during sampling year with six rain gauge observatories was 4560 mm while for the five year annual average it was 5300 mm in addition the annual rainfall amount in the nearby locations outside the basin were as follows 3170 mm during 2012 and 3545 mm during 2013 in bakrabail further south of the basin and 7171 mm in agumbe inland high altitude mountain site close to hebri during 2012 3 2 physico chemical parameters and stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in tropical rainwater fingerprinting the moisture source of rainwater and its control by secondary processes for eg evaporation and transpiration during its transport pathway within the continental river basins is necessary to understand the role of rainwater in the tropical hydrology for this the data on stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen along with its physico chemical parameters have been presented in this section the in situ measurements for physico chemical parameters of rainwater in selected samples of manipal were as follows the temperature of rainwater in manipal was ranging between 23 3 and 27 c with an average of 25 3 c while the measured ph varied from 4 9 to 7 2 units and the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the rainwater samples were ranging from 7 7 to 8 6 mg l the δ2h and δ18o values obtained for selected rainwater samples n 54 in the swarna madisal basin and nearby locations bakrabail and agumbe are given in supplementary table 1 refer supplementary material file the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater in santhekatte varied from 6 3 to 0 2 average 2 73 2 and 34 5 to 0 2 average 15 8 13 respectively with d excess value ranging from 1 5 to 16 1 average 6 5 3 for manipal the δ18o and δ2h varied from 15 6 to 1 4 average 4 29 4 06 and 107 1 to 0 4 average 23 3 30 respectively with d excess value ranging from 5 6 to 17 6 average 11 1 4 the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater for hebri was in the range of 4 3 to 0 9 average 3 0 1 and 27 9 to 0 4 average 12 7 8 respectively with d excess value ranging from 3 7 to 18 4 average 11 0 4 the rainwater of the swarna madisal river basin showed an annual mean isotopic composition of 3 3 0 8 for δ18o 17 3 5 5 for δ2h and 9 4 2 9 for d excess in the measured samples in the studied river basin note that the annual mean has been provided based on isotopic data of different precipitation range covers high and low daily rainfall rather than total rain events thus the rain amount weighted mean isotopic compositions have been considered to draw further inference the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater were estimated to be 3 65 0 3 for δ18o 20 72 2 for δ2h and 8 5 1 for d excess in santhekatte whereas it was 3 9 0 3 for δ18o 21 4 2 for δ2h and 10 1 0 7 for d excess in manipal and 2 7 0 3 for δ18o 9 3 1 for δ2h and 12 6 2 for d excess in hebri for the summer monsoon season the amount weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater were estimated to be 3 7 0 3 for δ18o 20 9 2 for δ2h and 8 5 1 for d excess in santhekatte whereas it was 2 9 0 3 for δ18o 13 6 2 for δ2h and 9 5 1 for d excess in manipal and 2 7 0 3 for δ18o 9 4 1 for δ2h and 12 5 2 for d excess in hebri as most 85 of the analysed samples were from the summer monsoon season the average values with standard deviation of only that season have been provided the weighted mean composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin during the summer monsoon season was 3 1 0 5 for δ18o 14 6 6 for δ2h and 10 2 2 for d excess however it has to be noted that the two sampled locations were close to the coast the monthly bulk rainwater samples of bakrabail were representative of all seasons the measured δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater in bakrabail varied from 8 4 to 0 6 average 4 1 2 5 and 52 6 to 14 0 average 17 6 20 8 respectively with d excess value ranging from 9 4 to 19 0 average 15 3 2 7 the amount weighted monthly bulk rainwater samples of bakrabail showed that the average values of δ18o δ2h and d excess were 2 8 0 3 6 3 1 and 16 5 2 respectively for the study period the seasonal weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in bakrabail were as follows 2 6 0 2 for δ18o 4 3 2 3 for δ2h and 16 8 2 8 for d excess during summer monsoon 3 9 1 7 for δ18o 15 2 6 for δ2h and 15 9 7 8 for d excess during winter monsoon season and 4 5 1 for δ18o 23 4 6 6 for δ2h and 12 8 2 7 for d excess during pre monsoon season 3 3 statistical analysis of rainwater isotopic data the correlation analysis was carried out to understand the relationship between the rainwater isotopic composition and various environmental factors in bakrabail as well as the swarna madisal river basin the correlation coefficient r value obtained for bakrabail as well as three locations of the studied river basin have been provided in supplementary table 2 and supplementary table 3 respectively along with description refer supplementary material file in general the correlation coefficients suggest that there was minimal effect of synoptic weather controls on the isotopic composition of rainwater while the rain out effect due to inland transport or higher elevation was also masked in the humid region of south india which are further assessed for the influence of microclimatic condition in the following section 4 discussion the global warming and anthropogenic climate forcing have led to the changes in atmospheric circulation and its subsequent reflection in the regional precipitation the rainfall amount the moisture source variability local regional dominance for rainwater and the factors governing microclimate manifestation in the humid tropical regions of southwest india have been discussed in detail in the following sub sections 4 1 monsoon rainfall amount variability at sampling sites in southwest india there is a notable spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the rainfall amount within the basin fig 2 the swarna madisal river basin received relatively lower annual rainfall in the coast santhekatte than inland locations manipal hebri during the sampling period the higher annual rainfall amount in the inland region is due to the orographic effect posed by the high altitude mountains of the western ghats towards the southwesterly trade winds carrying indian summer monsoon ism moisture from the arabian sea and equatorial indian ocean tawde and singh 2015 this has resulted in higher relative humidity in the inland region than the coast there is a strong seasonality in the amount of rainfall for the swarna madisal basin as assessed from the monthly rainfall variability during the sampling period fig 2 the three observed rainwater locations experienced higher rainfall during the summer monsoon season compared to other seasons characterized by winter monsoon or dry spell it was found that the rainfall amount was highest during august in all three locations of the basin for the sampling year the observed seasonal rainfall trends in these three tropical stations are similar to that in the southwestern part or the peninsular india the rainfall amount during the sampling period showed the influence of dual monsoon variability in the river basin with higher summer monsoon 93 and lower winter monsoon 5 effect this is because of the close proximity of the studied locations in the swarna madisal basin to the northern indian ocean specifically its geographical location in the eastern coast of arabian sea which contributes to 85 of monsoon moisture to the indian west coast and peninsular india india meteorological department government of india the shifting of inter tropical convergence zone itcz associated with irregular thermal heating of the ocean water hosts non uniform distribution of the indian monsoon which eventually leads to the creation of seasons characterised by dual monsoonal systems gadgil 2003 as a result the southwest monsoon winds carry moisture from these oceanic regions to the west coast of india and its neighbouring countries during wet summer monsoon season whereas the moisture carried by the northeast winds originating mainly from the bay of bengal reaches the indian west coast after its long traverse over the continent during the winter monsoon season sikka and gadgil 1980 rao and goswami 1988 gadgil 2003 eventually there is higher monsoon moisture input to the swarna madisal basin and bakrabail station during summer monsoon while lesser moisture reaches the river basin during winter monsoon except for the stronger cyclones this is also supported by the dual monsoon circulation pattern observed by the air mass backward trajectory shown in fig 4 there is a clear difference in seasonal monsoon circulation contributing to rainfall in observed stations the air mass backward trajectory demonstrates that the monsoon moisture from the arabian sea and the equatorial indian ocean reaches the sampling location during summer monsoon also called southwest monsoon during the winter monsoon also called northeast monsoon the moisture originating from the bay of bengal initially passes over the continent through southeast coast of india and then reaches the sampling locations fig 4 the cyclonic storm effect is usually relatively minimal in this basin or in the west coast than in the east coast of india the severe cyclonic storm was not observed for the sampling year during winter monsoon season which was the second time in the recorded monsoon circulation history of northern indian ocean after 2005 india meteorological department the northern indian ocean encountered two cyclonic storms murjan with arabian sea origin during october 22 26 and nilam with bay of bengal origin during october 28 november 01 and three deep depressions one from arabian sea origin and two from bay of bengal origin during the winter monsoon season in 2012 however the influence of these storms was found to be minimal in india during sampling year except for the nilam cyclone and the deep depression over bay of bengal during november 17 19 accordingly the swarna madisal river basin experienced higher rainfall due to these storm events impact during the winter monsoon season compared to pre monsoon season further the impacts of these synoptic and local monsoonal circulations on the source moisture variability of precipitation in the studied tropical regions have been traced using stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater 4 2 stable isotopic composition of rainwater in southwest coast of india the inferences drawn from the stable isotopic composition of rainwater in south india and other tropical regions as well as that of the river and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats have allowed to discuss the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h and d excess variability in rainwater of the swarna madisal river basin in this section the overall average values for amount weighted isotopic composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin were 3 44 0 6 for δ18o 17 15 7 for δ2h and 10 4 2 for d excess with the representative of three stations i e santhekatte in shoreline manipal close to coast and hebri inland the rainwater oxygen isotope ratios δ18o 3 1 0 5 excluding one storm effect sample were similar to the reported average values for river water δ18o 3 09 0 05 and groundwater δ18o 3 11 0 02 in the swarna madisal basin tripti et al 2016 the average value of amount weighted δ18o reported for the rainwater further south in bakrabail during 2013 was 2 84 0 3 this study calicut during 2005 2007 was 3 5 0 3 and 1997 2007 was 2 9 0 2 warrier et al 2010 kochi during 2015 2016 was 3 62 0 3 weighted mean value calculated from aneesh et al 2019 thiruvananthapuram also called trivandrum during 2009 2010 was 4 9 0 7 weighted mean values calculated from hameed et al 2016 while during june 2010 december 2013 was 3 7 3 2 rahul and ghosh 2018 and for the kerala stretch during 2012 was 2 84 1 6 lekshmy et al 2014 the rainwater isotopic characteristics in these regions have demonstrated the dominance of monsoon moisture provenance due to the seasonal itcz variability i e moisture from the equatorial northern indian ocean and southern part of arabian sea during the summer monsoon season while the winter monsoon moisture is mainly from the bay of bengal provenance over south india the rainwater of these southern regions provides an insight to the rainwater isotopic characteristics in the swarna madisal basin this is because the southwesterly winds carrying summer monsoon moisture to the studied tropical river basin generally passes through the similar regional stretch from its oceanic source and experiences similar seasonal monsoon circulation pattern as represented by the air mass backward trajectory fig 4 also the river and groundwater in the tropical monsoonal river basins usually demonstrate the precipitation isotopic signature as it forms the main water recharge source component and also the terrestrial hydrological compartments in the tropics experience relatively less evaporation effect under high humid conditions compared to mid latitude temperate regions the seasonal dissemination of rainwater isotopic characteristics may further provide an insight to the rainwater vapour source and the major secondary processes impacting the source signals 4 3 seasonal rainwater isotopic variability in humid tropical river basin of southwest india the seasonal itcz variability over the indian ocean formulates the arabian sea and the bay of bengal as two distinct seasonal provenance platform for the indian monsoon moisture mooley and shukla 1987 webster et al 1998 gadgil 2003 with their unique isotopic signatures bhattacharya et al 2003 warrier et al 2010 breitenbach et al 2010 singh et al 2010 achyuthan et al 2013 deshpande et al 2013 in south india the rainwater of calicut the nearest gnip station to bakrabail station and the swarna madisal basin in the west coast of india indicated a clear dual monsoon isotopic effect with lower d excess values corresponding to higher oxygen isotope ratios during summer monsoon season while the higher d excess values corresponded to lower oxygen isotope ratios during winter monsoon season warrier et al 2010 the temporal variability of rainwater δ18o and d excess in bakrabail station and the three sampled locations in the swarna madisal basin have been plotted to understand the seasonal isotopic variability of tropical rainwater in humid regions fig 5 the seasonal isotopic difference for the weighted mean values of rainwater in observed stations were assessed to realize the dual monsoon moisture effect the monthly rainwater of bakrabail station displayed a clear seasonal trend with higher δ18o values during summer monsoon season and lower δ18o values during winter monsoon season similar to calicut dual monsoon isotopic signature nearest gnip station warrier et al 2010 the seasonal δ18o variability of rainwater in bakrabail reflected the control of prevailing air masses over the region which is further supported by the hysplit backward trajectory fig 4 the seasonal isotopic difference showed 1 8 and 15 7 depletion for heavy isotopes in δ18o and δ2h respectively during the winter monsoon relative to that of summer monsoon in bakrabail the relatively higher δ18o and δ2h values for rainwater of bakrabail were observed during summer monsoon due to the moisture trade winds from the equatorial indian ocean and adjacent arabian sea the winter monsoonal rains from the depressions and severe cyclonic storms over the bay of bengal resulted in lower isotopic composition for the observed period however the d excess values did not show much variability between seasons and remained higher than 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 throughout the study period the secondary processes led to high d excess under kinetic fractionation effect this is possible due to the continental source moisture contribution to the condensing vapour in the wetter soil annual rainfall of 3500 mm and higher vegetation agricultural land dense forest covered region the intense continental moisture recycling over the middle region of kerala have been reported earlier hameed et al 2016 the higher regional recycling ratio 0 16 of maximum and a subsequent higher recycled precipitation 1 5 mm day have been reported over the indian sub continent during summer monsoon pathak et al 2014 the increased convective rain characteristics during recent decades has also been reported for the west coast of india sreenath et al 2022 the measured rainwater isotopic composition of bakrabail exhibited the following relative seasonal trend high d excess 16 6 and high δ18o values 3 46 for summer monsoon high d excess 15 3 and low δ18o 5 26 values for winter monsoon and relatively low d excess 14 1 and high δ18o 3 90 values during pre monsoon season the relatively higher δ18o values during summer monsoon and pre monsoon could be due to seasonally heavy isotope enriched ism contribution and minor impact from sub cloud evaporation effect on falling rain drop respectively clark and fritz 1997 whereas the higher d excess reflected the recycled moisture contribution from the continent to the atmospheric vapour under warm temperature 25 c and high relative humidity 85 in regional tropical settings salati et al 1979 the rainwater d excess of summer monsoon was slightly higher than that of winter monsoon due to higher local moisture recycling the climatic characteristics of relatively wetter condition higher rainfall amount coupled with warm temperature usually 25 30 c during summer monsoon than during winter monsoon limited rainfall provides sufficient moisture medium for local recycling in the presence of dense vegetation agriculture lands forest and water bodies and further lead to local precipitation effect however the d excess remained always greater than 10 craig 1961 and 14 warrier et al 2010 this indicates the dominant contribution of terrestrially recycled moisture source craig and gordon 1965 zimmermann et al 1967 to the rainwater isotopic composition in bakrabail station similar observations were reported for the tropical forest ecosystems of amazon and congo basins salati et al 1979 sonntag et al 1979 gat and matsui 1991 niger delta ohwoghere asuma et al 2021 and other tropical regions influenced by similar indian monsoon circulation pattern like that in ethiopia and kenya levin et al 2009 the plot of stable isotope ratios of oxygen and d excess values as a function of time daily scale for the sampled rainwater in two locations coast near the eastern arabian sea and inland at foothills of the western ghats of the swarna madisal basin does not represent the isotopic seasonal trend dual monsoon isotopic pattern which is in contrast to the observed seasonality for the calicut rainwater however the rainwater of manipal few km away from coast still displayed the seasonality from dual monsoonal precipitation system of indian monsoon in its isotopic composition fig 5 the lower d excess values corresponded to higher oxygen isotope ratios and vice versa within the same season for rainwater of santhekatte the measured values of δ18o δ2h and d excess in most samples of coastal rainwater were close to isotopic composition of water from the eastern arabian sea δ18o 0 2 δ2h 0 7 and d excess 1 2 tripti et al 2016 for the study period few rainwater samples in santhekatte exhibited much lower δ18o than its average value for the study period and they displayed higher depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen than that of the calicut rainwater during summer monsoon season the d excess values of these samples were also higher than that of the calicut this indicates that the coastal rainwater close to the arabian sea did not show a clear summer monsoon isotopic effect summer monsoon enriched δ18o and δ2h values during the study period as observed elsewhere in the west coast the relatively lower isotopic composition depleted in 2h and 18o of three rainwater samples in santhekatte during summer monsoon is due to the large scale convective activity at the oceanic moisture source region which was also reported for the same period further south in kerala stretch lekshmy et al 2014 moreover the sample of early winter monsoon october was influenced by the air mass from nearby arabian sea as observed from the backward trajectory not drawn here which further supports the observation of less seasonality in santhekatte the rainwater samples of manipal showed lower d excess values corresponding to higher oxygen isotope ratios and vice versa throughout the study period similar to that of coastal rainwater santhekatte however the relatively lower δ18o values and higher d excess of rainwater during april and october than that of june september represented higher depletion of heavy isotopes of oxygen 18o and hydrogen 2h in rainwater of pre monsoon and winter monsoon seasons compared to summer monsoon season in manipal following the dual monsoon seasonal trend for calicut rainwater δ18o moreover the extreme lower δ18o with extreme higher d excess values of the two rainwater samples april and october in manipal indicated the stronger seasonal storm effect deep depression cyclone at oceanic source india meteorological department the observed lower isotopic composition of rainwater from the effect of deep depression low pressure system was also reported for rainwater in the kerala stretch during the same period lekshmy et al 2015 the rainwater samples of hebri inland region displayed lower d excess values with higher oxygen isotope ratios and vice versa during summer monsoon season while the higher d excess values corresponded with higher oxygen isotope ratios during winter monsoon season fig 5 these inland rainwater samples exhibited less effect of seasonality on the δ18o and d excess trend the temporal isotopic variability of rainwater in hebri reflected the higher effect of continental recycled moisture on the condensing vapour this is possible due to evaporation from wetter soils and inland water bodies while there exists also the high evapotranspiration at the foothills of the evergreen forest of the western ghats the higher evapotranspiration over the continent is often the case in high rainfall region having dense forest and agricultural vegetation hsieh et al 1998 transpiration forms the largest water output flux in the tropical ecosystem and has higher contribution to the continental atmospheric vapour jasechko et al 2013 there are studies supporting vapour isotopic enrichment from evaporation of wet soils zimmermann et al 1967 walker et al 1988 as well as transpiration dubbert et al 2014 few inland rainwater samples n 3 of september represented sea water composition of the eastern arabian sea this indicates that the marine source vapour for these rainwater samples did not undergo major rainout of heavy isotopes before reaching the condensation location at hebri this is possible considering the short river length aerial distance for the marine moisture transport pathway in the swarna madisal basin thus there is a continuous availability of higher marine moisture in the basin which potentially mask the rainout effect in the inland region for the rainwater samples of swarna madisal river basin having higher δ18o and lower d excess i e close to eastern arabian sea water isotopic composition δ18o 0 2 and d excess 1 2 it may be representative of first condensate from marine source vapours which were formed under fast evaporation at the nearby ocean travelled over a short distance or sub cloud evaporation of falling rain drop dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 clark and fritz 1997 similar lower d excess were also reported during the summer monsoon in other tropical regions warrier et al 2010 chakraborty et al 2016 rahul and ghosh 2018 wolf et al 2020 few rainwater samples of relatively high elevation locations manipal n 2 and hebri n 1 showed much lower d excess with lower δ18o values during the wet summer monsoon daily rainfall amount around 40 mm the low δ18o represents the lower mean condensate temperature in the inland local scale for the less rained out marine source vapours dansgaard 1964 while the low d excess reflects partial sub cloud evaporation effect on the falling rain drop the seasonal rainwater isotopic trend allows a clear source tracking of monsoon moisture and its evolution along the travel path in the swarna madisal basin with limited dual monsoon isotopic effect though for the year 2012 no rainfall occurrence was recorded during january march and december in the three chosen locations of the study basin the inter annual rainwater samples or the monthly bulk may help to identify any further dominant seasonal trend in the isotopic composition of rainwater however the observations from interannual variability 2011 2013 of surface and sub surface water in the swarna madisal basin also exhibited no much seasonal isotopic trend seasonal δ18o difference 0 07 for river water and 0 03 for groundwater further south the river and groundwater of the larger nethravati gurupur basin demonstrated observable seasonal isotopic variability seasonal δ18o difference 0 5 0 6 tripti et al 2016 interestingly another southwest river basin chaliyar which hosts the calicut gnip station exhibited lower seasonal δ18o difference of about 1 for groundwater compared to that about 3 for river water hameed et al 2015 while there was a significant seasonal isotopic variability in calicut rainwater seasonal difference in δ18o 4 5 warrier et al 2010 hameed et al 2016 in addition it was reported that the contribution from evaporated rainwater in this case due to canopy interception resulted in higher δ18o values of highland region groundwater in chaliyar river basin which further limited the isotopic elevation effect thus the observed limited seasonal effect on rainwater isotopic composition in the swarna madisal basin is due to two main factors i the river basin hosts continuous availability of monsoon moisture from the arabian sea warrier et al 2010 as it forms the wettest region annual rainfall amount of 3000 6000 mm in the west coast and ii the climate of this region exhibits warm temperature 25 35 c and high relative humidity 70 99 along with dense vegetation which supports higher terrestrial moisture recycling in these humid tropical river basins gat and matsui 1991 bu et al 2018 moreover the region receives only limited winter monsoon 5 10 from north easterly winds carrying bay of bengal moisture except for the strong storms developed by oceanic low pressure systems with characteristic lower isotopic composition i e rain extremely depleted in 2h and 18o 4 4 secondary processes governing tropical rainwater isotopic composition the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in the condensing vapour may undergo variable fractionation due to the effect of secondary processes like evaporation or evapotranspiration during its continental evolution high evapotranspiration has been reported elsewhere in the tropics schellekens et al 2000 the basin characteristics of a humid tropical zone with evergreen forest and warm climate settings support the isotopic fractionation of the incoming oceanic monsoon moisture by secondary processes effect as reported for the tropical river basins in africa and south america salati et al 1979 sonntag et al 1979 this can be identified from the relationship of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios fig 6 and fig 7 and the magnitude of d excess fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 it can be observed from the relationship of δ18o and δ2h values that most rainwater samples 95 in the swarna madisal basin were either above 47 5 or below 47 5 the global meteoric water line gmwl forming two distinct groups and only few samples 5 were falling on the gmwl fig 7 the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater samples in two stations santhekatte and manipal close to the arabian sea were mostly below or on the gmwl while that in the inland station hebri at the foothills of the western ghats were above the gmwl indicating influence of different meteorological conditions at the moisture source region however the air mass backward trajectory indicates the similar seasonal oceanic moisture sources for these stations which further suggests the higher isotopic control by secondary processes at the local precipitation site 4 4 1 local meteoric water line lmwl in humid tropics of south india the local meteoric water line lmwl obtained from the linear relationship of δ18o and δ2h in local rainwater indicates the different source moisture contribution and its fluctuation at the condensing region the lmwl obtained for the precipitation in india further referred as imwl has the slope of 7 93 0 06 and intercept of 9 94 0 51 kumar et al 2010 whereas that for the nearest gnip station calicut cmwl has the slope of 7 6 and intercept of 10 4 warrier et al 2010 the lmwls for the humid tropical regions of southwest india obtained in this study suggests that except the manipal station to some extent the remaining three stations didn t reflect the simple oceanic disturbance and rather had significant regional hydrological control craig 1961 which has been discussed in detail in this section however considering the limitation of short term sampling in the swarna madisal basin the lmwls were deduced to explain each sample isotopic characteristics further labelled as two groups group 1 for samples below gmwl and group 2 for samples above gmwl rather than general meteoric line in the studied river basin the lmwl obtained for the rainwater of bakrabail further referred as bmwl fig 6 and table 1 showed slightly higher slope 8 19 than that of gmwl cmwl and imwl indicating relatively low condensation temperature in humid tropics of southwest india eventually the bmwl falls above the gmwl and cmwl in the plot of δ18o and δ2h relationship fig 6 a the bmwl also displayed higher intercept 16 1 than that of gmwl imwl and cmwl this indicated the dominant contribution from continental recycled vapours i e evaporation of wet soils and transpiration of heavy isotope enriched soil water by plants further referred as evapotranspiration than atmospheric moisture from maritime craig and gordon 1965 allison et al 1985 leaney et al 1985 flanagan and ehleringer 1991 roden and ehleringer 1999 barbour et al 2004 this is possible considering the higher vegetation covered lands in bakrabail which also supports the misty condition during summer and winter monsoons like in other tropical montane cloud forest ecosystem rhodes et al 2006 scholl et al 2009 for example in altiplano yungas transect bolivia gonfiantini et al 2001 the lmwl was δ2h 8 01 0 08 δ18o 15 2 0 7 for the 132 monthly data points while that in the central vietnam wolf et al 2020 the lmwl during wet winter monsoon october november and relatively dry period december may was δ2h 8 5 0 6 δ18o 16 3 3 similarly the lmwl in eastern puerto rico scholl and murphy 2014 was found to be δ2h 8 2 δ18o 14 r2 0 98 while in the monteverde costa rica rhodes et al 2006 the lmwl was δ2h 8 6 δ18o 14 3 and in the san francisco catchment southern ecuador windhorst et al 2013 the lmwl was δ2h 8 31 δ18o 14 5 the continuous availability of recycled moisture during both monsoon seasons in bakrabail permitted higher terrestrial convective effect on vapour source of rainwater while the sub cloud evaporation effect on the condensing vapour was minimal for the study period under humid condition the seasonal lmwls of bakrabail were also similar to that observed in other tropical montane cloud forest ecosystems with slope 8 close to gmwl while the intercept is much higher 16 the lmwl of summer monsoon referred as sm lmwl in fig 6 a had slightly lower slope than gmwl indicating warm temperature effect of the tropics even during wet season however the higher intercept indicated higher moisture recycling the lmwl of pre monsoon referred as pm lmwl in fig 6 a showed higher slope indicating lower condensation temperature than summer monsoon while the intercept was similar to that of summer monsoon indicating convective effect this suggests that the low condensation temperature for the rainwater in bakrabail during dry pre monsoon season might have been temporarily imposed by the large convective activity at the oceanic scale than that over the continent it has to be noted that the lowest rainwater isotopic composition observed in the region was for pre monsoon this further supports the observation that the local high temperature of the dry season was overridden by the higher rainfall occurred due to low pressure systems depressions developed in the ocean the lmwl of winter monsoon referred as wm lmwl in fig 6 a displayed relatively higher slope and intercept than other two seasons suggesting lower condensation temperature and maximum moisture recycling process in the region thus it can be inferred that the microclimatic condition was unique at the local scale with the availability of higher recycled moisture compared to the large scale climate setting based on the observed isotopic relationship fig 6 b and fig 7 it can be inferred that the three locations in the swarna madisal river basin exhibited different source meteorological conditions for monsoon moisture which are reflected by two distinct meteoric water lines and are placed parallel to the gmwl the description of lmwls in individual stations of the swarna madisal basin are given in supplementary material file the two groups of samples along with their local meteoric water lines fig 7 allowed to fingerprint the secondary processes effect on the original oceanic source vapours in the humid tropics of southwest india the overall lmwl obtained by combining all stations in the swarna madisal river basin was similar to local meteoric water line of hebri hmwl with slope of 6 98 and intercept 5 9 r2 0 95 indicating that the condensing vapours were an admixture of original oceanic vapours and terrestrially recycled moisture this was supported by the two groups which indicated similar slopes 7 40 and 7 56 for their lmwls while the intercept was lower 3 38 for lmwl 1 and higher 11 5 for lmwl 2 the overall lmwl 1 of the swarna madisal river basin was similar to that of the cameroon rainwater with five year observation slope 7 32 0 21 and intercept 4 9 1 4 gonfiantini et al 2001 and that of the daily precipitation during summer monsoon in central usa with two year observation slope 7 53 0 26 and intercept 2 07 1 49 tian et al 2018 while the overall lmwl 2 of the basin was similar to other tropical regions with higher intercept for the overall rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin the lmwl monthly mean was found to be δ2h 7 19 δ18o 7 54 r2 0 98 fig 6 b and the lmwl event scale for the identified two groups fig 7 were i lmwl 1 δ2h 7 40 δ18o 3 38 r2 0 96 ii lmwl 2 δ2h 7 56 δ18o 11 53 r2 0 99 the climate change impact on the precipitation during the anthropocene can result in uncertainty of the meteoric water lines at local to global scales the increased frequency of depressions and cyclonic storms in the tropical oceanic region as well as the prolonged drought have been arbitrary irrespective of the season during the recent decades consequently this has a substantial effect on the obtained local meteoric water lines the rainwater samples in the studied monsoon dominated tropical river basin swarna madisal basin of southwest india indicated two distinct lines within the same station which were parallel to global meteoric water line and independent of seasons thus the study suggests that the meteoric water line in the tropical stations can be defined as an integrated isotopic reflection of local and regional moisture along with its synoptic seasonal change 4 4 2 deuterium excess variability in tropical rainwater of south india the d excess values of precipitation vary with the meteorological conditions at the moisture source region and kinetic fractionation during evaporation and is independent of kinetic fractionation during condensation or the atmospheric processes effect dansgaard 1964 merlivat and jouzel 1979 gat 1980 thus the magnitude of d excess fig 8 and its relationship with δ18o fig 9 and fig 10 of rainwater are useful in identifying the dominance of evaporation or moisture recycling effect froelich et al 2008 the continental moisture recycling process may dominate either due to the natural terrestrial moisture feedback mechanisms or the higher anthropogenic pressure few studies reported higher isotopic variability in the highly vegetated tropics due to evapotranspiration like that in amazon salati et al 1979 and congo sonntag et al 1979 basins while in the temperate mid latitude regions transpiration did not result in much isotopic variability zimmermann et al 1967 the evergreen and deciduous forest vegetation and water bodies in upstream and midstream region supports higher evapotranspiration the evaporation and evapotranspiration of moisture from the wetter soils of these tropical forests forest runoff water δ18o 2 7 d excess 10 5 tripti et al 2018 can lead to mixing of re evaporated vapours which are characteristics of relatively higher d excess values than the original atmospheric vapour zimmermann et al 1967 the higher anthropogenic pressure also leads to terrestrial moisture contribution to the atmospheric vapour at the condensation site this contribution is mainly from the agricultural lands 30 of land use land cover in this basin spread across the river basin for example the dominant paddy cultivation in the basin provides a platform for the moisture with heavier isotopic composition paddy field water δ18o 1 6 d excess 3 5 tripti et al 2018 to escape from vegetation covered standing water in the form of evapotranspiration moreover the high humid condition 75 95 and the smaller area of the river basin provides a strong convective platform for the higher distribution of these recycled evapotranspiration vapours with relative enrichment of 2h and 18o than the original atmospheric vapours from incoming maritime the terrestrial convective activity is reflected by the higher δ18o corresponding with higher d excess values of rainwater for hebri and manipal than santhekatte shoreline in the swarna madisal basin the higher d excess values i e around 20 were also observed for river and groundwater in the same river basin tripti et al 2013 tripti et al 2016 tripti et al 2018 as well as further south in nethravati gurupur river basin lambs et al 2011 gurumurthy et al 2015 tripti et al 2013 tripti et al 2016 tripti et al 2018 and chaliyar basin hameed et al 2015 which hosts the gnip calicut station this further supports the observation of contribution from the terrestrially recycled moisture to the natural water resources rain river and groundwater in the humid tropical river basins of southwest india the rainwater in hebri shows annual and summer monsoon weighted mean isotopic composition similar to the forest runoff while that of summer monsoon rainwater in manipal also reflected the same this suggests higher effect of transpiration rather than evaporation in the swarna madisal river basin most of the rainwater samples 53 in the swarna madisal river basin exhibited d excess values in the range of 10 18 while the remaining samples were in the range of 1 10 fig 8 this clearly indicated that the rainwater in the basin was generated from the vapours which were subjected to different kinetic isotopic fractionation either during evaporation at oceanic source region or evapotranspiration in the continental river basin the details of magnitude and distribution frequency of d excess in individual stations are given in supplementary material file in general the d excess in santhekatte coast rainwater supported the observation of fast evaporation from nearby sea as well as sub cloud evaporation effect while the inland rainwater hebri bakrabail supported higher terrestrial moisture recycling effect in the swarna madisal river basin the higher d excess values usually with lower or higher δ18o of rainwater represented respectively the impact of large scale convective activity over the oceanic source region or the higher continental moisture recycling effect on the stable isotopes of condensing moisture respectively fig 9 and fig 10 the rainwater of santhekatte showed a sharp decrease in d excess value with increase in δ18o indicating the significance of dominant isotopic diffusion process r2 0 6 fig 9 similar inverse relation but with a relatively lower slope was observed for rainwater of manipal r2 0 4 and calicut r2 0 4 the decrease in d excess with increase in δ18o was not significant r2 0 01 for the rainwater of hebri the bakrabail rainwater displayed increase in d excess value with δ18o indicating the dominant continental recycling effect on the incoming oceanic source moisture r2 0 1 fig 9 assuming the data points of santhekatte as reference for δ18o d excess deviation for strong rain drop evaporation effect it can be identified that the rainwater of manipal and calicut reflected low rain drop evaporation effect due to strong storm effect during winter monsoon while the rainwater of hebri and bakrabail reflected the orographic cloud condensate and evapotranspiration effects thus it can be inferred that the coastal site experienced higher sub cloud evaporation effect even in the humid tropical regions the global climate change has led to uncertainty in the fraction of advected oceanic monsoon moisture contributing to precipitation this necessitates the study on fingerprinting the regions exhibiting higher moisture recycling over the continent it has been reported that about 34 of moisture recycling occurs over the tropical amazon while the global average over the land is around 10 trenberth 1999 the fraction of precipitation contributed from continental evaporation over south india is reported to be about 30 van der ent et al 2010 the relationship between d excess and δ18o values both weighted mean of rainwater in different regions over southwest india have been plotted to further disseminate the possible source mixing and secondary process effects on the monsoon vapours fig 10 a and 10 b in the simple scatter plot for the annual data observation fig 10 a the rainwater of santhekatte which mainly composed summer monsoon samples was considered as a reference end member for summer monsoon ism while the rainwater of trivandrum composing both ism and winter monsoon iwm samples was considered as an end member for combined effect of ism and iwm and the rainwater of bakrabail as an end member for moisture recycling effect in southwest india the rainwater of agumbe at high altitude of the western ghats was considered as end member for rainfall from orographic cloud effect with limitation due to few representative samples it was found that the orographic precipitation and continental recycling had significant effects liotta et al 2006 on the stable isotopic composition of rainwater in hebri which is located at the foothills of agumbe in the windward side the rainwater of manipal was in the range of ism iwm effect due to the influence of strong storm effect in winter monsoon for the sampling year the rainwater of calicut and kochi were in centre of three component mixing from ism iwm and orographic rainfall and showed relatively lesser effect from moisture recycling the overall rainwater isotopic composition of the swarna madisal basin in the source mixing analysis plot demonstrated that around 80 of monsoon moisture was under the influence of direct ism and orographic rainfall in the region similar to that observed by the rainfall amount while about 15 was controlled by the continental recycling effect at the precipitation site and 5 by the winter monsoon for the annual scale fig 10 a similarly the scatter plot of secondary process dissemination during the summer monsoon season fig 10 b showed that the moisture source for coastal rainwater of santhekatte has undergone low rain out effect 0 27 decrease in δ18o for 660 km during its transport from southern location of trivandrum entry point in southwest coast of india for ism it also reflected that the condensing rain was subjected to slight sub cloud evaporation effect at the precipitation site as reflected by the relatively low d excess in santhekatte the rainwater of manipal and calicut shows influence of both marine moisture and orographic rainfall while that of hebri reflects both orographic rainfall and local moisture recycling effects the overall rainwater isotopic composition during summer monsoon reflects combined effect of orographic rainfall under ism influence as well as terrestrial moisture recycling this study pinpoints that large amount of terrestrially recycled moisture contributes to the inland precipitation in the tropical river basins of southwest india experiencing high humid condition in fig 10 a when the rainwater of one storm effect was excluded in the swarna madisal basin the overall weighted mean composition shifted to the range of ism and orographic cloud effect in addition the d excess was around 10 indicating that the observed continental moisture recycling in the studied river basin had higher effect from transpiration rather than evaporation gat and matsui 1991 further this was verified by comparison with the river water and groundwater in the basin it was observed that the annual rainwater excluding one event of cyclone and inter annual average δ18o of river water and groundwater displayed similar values indicating minimal evaporation effect on the hydrological compartments in the basin while there was a 10 higher variability in the d excess values of latter indicating the effect of evapotranspired moisture contribution which led to the excess of deuterium in river water and groundwater compared to their recharged source of rainwater however this observation has to be considered with limitations as there is no availability of fractions between evaporation and transpiration contributing to evapotranspiration in the region the observed pan evaporation in the mid region of the basin measured at ajekar is about 21 for annual and 8 for summer monsoon while for bakrabail it was 29 for annual and 6 for summer monsoon however the water bodies 15 and built up area 3 covered lesser region than the forest 45 and agricultural crops lands 30 suggesting higher proportion of evapotranspiration rather than direct evaporation in the swarna madisal river basin fig 3 this suggests that the water balance in the swarna madisal basin is maintained by evapotranspiration in the presence of dense vegetation 75 in the region rather than direct evaporation process in the swarna madisal basin the two stations of manipal coast but less possible effect from sea breeze relative to santhekatte and hebri inland were considered to pinpoint the actual moisture recycling contribution these two stations covered much 85 of regional area in the basin the santhekatte rainwater in the shoreline was considered as the region indicating the onset signature incoming moisture of monsoon rainfall in the basin before undergoing much recycling over the continent the study hypothesizes the following isotopic empirical model to be potential to explain the continental moisture recycling observed in the tropical river basins of south india during summer monsoon continental moisture recycling f in d i d c 2 d o d g 100 where di dc do and dg represent the weighted mean d excess values of inland here hebri coastal manipal onset santhekatte and global 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 rainwater respectively while the fraction of 1 f provided the oceanic moisture contribution these fractions can be accounted with limitations as factor like sub cloud evaporation has not been accounted still much useful where there are no meteorological observatory stations to feed the data required for highly complex existing fractionation models it has been estimated that about 28 5 of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin was contributed from the continental moisture recycling in the region while among the individual stations it was 16 for manipal and 41 for hebri when one strong storm effect sample was excluded it further decreases to 3 in manipal and 14 in the swarna madisal river basin therefore this model estimation may be considered with limitation with event rainfall observation and further the monthly observation may provide the robust output the estimated moisture recycling fraction to local rainfall in the swarna madisal was also validated by the two component mixing model which yields the similar output this is supported by the pan evaporation in the basin which indicates 20 of precipitation undergoes evaporation however this fraction may coincide with evapotranspiration rather than direct evaporation as region is widely covered by vegetation 75 and exhibits fewer exposed waterbodies and barren lands 15 the higher continental moisture recycling contribution of about 80 range 30 42 during pre monsoon to 83 during summer monsoon was obtained for bakrabail station with monthly observations this unique response of continent to the atmospheric water balance at local scales between the eastern arabian sea and the western ghats suggests the manifestation of microclimate conditions in south india further the relationship of isotopic data with environmental meteorological and geographical conditions may reflect the local microclimate to mesoscale convective effect on the rainwater source composition 4 5 isotopic storm effect induced by the tropical oceanic convective systems the depressions and cyclones which originated from the bay of bengal during sampling period demonstrated the isotopic storm effect or the extreme event effect on the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin and bakrabail station particularly during the winter monsoon season the isotopic storm effect was observed in manipal for the sampling of october 21st with significant depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen and higher d excess value the δ18o value for this rainwater exhibited the lowest recorded value of 15 6 in the station which is estimated to be about 12 3 lower than the remaining rainwater average similarly the δ2h value also showed the lowest recorded value of 107 4 which is about 91 4 lower than the remaining rainwater average measured in the station such extreme isotopic depletion represents that the vapour for this rainwater was highly saturated which is often the case under cyclonic impact lawrence and gedzelman 1996 gedzelman et al 2003 coplen et al 2008 good et al 2015 li et al 2020 the observed isotopic composition was similar to that of intense storm reported for the tropics formed under kinetic fractionation between these vapours and seawater leading to depletion by upto 15 for vapour δ18o lawrence et al 2004 the first depression of the winter monsoon season in 2012 was reported by the india meteorological department for the date of october 10th which occurred in bay of bengal this was followed by the cyclonic storms during october 22 26 western part of arabian sea and october 28 november 01 bay of bengal the depression of october 10th was developed in bay of bengal as a remnant of severe cyclonic storm gaemi that occurred over the pacific ocean india meteorological department however the effect was seen much towards the north eastern part of india and bangladesh rather than the study area which suggests less memory effect moreover the inland rainwater sampled at hebri on the previous day did not represent this extreme isotopic depletion the observed lowest δ18o and δ2h values of october 21st in manipal station is due to the early storm signatures from the later appeared cyclones either of the western arabian sea murjan or bay of bengal nilam the cyclone track of murjan shows less effect on the sampling region however the air mass backward trajectory confirms the bay of bengal moisture origin to this rainwater the seasonal average of rainwater isotopic composition in bakrabail displayed relatively lower δ18o and δ2h values during winter monsoon than summer monsoon the winter monsoon for the rainwater sampling year in bakrabail exhibited rainfall under the influence of severe storms from the bay of bengal the moisture contribution from the severe cyclonic storm helen very severe cyclonic storm lehar followed by a depression all during november and a very severe cyclonic storm madi during december in bay of bengal have resulted in significant depletion in heavy isotopes of rainwater in bakrabail during the winter monsoon season the effect of cyclone phailin was relatively lesser on the rainwater isotopic composition during october the air mass trajectories not drawn here and cyclone tracks india meteorological department also support the possible moisture contribution from these severe cyclonic storms of november and december and lesser effect during october under the influence of storm effect in bakrabail the heavy isotope depletion in rainwater during december was relatively higher of about 3 1 for δ18o and 24 9 for δ2h when compared to october while that during november is about 2 5 for δ18o and 23 2 for δ2h the isotopic storm effect was also reported for the same period november in the highlands of the western ghats at ooty with extreme depletion in heavy isotopes of two rainwater and nearby surface and sub surface water tripti et al 2019 however the bakrabail rainwater was enriched with heavy isotopes by an average of about 11 1 in δ18o and 82 5 in δ2h when compared to rainwater of ooty for the monsoon affected by same tropical storms during november the observed isotopic difference could be due to the monthly cumulative observation of rainwater in bakrabail when compared to event sampling in ooty which is also supported by the higher cumulative isotopic composition of surface and surface water of ooty moreover the moisture travelling over a long distance from the bay of bengal may also lose much of its airmass amount on its traverse over the higher mountains of the western ghats before reaching the west coast of india leading to absence of rainout effect lekshmy et al 2015 however the observation of event rainfall sampling in manipal for isotopic storm effect showed similar isotopic composition as that of the ooty rainwater but from a different cyclone during previous sampling year though both had moisture from bay of bengal origin thus the heavy isotope enrichment of rainwater in bakrabail relative to ooty which were impacted by the same cyclonic storm could be due to the difference in monthly bulk and event sampling as well as higher continental moisture recycling effect rather than the traversing moisture loss the higher moisture recycling is supported by the higher d excess value than that of winter monsoon d excess 14 warrier et al 2010 observed in gnip calicut station similarly the monthly bulk effect is supported by lower isotopic composition of rainwater during december which recorded one rainfall though lowest unrecorded rainfall occurred effectively compared to november which had higher mixing from different rain events 4 6 relationship of rainwater isotopic composition with environmental conditions in the humid tropics the effect of temperature on regional rainwater composition can be studied with the seasonal isotopic variability rainfall amount effect and elevation effect dansgaard 1964 the isotopic composition of water spring river and groundwater long term regional water representatives along the west coast and the western ghats demonstrated low temperature effect δδ18o δt 0 016 c r2 0 004 δδ2h δt 0 5 c r2 0 1 and δd excess δt 0 47 c r2 0 06 for the low relief mountains 700 m asl while a significant high temperature effect δδ18o δt 0 65 c r2 0 7 δδ2h δt 3 4 c r2 0 5 and δd excess δt 1 8 c r2 0 6 was observed for the higher altitude mountains 1900 m asl influenced by strong storms as reported in earlier study tripti et al 2019 the reported study exhibited overall intermediate temperature effect δδ18o δt 0 36 c r2 0 8 δδ2h δt 2 5 c r2 0 8 and δd excess δt 0 38 c r2 0 2 along mountain ranges of south west coast and high altitude of the western ghats india for the region covering 120 km width inland from the arabian sea west to east transect coastal stretch of 500 km north to south transect and elevation between 2 m and 2300 m above msl the limited seasonal isotopic variability as explained in earlier section section 4 3 supports low temperature effect in the swarna madisal river basin the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in three stations along the swarna madisal river basin during summer monsoon shows that the rainfall originated from the orographic clouds which represented the early stage condensate formed at temperatures near the land surface and typically they are characterized by enriched heavy stable isotopic composition ingraham and matthews 1988 rhodes et al 2006 2010 scholl et al 2007 rather than the depletion from amount effect rain out effect and elevation effect dansgaard 1964 the correlation analysis of isotopic composition with pan evaporation showed negative low r values indicating poor temperature effect except for the pre monsoon in the swarna madisal basin the low temperature effect suggests higher amount effect in the tropics rozanski et al 1993 further the detailed analysis of rainfall amount distance to sea and elevation of the sampling locations can provide insights to the local temperature effect in the humid tropics if any and is discussed in the following sub sections 4 6 1 amount effect on rainwater isotopic composition the reconstruction of past monsoon from palaeo archives tree rings speleothem marine sediments carbonates etc to understand the earth s long term climate has been carried out with the assumption of rainfall amount effect the amount effect is defined as the progressive depletion of heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation with the increase in amount of regional precipitation dansgaard 1964 the amount effect suggests a decrease in δ18o by 1 5 for the global observation dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 and 1 4 for the tropics 30 ns latitudes kurita 2013 per 100 mm of rainfall amount the amount effect on the rainwater isotopic composition of tropical islands displayed a slope of 0 02 per mm for δ18o rozanski et al 1993 however for the low elevation tropical regions the slope has always remained lower due to higher evapotranspiration effect salati et al 1979 gat and matsui 1991 gonfiantini et al 2001 the isotopic composition of water spring water river water and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats showed an overall positive amount effect with slope of 0 06 for δ18o r2 0 2 0 41 for δ2h r2 0 2 and 0 05 for d excess r2 0 03 per 100 mm of rainfall due to the prevailing orographic precipitation and continental moisture recycling effect in the region tripti et al 2019 the relationship of stable isotopic composition of rainwater with rainfall amount is explored in the swarna madisal river basin to understand the possible amount effect in the humid tropical river basin of the western ghats and its narrow west coast south india fig 11 the relationship between rainfall amount and unweighted rainwater isotopic compositions of all three station in the swarna madisal river basin on event scale showed inverse linear trend with slope of 0 34 for δ18o r2 0 003 and 0 95 for δ2h r2 0 001 per 100 mm which represented general amount effect fig 11 a the slope improved slightly to 0 6 per mm for δ18o r2 0 02 and 2 5 for δ2h r2 0 01 per 100 mm when one sample of cyclonic storm effect in manipal was excluded not drawn here for the event scale rainwater samples in individual station not drawn here of the swarna madisal basin the rainfall amount vs δ18o unweighted values trend displayed the general negative amount effect in santhekatte slope δδ18o δp 0 019 mm 1 and δδ2h δp 0 102 mm 1 both r2 0 2 while the slightly positive amount effect was observed in manipal δδ18o δp 0 02 mm 1 and δδ2h δp 0 106 mm 1 both r2 0 1 and hebri δδ18o δp 0 004 mm 1 r2 0 1 and δδ2h δp 0 056 mm 1 r2 0 1 for the annual observation in three tropical stations the general amount effect was reflected in the coastal rainwater santhekatte while the higher terrestrial vapour recycling and the first condensate of orographic cloud masked the amount effect in inland regions hebri and manipal as observed elsewhere in the humid tropics salati et al 1979 sonntag et al 1979 scholl et al 2007 scholl et al 2009 the difference in isotopic amount effect within the small river basin of the humid tropics fingerprints the occurrence of microclimatic conditions between the west coast and western ghats south india the inverse relationship between total sampled rainfall amount and weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal basin during the ism reflected significant amount effect in the studied humid tropical river basin fig 11 b the overall amount effect in the swarna madisal basin during ism exhibited an observable change in δ18o by 0 21 r2 0 7 while δ2h changed by 2 03 r2 0 5 and d excess by 0 36 r2 0 1 per 100 mm of rainfall amount the correlation analysis of isotopic composition with rainfall amount also showed negative r values for the overall basin as well as coastal rainwater while the positive r values were exhibited for inland stations bakrabail manipal and hebri demonstrating prevailing local moisture effect on incoming maritime composition for the monthly rainwater of bakrabail there was an observable change in δ18o and δ2h by 0 24 and 2 1 respectively per 100 mm increase in rainfall amount suggesting positive amount effect r2 0 2 fig 12 a the seasonal trend for the relationship of δ18o with rainfall amount in bakrabail station exhibited change by 0 004 0 015 and 0 024 per mm respectively during the summer monsoon r2 0 55 ism winter monsoon r2 0 99 iwm and pre monsoon r2 0 1 pre ism period fig 12 b the negative amount effect during pre monsoon season was due to the large scale oceanic convective activity rather than local amount effect as explained earlier in section 4 4 1 the rainwater of bakrabail showed positive amount effect for annual summer monsoon and winter monsoon observations similar to annual observation of manipal and hebri indicating higher distribution of terrestrially recycled vapours in the humid tropical vegetation zones further the observed positive δ18o change with rainfall amount i e slope δ18o δp in bakrabail was similar to that in hebri 0 003 mm 1 this study and gnip calicut 0 003 0 001 mm 1 warrier et al 2010 while it was lower than that of mangalore 0 008 0 002 mm 1 yadava et al 2007 the δ18o δp values of the observed rainwater stations in this study were also in the range obtained for rainwater from the southern stretches of kerala δ18o δp 0 009 to 0 004 mm 1 and sri lanka δ18o δp 0 023 to 0 001 mm 1 which are largely influenced by ism lekshmy et al 2015 4 6 2 continental effect on rainwater isotopic composition the continental effect is defined as the progressive depletion of heavy isotopes 18o and 2h respectively of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation as the monsoon air mass traverse over the continent dansgaard 1964 the continental effect formulates heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen present in source vapour to fall down as rain droplets during the first condensate near the coast while the remaining vapour reaching more inland locations are enriched with their lighter isotopes 16o and 1h globally there has been variable isotopic gradients for continental effect depending on the topography geographical location season and climate the observed continental effect resulted in isotopic gradient of about 0 2 to 0 4 in δ18o for global observation dansgaard 1964 0 075 in δ18o for the tropical amazon basin salati et al 1979 0 3 in δ18o for southern patogonean andes stern and blisniuk 2002 0 33 in δ18o for europe sonntag et al 1979 rozanski et al 1993 3 3 and 1 5 in δ2h during winter and summer monsoon respectively in central europe rozanski et al 1982 and 2 4 in δ18o and 20 in δ2h for colder season in adriatic pannonian region while the same region represented no significant continental effect for the summer monsoon and rest of the year kern et al 2020 all gradients with respect to per 100 km the isotopic study on the spring river water and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats tripti et al 2019 demonstrated intermediate continental effect slope was 0 02 for δ18o r2 0 2 and 0 23 for δ2h r2 0 3 per km for inland distance of 45 km from coast for the low relief regions 700 m asl the overall gradient with a width covering 120 km between the arabian sea coast and different high altitude mountain ranges in the western ghats demonstrated higher continental effect with slope of 3 5 for δ18o r2 0 6 and 27 4 for δ2h r2 0 6 per 100 km the d excess exhibited higher values throughout the western stretch of the western ghats which posed no significant continental effect from coast to inland the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin during summer monsoon fig 13 shows that the inland location hebri exhibits higher δ18o and δ2h values than that of the coastal location santhekatte this demonstrates the reduced continental isotope gradient in rainwater of the studied humid tropical river basin during ism the relationship of weighted mean rainwater isotopic composition in the swarna madisal river basin with its location distance from the eastern arabian sea coast demonstrated that there is an increase in δ18o by 0 029 per km r2 0 65 δ2h by 0 38 per km r2 0 84 and d excess by 0 15 per km r2 0 99 in western part of the western ghats fig 13 similar positive but low isotopic gradient was observed for annual weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater in the basin excluding one extreme event sample not drawn here however the measured annual average isotopic composition demonstrated not drawn here an isotopic lapse rate of 0 003 per km for δ18o r2 0 025 0 12 per km for δ2h r2 0 97 and 0 14 per km for d excess r2 0 55 the positive continental effect i e inverse general trend reflected by the rainwater isotopic composition in this humid tropical river basin of southwest india is due to the recycling of atmospheric moisture by evapotranspiration ingraham and taylor 1991 ingraham and craig 1993 rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 araguás araguás et al 1998 winnick et al 2014 and the rainwater originating from the heavy isotopes 18o and 2h enriched first condensate of orographic cloud similar to other tropical mountain forest ecosystem ingraham and matthews 1988 scholl et al 2007 rhodes et al 2006 this observation is supported by the geographical location of the studied river basin considering the high altitude western ghats in the eastern edge of the basin which provides orographic barrier to the high amount of incoming monsoon moisture from the arabian sea and equatorial indian ocean also the inland region is dominated by the evergreen forest vegetation triggering canopy interaction and transpiration and wetter soils triggering evaporation which supports higher evapotranspiration thus it can be suggested that the continental effect on rainwater isotopic composition in the tropical mountainous river basins is largely controlled by the prevailing local air mass rather than the rain out effect of marine air mass this observation reflects the dominance of microclimate in the regional tropics between the west coast and the western ghats south india 4 6 3 elevation effect on rainwater isotopic composition continental deformation landscape evolution and climate have been studied with the elevation changes in the earth s surface chamberlain and poage 2000 luo et al 2011 the stable isotopic proxies have been useful in determining palaeo elevation or the palaeo altimetry of the orogenic belts as well as in identifying the recharge site elevation for groundwater in a geographical location siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 chamberlain et al 1999 poage and chamberlain 2001 araguás araguás et al 1998 gonfiantini et al 2001 blisniuk and stern 2005 the isotopic elevation effect also called the altitude effect is defined as the decrease in stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation when the air mass adiabatically rises to a cooler higher elevation gradient dansgaard 1964 as a result the high elevation mountains exhibit lower isotopic composition of precipitation with inverse relationship between δ18o or δ2h in regional water and elevation of the location the global relationship investigated a vertical isotopic gradient of 0 28 for δ18o varies between 0 5 and 0 15 except for the extreme latitudes between 1 14 and 0 64 while for global higher elevation 5000 m which included himalayas was 0 41 per 100 m and 0 24 per 100 m for himalayas only and 1 5 for δ2h varies between 5 and 1 per 100 m of elevation above msl chamberlain and poage 2000 poage and chamberlain 2001 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 holdsworth et al 1991 the evidence of isotopic elevation effect on the spring water river water and groundwater in the western part of the western ghats showed an isotopic lapse rate of 0 09 in δ18o per 100 m above msl for elevation upto 2050 m asl while at the higher elevation 2050 m asl an isotopic lapse rate of 2 5 in δ18o per 100 m above msl was observed under the influence of cyclonic storm tripti et al 2019 the overall isotopic gradient was 0 18 for δ18o and 1 5 for δ2h both r2 0 7 per 100 m of 2 2300 m asl in the western ghats and its west coast south india the gradient between the lowest 2 m asl and highest 2300 m asl points in the western stretch of western ghats showed an isotopic lapse rate of 0 31 for δ18o per 100 m tripti et al 2019 similar to global isotopic lapse rate while it was 0 41 per 100 m asl for the well water between 400 and 1000 m in southwest india deshpande et al 2003 the isotopic elevation effect on rainwater was explored in the swarna madisal basin to understand the temperature induced rain out process adiabatic cooling during uplift in humid tropical regions of south india it was noted that the weighted mean δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater showed positive linear relationship with elevation in the swarna madisal river basin during summer monsoon fig 14 as all three sampling sites in the basin were in low relief regions 100 m the weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater from agumbe at the immediate north eastern edge of the basin having elevation of 650 m asl was also considered to obtain an overall isotopic lapse rate in the western part of the western ghats the relationship of sampling site elevation with weighted mean rainwater isotopic composition during the summer monsoon fig 14 demonstrated that there is an increase in δ18o by 0 18 per 100 m above msl r2 0 69 δ2h by 1 8 per 100 m above msl r2 0 59 and d excess by 0 31 per 100 m above msl r2 0 24 for the low relief regions the increase in d excess with elevation has been reported for tropical precipitation gonfiantini et al 2001 the positive elevation effect on rainwater isotopic composition in this humid tropical river basin of southwest india is due to i the first rain condensate from orographic cloud at the foothills of the western ghats which is characteristic of heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen than the incoming rained out marine vapours and ii higher moisture recycling in the region which is supported by higher vegetation high rainfall and warm temperature of the humid tropics the terrestrial recycling effect and the orographic effect has led to lower isotopic elevation effect in different tropical regions like the isotopic lapse rate of 0 12 per 100 m in puerto rico scholl et al 2009 and 0 09 to 0 18 per 100 m in south india deshpande et al 2003 resmi et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 for δ18o moreover the global observation suggests negligible isotopic elevation effect for the low relief regions due to simultaneous effect of different regional environmental factors poage and chamberlain 2001 this supports the influence of microclimatic conditions in humid tropical river basins of the western ghats thus it is important to consider the local meteorological and environmental conditions while determining the palaeo altimetry and the mean elevation of groundwater recharge sites in the mountainous tropical river basins 4 7 comparison of rainwater isotopic inference in wetter regions of india and global tropics using stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater as a tool to fingerprint the oceanic moisture sources and governing local secondary processes the integrated complex effect of geographical vicinity to the arabian sea and low latitude tropics geomorphological evergreen tropical forest ecosystem and orographic upliftment of trade winds by the high altitude mountains of the western ghats and anthropogenic standing water bodies and vegetation covered agricultural lands factors on the rainwater characteristics of humid tropics has been demonstrated in this study the rapid pace of change in tropical forest ecosystem during the anthropocene necessitates the study of natural and anthropogenic impact on the source components of hydrological cycle in humid tropical river basins bruijnzeel et al 2011 lion et al 2017 the indian monsoon mainly controlled by the monsoon moisture from the northern indian ocean has been a major controlling factor of the summer monsoon and winter monsoon rains over several immediate neighbouring countries of india the rainfall variability over these tropical regions forms a primary factor to understand the possible influence of global climate change over the indian sub continent the critical observations on the isotopic fingerprinting of rainwater sources at different locations over the wetter regions of indian west coast northeast regions highest rainfall region in india and other global tropical sites and their controlling factors have been described in this section the reported data available on tropical rainwater isotopic characteristics covering representative locations and the new rainwater data generated from this work have been compiled in table 1 based on the studied rainwater over the humid regions of india and other global tropical regions it is concluded that most regions showcased higher control of precipitation moisture isotopic characteristics by continental factors like evapotranspiration and sub cloud evaporation rather than seasonality this is crucial considering high stress on continental landmass in humid tropical regions during the anthropocene hence this study highlights the need to carry out much robust investigation of rainwater at local to regional scales to better understand the climate change impact on tropical hydrology and sustainable development of water resources in the developing tropics this study also highlights the need for a long term investigation on stable isotopic composition of rainwater in the humid tropics before the global implication in regional palaeoclimate to account for the uncertainty as well as for the sustainable water resource management 5 conclusions the present study investigated the moisture sources to monsoonal rainfall in humid tropical river basin of the western ghats swarna madisal river basin and further south in bakrabail southwest coast of india the integrated approach of stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen and the computed d excess parameter for rainwater has been inferred as a successful tool in fingerprinting the moisture sources for rain and its governing secondary processes in the studied river basin the stable isotopic distribution of rainwater within the swarna madisal river basin demonstrated the unique role of geographical high maritime vapour input due to close vicinity of the eastern arabian sea and windward side of the western ghats geomorphological evapotranspiration from evergreen tropical forest ecosystem and orographic monsoon uplift by the high altitude mountains of the western ghats and anthropogenic evaporation from standing water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation covered agricultural lands factors in controlling source vapours of rainwater in the developing tropical monsoon climatic zone of south india in this study the strong influence of microclimate on the tropical rainwater isotopic composition has been fingerprinted between the west coast and the western ghats south india the oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of coastal rainwater in the swarna madisal river basin showed dominance of marine vapour source from the nearby arabian sea and the equatorial indian ocean the stable isotopic compositions of rainwater were altered during the inland transport of original marine vapours by the recycled vapours from the continental moisture contribution the event scale rainwater isotopic composition did not represent clear seasonality in the swarna madisal river basin however the isotopic storm effect was observed during the winter monsoon northeast monsoon season in manipal with extreme depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen the rainwater of bakrabail demonstrated a strong effect of seasonality on the monthly δ18o variability but its d excess variability was controlled largely by the continental moisture recycling effect the parallel placing of two local meteoric water lines lmwl in the swarna madisal river basin above and below the gmwl suggests that the moisture for rainwater from the indian monsoon in the studied region was generated under two distinct meteorological conditions at the source region however the higher d excess and higher intercept of lmwl cannot be attributed to the low humidity at the oceanic moisture source region in this case and rather indicated continental recycled moisture sources even under high humid condition in southwest india the rainfall amount effect negative in santhekatte and positive in manipal and hebri was not significant on event scale rainwater of three individual tropical stations in the swarna madisal river basin during the study period however there was a significant amount effect on the overall weighted mean isotopic composition of rainwater during ism in the studied tropical river basin the monthly rainwater oxygen isotopic composition unweighted values of bakrabail demonstrated positive amount effect for annual observation ism observation and winter monsoon observation whereas it showed significant negative amount effect during the drier pre monsoon season the significant positive continental and elevation effects were also observed on the weighted mean isotopic compositions of rainwater during ism in the swarna madisal river basin the effective control of rainwater isotopic compositions by these environmental conditions supports the inference on dominance of orographic rainfall input and continental recycled vapour source for inland rainwater in the studied humid tropical regions of south india the isotopic findings of rainwater suggested that the monsoon vapour was not only controlled by the evaporation at the oceanic source but also by the moisture recycling processes at precipitation site in the continent this study clearly pinpoints the specific timing and region of higher moisture recycling effect on atmospheric water balance in the river basins of southwest india and the presence of microclimatic conditions the recycled moisture flux in the humid tropical region of southwest india is accounted with limitations to be around 15 to 80 based on simple end member mixing analysis and empirical model thus this study on the rainwater isotopic composition provides an insight into evaporation and condensation processes not only at ocean atmosphere boundary but also to the evapotranspiration and condensation processes at the land atmosphere boundary layer which further adds to the knowledge on the regional scale convective activity in the humid tropics this investigation highlights the need to consider the humid tropical regions which are under immense stress of land use land cover changes

3144,the study on whether there is a magma chamber under wudalianchi is a hot topic recently as it holds great significances for the theory of plate tectonics early warning of volcano eruption and geothermal exploration there is no near surface geothermal abnormality reported in weishan the widely used and well studied tool geochemistry of geothermal fluids and geothermal gases cannot be applied to this area to reveal the thermal conditions under weishan we conducted a study about the abundances and isotope ratios of dissolved noble gases in shallow groundwater and springs of weishan the concentrations of noble gases display obvious ne excesses and mass dependent differentiation the isotopic ratios indicate that ne ar kr and xe are atmosphere derived noble gases angs we apply the closed system equilibrium ce model to process the data of noble gases and indicate that the excess angs are not caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure or diffusive influx neither meltwater mixing nor oxygen consumption alone could generate sufficient noble gas excesses in our samples based on the reconstructed abundances of noble gases in vapor phases produced at different boiling temperatures which are calculated according to the boiling model established on henry s law we conclude that the abundances of noble gases in these samples were influenced by vapor liquid partition caused by underground boiling the diagrams of 84kr 36ar 20ne 36ar and 130xe 36ar confine the temperature range where the boiling events occur in 100 c 300 c we argued that the excess angs in shallow groundwater are geochemical evidence of boiling events which seems to be continuously happening during the time range confined by the young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer our findings also corroborate the recent results of geophysical survey works that a potential magma chamber exists under weishan area we suggest that noble gases dissolved in shallow aquifers represent a reliable geochemical tool to unveil subsurface geothermal state where no near surface thermal anomaly occurs keywords wudalianchi volcanoes noble gases rayleigh distillation shallow aquifer data availability the authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within its supplementary materials supporting data are provided in tables s1 s3 1 introduction most of the world s volcanoes occur at plate boundaries morgan 1968 located 1600 km away from the japan arc fig 1 a wudalianchi is a typical intraplate volcanic field zhao 2007 on continent which makes wudalianchi a special case to the theory of plate tectonics fig 1b shows the subducting profile of the west pacific plate and similar to changbaishan volcano which is the largest active volcano in northeast china wudalianchi volcanism is driven by the dehydration of stagnant part of subducting pacific slab huang and zhao 2006 zhao 2007 zhang et al 2018 zhao 2021 surface wave tomography of ne china indicates an occurrence of mantle upwelling beneath wudalianchi ma et al 2018 lu et al 2020 and this phenomenon could be related to mantle upwelling beneath changbaishan through a secondary mantle convection guo et al 2016 zhao 2021 according to the geochemical analyses of potassic basalt samples the magma temperature of the 1719 1721 ce eruption is estimated to be 1250 c kuritani et al 2013 which indicates that the magmas supply for wudalianchi volcanic eruptions are primarily derived from the asthenospheric mantle the c he isotopic compositions of bubbling gases in cold springs of wudalianchi see fig 1c have been well studied jianguo et al 1999 xu et al 2013 mao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 and the 3he 4he ratios ranging from 1 88 ra to 3 87 ra with an average value of 3 0 0 4 ra zhao et al 2019 clearly indicate a presence of mantle component mao et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 δ13c values of co2 range from 8 8 to 3 1 consistent with the δ13cco2 values of island arc volcanic gases which range from 9 1 to 1 3 sano and marty 1995 these studies about c he isotopic compositions manifest the occurrence of a mantle component released and transferred to the surface of wudalianchi by cenozoic extension related magmatic activities the multitude of needs for the research on plate tectonics early warning of volcanic eruption hazards and geothermal exploration warrant the discussion of whether the magma chamber under wudalianchi exists recent regional geophysical survey works found a potential magma chamber beneath weishan volcano of wudalianchi volcano field based on dense array seismic imaging li et al 2016 found low velocity bodies beneath the weishan volcano of wudalianchi and these low velocity anomalies are interpreted as manifestation of a magma chamber at a depth of 7 13 km with an estimated volume of 200 km3 3 d magnetotelluric imaging work illuminates the high resolution spatial distribution of a very low resistivity body at a depth of 8 15 km beneath the weishan volcano it reconfirms that there exists a magma chamber gao et al 2020 the eruption sequence of wudalainchi volcanoes corroborates the existence of an uncooled magma chamber under weishan however there is no near surface geothermal abnormality to indicate the existence of magma chamber beneath weishan and the lack of geothermal fluids and geothermal gases makes it an urgent task to seek suitable geochemical tools that can verify the above mentioned geophysical results the two prominent properties of noble gases he ne ar kr and xe inertness and rareness make noble gases excellent tools for tracing the source migration and mixing of subsurface fluids hilton and craig 1989 ballentine et al 2005 castro et al 2009 kendrick et al 2011 crossey et al 2016 in particular isotopic ratios of he and ne are well established tracers for mantle gas fluid provenance fractionated atmosphere derived noble gases angs signatures have been proved to be a robust tool to document thermal events mazor 1977 wen et al 2018 byrne et al 2021 ma et al 2009 and warrier et al 2013 report the dissipation of noble gases in deep brines in the michigan basin those escaping noble gases from the brine be captured and recognized by the shallow groundwater resulting in moderate 20 60 ne excess and large 80 120 ne excess excess of noble gases in the shallow groundwater relative to air saturated water asw previous research of noble gases as indicators for thermal events mainly took geothermal water geothermal vapor natural gases e g pinti et al 2017 harðardóttir et al 2018 wen et al 2018 marty et al 2020 byrne et al 2021 or deep brines ma et al 2009 as study materials here we collected groundwater samples from shallow aquifers in the vicinity area of weishan volcano of wudalianchi and analyzed them for the abundances and isotopic ratios of dissolved noble gases we strive to take weishan as a natural laboratory for studying whether the shallow groundwater could capture and preserve the signature of deep thermal abnormality noble gas abundances of our samples display a clearly mass dependent fractionation pattern contrasting with that of asw which after ruling out other possible causes i e hydraulic pressure related mechanisms and the influence of other external factors is identified as a result of vapor liquid phase separation after boiling events the combined analysis of 20ne 36ar 84kr and 130xe in angs further indicates that the temperatures of these boiling events range from 100 to 300 c this study provides geochemical evidence for a potential magma chamber beneath the weishan volcano of the wudalianchi intraplate volcanic field and also pioneers the utilization of dissolved noble gases in shallow aquifers to investigate deep subsurface geothermal behavior for regions where no near surface thermal abnormality occurs 2 geological and hydrogeological background located at the transition zone between the xiaoxinganling mountain denoted as xxal and the songliao basin sl basin fig 1a wudalianchi volcano field wdf is one of the widely distributed cenozoic volcanic fields surrounding the songliao basin according to the recent high resolution p wave tomography works carried out by wei et al 2019 and lu et al 2020 a hot and wet upwelling flow was revealed in the crust and big mantle wedge under wdf which indicates an association between the formation of the wudalianchi volcanoes and the upwelling of asthenospheric materials above the stagnant part of pacific slab that subducted into the mantle transition zone fig 1b a series of 14 cenozoic volcanoes fig 1c with eruption period from ca 2 5 ma to ca 0 3 ka are located in the northernmost of wdf among which weishan volcano erupted at about ca 50 ka gao et al 2020 two developed faults intersect these wudalianchi volcanoes with a main fault striking nne and the other striking nw fig 1c in general the 14 volcanoes erupted in sequence from southwest to northeast fig 1c indicating the potential existence of new or residual magma chamber under weishan volcano wdf is generally covered by quaternary unconsolidated sediment and the pre quaternary strata are scattered which is very conducive to the infiltration and replenishment of atmospheric precipitation xxal in the north of wdf is the recharge area of wdf s groundwater the overall groundwater flow direction in the wdf is from northeast to southwest wang et al 2021 located in the middle temperate continental seasonal climate zone wdf holds an annual average temperature of 0 5 c as estimated from the wudalianchi city meteorological observatory data from 1980 to 2019 the lowest monthly temperature appears in january and the average monthly temperature of january from 1980 to 2019 is 24 c the highest monthly temperature appears in july and the average monthly temperature of july from 1980 to 2019 is 21 1 c the multi year average precipitation is 514 3 mm and the wet season spans from june to august basalts are exposed on the surface of weishan area late cretaceous nenjiang formation mudstone silt mudstone argillaceous siltstone and gravel bearing mudstone underlie the quaternary strata the underlying rocks are schist quartzite slate and phyllite of beikuanhe formation from neoproterozoic to early cambrian more details are shown in fig 1d two main shallow aquifers are developed in weishan area quaternary basalt phreatic aquifer and cretaceous sandstone confined aquifer in the phreatic aquifer pores and fractures are developed in basalts the water table depth is 10 50 m with the hydraulic head ranging from 2 to 5 m unlike hydraulic head the aquifer thickness varies greatly with an average of 6 m as for the confined aquifer the thickness of this aquifer varies from 5 to 30 m and the depth of the top of the confined aquifer is about 100 120 m the hydraulic head in the confined aquifer declines from 31 m to 1 m along with the water flow 3 samples and methods in this study 2 spring samples and 12 well water samples were collected including 8 phreatic aquifer samples from basalt layer and 4 confined aquifer samples from coarse sandstone layer sample locations are shown in fig 1c when collecting groundwater samples from well we first pumped the wells for 1 h before allowing the water to flow through the 40 cm 3 8 long refrigerated copper tube 14 cm3 via a stainless steel hose after the ph and temperature of the water stabilize both ends of the copper tube are clamped after checking air bubbles as for spring samples a small peristaltic pump was used to pump water through a plastic hose into copper tube and the plastic hose was placed as close to the mouth of the spring as possible to avoid contamination the abundances and the isotopic ratios of dissolved noble gases he ne ar kr xe in the water were measured at the natural gas laboratory at the university of michigan the analytical procedures are briefly described below while further details can be found in wen et al 2016 and wen et al 2017 after being extracted and purified the noble gases are captured into a computer controlled cryogenic separator at about 10 k then with the temperature in cryogenic separator increasing he ne ar kr and xe are sequentially released from the cryogenic separator at 42 80 205 215 and 280 k and introduced into the mass spectrometer he and ne were transferred into the thermo scientific helix sft mass spectrometer while ar kr and xe were introduced into the argus vi mass spectrometer the standard errors for he ne ar kr and xe concentration were 1 5 1 3 1 3 1 5 and 2 2 respectively 4 results sample types well depths noble gas abundances and noble gas isotopic ratios are listed in table s1 and table s2 supplementary materials noble gas concentrations of asw under local annual modern recharge conditions 0 5 c 500 m altitude and of air are both shown for reference except for samples 5 and 9 r ra ratios of basalt aquifer samples where r is the measured 3he 4he ratio and ra is the corresponding 3he 4he in air that is 1 384 10 6 clarke et al 1976 are generally greater than 1 ra air value by definition and 0 985 ra theoretical asw value in particular r ra ratios of samples 4a and 4b are greater than 2 with mantle components contributing 20 to the terrigenic he which is total he minus atomospheric he in the absence tritiogenic he more detailed equations to calculate he components can be found in ma et al 2005 such decoupling phenomena between mantle he and thermal manifestation have been documented before elsewhere e g wang et al 2022 reported cold groundwater sites with r ra varying from 4 87 to 6 37 in guangdong china and niu et al 2017 reported two samples of a spring site with a water temperature of 15 3 c in the island of maui hawaii and the r ra values are 3 82 and 4 27 respectively r ra ratios of samples from sandstone aquifer are less than 1 but higher than the typical crustal r ra range which is 0 02 0 05 oxburgh et al 1986 if mantle components were mixed into the basalt aquifer with the deep groundwater through faults it is hard to avoid mixing such groundwater into the sandstone aquifer which is underneath the basalt aquifer indicating that except for atmospheric components there are also mantle components mixed into the groundwater of sandstone aquifer to make the r ra values higher than typical crustal values r ra values for our spring samples are close to 1 indicating atmospheric origin unlike he isotopic ratios ne ar kr and xe isotopic ratios of our samples generally present atmospheric values within 1σ errors table s2 supplementary materials indicating an apparent decoupling behavior of he and other noble gas isotopes fig 2 a displays total measured abundances for each noble gas element normalized to asw values under local modern recharge conditions with respect to asw all samples present he excesses fig 2a which are mainly composed of atmospheric crustal and mantle components except for sample 12a all samples show ne excesses that are calculated by cne casw casw which vary from 4 6 to 549 4 and the samples of basalt aquifer display higher ne excesses than that of samples from springs and sandstone aquifer to highlight the abundance pattern of angs fig 2b displays the same normalized data except for he which holds excess mantle and crustal components besides atmospheric components samples 5 7 and 9 whose trends are displayed distinctly in fig 2a are also excluded from fig 2b for visual purpose we illustrate the samples by sample type in fig 2b these three subsets show different levels of ne excesses samples from sandstone aquifer display moderate ne excess varying between 4 6 and 30 1 while samples from basalt aquifer show high ne excesses varying between 11 1 and 549 4 and 2 spring samples display slightly ne excesses 5 1 for sample 1 and 4 7 for sample 2 an overall mass dependent pattern that the heavier noble gases are more depleted than the lighter ones is displayed in fig 2b and most samples display an excess of ne and a depletion of kr and xe compared with asw values a similar mass dependent pattern was previously observed in groundwater of hawaii niu et al 2017 and suggested to be related to weather patterns e g cloud heights and rainfall amount for our samples however weather pattern failed to explain the extremely high atmospheric ne excesses thus we list other possible reasons in section 5 1 then discuss their possibilities 5 discussion 5 1 ang excesses hydrostatic pressure influence or external factors the concentration of noble gases in asw is a simple function of the temperature and pressure near the water table when groundwater is recharged in addition to the temperature related asw component groundwater also contains excess air which is caused by the fluctuation of groundwater table the parameters derived from the ce model hold clear physical meanings grundl et al 2013 klump et al 2008 markovich et al 2020 warrier et al 2013 and have been widely used to discuss the formation of excess air in groundwater aeschbach hertig et al 2002 grundl et al 2013 kipfer et al 2002 klump et al 2008 markovich et al 2020 severinghaus and battle 2006 warrier et al 2013 through analyzing the parameters calculated by the ce model the cause of excess angs in groundwater can be identified i e hydraulic pressure driven excess air dissolution or mostly controlled by the addition of external gases other than excess air according to the ce model output klump et al 2008 found that the excess angs in the sedimentary aquifer in southeastern wisconsin are due to the change of hydrostatic pressure caused by the growth of ice covers warrier et al 2013 found that the large excess angs in the michigan basin are not caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure but by external additions outside the aquifer the concentrations of dissolved noble gases in water c iw are described as 1 c iw c iw e q 1 1 f v h i 1 f v h i where the index i refers to any noble gas species c iw e q is the asw component v is the volume of trapped air in per unit volume of water hi is henry s constant for noble gas i and factor f refers to the fractionation factor established for describing the volume variation of trapped gas as a result of bubble dissolution the value of f usually varies from 0 to 1 represents different dissolution degrees of trapped gas where f 0 means that all trapped air bubbles are dissolved completely f 1 indicates that the samples have no bubbles dissolution and f greater than 1 indicates that water sample is degassing aeschbach hertig et al 2008 warrier et al 2013 f can be calculated by 2 f v q w i t h v i n b i n a a n d q p b e p a e where v is the ratio of trapped air volumes in the final and initial states of dissolution respectively q is the ratio of the dry gas pressure in the trapped air to that in free atmosphere n refers to the volume of noble gas i in air bubble p is dry gas pressure of the trapped air and e is the vapor pressure of saturation water subscripts a and b represent the air bubbles states in the initial and final dissolution respectively different from the ne excess ratios used above which are compared with ne abundances in asw with temperature of 0 5 c and altitude of 500 m we utilize the processed outputs of ce model δne values in this section to discuss atmospheric noble gas excesses see in fig 3 and table s3 all of our samples from springs basalt aquifer and sandstone aquifer show high amounts of δne values δne 10 0 85 01 with some samples sample 5 7 and 9 are even higher than the typical values of δne in groundwater δne 10 50 see kipfer et al 2002 air contamination during sample collecting could lead to atmospheric ne excesses but failed to explain the fractionation between light and heavy noble gas elements as the elemental composition of noble gases in dry air ozima and podosek 2002 is not mass depended thus we need other mechanisms instead of air contamination to explain the regional systematic ne excesses in continental aquifer systems δne values of 80 have rarely been reported two main mechanisms were previously suggested to explain the abnormally high δne in groundwater hydraulic pressure related mechanisms and the influence of external factors the hydraulic pressure related mechanisms contain 1 more frequent intense rain events 2 the advancing of ice covers klump et al 2008 and 3 enhanced fluctuations of groundwater table beyerle et al 2003 kulongoski et al 2009 the external factors include 1 admixture of glacial meltwater niu et al 2015 and such meltwater is reported to contain as high as hundreds of percent of δne loose et al 2009 2 the diffusive influx of excess air from the deep and 3 the o2 depletion without the corresponding increase of co2 will lead to an increase in the noble gases partial pressure in the unsaturated region hall et al 2005 and 4 the addition of released angs from the past boiling event at depth which subsequently were transported to shallow aquifers along with groundwater convection ma et al 2009 warrier et al 2013 fig 3a shows the calculated fractionation factor f as a function of ne excess derived from the ce model the best fitting lines for sandstone aquifer samples and basalt aquifer samples are made individually the f values of basalt aquifer samples range from 0 to 0 89 and δne values range from 10 00 to 85 01 the f values of sandstone aquifer samples range from 0 to 0 90 and δne values range from 10 00 to 24 73 the f values of sample 10 in the basalt aquifer and sample 12a in the sandstone aquifer are 0 indicating that the trapped noble gases were completely dissolved the f values of the other samples including spring samples range from 0 to 1 indicating that the entrapped noble gas was dissolved with different degrees the correlations between f and δne of samples from basalt aquifer and sandstone aquifer are negative both with r2 0 98 respectively the negative correlations between f and δne suggest that the large amount of dissolved excess air is due to more thorough dissolution low f value indicates high dissolution level of the captured bubbles in other words lower f fractionation level so the increase in ne excess of our samples is controlled by dissolution instead of diffusive influx which will further be consolidated by the discussion about isotope fractionation conditions in section 5 2 2 the fitting line between q and δne is approximately horizontal for samples from sandstone aquifer fig 3b the δne values of our samples from sandstone aquifer range from 10 00 to 24 73 table s3 while q values that represent hydrostatic pressure are not significantly changed vary from 1 00 to 1 05 indicating that the large amount of ang excesses in the sandstone aquifer is unrelated to the increase of q which emphasized the possibility of external factors the calculated f v and q values of spring samples are similar with that of samples from sandstone aquifer so in the absence of sufficient data to fit we can assume that the ang excesses in springs are also not related to q different from samples from sandstone aquifer the q values among the samples from basalt aquifer which vary from 1 00 to 3 88 display a larger range of variation but the correlation between their q and δne is not strong enough to exclude the influence of external factors r2 0 77 different from the condition of sandstone layer angs excesses in basalt aquifer seem to be caused by the joint influence of hydrostatic pressure increase and external factors according to eq 2 both q and volume ratio v of trapped bubbles affect the solubility of bubbles and the increase of hydrostatic pressure high q value will lead to the increase of noble gases solubility in groundwater which in turn will reduce the gas volume ratio v δne of our samples is negatively correlated with f but has no correlation with q this suggest a negative correlation between δne and v which is verified by the strong negative between v and δne shown in fig 3c with r2 0 99 for samples from sandstone aquifer and r2 0 93 for samples from basalt aquifer and such strong negative correlations suggests that the increase of excess air dissolution is due to the decrease of trapped gas volume ratio v without significant influence of hydrostatic pressure increase therefore we propose that external factors contribute to the large amounts of excess angs in weishan area which we will further discuss below we found no evidence of pure glacial meltwater infiltration as there was no exceptionally large δne content on the order of glacial meltwater several hundred percent of excess ne in our samples additionally according to the groundwater isotopes analysis carried out by wang et al 2021 d and 18o isotopes of weishan groundwater display no strongly depletion and local hydrogeologic condition indicates that groundwater recharge of wdf is driven largely by atmospheric precipitation thus we can rule out the possibility that glacial meltwater were added to the groundwater according to the calculation by warrier et al 2013 the maximum excesses of noble gases produced by an oxygen depletion od mechanism without the corresponding increase of co2 is only 26 6 the δne values of our samples from basalt aquifer 34 4 85 01 are much higher than 26 6 therefore the contribution of od mechanism if any to the ne excess of our water samples will be minor or even negligible to further investigate the possibility of other external factors we evaluate the enrichment or depletion degree of noble gases relative to air composition by introducing the factor f i wen et al 2018 which can be used to evaluate whether boiling or condensation signal occurs in the origin reservoir of the samples f i is calculated by normalizing the volume fractions of measured noble gas isotope i to the corresponding noble gas isotope value in air while 36ar is taken as the reference isotope i e f i i 36ar measured i 36ar air fig 4 a and 4b respectively illustrate the measured r ra values compared to f 20ne and f 130xe values most of the samples show deviations to different degrees from the asw values fig 4 which can be explained by mixing the asw with other end members including atmospheric air mantle crustal and boiling vapor phase of atmospheric noble gases in both fig 4a and 4b samples 5 and 9 show an offset towards air end member indicating the addition of air or fractionated vapor phase originated from pure asw without crustal or mantle components in fig 4a samples 13 and 14 indicate the mixing between asw and aswc asw with the addition of crustal helium while in fig 4b a slight contribution of vapor phase fractionation is observed in samples 13 and 14 the rest samples display a mixing trend between asw and aswm asw adding mantle helium and both in fig 4a and 4b trends of vapor phase fractionation occur these mixing trends consolidate the hypothesis that the element fractionation among heavy and light noble gases observed in shallow groundwater as well as springs in weishan area is a result of mixing with vapor phase which is the product of vapor liquid separation caused by potential boiling events under weishan although there is no near surface geothermal abnormality displayed near weishan area recent geophysical results which display low velocity anomaly see a a and b b cross sections of shear wave velocity from li et al 2016 and low resistivity body see all four cross sections of resistivity from gao et al 2020 at the depth of 10 km in the crust of weishan that are interpreted as a potential magma chamber reinforce our speculation of modern underground boiling events under weishan after ruling out all the possible external factors described in section 5 1 except for boiling events we argue that the atmospheric ne excesses observed in weishan area are ang remnants released from the boiling of the deep fluids to the shallow layer 5 2 noble gas pattern as implication for thermal event under weishan volcano noble gas signals of vapor phase from vapor liquid fractionation have been reported in several hydrothermal systems such as the los azufres geothermal field in mexico wen et al 2018 and the icelandic geothermal system byrne et al 2021 noble gas signals in residual liquid phases have also been reported such as brines that show noble gas depletion in deep aquifer of the michigan basin ma et al 2009 in order to further evaluate the likelihood of the underground boiling events and the temperature at which the boiling occurred and vapor phase be separated we adopted a boiling model established on henry s law to reconstruct the abundances of vapor phase noble gases for different temperatures and compared them with our data for interpretation 5 2 1 the boiling model according to henry s law mazor and truesdell 1984 established the boiling model to describe the fractionation degree of noble gases between vapor and liquid phases when a boiling event occurs a mass balance can be used to describe the fractionation of a noble gas from initial asw into vapor phase and residual liquid phase 3 c asw x v c v 1 x v c l where casw cv and cl are the noble gas abundances e g 20ne 36ar 130xe dissolved in the initial asw vapor phase steam and residual liquid respectively xv and 1 xv represent the fractions of vapor phase and residual liquid phase after boiling occurs respectively a is the fractionation coefficient of noble gases between liquid phase and vapor phase can be calculated by 4 a c v c l by substituting eq 4 into eq 3 a formula can be derived to calculate the noble gas abundance in vapor phase as a function of xv and a 5 c v a c asw a 1 x v 1 the coefficient a is temperature dependent and can be calculated for each noble gas at a given temperature wagner and pruss 1993 harvey 1996 ozima and podosek 2002 fernández prini et al 2003 byrne et al 2021 the calculating methods and needed parameters are outlined in supplemental text 5 2 2 noble gas abundances indicate boiling events when evaluating the noble gas differentiation the highest atmosphere derived isotope abundance for each element is usually considered 20ne 36ar 84kr 130xe and132xe can be used when fissiogenic xe is negligible byrne et al 2021 using eq 5 we can calculate the maximum fractionation of vapor phase which occurs at the initial partitioning xv 0 fig 5 illustrates the maximum fractionation vapor phase line that fractionated from the initial asw phase in a certain temperature range and except for samples 5 and 9 that offset towards air end member noble gas abundances of our samples are close to the vapor phase fractional line showing that 20ne 36ar 84kr 130xe abundances are in good correlation with boiling temperature which consolidates our speculation that external factors influence noble gas pattern in weishan area and the external factor for our samples refer to the addition of vapor phase caused by boiling events it should be noted that as shown in fig 5 mixing with asw will move data points toward the asw end member resulting in overestimated temperature records in addition continuous fractionation will also reduce the abundance of noble gases leading to data points moving downwards along the vapor phase line which will also lead to overestimated temperature records the temperature range in fig 5 where our samples are located is not the real boiling temperature range which requires other analytical methods to discern the influence of asw and continuous fractionation and we will take these factors into account when discussing about the boiling temperature range in section 5 2 3 when there is a certain concentration gradient of noble gases in underground water molecular diffusion is a mechanism that cannot be ignored which can lead to the abundance differentiation among heavy and light elements of noble gases molecular diffusion transport is generally thought to result in mass dependent differentiation of ne and ar isotopes inversely proportional to the square root relationship of their atomic mass ratios tyroller et al 2014 whereas fractionation of kr and xe isotopes has not been observed in the molecular diffusion experiments carried out by tyroller et al 2018 since the molecular diffusion coefficient of noble gases decreases with the increase of atomic mass the diffusion rate of light noble gases he ne ar is much faster than that of weight noble gases kr xe and both elements and isotopes of light noble gases will be fractionated when diffusion occurs if diffusion is a non negligible factor that influences the fractionation among light and heavy noble gases of our samples then isotope fractionations of ne and ar should also be observed however isotope ratios of ne and ar in our samples are very close to asw values without significant isotopic fractionation thus diffusive influx can be excluded as a controlling factor for noble gas pattern of weishan and the separated vapor after boiling should be carried into shallow aquifers by deep circulation groundwater without significant diffusion occurs 5 2 3 estimated temperature range at which boiling occurs in a high enthalpy hydrothermal system with well researched geological conditions the required depth and temperature for the initial boiling to occur can be estimated through introducing a boiling point curve ma et al 2009 when the condition ofsubsurface geothermal water encounters the boiling point curve boiling event will occur as well as phase separation in fact the establishment of a boiling point curve is a complicated function that needs a multitude of factors including geothermal gradient ground stress condition and the content of dissolved gas in the fluids however the confirmations for every factor need more detailed information and fieldwork to support which is beyond the scope of this research and we will only discuss the temperature range where the boiling might occur according to the analysis in section 5 2 2 the concentrations of ne ar kr and xe are mainly controlled by temperature dependent vapor liquid fractionation we can analyze the temperature range when vapor liquid separation occurs according to the diagram based on the boiling model fig 6 the maximum fractionation of this complementary vapor phase is plotted as a solid red line in fig 6 representing the maximum fractionation over a certain temperature range taking the values of xv from 0 to 1 we can get continuous fractionation lines to show the selected annotation temperature dashed lines in fig 6 according to eq 5 air addition during sampling or during degassing the samples in the laboratory will increase the ang abundances and results in an underestimation of the estimated boiling temperature samples 5 and 9 that from basalt aquifer display significantly offsets toward the air end member fig 6 such air influence also can be recognized in fig 3b fig 4 and fig 5 while the remaining samples are subject to negligible air influence samples 3 12a and 12b are located to the right of the maximum vapor phase fractionation line showing relative enrichment of 84kr to 36ar which may indicate the admixture of sedimentary kr released by organic matter e g shale high 84kr 36ar ratios have also been previously reported in brine samples from deep aquifer of the michigan basin ma et al 2009 as well as in hydrocarbon related samples from san juan basin zhou et al 2005 and those high 84kr 36ar ratios have been interpreted as organic kr release from local sedimentary matter the fractionation between heavy and light isotopes is regionally systematic while kr enrichment is only shown in three samples in this case it can be speculated that the organic noble gases which show kr enrichment are not likely to be added into the deep circulating asw before the boiling event occurs otherwise our samples should display an overall 84kr enrichment accompanying the systematic mass dependent fractionation as we can recognize in fig 6 except for samples 5 and 9 that are located above the maximum vapor phase fractionation line and samples 3 12a and 12b that are located to the right of the maximum vapor phase fractionation line most of the plotted data are located within the continuous fractionation lines controlled by the temperatures vary from 100 c to 300 c the samples show convergence towards asw end member which may indicate a high degree of fractionation or and mixing with shallow asw the mixing line between the asw and the maximum fractionation point should be a straight line connecting two points which hold no significant difference from the continuous fractionation line so for visual purposes the mixing lines are not drawn in fig 6 due to the poor constraints at the deep conditions of weishan area we cannot distinguish these two possible reasons that can result in the convergence towards asw end member however they both indicate the occurrence of boiling events and they hold no significant difference under the accuracy requirements for evaluating temperature range of boiling if the noble gas pattern in our samples is controlled by vapor liquid fractionation we should expect to find samples in deeper reservoirs that can record the residual complementary liquid phase for the vapor phase signals displayed in this study and those potential samples will locate between asw and the maximum fractionation liquid phase line in fig 6 the sampling for the deeper reservoir of weishan area will be carried out soon the noble gas pattern in weishan area is caused by vapor liquid separation due to boiling and the separated vapor phase has undergone no obvious diffusion in the process of upward migration to shallow aquifers we speculated that the upward migration of gas is dominated by groundwater circulation controlled by faults based on the above speculations we draw a schematic plot to show the formation mechanism of the noble gas pattern of our samples see fig 7 the boiling events seem to be continuously happening in the time scale confined by the time limit provided by young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer according to our results fig 4 high 3he 4he magma gases only affect two wells i e where we collected samples 4a 4b 11a and 11b however the mass related trends about element abundances of heavy noble gases ne ar kr and xe can be recognized in all of our samples fig 2 this decoupling behavior between he and other noble gases indicates a different mechanism other than magmatic gases and further discussions indicate the influence of separated vapor phase after asw boiling the isotopic compositions of volcanic noble gases are often indistinguishable from that of the atmosphere that is because when volcanic gas enters the local circulation system it is usually saturated with atmospheric noble gases that could overwhelm the mantle component except for he which is so strongly depleted in the atmosphere as kaneoka 1980 pointed out when fractionation occurs the maximum enrichment of the 3he 4he ratio by a single mass fractionation process is not higher than 16 hence it is difficult to explain the high 3he 4he ratios displayed in our samples by a single mass fractionation of atmospheric he since samples 3 4a 4b 8 11a and 11b display 20 more enrichment of the 3he 4he ratio than air value table s1 supplementary materials meanwhile the atmospheric characteristic of ne and ar isotopes seems not to support the occurrence of diffusion processes like diffusion and rayleigh distillation cannot explain the high 3he 4he ratio in the sample so it is suggested that the high 3he 4he ratios in our samples are due to inherited mantle end member characteristics different from the overall characteristic of atmospheric ne excess and noble gas element fractionation in each sample the non atmospheric 3he 4he values only appear in a few individual samples indicating that the additions of the crustal or mantle components have not mixed into the deep circulation groundwater before the vapor liquid phase fractionation occurs fig 7 based on the published data we can acquire now it s hard to distinguish the source of these mantle components which might be from the potential magma chamber in the shallow crust under weishan and or from deeper reservoir 6 conclusions the isotopic compositions of he in our samples show the addition of crust derived and mantle derived he while the ne xe isotope ratios only indicate atmospheric sources the noble gas pattern displays a general mass dependent trend that lighter noble gases are more abundant than heavier noble gases and also show atmospheric ne excesses relative to asw under local modern recharge conditions we have adopted the ce model to process the measured noble gas data and the results indicate that the excess ang in our samples is not caused by the increase of hydrostatic pressure meanwhile the diffusive influx is also excluded as one external factor through further discussion we confirmed that there is no admixture of glacial meltwater and oxygen depletion alone cannot generate enough noble gas excess according to the boiling model based on henry s law we reconstruct the noble gas abundances in vapor phase of different boiling temperatures which indicates that the abundances of angs in our samples are influenced by fractionated vapor phase that can be the outcome of subsurface boiling events the results of 84kr 36ar vs 20ne 36ar and 130xe 36ar indicate that most of our data are located in the noble gas fractionation line from 100 c to 300 c and the samples showed convergence towards the asw end member which can be interpreted as a high degree of fractionation or and mixing with shallow asw the young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer provides the time limit when the boiling events seem to be continuously happening these findings strengthen the geophysical imaging results that there are potential magma chambers in the shallow crust of weishan which are not in equilibrium with the temperature of the surrounding rock these incomplete cooling hot magmas will heat up deep circling asw and when the condition of hot fluids encounters the boiling point curve boiling events will occur generating the vapor phase that is responsible for the abnormal ang signals in shallow groundwater of weishan we suggest that noble gases dissolved in shallow aquifers

3144,the study on whether there is a magma chamber under wudalianchi is a hot topic recently as it holds great significances for the theory of plate tectonics early warning of volcano eruption and geothermal exploration there is no near surface geothermal abnormality reported in weishan the widely used and well studied tool geochemistry of geothermal fluids and geothermal gases cannot be applied to this area to reveal the thermal conditions under weishan we conducted a study about the abundances and isotope ratios of dissolved noble gases in shallow groundwater and springs of weishan the concentrations of noble gases display obvious ne excesses and mass dependent differentiation the isotopic ratios indicate that ne ar kr and xe are atmosphere derived noble gases angs we apply the closed system equilibrium ce model to process the data of noble gases and indicate that the excess angs are not caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure or diffusive influx neither meltwater mixing nor oxygen consumption alone could generate sufficient noble gas excesses in our samples based on the reconstructed abundances of noble gases in vapor phases produced at different boiling temperatures which are calculated according to the boiling model established on henry s law we conclude that the abundances of noble gases in these samples were influenced by vapor liquid partition caused by underground boiling the diagrams of 84kr 36ar 20ne 36ar and 130xe 36ar confine the temperature range where the boiling events occur in 100 c 300 c we argued that the excess angs in shallow groundwater are geochemical evidence of boiling events which seems to be continuously happening during the time range confined by the young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer our findings also corroborate the recent results of geophysical survey works that a potential magma chamber exists under weishan area we suggest that noble gases dissolved in shallow aquifers represent a reliable geochemical tool to unveil subsurface geothermal state where no near surface thermal anomaly occurs keywords wudalianchi volcanoes noble gases rayleigh distillation shallow aquifer data availability the authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within its supplementary materials supporting data are provided in tables s1 s3 1 introduction most of the world s volcanoes occur at plate boundaries morgan 1968 located 1600 km away from the japan arc fig 1 a wudalianchi is a typical intraplate volcanic field zhao 2007 on continent which makes wudalianchi a special case to the theory of plate tectonics fig 1b shows the subducting profile of the west pacific plate and similar to changbaishan volcano which is the largest active volcano in northeast china wudalianchi volcanism is driven by the dehydration of stagnant part of subducting pacific slab huang and zhao 2006 zhao 2007 zhang et al 2018 zhao 2021 surface wave tomography of ne china indicates an occurrence of mantle upwelling beneath wudalianchi ma et al 2018 lu et al 2020 and this phenomenon could be related to mantle upwelling beneath changbaishan through a secondary mantle convection guo et al 2016 zhao 2021 according to the geochemical analyses of potassic basalt samples the magma temperature of the 1719 1721 ce eruption is estimated to be 1250 c kuritani et al 2013 which indicates that the magmas supply for wudalianchi volcanic eruptions are primarily derived from the asthenospheric mantle the c he isotopic compositions of bubbling gases in cold springs of wudalianchi see fig 1c have been well studied jianguo et al 1999 xu et al 2013 mao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 and the 3he 4he ratios ranging from 1 88 ra to 3 87 ra with an average value of 3 0 0 4 ra zhao et al 2019 clearly indicate a presence of mantle component mao et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 δ13c values of co2 range from 8 8 to 3 1 consistent with the δ13cco2 values of island arc volcanic gases which range from 9 1 to 1 3 sano and marty 1995 these studies about c he isotopic compositions manifest the occurrence of a mantle component released and transferred to the surface of wudalianchi by cenozoic extension related magmatic activities the multitude of needs for the research on plate tectonics early warning of volcanic eruption hazards and geothermal exploration warrant the discussion of whether the magma chamber under wudalianchi exists recent regional geophysical survey works found a potential magma chamber beneath weishan volcano of wudalianchi volcano field based on dense array seismic imaging li et al 2016 found low velocity bodies beneath the weishan volcano of wudalianchi and these low velocity anomalies are interpreted as manifestation of a magma chamber at a depth of 7 13 km with an estimated volume of 200 km3 3 d magnetotelluric imaging work illuminates the high resolution spatial distribution of a very low resistivity body at a depth of 8 15 km beneath the weishan volcano it reconfirms that there exists a magma chamber gao et al 2020 the eruption sequence of wudalainchi volcanoes corroborates the existence of an uncooled magma chamber under weishan however there is no near surface geothermal abnormality to indicate the existence of magma chamber beneath weishan and the lack of geothermal fluids and geothermal gases makes it an urgent task to seek suitable geochemical tools that can verify the above mentioned geophysical results the two prominent properties of noble gases he ne ar kr and xe inertness and rareness make noble gases excellent tools for tracing the source migration and mixing of subsurface fluids hilton and craig 1989 ballentine et al 2005 castro et al 2009 kendrick et al 2011 crossey et al 2016 in particular isotopic ratios of he and ne are well established tracers for mantle gas fluid provenance fractionated atmosphere derived noble gases angs signatures have been proved to be a robust tool to document thermal events mazor 1977 wen et al 2018 byrne et al 2021 ma et al 2009 and warrier et al 2013 report the dissipation of noble gases in deep brines in the michigan basin those escaping noble gases from the brine be captured and recognized by the shallow groundwater resulting in moderate 20 60 ne excess and large 80 120 ne excess excess of noble gases in the shallow groundwater relative to air saturated water asw previous research of noble gases as indicators for thermal events mainly took geothermal water geothermal vapor natural gases e g pinti et al 2017 harðardóttir et al 2018 wen et al 2018 marty et al 2020 byrne et al 2021 or deep brines ma et al 2009 as study materials here we collected groundwater samples from shallow aquifers in the vicinity area of weishan volcano of wudalianchi and analyzed them for the abundances and isotopic ratios of dissolved noble gases we strive to take weishan as a natural laboratory for studying whether the shallow groundwater could capture and preserve the signature of deep thermal abnormality noble gas abundances of our samples display a clearly mass dependent fractionation pattern contrasting with that of asw which after ruling out other possible causes i e hydraulic pressure related mechanisms and the influence of other external factors is identified as a result of vapor liquid phase separation after boiling events the combined analysis of 20ne 36ar 84kr and 130xe in angs further indicates that the temperatures of these boiling events range from 100 to 300 c this study provides geochemical evidence for a potential magma chamber beneath the weishan volcano of the wudalianchi intraplate volcanic field and also pioneers the utilization of dissolved noble gases in shallow aquifers to investigate deep subsurface geothermal behavior for regions where no near surface thermal abnormality occurs 2 geological and hydrogeological background located at the transition zone between the xiaoxinganling mountain denoted as xxal and the songliao basin sl basin fig 1a wudalianchi volcano field wdf is one of the widely distributed cenozoic volcanic fields surrounding the songliao basin according to the recent high resolution p wave tomography works carried out by wei et al 2019 and lu et al 2020 a hot and wet upwelling flow was revealed in the crust and big mantle wedge under wdf which indicates an association between the formation of the wudalianchi volcanoes and the upwelling of asthenospheric materials above the stagnant part of pacific slab that subducted into the mantle transition zone fig 1b a series of 14 cenozoic volcanoes fig 1c with eruption period from ca 2 5 ma to ca 0 3 ka are located in the northernmost of wdf among which weishan volcano erupted at about ca 50 ka gao et al 2020 two developed faults intersect these wudalianchi volcanoes with a main fault striking nne and the other striking nw fig 1c in general the 14 volcanoes erupted in sequence from southwest to northeast fig 1c indicating the potential existence of new or residual magma chamber under weishan volcano wdf is generally covered by quaternary unconsolidated sediment and the pre quaternary strata are scattered which is very conducive to the infiltration and replenishment of atmospheric precipitation xxal in the north of wdf is the recharge area of wdf s groundwater the overall groundwater flow direction in the wdf is from northeast to southwest wang et al 2021 located in the middle temperate continental seasonal climate zone wdf holds an annual average temperature of 0 5 c as estimated from the wudalianchi city meteorological observatory data from 1980 to 2019 the lowest monthly temperature appears in january and the average monthly temperature of january from 1980 to 2019 is 24 c the highest monthly temperature appears in july and the average monthly temperature of july from 1980 to 2019 is 21 1 c the multi year average precipitation is 514 3 mm and the wet season spans from june to august basalts are exposed on the surface of weishan area late cretaceous nenjiang formation mudstone silt mudstone argillaceous siltstone and gravel bearing mudstone underlie the quaternary strata the underlying rocks are schist quartzite slate and phyllite of beikuanhe formation from neoproterozoic to early cambrian more details are shown in fig 1d two main shallow aquifers are developed in weishan area quaternary basalt phreatic aquifer and cretaceous sandstone confined aquifer in the phreatic aquifer pores and fractures are developed in basalts the water table depth is 10 50 m with the hydraulic head ranging from 2 to 5 m unlike hydraulic head the aquifer thickness varies greatly with an average of 6 m as for the confined aquifer the thickness of this aquifer varies from 5 to 30 m and the depth of the top of the confined aquifer is about 100 120 m the hydraulic head in the confined aquifer declines from 31 m to 1 m along with the water flow 3 samples and methods in this study 2 spring samples and 12 well water samples were collected including 8 phreatic aquifer samples from basalt layer and 4 confined aquifer samples from coarse sandstone layer sample locations are shown in fig 1c when collecting groundwater samples from well we first pumped the wells for 1 h before allowing the water to flow through the 40 cm 3 8 long refrigerated copper tube 14 cm3 via a stainless steel hose after the ph and temperature of the water stabilize both ends of the copper tube are clamped after checking air bubbles as for spring samples a small peristaltic pump was used to pump water through a plastic hose into copper tube and the plastic hose was placed as close to the mouth of the spring as possible to avoid contamination the abundances and the isotopic ratios of dissolved noble gases he ne ar kr xe in the water were measured at the natural gas laboratory at the university of michigan the analytical procedures are briefly described below while further details can be found in wen et al 2016 and wen et al 2017 after being extracted and purified the noble gases are captured into a computer controlled cryogenic separator at about 10 k then with the temperature in cryogenic separator increasing he ne ar kr and xe are sequentially released from the cryogenic separator at 42 80 205 215 and 280 k and introduced into the mass spectrometer he and ne were transferred into the thermo scientific helix sft mass spectrometer while ar kr and xe were introduced into the argus vi mass spectrometer the standard errors for he ne ar kr and xe concentration were 1 5 1 3 1 3 1 5 and 2 2 respectively 4 results sample types well depths noble gas abundances and noble gas isotopic ratios are listed in table s1 and table s2 supplementary materials noble gas concentrations of asw under local annual modern recharge conditions 0 5 c 500 m altitude and of air are both shown for reference except for samples 5 and 9 r ra ratios of basalt aquifer samples where r is the measured 3he 4he ratio and ra is the corresponding 3he 4he in air that is 1 384 10 6 clarke et al 1976 are generally greater than 1 ra air value by definition and 0 985 ra theoretical asw value in particular r ra ratios of samples 4a and 4b are greater than 2 with mantle components contributing 20 to the terrigenic he which is total he minus atomospheric he in the absence tritiogenic he more detailed equations to calculate he components can be found in ma et al 2005 such decoupling phenomena between mantle he and thermal manifestation have been documented before elsewhere e g wang et al 2022 reported cold groundwater sites with r ra varying from 4 87 to 6 37 in guangdong china and niu et al 2017 reported two samples of a spring site with a water temperature of 15 3 c in the island of maui hawaii and the r ra values are 3 82 and 4 27 respectively r ra ratios of samples from sandstone aquifer are less than 1 but higher than the typical crustal r ra range which is 0 02 0 05 oxburgh et al 1986 if mantle components were mixed into the basalt aquifer with the deep groundwater through faults it is hard to avoid mixing such groundwater into the sandstone aquifer which is underneath the basalt aquifer indicating that except for atmospheric components there are also mantle components mixed into the groundwater of sandstone aquifer to make the r ra values higher than typical crustal values r ra values for our spring samples are close to 1 indicating atmospheric origin unlike he isotopic ratios ne ar kr and xe isotopic ratios of our samples generally present atmospheric values within 1σ errors table s2 supplementary materials indicating an apparent decoupling behavior of he and other noble gas isotopes fig 2 a displays total measured abundances for each noble gas element normalized to asw values under local modern recharge conditions with respect to asw all samples present he excesses fig 2a which are mainly composed of atmospheric crustal and mantle components except for sample 12a all samples show ne excesses that are calculated by cne casw casw which vary from 4 6 to 549 4 and the samples of basalt aquifer display higher ne excesses than that of samples from springs and sandstone aquifer to highlight the abundance pattern of angs fig 2b displays the same normalized data except for he which holds excess mantle and crustal components besides atmospheric components samples 5 7 and 9 whose trends are displayed distinctly in fig 2a are also excluded from fig 2b for visual purpose we illustrate the samples by sample type in fig 2b these three subsets show different levels of ne excesses samples from sandstone aquifer display moderate ne excess varying between 4 6 and 30 1 while samples from basalt aquifer show high ne excesses varying between 11 1 and 549 4 and 2 spring samples display slightly ne excesses 5 1 for sample 1 and 4 7 for sample 2 an overall mass dependent pattern that the heavier noble gases are more depleted than the lighter ones is displayed in fig 2b and most samples display an excess of ne and a depletion of kr and xe compared with asw values a similar mass dependent pattern was previously observed in groundwater of hawaii niu et al 2017 and suggested to be related to weather patterns e g cloud heights and rainfall amount for our samples however weather pattern failed to explain the extremely high atmospheric ne excesses thus we list other possible reasons in section 5 1 then discuss their possibilities 5 discussion 5 1 ang excesses hydrostatic pressure influence or external factors the concentration of noble gases in asw is a simple function of the temperature and pressure near the water table when groundwater is recharged in addition to the temperature related asw component groundwater also contains excess air which is caused by the fluctuation of groundwater table the parameters derived from the ce model hold clear physical meanings grundl et al 2013 klump et al 2008 markovich et al 2020 warrier et al 2013 and have been widely used to discuss the formation of excess air in groundwater aeschbach hertig et al 2002 grundl et al 2013 kipfer et al 2002 klump et al 2008 markovich et al 2020 severinghaus and battle 2006 warrier et al 2013 through analyzing the parameters calculated by the ce model the cause of excess angs in groundwater can be identified i e hydraulic pressure driven excess air dissolution or mostly controlled by the addition of external gases other than excess air according to the ce model output klump et al 2008 found that the excess angs in the sedimentary aquifer in southeastern wisconsin are due to the change of hydrostatic pressure caused by the growth of ice covers warrier et al 2013 found that the large excess angs in the michigan basin are not caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure but by external additions outside the aquifer the concentrations of dissolved noble gases in water c iw are described as 1 c iw c iw e q 1 1 f v h i 1 f v h i where the index i refers to any noble gas species c iw e q is the asw component v is the volume of trapped air in per unit volume of water hi is henry s constant for noble gas i and factor f refers to the fractionation factor established for describing the volume variation of trapped gas as a result of bubble dissolution the value of f usually varies from 0 to 1 represents different dissolution degrees of trapped gas where f 0 means that all trapped air bubbles are dissolved completely f 1 indicates that the samples have no bubbles dissolution and f greater than 1 indicates that water sample is degassing aeschbach hertig et al 2008 warrier et al 2013 f can be calculated by 2 f v q w i t h v i n b i n a a n d q p b e p a e where v is the ratio of trapped air volumes in the final and initial states of dissolution respectively q is the ratio of the dry gas pressure in the trapped air to that in free atmosphere n refers to the volume of noble gas i in air bubble p is dry gas pressure of the trapped air and e is the vapor pressure of saturation water subscripts a and b represent the air bubbles states in the initial and final dissolution respectively different from the ne excess ratios used above which are compared with ne abundances in asw with temperature of 0 5 c and altitude of 500 m we utilize the processed outputs of ce model δne values in this section to discuss atmospheric noble gas excesses see in fig 3 and table s3 all of our samples from springs basalt aquifer and sandstone aquifer show high amounts of δne values δne 10 0 85 01 with some samples sample 5 7 and 9 are even higher than the typical values of δne in groundwater δne 10 50 see kipfer et al 2002 air contamination during sample collecting could lead to atmospheric ne excesses but failed to explain the fractionation between light and heavy noble gas elements as the elemental composition of noble gases in dry air ozima and podosek 2002 is not mass depended thus we need other mechanisms instead of air contamination to explain the regional systematic ne excesses in continental aquifer systems δne values of 80 have rarely been reported two main mechanisms were previously suggested to explain the abnormally high δne in groundwater hydraulic pressure related mechanisms and the influence of external factors the hydraulic pressure related mechanisms contain 1 more frequent intense rain events 2 the advancing of ice covers klump et al 2008 and 3 enhanced fluctuations of groundwater table beyerle et al 2003 kulongoski et al 2009 the external factors include 1 admixture of glacial meltwater niu et al 2015 and such meltwater is reported to contain as high as hundreds of percent of δne loose et al 2009 2 the diffusive influx of excess air from the deep and 3 the o2 depletion without the corresponding increase of co2 will lead to an increase in the noble gases partial pressure in the unsaturated region hall et al 2005 and 4 the addition of released angs from the past boiling event at depth which subsequently were transported to shallow aquifers along with groundwater convection ma et al 2009 warrier et al 2013 fig 3a shows the calculated fractionation factor f as a function of ne excess derived from the ce model the best fitting lines for sandstone aquifer samples and basalt aquifer samples are made individually the f values of basalt aquifer samples range from 0 to 0 89 and δne values range from 10 00 to 85 01 the f values of sandstone aquifer samples range from 0 to 0 90 and δne values range from 10 00 to 24 73 the f values of sample 10 in the basalt aquifer and sample 12a in the sandstone aquifer are 0 indicating that the trapped noble gases were completely dissolved the f values of the other samples including spring samples range from 0 to 1 indicating that the entrapped noble gas was dissolved with different degrees the correlations between f and δne of samples from basalt aquifer and sandstone aquifer are negative both with r2 0 98 respectively the negative correlations between f and δne suggest that the large amount of dissolved excess air is due to more thorough dissolution low f value indicates high dissolution level of the captured bubbles in other words lower f fractionation level so the increase in ne excess of our samples is controlled by dissolution instead of diffusive influx which will further be consolidated by the discussion about isotope fractionation conditions in section 5 2 2 the fitting line between q and δne is approximately horizontal for samples from sandstone aquifer fig 3b the δne values of our samples from sandstone aquifer range from 10 00 to 24 73 table s3 while q values that represent hydrostatic pressure are not significantly changed vary from 1 00 to 1 05 indicating that the large amount of ang excesses in the sandstone aquifer is unrelated to the increase of q which emphasized the possibility of external factors the calculated f v and q values of spring samples are similar with that of samples from sandstone aquifer so in the absence of sufficient data to fit we can assume that the ang excesses in springs are also not related to q different from samples from sandstone aquifer the q values among the samples from basalt aquifer which vary from 1 00 to 3 88 display a larger range of variation but the correlation between their q and δne is not strong enough to exclude the influence of external factors r2 0 77 different from the condition of sandstone layer angs excesses in basalt aquifer seem to be caused by the joint influence of hydrostatic pressure increase and external factors according to eq 2 both q and volume ratio v of trapped bubbles affect the solubility of bubbles and the increase of hydrostatic pressure high q value will lead to the increase of noble gases solubility in groundwater which in turn will reduce the gas volume ratio v δne of our samples is negatively correlated with f but has no correlation with q this suggest a negative correlation between δne and v which is verified by the strong negative between v and δne shown in fig 3c with r2 0 99 for samples from sandstone aquifer and r2 0 93 for samples from basalt aquifer and such strong negative correlations suggests that the increase of excess air dissolution is due to the decrease of trapped gas volume ratio v without significant influence of hydrostatic pressure increase therefore we propose that external factors contribute to the large amounts of excess angs in weishan area which we will further discuss below we found no evidence of pure glacial meltwater infiltration as there was no exceptionally large δne content on the order of glacial meltwater several hundred percent of excess ne in our samples additionally according to the groundwater isotopes analysis carried out by wang et al 2021 d and 18o isotopes of weishan groundwater display no strongly depletion and local hydrogeologic condition indicates that groundwater recharge of wdf is driven largely by atmospheric precipitation thus we can rule out the possibility that glacial meltwater were added to the groundwater according to the calculation by warrier et al 2013 the maximum excesses of noble gases produced by an oxygen depletion od mechanism without the corresponding increase of co2 is only 26 6 the δne values of our samples from basalt aquifer 34 4 85 01 are much higher than 26 6 therefore the contribution of od mechanism if any to the ne excess of our water samples will be minor or even negligible to further investigate the possibility of other external factors we evaluate the enrichment or depletion degree of noble gases relative to air composition by introducing the factor f i wen et al 2018 which can be used to evaluate whether boiling or condensation signal occurs in the origin reservoir of the samples f i is calculated by normalizing the volume fractions of measured noble gas isotope i to the corresponding noble gas isotope value in air while 36ar is taken as the reference isotope i e f i i 36ar measured i 36ar air fig 4 a and 4b respectively illustrate the measured r ra values compared to f 20ne and f 130xe values most of the samples show deviations to different degrees from the asw values fig 4 which can be explained by mixing the asw with other end members including atmospheric air mantle crustal and boiling vapor phase of atmospheric noble gases in both fig 4a and 4b samples 5 and 9 show an offset towards air end member indicating the addition of air or fractionated vapor phase originated from pure asw without crustal or mantle components in fig 4a samples 13 and 14 indicate the mixing between asw and aswc asw with the addition of crustal helium while in fig 4b a slight contribution of vapor phase fractionation is observed in samples 13 and 14 the rest samples display a mixing trend between asw and aswm asw adding mantle helium and both in fig 4a and 4b trends of vapor phase fractionation occur these mixing trends consolidate the hypothesis that the element fractionation among heavy and light noble gases observed in shallow groundwater as well as springs in weishan area is a result of mixing with vapor phase which is the product of vapor liquid separation caused by potential boiling events under weishan although there is no near surface geothermal abnormality displayed near weishan area recent geophysical results which display low velocity anomaly see a a and b b cross sections of shear wave velocity from li et al 2016 and low resistivity body see all four cross sections of resistivity from gao et al 2020 at the depth of 10 km in the crust of weishan that are interpreted as a potential magma chamber reinforce our speculation of modern underground boiling events under weishan after ruling out all the possible external factors described in section 5 1 except for boiling events we argue that the atmospheric ne excesses observed in weishan area are ang remnants released from the boiling of the deep fluids to the shallow layer 5 2 noble gas pattern as implication for thermal event under weishan volcano noble gas signals of vapor phase from vapor liquid fractionation have been reported in several hydrothermal systems such as the los azufres geothermal field in mexico wen et al 2018 and the icelandic geothermal system byrne et al 2021 noble gas signals in residual liquid phases have also been reported such as brines that show noble gas depletion in deep aquifer of the michigan basin ma et al 2009 in order to further evaluate the likelihood of the underground boiling events and the temperature at which the boiling occurred and vapor phase be separated we adopted a boiling model established on henry s law to reconstruct the abundances of vapor phase noble gases for different temperatures and compared them with our data for interpretation 5 2 1 the boiling model according to henry s law mazor and truesdell 1984 established the boiling model to describe the fractionation degree of noble gases between vapor and liquid phases when a boiling event occurs a mass balance can be used to describe the fractionation of a noble gas from initial asw into vapor phase and residual liquid phase 3 c asw x v c v 1 x v c l where casw cv and cl are the noble gas abundances e g 20ne 36ar 130xe dissolved in the initial asw vapor phase steam and residual liquid respectively xv and 1 xv represent the fractions of vapor phase and residual liquid phase after boiling occurs respectively a is the fractionation coefficient of noble gases between liquid phase and vapor phase can be calculated by 4 a c v c l by substituting eq 4 into eq 3 a formula can be derived to calculate the noble gas abundance in vapor phase as a function of xv and a 5 c v a c asw a 1 x v 1 the coefficient a is temperature dependent and can be calculated for each noble gas at a given temperature wagner and pruss 1993 harvey 1996 ozima and podosek 2002 fernández prini et al 2003 byrne et al 2021 the calculating methods and needed parameters are outlined in supplemental text 5 2 2 noble gas abundances indicate boiling events when evaluating the noble gas differentiation the highest atmosphere derived isotope abundance for each element is usually considered 20ne 36ar 84kr 130xe and132xe can be used when fissiogenic xe is negligible byrne et al 2021 using eq 5 we can calculate the maximum fractionation of vapor phase which occurs at the initial partitioning xv 0 fig 5 illustrates the maximum fractionation vapor phase line that fractionated from the initial asw phase in a certain temperature range and except for samples 5 and 9 that offset towards air end member noble gas abundances of our samples are close to the vapor phase fractional line showing that 20ne 36ar 84kr 130xe abundances are in good correlation with boiling temperature which consolidates our speculation that external factors influence noble gas pattern in weishan area and the external factor for our samples refer to the addition of vapor phase caused by boiling events it should be noted that as shown in fig 5 mixing with asw will move data points toward the asw end member resulting in overestimated temperature records in addition continuous fractionation will also reduce the abundance of noble gases leading to data points moving downwards along the vapor phase line which will also lead to overestimated temperature records the temperature range in fig 5 where our samples are located is not the real boiling temperature range which requires other analytical methods to discern the influence of asw and continuous fractionation and we will take these factors into account when discussing about the boiling temperature range in section 5 2 3 when there is a certain concentration gradient of noble gases in underground water molecular diffusion is a mechanism that cannot be ignored which can lead to the abundance differentiation among heavy and light elements of noble gases molecular diffusion transport is generally thought to result in mass dependent differentiation of ne and ar isotopes inversely proportional to the square root relationship of their atomic mass ratios tyroller et al 2014 whereas fractionation of kr and xe isotopes has not been observed in the molecular diffusion experiments carried out by tyroller et al 2018 since the molecular diffusion coefficient of noble gases decreases with the increase of atomic mass the diffusion rate of light noble gases he ne ar is much faster than that of weight noble gases kr xe and both elements and isotopes of light noble gases will be fractionated when diffusion occurs if diffusion is a non negligible factor that influences the fractionation among light and heavy noble gases of our samples then isotope fractionations of ne and ar should also be observed however isotope ratios of ne and ar in our samples are very close to asw values without significant isotopic fractionation thus diffusive influx can be excluded as a controlling factor for noble gas pattern of weishan and the separated vapor after boiling should be carried into shallow aquifers by deep circulation groundwater without significant diffusion occurs 5 2 3 estimated temperature range at which boiling occurs in a high enthalpy hydrothermal system with well researched geological conditions the required depth and temperature for the initial boiling to occur can be estimated through introducing a boiling point curve ma et al 2009 when the condition ofsubsurface geothermal water encounters the boiling point curve boiling event will occur as well as phase separation in fact the establishment of a boiling point curve is a complicated function that needs a multitude of factors including geothermal gradient ground stress condition and the content of dissolved gas in the fluids however the confirmations for every factor need more detailed information and fieldwork to support which is beyond the scope of this research and we will only discuss the temperature range where the boiling might occur according to the analysis in section 5 2 2 the concentrations of ne ar kr and xe are mainly controlled by temperature dependent vapor liquid fractionation we can analyze the temperature range when vapor liquid separation occurs according to the diagram based on the boiling model fig 6 the maximum fractionation of this complementary vapor phase is plotted as a solid red line in fig 6 representing the maximum fractionation over a certain temperature range taking the values of xv from 0 to 1 we can get continuous fractionation lines to show the selected annotation temperature dashed lines in fig 6 according to eq 5 air addition during sampling or during degassing the samples in the laboratory will increase the ang abundances and results in an underestimation of the estimated boiling temperature samples 5 and 9 that from basalt aquifer display significantly offsets toward the air end member fig 6 such air influence also can be recognized in fig 3b fig 4 and fig 5 while the remaining samples are subject to negligible air influence samples 3 12a and 12b are located to the right of the maximum vapor phase fractionation line showing relative enrichment of 84kr to 36ar which may indicate the admixture of sedimentary kr released by organic matter e g shale high 84kr 36ar ratios have also been previously reported in brine samples from deep aquifer of the michigan basin ma et al 2009 as well as in hydrocarbon related samples from san juan basin zhou et al 2005 and those high 84kr 36ar ratios have been interpreted as organic kr release from local sedimentary matter the fractionation between heavy and light isotopes is regionally systematic while kr enrichment is only shown in three samples in this case it can be speculated that the organic noble gases which show kr enrichment are not likely to be added into the deep circulating asw before the boiling event occurs otherwise our samples should display an overall 84kr enrichment accompanying the systematic mass dependent fractionation as we can recognize in fig 6 except for samples 5 and 9 that are located above the maximum vapor phase fractionation line and samples 3 12a and 12b that are located to the right of the maximum vapor phase fractionation line most of the plotted data are located within the continuous fractionation lines controlled by the temperatures vary from 100 c to 300 c the samples show convergence towards asw end member which may indicate a high degree of fractionation or and mixing with shallow asw the mixing line between the asw and the maximum fractionation point should be a straight line connecting two points which hold no significant difference from the continuous fractionation line so for visual purposes the mixing lines are not drawn in fig 6 due to the poor constraints at the deep conditions of weishan area we cannot distinguish these two possible reasons that can result in the convergence towards asw end member however they both indicate the occurrence of boiling events and they hold no significant difference under the accuracy requirements for evaluating temperature range of boiling if the noble gas pattern in our samples is controlled by vapor liquid fractionation we should expect to find samples in deeper reservoirs that can record the residual complementary liquid phase for the vapor phase signals displayed in this study and those potential samples will locate between asw and the maximum fractionation liquid phase line in fig 6 the sampling for the deeper reservoir of weishan area will be carried out soon the noble gas pattern in weishan area is caused by vapor liquid separation due to boiling and the separated vapor phase has undergone no obvious diffusion in the process of upward migration to shallow aquifers we speculated that the upward migration of gas is dominated by groundwater circulation controlled by faults based on the above speculations we draw a schematic plot to show the formation mechanism of the noble gas pattern of our samples see fig 7 the boiling events seem to be continuously happening in the time scale confined by the time limit provided by young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer according to our results fig 4 high 3he 4he magma gases only affect two wells i e where we collected samples 4a 4b 11a and 11b however the mass related trends about element abundances of heavy noble gases ne ar kr and xe can be recognized in all of our samples fig 2 this decoupling behavior between he and other noble gases indicates a different mechanism other than magmatic gases and further discussions indicate the influence of separated vapor phase after asw boiling the isotopic compositions of volcanic noble gases are often indistinguishable from that of the atmosphere that is because when volcanic gas enters the local circulation system it is usually saturated with atmospheric noble gases that could overwhelm the mantle component except for he which is so strongly depleted in the atmosphere as kaneoka 1980 pointed out when fractionation occurs the maximum enrichment of the 3he 4he ratio by a single mass fractionation process is not higher than 16 hence it is difficult to explain the high 3he 4he ratios displayed in our samples by a single mass fractionation of atmospheric he since samples 3 4a 4b 8 11a and 11b display 20 more enrichment of the 3he 4he ratio than air value table s1 supplementary materials meanwhile the atmospheric characteristic of ne and ar isotopes seems not to support the occurrence of diffusion processes like diffusion and rayleigh distillation cannot explain the high 3he 4he ratio in the sample so it is suggested that the high 3he 4he ratios in our samples are due to inherited mantle end member characteristics different from the overall characteristic of atmospheric ne excess and noble gas element fractionation in each sample the non atmospheric 3he 4he values only appear in a few individual samples indicating that the additions of the crustal or mantle components have not mixed into the deep circulation groundwater before the vapor liquid phase fractionation occurs fig 7 based on the published data we can acquire now it s hard to distinguish the source of these mantle components which might be from the potential magma chamber in the shallow crust under weishan and or from deeper reservoir 6 conclusions the isotopic compositions of he in our samples show the addition of crust derived and mantle derived he while the ne xe isotope ratios only indicate atmospheric sources the noble gas pattern displays a general mass dependent trend that lighter noble gases are more abundant than heavier noble gases and also show atmospheric ne excesses relative to asw under local modern recharge conditions we have adopted the ce model to process the measured noble gas data and the results indicate that the excess ang in our samples is not caused by the increase of hydrostatic pressure meanwhile the diffusive influx is also excluded as one external factor through further discussion we confirmed that there is no admixture of glacial meltwater and oxygen depletion alone cannot generate enough noble gas excess according to the boiling model based on henry s law we reconstruct the noble gas abundances in vapor phase of different boiling temperatures which indicates that the abundances of angs in our samples are influenced by fractionated vapor phase that can be the outcome of subsurface boiling events the results of 84kr 36ar vs 20ne 36ar and 130xe 36ar indicate that most of our data are located in the noble gas fractionation line from 100 c to 300 c and the samples showed convergence towards the asw end member which can be interpreted as a high degree of fractionation or and mixing with shallow asw the young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer provides the time limit when the boiling events seem to be continuously happening these findings strengthen the geophysical imaging results that there are potential magma chambers in the shallow crust of weishan which are not in equilibrium with the temperature of the surrounding rock these incomplete cooling hot magmas will heat up deep circling asw and when the condition of hot fluids encounters the boiling point curve boiling events will occur generating the vapor phase that is responsible for the abnormal ang signals in shallow groundwater of weishan we suggest that noble gases dissolved in shallow aquifers
