14305,the study aims at evaluating the robustness of sulfidogenic anaerobic membrane bioreactor for the treatment of synthetic acid mine drainage ph 4 0 containing fe cu zn co mn ni and as the performance of the anaerobic membrane bioreactor was evaluated at varying fluxes 3 6 8 25 l m2 h 1 hydraulic retention times 1 3 2 days gas scouring rates 1 67 7 8 m3 gas m2 h 1 and heavy metal concentrations anaerobic membrane bioreactor was operated at sulfate and chemical oxygen demand concentrations of 2000 mg l 1 and 1500 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to chemical oxygen demand sulfate ratio of 0 75 ethanol was externally supplemented as carbon and energy sources for sulfate reducing bacteria the performance improved with doubling metal concentrations in the feed as both sulfate reduction and chemical oxygen demand oxidation performances reached 95 electron flow from ethanol oxidation to sulfate reduction averaged 90 alkalinity generated from sulfate reduction increased the feed ph from 4 0 to neutral values throughout the study over 99 removals were observed for fe cu zn co and ni whereas partial removals of mn 76 91 and as 41 67 were observed keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor acid mine drainage arsenic removal sulfate reduction 1 introduction heavy metals are considered as toxic and or carcinogenic and tend to accumulate in organisms and cause reduction in species diversity the source of heavy metals may be anthropogenic or natural sewage and industrial wastewater especially mining tanneries and electroplating activities are among the main anthropogenic sources 1 the interaction of air and water with metal sulfides in overburden and disused mine shafts creates acid mine drainage amd 1 as an example arsenopyrite oxidation with oxygen and ferric iron reactions 1 and 2 release arsenic iron and sulfate accommodating with increasing acidity 2 r1 2 feass 7 o2 2 h2o 2 fe3 2 so4 2 2 h2aso4 r2 feass 13 fe3 8 h2o 14 fe2 so4 2 13 h h3aso4 other sulfide minerals are also oxidized in a similar way releasing metals cu fe zn al pb as cd and sulfuric acid to water body the presence of iron oxidizing bacteria such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans accelerates the arsenopyrite oxidation rate and increases arsenic release as concentration in the amd shows great variation depending on the conditions which may range between 100 μg l 1 and 5000 μg l 1 although quite high levels of arsenic concentrations have been observed in some amds such as 72 mg l 1 at zimbabwe duke mining area 3 sulfidogenic treatment of amd seems to have several advantages over other alternatives such as low solubility products of metal sulfide compounds less and compact sludge generation decreasing or eliminating alkali addition and increasing metal recovery potential 4 in this process sulfate present at a high concentration in amd is biologically reduced by sulfate reducing bacteria srb with the externally supplemented organic compounds which generates hydrogen sulfide and alkalinity reaction 3 r3 2 ch2o so4 2 h2s 2 hco3 where ch2o represents organic matter the generated hydrogen sulfide precipitates dissolved metals as illustrated in reaction 4 r4 h2s m2 ms s 2h where m2 denotes metal such as zn2 cu2 ni2 co2 or fe2 in the sulfidogenic treatment of amd generally attached growth reactors have been used due to long solid retention time srt requirement of relatively slow growing srb in recent years anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr are gaining interest for both municipal 5 and industrial wastewater treatment 6 and remarkable progress has been achieved in the past two decades especially in mitigating membrane fouling 7 the high process performance of anmbr for methane generation have been illustrated in several studies however their performance for sulfate reduction has been tested only in few studies 6 8 9 in the study of yurtsever et al 6 treatment of synthetic textile wastewater was studied in a sulfate reducing mbr they reported high color and cod removals together with high sulfate reduction efficiency however stable operation was achieved at relatively low flux of 5 l m 2 h 1 lmh due to high cake layer resistance which may limit the full scale application of the process vallero et al 9 investigated sulfate reduction in salt rich wastewater conductivity 60 70 ms cm 1 using a submerged anaerobic mbr inoculated with a halotolerant bacterium desulfobacter halotolerans in our previous study 8 sulfate reduction performance in a submerged anmbr was investigated using synthetic wastewater containing 2000 mg l 1 sulfate and ethanol with cod equivalent of 1500 mg l 1 over 90 sulfate reduction and cod oxidation were obtained in the anmbr however similar to the previous study 6 the observed flux 4lmh was relatively low due to thick cake layer on the membrane although some studies have been conducted on sulfate reducing anmbr sulfidogenic treatment of amd i e acidic sulfate and metal containing wastewater has received little or no attention however using anmbr may improve the sulfidogenic treatment of amd due to keeping slow growing biomass especially acetate oxidizing srb in the bioreactor and potential of rejecting fine non precipitating metal sulfide particles therefore this study aims at evaluating sulfidogenic anmbr performance for the treatment of amd containing fe cu zn co mn ni and as 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfate reducing anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr the anmbr used in the study was made of plexiglass with the dimensions lxwxh of 12 15 37 cm corresponding to a total volume of 6 6 l and an active volume of 4 l 8 flat sheet polyethersulfone pes ultrafiltration membrane 0 02 μm pore size was mounted in double sided handmade modules each membrane module had a total active membrane area of 0 01 m2 and the number of modules was adjusted to attain the targeted flux an intermittent filtration 5 min on and 1 min off cycle was performed to control the cake layer thickness on the membrane headspace gas was circulated on the membrane with varying velocities table 2 using a gas pump to scour the excess cake on the membrane and to provide mixing the reactor was equipped with level sensors ph probe and oxidation reduction potential orp sensors and sample ports the reactor was operated under sulfate reducing conditions in the absence of metal for around 166 days 8 hence srb was already enriched and desulfovibrio like sulfate reducing bacteria was detected in the bioreactor sludge 8 the reactor was operated at 35 2 c in a temperature controlled room 2 2 synthetic amd composition the reactor was fed with a synthetic amd based on our previous study conducted with a real amd obtained from an active mine site located in turkey 10 the anmbr had been previously operated at cod sulfate ratio of 0 75 and over 90 cod oxidation and sulfate reduction performances were obtained in the absence of metals 8 hence in the present study ethanol was supplemented as a carbon and energy source for srb the selected cod sulfate ratio 0 75 was slightly higher than the theoretical requirement 0 67 mg mg 1 due to additional organic substrate utilization for biomass growth 8 throughout the 290 days of the reactor operation influent sulfate and cod concentrations were kept constant at 2000 and 1500 mg l 1 respectively the reactor was also supplemented with kh2po4 and nh4cl as phosphorus and nitrogen sources table 1 the reactor operation may be divided into two different periods depending on metal concentrations in the synthetic amd table 1 in the first period of the operation the anmbr was fed with relatively low metal concentrations to acclimate the srb then in the second period metal concentrations were doubled the reactor was operated for long periods of time both in the first 180 days and the second periods 110 days to see the performance of the amd treating anmbr in long term operation 2 3 anmbr operation the reactor was operated in the absence of metal and neutral ph values for 166 days and the results were presented previously 8 in the present study the reactor was operated for around 290 days with the synthetic amd the operational conditions of the anmbr are illustrated in table 2 the operation of the anmbr was divided in two main periods i e period 1 followed by period 2 where the metal concentrations were doubled as explained in 2 2 each period was consisted of sub periods depending mainly on applied fluxes and hrts fig 1 the first period consisted of four sub periods in which srt and the influent ph were kept constant at infinite and 4 0 respectively in the first sub period 1 1 hrt and flux were 2 0 2 d and 3 6 0 7 l m2 h 1 lmh respectively hrt in this period was kept relatively longer to acclimate the srb to metal feeding similarly flux was kept relatively low to see the impact of metal presence on the filtration performance in the following sub periods hrt was kept around at 1 4 1 6 d in the second 1 2 and third 1 3 sub periods fluxes were increased steadily to investigate the impacts of metal presence on the filtration performance in the last sub period flux was decreased to 6 0 lmh to have stable filtration performance in the first 1 1 and the second 1 2 sub periods gas scouring rate gsr was 1 67 m3 m2 h 1 in the sub period 1 3 the impact of gsr on the filtration performance was investigated by increasing the rate from 1 67 m3 m2 h 1 to 3 m3 m2 h 1 under the same operating conditions in the last sub period 1 4 flux was kept constant at 6 lmh and the impact of gsrs were further evaluated by increasing the rate from 3 m3 m2 h 1 up to 7 8 m3 m2 h 1 in the second period the metal concentrations in the feed were increased to twice of their initial values experimented in the first period hrt flux and the influent ph were kept constant whereas srt and gsr were changed table 2 in the first sub period 2 1 the gsr was kept relatively higher compared to the first period to completely mix the reactor as increasing feed metal concentration led to the accumulation of metal precipitates in the bioreactor between days 166 and 362 around 200 days all the metal precipitates remained and accumulated in the bioreactor by this way the impacts of metal sulfide precipitate accumulation both on removal and filtration performances were evaluated in the second sub period the srt was changed from infinite to 95 days to remove the metal precipitates from the bioreactor as in the real scale applications metal precipitates should be removed from the bioreactor to have steady continuous operation and to recover metals from the precipitate in the sub period 2 2 the gsr was decreased to 6 3 m3 m2 h 1 considering decreased metal precipitates in the bioreactor in order to evaluate the performance of the anmbr cod sulfate sulfide metals ph and alkalinity were measured in the feed supernatant and permeate the variations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile mlss mlvss were measured in the bioreactor regularly also ph oxidation reduction potential and transmembrane pressure tmp were measured online throughout the study 2 4 cleaning of the fouled membranes the operation of the anmbr was stopped once the tmp reached around 0 4 0 5 bar then membrane was physically cleaned under tap water using a soft sponge to improve the chemical cleaning efficiency then physically cleaned membranes were soaked successively in naocl 1000 mg l 1 and sulfuric acid ph 2 solutions for 1 h 6 2 5 analytical methods liquid samples were filtered through cellulose acetate syringe filters with pore size of 0 45 μm before the measurements of cod sulfate and sulfide prior to cod measurement ph was decreased below 2 0 using concentrated h2so4 and sample was purged with n2 gas for 5 min to remove h2s from the sample then cod was measured using the closed reflux method provided in the standard methods 11 a turbidimetric method using bacl2 11 was used for sulfate measurements sulfide was measured using a spectrometric method provided previously 8 mlss and mlvss concentrations were also measured following the procedures in standard methods 11 alkalinity concentration was measured in the unfiltered liquid samples using 0 1 n hcl as titrant until the endpoint of ph 4 5 the metal removal performance in the anmbr was determined by measuring total fe cu co zn mn ni and as concentrations in the feed supernatant and permeate with perkin elmer optima 7000 icp oes optical emission spectrophotometry after filtration through 0 45 μm pore sized syringe filter the detection limit for the metals was 0 05 mg l 1 2 6 measurement of sludge filterability tmp data were used for the calculation of filtration resistance 12 according to eq 1 1 r t m p μ j where j is the flux as m3 m2 s 1 tmp is the trans membrane pressure as pa μ is the permeate viscosity as pa s and r is the membrane filtration resistance as m 1 total hydraulic resistance during filtration was calculated according to resistance in series model 12 2 r t r m r r r f where rt is the total membrane filtration resistance rm is the intrinsic membrane resistance rr is the reversible fouling resistance that can be removed by relaxation and rf is the fouling resistance which can be divided into irreversible rirv and irrecoverable rirc fouling resistances irreversible fouling rirv can be removed by chemical cleaning whereas irrecoverable fouling rirc cannot be removed by physical or chemical cleaning eq 3 3 r f r i r v r i r c 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate reduction efficiency the variations of sulfate concentrations throughout the reactor operation are presented in fig 2 the influent sulfate concentration was kept around 2000 mg l 1 and the permeate sulfate concentrations oscillated depending on the operational conditions in the first operational period period 1 1 the effluent sulfate concentration averaged 549 268 mg l 1 corresponding to 73 sulfate reduction which was relatively higher compared to the later periods the anmbr was previously fed with synthetic wastewater in the absence of metals and then with metal containing synthetic amd in the period 1 1 although the reactor was suddenly fed with acidic wastewater containing various type of heavy metals and srb had no time for acclimation the reactor performed well and no deterioration in the performance was observed in the period 1 3 relatively higher oscillations in the permeate sulfate concentrations 417 489 mg l 1 were observed which was due to frequent opening of the reactor cover to clean the membrane due to relatively higher flux applied table 2 and facing with more frequent membrane fouling permeate sulfate concentration throughout period 1 averaged 439 283 mg l 1 corresponding to 78 sulfate reduction efficiency in the second period where the metal concentrations in the feed were doubled table 2 the process performance was not affected and a rather higher sulfate reduction performance was observed as the permeate sulfate concentration averaged 119 137 mg l 1 corresponding to 94 sulfate reduction efficiency there may be three possible reasons for observing higher sulfate reduction efficiency with increasing influent metal concentrations the first one is lesser frequency of opening reactor cover to clean the membrane in the second period which exposed srb to oxygen and increasing orp from around 450 mv to 300 mv in period 1 3 the flux was relatively higher compared to the other periods table 2 and frequent membrane cleaning was required which resulted in relatively higher and oscillating sulfate concentrations in the permeate fig 2 as will be explained later in the second period the filterability of sludge increased significantly and the frequency of chemical membrane cleaning decreased accordingly the second possible reason was the increased metal availability for srb when heavy metals some of which may be necessary to srb were doubled in the second period the third possible reason was the acclimation and enrichment of srb in the anmbr due to long term of operation in our previous study 8 sulfate reduction increased up to 95 in anmbr fed with sulfate containing but metal deficient synthetic wastewater in another study 6 treatment of sulfate containing synthetic textile dye wastewater treatment was studied in an anmbr sulfate reduction performance was studied under varying cod sulfate ratios interestingly the sulfate reduction performance was quite low 55 when the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater with cod sulfate ration of 0 67 i e sulfate and cod concentrations of 1500 and 1000 mg l 1 respectively when the ratio was increased to 1 0 sulfate reduction performance improved and a further increase to 2 0 increased sulfate reduction performance up to 95 in the present study quite high 94 sulfate reduction performance was observed even when the reactor was fed with acidic and metal containing amd at relatively low cod sulfate ration of 0 75 3 2 cod oxidation efficiency srb have the ability to utilize several low molecular weight organic matters i e lactate formate acetate and ethanol some srb can oxidize organics completely to co2 while the others incompletely to acetate high or shock loadings may also cause increase of acetate concentration in the sulfidogenic bioreactors 1 13 under sulfate reducing conditions ethanol is first converted to acetate and the oxidation of acetate may occur if acetate oxidizing srb is present in the sludge in the treatment of acidic sulfate containing waters without external alkalinity addition acetate oxidation is necessary to generate alkalinity according to reactions 5 and 6 8 as mentioned above high loads or toxic conditions may lead to acetate accumulation as its oxidation is the rate limiting step 13 in the case of ethanol supplementation the use of mbr may be advantageous due to complete retention of slow growing microorganisms i e acetate oxidizing sulfate reducers in the bioreactor r5 2ch3ch2oh so4 2 2ch3coo hs h 2h2o r6 ch3coo so4 2 2hco3 hs the variations of cod concentration throughout the study are illustrated in fig 2 the influent cod concentration was kept constant at 1500 mg l 1 corresponding to cod sulfate ratio of 0 75 throughout the periods 1 and 2 the permeate cod concentration averaged 180 144 mg l 1 and 75 68 mg l 1 corresponding to 88 and 95 cod oxidation efficiency respectively hence similar to the sulfate reduction performance cod oxidation efficiency was not adversely affected by doubling the metal concentrations in the feed the supernatant cod concentrations in the periods 1 and 2 were 240 128 and 153 79 mg l 1 respectively hence around 25 and 50 cod reductions were observed during the filtration throughout the reactor operation supernatant and permeate cod averaged 200 115 mg l 1 and 147 114 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to around 27 reduction during the membrane filtration although the supernatant was also filtered before cod measurement the observed high differences should be due to the activity of srb present in the rather thick cake layer developed on the membrane 14 15 the ratio of electron flow from complete ethanol oxidation to sulfate reduction can be calculated using the following equation 8 4 electron flow 100 0 67 s o 4 o s o 4 e co d o co d e where so4 o and so4 e are influent and effluent sulfate concentrations and codo and code are influent and effluent cod concentrations respectively electron flow to sulfate reduction in the periods 1 and 2 averaged 86 5 10 and 95 5 10 respectively fig s1 supplementary material throughout the study the average value was 90 2 11 which shows that most of the electrons generated from cod oxidation was used for sulfate reduction and only 10 was used for other purposes such as biomass growth similarly in our previous study conducted with sulfidogenic anmbr fed with metal deficient feed around 91 of the electrons generated from cod oxidation were used for sulfate reduction kaksonen et al 13 reported that electron flow to sulfate reduction was between 77 95 in a sulfate reducing fluidized bed reactor fbr in a uasb reactor receiving synthetic amd the highest value observed was 84 hence relatively higher fractions of cod were used for sulfate reduction in the anmbr compared to conventional attached growth bioreactors used for sulfate reduction 3 3 sulfide and alkalinity generation in the anmbr sulfate reduction accompanying cod oxidation generates sulfide as given in reactions 3 5 and 6 sulfide concentration throughout the periods 1 and 2 averaged 418 138 mg l 1 and 558 107 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 as discussed above in the second period both sulfate reduction and the cod oxidation efficiencies were higher compared to the first one and expectedly higher sulfide concentration was observed considering the influent and permeate sulfate concentrations together with the sulfide requirement for metal precipitation based on reaction 4 the theoretical sulfide concentration for the first and the second stage were calculated as 503 mg l 1 and 581 mg l 1 respectively the measured permeate sulfide concentrations in the first and the second stage around 83 and 96 respectively of the theoretical ones in the first stage around 17 gap should be due to evaporation and or chemical oxidation of sulfide due to frequent opening of the reactor cover to clean the membrane chemical oxidation during the opening of the reactor cover may be a higher possibility as white to yellowish precipitates were observed on top of the reactor data not shown especially during the operation of period 1 3 the influent ph was kept constant at around 4 except for the few days when technical problems occurred although external alkalinity was not added to the reactor the permeate ph in the periods 1 and 2 averaged 7 43 0 26 and 7 36 0 19 respectively fig 3 similarly permeate average alkalinity concentrations were 1636 315 mg l 1 caco3 and 1800 255 mg l 1 caco3 in the periods 1 and 2 respectively sulfate reduction generates alkalinity as presented in reaction 3 during the metal precipitation with sulfide acidity is generated according to reaction 4 hence a part of alkalinity generated during the sulfate reduction was also consumed due to sulfidogenic metal precipitation considering the influent and permeate sulfate concentrations and the metal concentrations in the feed the theoretical alkalinity concentrations for the first and the second periods were calculated as 1523 mg l 1 caco3 and 1762 mg l 1 caco3 respectively the calculated values were a little less than the measured 1636 315 mg l 1 caco3 and 1800 255 mg l 1 caco3 respectively ones one possible explanation is the presence of volatile fatty acids in the permeate which can be titrated between phs 5 and 4 3 during alkalinity measurement 3 4 metal and metalloid removal performance of the anmbr as illustrated in the reaction 4 the generated sulfide precipitates the metals as metal sulfides the solubility products of fe cu zn ni and co sulfides were much lower than their hydroxide forms 10 hence except mn and as 99 removal efficiencies were obtained table 3 and fig s2 doubling the metal concentrations in the period 2 did not adversely affect the performance increasing influent mn concentration did not cause increase of permeate mn concentration and the removal efficiencies were around 76 and 91 in periods 1 and 2 respectively as removal efficiency was relatively lower compared to other metals and the permeate concentrations in periods 1 and 2 averaged 0 73 0 20 mg l 1 41 removal and 0 82 0 27 mg l 1 67 removal respectively fig s3 as2s3 precipitate occurs in the presence of sulfide 16 on the other hand as2s3 dissolves at high ph and sulfide concentrations as illustrated in reaction 7 2 17 18 hence as removal at high sulfide concentrations may not be expected as its stability is very sensitive to sulfide concentrations 17 18 and depending on the ph soluble species of h2as3s6 and or has3s6 2 may be formed at high sulfide concentrations 19 r7 3 2 as2s3 amorphous 3 2 h2s h2as3s6 h hence further studies to optimize the as precipitation in sulfidogenic anmbr is required in our previous studies with fixed bed bioreactor 2 and uasb 19 similar results were observed in the study of altun et al 2 arsenic removal efficiency was only 8 in the absence of iron and at high sulfide concentration in the bioreactor supplementing the influent with 100 and 200 mg l 1 fe2 increased arsenic removal efficiency to 63 and 85 respectively decreasing the sulfide concentration to around 46 mg l 1 by halving feed cod improved the performance to 96 due to decreasing as dissolution reaction 7 3 5 the variations of mlss mlvss concentrations and the filtration performance mlvss concentrations did not show significant variations and averaged 5 42 1 0 g l 1 and 5 13 1 2 g l in the periods 1 and 2 respectively fig 4 mlss concentration in the bioreactor increased due to accumulation of precipitated metals which decreased the mlvss mlss ratio fig 4 especially in the second period the accumulation of metal precipitates in the bioreactor may cause some operational problems in the long term operation hence periodical sludge removal from the bioreactor and adding active anaerobic sludge even from an anaerobic sludge digester would keep the mlvss mlss ratio considerably high also metal recovery from the sludge removed from the bioreactor would be economically favorable up to day 200 tmp and the resistance values were quite high indicating relatively low filterability of the sludge fig 5 during the operation as the metals accumulated in the bioreactor the resistances decreased significantly although during the period 1 3 the tmp values showed frequent increase and almost weekly chemical cleaning was required the flux was quite high 8 25 0 4 lmh in the second period metal concentrations were doubled and the flux was decreased to 5 6 0 1 lmh which resulted in significant decrease in the tmps and the resistances fig 5 throughout the second period chemical cleaning was required only once and the tmp values generally remained 0 1 bar the total resistance in the second period was almost 4 5 times lower compared to the first stage together with the results obtained in the previous study 8 which was conducted in the absence of heavy metal it may be concluded that metal addition improved the sludge filterability due to coagulation behavior of the metal sulfides especially iron sulfide metal addition can mitigate the membrane fouling due to removal of colloidal particles from the mixed liquor 20 21 koseoglu et al 20 reported that the fecl3 removed soluble microbial products smps effectively and increased the filtration performance of an mbr similarly zhang et al 21 reported that fecl3 addition may remove small flocks and smps with molecular weight 10 kda due to charge neutralization hence in our study the presence of heavy metals especially fe in the wastewater may behaved as filtration aid and improved the filterability significantly the metal precipitates may also increase the floc size and improve the porosity of cake layer accumulated on the membrane surface koseoglu et al 20 reported that addition of coagulants to mbr increased the floc size in the absence of additive the mean particle size of the sludge was 38 9 μm and it increased to 206 μm with the addition of chitosan also the fraction of small particles in the sludge decreased appreciably with the addition of chitosan particles 1 μm was completely removed similarly addition of fecl3 increased the floc size from 38 9 μm to 43 7 μm also 50 60 smp removal was observed with the fecl3 addition similarly zhang et al 21 reported that ferric iron supplied positive charge for soluble macromolecules and enhanced charge neutralization hence the removal of small flocs together with smp in the presence of metal coagulants may improve the sludge filterability although frequent membrane cleaning was observed in the absence of metal at flux of 4 lmh 8 quite stable operation and only once chemical membrane cleaning was required even at 5 6 0 1 lmh in the presence of heavy metals fig 5 the filtration resistance was mainly due to thick cake layer developed on the membrane surface as its contribution to total filtration resistance was around 98 8 fig s4 the resistances of the fouled and the chemically cleaned membrane were 2 5 1013 m 1 and 2 0 1011 m 1 respectively hence chemical cleaning decreased the resistance by 99 2 4 conclusions performance of anmbr for amd treatment under sulfate reducing conditions was investigated quite high cod and sulfate removal efficiencies i e up to 95 were observed even at relatively low cod sulfate ratio of 0 75 electron flow from cod oxidation to sulfate reduction was over 90 which was higher compared to attached growth counterparts in the literature the cake layer developed on the membrane behaved as a secondary membrane as around 25 further cod removal was observed during the filtration over 99 fe cu zn co and ni were removed due to formation of metal sulfide precipitates arsenic removal was only 40 67 and optimizing its removal should be further studied interestingly addition and further increasing the metal concentrations improved the filtration performance possibly due to removal of colloidal organics by the metal precipitates relatively stable removal and filtration performances were observed throughout the study which showed that anmbr may be a potential process alternative for amd treatment acknowledgment this study was funded by the scientific and technological research

reported high color and cod removals together with high sulfate reduction efficiency however stable operation was achieved at relatively low flux of 5 l m 2 h 1 lmh due to high cake layer resistance

supplemented as a carbon and energy source for srb the selected cod sulfate ratio 0 75 was slightly higher than the theoretical requirement 0 67 mg mg 1 due to additional organic substrate utilization for biomass growth 8 throughout the 290 days of the reactor operation influent sulfate and cod concentrations were kept constant at 2000 and 1500 mg l 1 respectively the reactor was also supplemented with kh2po4 and nh4cl as phosphorus and nitrogen sources table 1 the reactor operation may be divided into two different periods depending on metal concentrations in the synthetic amd table 1 in the first period of the operation the anmbr was fed with relatively low metal concentrations to acclimate the srb then in the second period metal concentrations were doubled the reactor was operated for long periods of time both in the first 180 days and the second periods 110 days to see the performance of the amd treating anmbr in long term operation 2 3 anmbr operation the reactor was operated in the absence of metal and neutral ph values for 166 days and the results were presented previously 8 in the present study the reactor was operated for around 290 days with the synthetic amd the operational conditions of the anmbr are illustrated in table 2 the operation of the anmbr was divided in two main periods i e period 1 followed by period 2 where the metal concentrations were doubled as explained in 2 2 each period was consisted of sub periods depending mainly on applied fluxes and hrts fig 1 the first period consisted of four sub periods in which srt and the influent ph were kept constant at infinite and 4 0 respectively in the first sub period 1 1 hrt and flux were 2 0 2 d and 3 6 0 7 l m2 h 1 lmh respectively hrt in this period was kept relatively longer to acclimate the srb to metal feeding similarly flux was kept relatively low to see the impact of metal presence on the filtration performance in the following sub periods hrt was kept around at 1 4 1 6 d in the second 1 2 and third 1 3 sub periods fluxes were increased steadily to investigate the impacts of metal presence on the filtration performance in the last sub period flux was decreased to 6 0 lmh to have stable filtration performance in the first 1 1 and the second 1 2 sub periods gas scouring rate gsr was 1 67 m3 m2 h 1 in the sub period 1 3 the impact of gsr on the filtration performance was investigated by increasing the rate from 1 67 m3 m2 h 1 to 3 m3 m2 h 1 under the same operating conditions in the last sub period 1 4 flux was kept constant at 6 lmh and the impact of gsrs were further evaluated by increasing the rate from 3 m3 m2 h 1 up to 7 8 m3 m2 h 1 in the second period the metal concentrations in the feed were increased to twice of their initial values experimented in the first period hrt flux and the influent ph were kept constant whereas srt and gsr were changed table 2 in the first sub period 2 1 the gsr was kept relatively higher compared to the first period to completely mix the reactor as increasing feed metal concentration led to the accumulation of metal precipitates in the bioreactor between days 166 and 362 around 200 days all the metal precipitates remained and accumulated in the bioreactor by this way the impacts of metal sulfide precipitate accumulation both on removal and filtration performances were evaluated in the second sub period the srt was changed from infinite to 95 days to remove the metal precipitates from the bioreactor as in the real scale applications metal precipitates should be removed from the bioreactor to have steady continuous operation and to recover metals from the precipitate in the sub period 2 2 the gsr was decreased to 6 3 m3 m2 h 1 considering decreased metal precipitates in the bioreactor in order to evaluate the performance of the anmbr cod sulfate sulfide metals ph and alkalinity were measured in the feed supernatant and permeate the variations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile mlss mlvss were measured in the bioreactor regularly also ph oxidation reduction potential and transmembrane pressure tmp were measured online throughout the study 2 4 cleaning of the fouled membranes the operation of the anmbr was stopped once the tmp reached around 0 4 0 5 bar then membrane was physically cleaned under tap water using a soft sponge to improve the chemical cleaning efficiency then physically cleaned membranes were soaked successively in naocl 1000 mg l 1 and sulfuric acid ph 2 solutions for 1 h 6 2 5 analytical methods liquid samples were filtered through cellulose acetate syringe filters with pore size of 0 45 μm before the measurements of cod sulfate and sulfide prior to cod measurement ph was decreased below 2 0 using concentrated h2so4 and sample was purged with n2 gas for 5 min to remove h2s from the sample then cod was measured using the closed reflux method provided in the standard methods 11 a turbidimetric method using bacl2 11 was used for sulfate measurements sulfide was measured using a spectrometric method provided previously 8 mlss and mlvss concentrations were also measured following the procedures in standard methods 11 alkalinity concentration was measured in the unfiltered liquid samples using 0 1 n hcl as titrant until the endpoint of ph 4 5 the metal removal performance in the anmbr was determined by measuring total fe cu co zn mn ni and as concentrations in the feed supernatant and permeate with perkin elmer optima 7000 icp oes optical emission spectrophotometry after filtration through 0 45 μm pore sized syringe filter the detection limit for the metals was 0 05 mg l 1 2 6 measurement of sludge filterability tmp data were used for the calculation of filtration resistance 12 according to eq 1 1 r t m p μ j where j is the flux as m3 m2 s 1 tmp is the trans membrane pressure as pa μ is the permeate viscosity as pa s and r is the membrane filtration resistance as m 1 total hydraulic resistance during filtration was calculated according to resistance in series model 12 2 r t r m r r r f where rt is the total membrane filtration resistance rm is the intrinsic membrane resistance rr is the reversible fouling resistance that can be removed by relaxation and rf is the fouling resistance which can be divided into irreversible rirv and irrecoverable rirc fouling resistances irreversible fouling rirv can be removed by chemical cleaning whereas irrecoverable fouling rirc cannot be removed by physical or chemical cleaning eq 3 3 r f r i r v r i r c 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate reduction efficiency the variations of sulfate concentrations throughout the reactor operation are presented in fig 2 the influent sulfate concentration was kept around 2000 mg l 1 and the permeate sulfate concentrations oscillated depending on the operational conditions in the first operational period period 1 1 the effluent sulfate concentration averaged 549 268 mg l 1 corresponding to 73 sulfate reduction which was relatively higher compared to the later periods the anmbr was previously fed with synthetic wastewater in the absence of metals and then with metal containing synthetic amd in the period 1 1 although the reactor was suddenly fed with acidic wastewater containing various type of heavy metals and srb had no time for acclimation the reactor performed well and no deterioration in the performance was observed in the period 1 3 relatively higher oscillations in the permeate sulfate concentrations 417 489 mg l 1 were observed which was due to frequent opening of the reactor cover to clean the membrane due to relatively higher flux applied table 2 and facing with more frequent membrane fouling permeate sulfate concentration throughout period 1 averaged 439 283 mg l 1 corresponding to 78 sulfate reduction efficiency in the second period where the metal concentrations in the feed were doubled table 2 the process performance was not affected and a rather higher sulfate reduction performance was observed as the permeate sulfate concentration averaged 119 137 mg l 1 corresponding to 94 sulfate reduction efficiency there may be three possible reasons for observing higher sulfate reduction efficiency with increasing influent metal concentrations the first one is lesser frequency of opening reactor cover to clean the membrane in the second period which exposed srb to oxygen and increasing orp from around 450 mv to 300 mv in period 1 3 the flux was relatively higher compared to the other periods table 2 and frequent membrane cleaning was required which resulted in relatively higher and oscillating sulfate concentrations in the permeate fig 2 as will be explained later in the second period the filterability of sludge increased significantly and the frequency of chemical membrane cleaning decreased accordingly the second possible reason was the increased metal availability for srb when heavy metals some of which may be necessary to srb were doubled in the second period the third possible reason was the acclimation and enrichment of srb in the anmbr due to long term of operation in our previous study 8 sulfate reduction increased up to 95 in anmbr fed with sulfate containing but metal deficient synthetic wastewater in another study 6 treatment of sulfate containing synthetic textile dye wastewater treatment was studied in an anmbr sulfate reduction performance was studied under varying cod sulfate ratios interestingly the sulfate reduction performance was quite low 55 when the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater with cod sulfate ration of 0 67 i e sulfate and cod concentrations of 1500 and 1000 mg l 1 respectively when the ratio was increased to 1 0 sulfate reduction performance improved and a further increase to 2 0 increased sulfate reduction performance up to 95 in the present study quite high 94 sulfate reduction performance was observed even when the reactor was fed with acidic and metal containing amd at relatively low cod sulfate ration of 0 75 3 2 cod oxidation efficiency srb have the ability to utilize several low molecular weight organic matters i e lactate formate acetate and ethanol some srb can oxidize organics completely to co2 while the others incompletely to acetate high or shock loadings may also cause increase of acetate concentration in the sulfidogenic bioreactors 1 13 under sulfate reducing conditions ethanol is first converted to acetate and the oxidation of acetate may occur if acetate oxidizing srb is present in the sludge in the treatment of acidic sulfate containing waters without external alkalinity addition acetate oxidation is necessary to generate alkalinity according to reactions 5 and 6 8 as mentioned above high loads or toxic conditions may lead to acetate accumulation as its oxidation is the rate limiting step 13 in the case of ethanol supplementation the use of mbr may be advantageous due to complete retention of slow growing microorganisms i e acetate oxidizing sulfate reducers in the bioreactor r5 2ch3ch2oh so4 2 2ch3coo hs h 2h2o r6 ch3coo so4 2 2hco3 hs the variations of cod concentration throughout the study are illustrated in fig 2 the influent cod concentration was kept constant at 1500 mg l 1 corresponding to cod sulfate ratio of 0 75 throughout the periods 1 and 2 the permeate cod concentration averaged 180 144 mg l 1 and 75 68 mg l 1 corresponding to 88 and 95 cod oxidation efficiency respectively hence similar to the sulfate reduction performance cod oxidation efficiency was not adversely affected by doubling the metal concentrations in the feed the supernatant cod concentrations in the periods 1 and 2 were 240 128 and 153 79 mg l 1 respectively hence around 25 and 50 cod reductions were observed during the filtration throughout the reactor operation supernatant and permeate cod averaged 200 115 mg l 1 and 147 114 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to around 27 reduction during the membrane filtration although the supernatant was also filtered before cod measurement the observed high differences should be due to the activity of srb present in the rather thick cake layer developed on the membrane 14 15 the ratio of electron flow from complete ethanol oxidation to sulfate reduction can be calculated using the following equation 8 4 electron flow 100 0 67 s o 4 o s o 4 e co d o co d e where so4 o and so4 e are influent and effluent sulfate concentrations and codo and code are influent and effluent cod concentrations respectively electron flow to sulfate reduction in the periods 1 and 2 averaged 86 5 10 and 95 5 10 respectively fig s1 supplementary material throughout the study the average value was 90 2 11 which shows that most of the electrons generated from cod oxidation was used for sulfate reduction and only 10 was used for other purposes such as biomass growth similarly in our previous study conducted with sulfidogenic anmbr fed with metal deficient feed around 91 of the electrons generated from cod oxidation were used for sulfate reduction kaksonen et al 13 reported that electron flow to sulfate reduction was between 77 95 in a sulfate reducing fluidized bed reactor fbr in a uasb reactor receiving synthetic amd the highest value observed was 84 hence relatively higher fractions of cod were used for sulfate reduction in the anmbr compared to conventional attached growth bioreactors used for sulfate reduction 3 3 sulfide and alkalinity generation in the anmbr sulfate reduction accompanying cod oxidation generates sulfide as given in reactions 3 5 and 6 sulfide concentration throughout the periods 1 and 2 averaged 418 138 mg l 1 and 558 107 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 as discussed above in the second period both sulfate reduction and the cod oxidation efficiencies were higher compared to the first one and expectedly higher sulfide concentration was observed considering the influent and permeate sulfate concentrations together with the sulfide requirement for metal precipitation based on reaction 4 the theoretical sulfide concentration for the first and the second stage were calculated as 503 mg l 1 and 581 mg l 1 respectively the measured permeate sulfide concentrations in the first and the second stage around 83 and 96 respectively of the theoretical ones in the first stage around 17 gap should be due to evaporation and or chemical oxidation of sulfide due to frequent opening of the reactor cover to clean the membrane chemical oxidation during the opening of the reactor cover may be a higher possibility as white to yellowish precipitates were observed on top of the reactor data not shown especially during the operation of period 1 3 the influent ph was kept constant at around 4 except for the few days when technical problems occurred although external alkalinity was not added to the reactor the permeate ph in the periods 1 and 2 averaged 7 43 0 26 and 7 36 0 19 respectively fig 3 similarly permeate average alkalinity concentrations were 1636 315 mg l 1 caco3 and 1800 255 mg l 1 caco3 in the periods 1 and 2 respectively sulfate reduction generates alkalinity as presented in reaction 3 during the metal precipitation with sulfide acidity is generated according to reaction 4 hence a part of alkalinity generated during the sulfate reduction was also consumed due to sulfidogenic metal precipitation considering the influent and permeate sulfate concentrations and the metal concentrations in the feed the theoretical alkalinity concentrations for the first and the second periods were calculated as 1523 mg l 1 caco3 and 1762 mg l 1 caco3 respectively the calculated values were a little less than the measured 1636 315 mg l 1 caco3 and 1800 255 mg l 1 caco3 respectively ones one possible explanation is the presence of volatile fatty acids in the permeate which can be titrated between phs 5 and 4 3 during alkalinity measurement 3 4 metal and metalloid removal performance of the anmbr as illustrated in the reaction 4 the generated sulfide precipitates the metals as metal sulfides the solubility products of fe cu zn ni and co sulfides were much lower than their hydroxide forms 10 hence except mn and as 99 removal efficiencies were obtained table 3 and fig s2 doubling the metal concentrations in the period 2 did not adversely affect the performance increasing influent mn concentration did not cause increase of permeate mn concentration and the removal efficiencies were around 76 and 91 in periods 1 and 2 respectively as removal efficiency was relatively lower compared to other metals and the permeate concentrations in periods 1 and 2 averaged 0 73 0 20 mg l 1 41 removal and 0 82 0 27 mg l 1 67 removal respectively fig s3 as2s3 precipitate occurs in the presence of sulfide 16 on the other hand as2s3 dissolves at high ph and sulfide concentrations as illustrated in reaction 7 2 17 18 hence as removal at high sulfide concentrations may not be expected as its stability is very sensitive to sulfide concentrations 17 18 and depending on the ph soluble species of h2as3s6 and or has3s6 2 may be formed at high sulfide concentrations 19 r7 3 2 as2s3 amorphous 3 2 h2s h2as3s6 h hence further studies to optimize the as precipitation in sulfidogenic anmbr is required in our previous studies with fixed bed bioreactor 2 and uasb 19 similar results were observed in the study of altun et al 2 arsenic removal efficiency was only 8 in the absence of iron and at high sulfide concentration in the bioreactor supplementing the influent with 100 and 200 mg l 1 fe2 increased arsenic removal efficiency to 63 and 85 respectively decreasing the sulfide concentration to around 46 mg l 1 by halving feed cod improved the performance to 96 due to decreasing as dissolution reaction 7 3 5 the variations of mlss mlvss concentrations and the filtration performance mlvss concentrations did not show significant variations and averaged 5 42 1 0 g l 1 and 5 13 1 2 g l in the periods 1 and 2 respectively fig 4 mlss concentration in the bioreactor increased due to accumulation of precipitated metals which decreased the mlvss mlss ratio fig 4 especially in the second period the accumulation of metal precipitates in the bioreactor may cause some operational problems in the long term operation hence periodical sludge removal from the bioreactor and adding active anaerobic sludge even from an anaerobic sludge digester would keep the mlvss mlss ratio considerably high also metal recovery from the sludge removed from the bioreactor would be economically favorable up to day 200 tmp and the resistance values were quite high indicating relatively low filterability of the sludge fig 5 during the operation as the metals accumulated in the bioreactor the resistances decreased significantly although during the period 1 3 the tmp values showed frequent increase and almost weekly chemical cleaning was required the flux was quite high 8 25 0 4 lmh in the second period metal concentrations were doubled and the flux was decreased to 5 6 0 1 lmh which resulted in significant decrease in the tmps and the resistances fig 5 throughout the second period chemical cleaning was required only once and the tmp values generally remained 0 1 bar the total resistance in the second period was almost 4 5 times lower compared to the first stage together with the results obtained in the previous study 8 which was conducted in the absence of heavy metal it may be concluded that metal addition improved the sludge filterability due to coagulation behavior of the metal sulfides especially iron sulfide metal addition can mitigate the membrane fouling due to removal of colloidal particles from the mixed liquor 20 21 koseoglu et al 20 reported that the fecl3 removed soluble microbial products smps effectively and increased the filtration performance of an mbr similarly zhang et al 21 reported that fecl3 addition may remove small flocks and smps with molecular weight 10 kda due to charge neutralization hence in our study the presence of heavy metals especially fe in the wastewater may behaved as filtration aid and improved the filterability significantly the metal precipitates may also increase the floc size and improve the porosity of cake layer accumulated on the membrane surface koseoglu et al 20 reported that addition of coagulants to mbr increased the floc size in the absence of additive the mean particle size of the sludge was 38 9 μm and it increased to 206 μm with the addition of chitosan also the fraction of small particles in the sludge decreased appreciably with the addition of chitosan particles 1 μm was completely removed similarly addition of fecl3 increased the floc size from 38 9 μm to 43 7 μm also 50 60 smp removal was observed with the fecl3 addition similarly zhang et al 21 reported that ferric iron supplied positive charge for soluble macromolecules and enhanced charge neutralization hence the removal of small flocs together with smp in the presence of metal coagulants may improve the sludge filterability although frequent membrane cleaning was observed in the absence of metal at flux of 4 lmh 8 quite stable operation and only once chemical membrane cleaning was required even at 5 6 0 1 lmh in the presence of heavy metals fig 5 the filtration resistance was mainly due to thick cake layer developed on the membrane surface as its contribution to total filtration resistance was around 98 8 fig s4 the resistances of the fouled and the chemically cleaned membrane were 2 5 1013 m 1 and 2 0 1011 m 1 respectively hence chemical cleaning decreased the resistance by 99 2 4 conclusions performance of anmbr for amd treatment under sulfate reducing conditions was investigated quite high cod and sulfate removal efficiencies i e up to 95 were observed even at relatively low cod sulfate ratio of 0 75 electron flow from cod oxidation to sulfate reduction was over 90 which was higher compared to attached growth counterparts in the literature the cake layer developed on the membrane behaved as a secondary membrane as around 25 further cod removal was observed during the filtration over 99 fe cu zn co and ni were removed due to formation of metal sulfide precipitates arsenic removal was only 40 67 and optimizing its removal should be further studied interestingly addition and further increasing the metal concentrations improved the filtration performance possibly due to removal of colloidal organics by the metal precipitates relatively stable removal and filtration performances were observed throughout the study which showed that anmbr may be a potential process alternative for amd treatment acknowledgment this study was funded by the scientific and technological research

nigrospora sp biomass can be used to obtain oil and as biosorbent at the same time contributing in the fields of process integration and cleaner production keywords biosorption cleaner production residual biomass oil extraction process integration 1 introduction several industrial activities use a variety of dyes in different areas 1 textile industries are responsible to generate 54 of effluents contaminated with dyes around the world 2 the residual waters of these activities contain a large quantity of dyes which are harmful to the aquatic environment 3 many dyes found in these waters are toxic with mutagenic and carcinogenic potential adversely affecting human health and aquatic biota 4 an example is procion red h e7b a dye used extensively in the textile and tanning industries this dye contains n n in the structure which can generate aromatic amines being extremely harmful 5 the treatment of dye containing wastewaters is normally performed by several separation techniques including photolysis photocatalytics coagulation electrokinetics ion exchange adsorption and biosorption 6 among these adsorption and biosorption are considered the more suitable methods 6 due its simple design ease operation and high efficiency 7 the use of adsorption or biosorption should present low cost there are a considerable number of studies using low cost materials for this purpose such as residual biomass by products of industrial and agricultural activities bagasse shells among others 2 6 8 15 the capacity of inactive microbial biomasses used as alternative materials for the removal of dyes and metals from industrial wastewaters has also been widely reported 16 20 the use of microbial biomass as biosorbent is advantageous because it is less contaminated by harmful wastes and can be regenerated and reused 19 in addition the composition of cell wall biomass mainly from fungi chitin glucan mannan proteins amino and hydroxyl groups make this residue attractive for biosorption 21 species of fungus of the genus nigrospora sp are widely studied in the literature for the production of a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites 22 23 moreover this genus of fungus is also studied as a potential microorganism in the production of microbial oil by solid state fermentation 24 and submerged fermentation 25 the extraction of microbial oil from fungal biomass generates about 800 kg of solid residue per ton of biomass 25 the reuse of the residual biomass from the oil extraction process as biosorbent would be an alternative to add value to the production of this biotechnological product microbial oil and reduce total expenses with treatment of the substrates generated in the process this study evaluated the application of the rdb of the fungus nigrospora sp obtained from the process of oil extraction as an alternative biosorbent for the removal of pr h e7b dye from aqueous media the biosorbent and the extracted oil were characterized to evaluate the efficiency of this new biosorbent rdb the influence of different process variables on the biosorption was studied the biosorption was analyzed in detail from the kinetic and equilibrium viewpoints 2 materials and methods 2 1 biosorbent oil and dye the fungus nigrospora sp was cultivated by submerged fermentation and the biomass was obtained by separation from liquid culture using centrifugation followed by lyophilization 25 this biomass was used for oil extraction using supercritical co2 80 c and 250 bar as a result of the supercritical extraction two products were generated the residual defatted biomass rdb and the oil the oil was characterized rdb was oven dried at 60 c for 12 h sieved until 60 mesh characterized and used as biosorbent fig 1 shows the scheme of process integration it was used the red dye procion h e7b pr h e7b c52h26o26s8cl2n14na8 cas number 61931 52 0 this dye was as chosen because it is common in textile and tanning effluents 26 2 2 biosorbent and oil

point phzpc was determined according to georgin et al 5 the oil was characterized by gas chromatography shimadzu gcms qp2010 ultra japan according to sallet et al 27 2 3 biosorption experiments for the biosorption assays a stock solution of the pr h e7b dye was prepared 1000 mg l 1 with deionized water and then diluted to obtain the desired concentrations all experiments were performed in a thermostated shaker marconi ma 093 brazil with a solution volume of 50 ml and agitation rate of 150 rpm after the tests solid liquid separation was performed by centrifugation centribio 80 2b brazil at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was used for determination of absorbance using a spectrophotometer biospectro sp 22 brazil at wavelength of 538 nm initially the ph effect 2 0 10 0 was evaluated at 298 k using 1 5 g l 1 of biosorbent 100 mg l 1 of dye concentration and stirring time of 2 h the ph was adjusted with hcl and naoh the influence of biosorbent dosage was evaluated at 298 k dye concentration was 100 mg l 1 and contact time of 2 h using the best ph above determined the effects of ph and biosorbent dosage were measured in terms of dye recovery efficiency r and biosorption capacity qt by means of a one factor at a time method dye recovery efficiency r and biosorption capacity qt mg g 1 were calculated conform the following equations 1 r 100 c 0 c t c 0 2 q t c 0 c t m v where c0 is the initial dye concentration in liquid phase mg l 1 ct is the dye concentration in the liquid phase at time t mg l 1 m is the mass of biosorbent g and v is the solution volume l 2 4 kinetic and equilibrium studies the kinetic study was carried out at ph 2 0 biosorbent dosage of 0 78 g l 1 temperature of 298 k for different initial dye concentrations 50 100 200 mg l 1 and contact time from 0 to 270 min to fit the experimental data four kinetic models were used conform presented in table s1 supplementary material the equilibrium was determined for different initial dye concentrations 0 25 50 100 200 300 400 500 mg l 1 and temperatures 298 308 318 and 328 k after 5 h of contact time this time was considered after three equal measurements of dye concentration in liquid phase the biosorbent dosage was 0 78 g l 1 and ph of solution 2 0 the biosorption capacity at equilibrium qe mg g 1 was calculated according to eq 2 but using the equilibrium values of dye concentration ce mg l 1 the isotherm models of freundlich langmuir and sips were tested to fit the experimental data these models and the respective parameters are presented in table s2 supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of microbial oil and biosorbent the microbial oil yield obtained by supercritical co2 at 80 c and 250 bar from the biomass of nigrospora sp was 3 27 wt the main fatty acids found in the oil are presented in table 1 the main fatty acids of the microbial oil were oleic acid linoleic acid and palmitic acid others fatty acids in lower concentrations also were reported such as palmitoleic stearic elaidic and tricosanoic acids the microbial oil can be used for specific food and pharmaceutical applications as a result of the oil extraction a residual defatted biomass of the fungus nigrospora sp was generated fig 1 in this work the residual defatted fungal biomass was dried milled and used as biosorbent this practice is an alternative to add value to the production of microbial oil and reduce total expenses with treatment of the residues generated in the process in order to verify the structure of the biosorbent rdb the xrd study was performed as shown in figure s1 supplementary material the xrd patterns show that the material did not show any crystalline phase only a pronounced wide band at 2θ in the range of 10 to 50 indicating an amorphous structure 28 the amorphous region presents a disarranged structure with empty spaces which provides a better arrangement of large adsorbate molecules dyes for example this characteristic can favor dye biosorption 26 infrared spectra of the rdb before red line and after black line the biosorption experiments with pr h e7b are shown in fig 2 it is possible to observe the nature of the different functional groups present on the surface of rdb the major bands found in the rdb before biosorption were close to 3446 2926 2878 1650 1556 1457 1412 1318 1246 1152 1078 1041 cm 1 in the ftir of rdb before biosorption red line the broad band with a vibrational elongation around 3446 cm 1 indicates the presence of the hydroxyl oh and amino nh groups on the surface of the material 18 the bands at 2926 and 2877 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the ch groups 26 the vibrations near to 1650 cm 1 and 1556 cm 1can be attributed to co and nh of amide group bonds 29 the bands at 1457 cm 1 and 1318 cm 1 correspond to angular deformation vibrations of ch2 28 and the bands of 1246 1041 cm 1 reflect the co vibrations 30 from this analysis it can be verified that rdb contains hydroxyl carboxyl amide and amine groups which are the main functional groups present in the polysaccharides and fungal biomass proteins 31 the presence of these functional groups can be an indicative of good biosorption capacity of rdb 32 in relation to the infrared spectrum of the rdb after the biosorption it is possible to verify some changes in the bands especially in the range of 1700 1500 cm 1 referring to the groups co and nh bonds of the amide group 29 and in the range of 1220 1000 cm 1 corresponding to the co vibrations 30 suggesting that an interaction occurred between these groups present on the surface of the material and the dye prh e7b this corroborates the hypothesis that the presence of these groups is responsible for the biosorption capacity of the material fig 3 a and b shows the surface morphology details of the biosorbent before the biosorption obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem at 500 and 1500 through these images it can be observed that rdb presents an irregular surface structure with different particle sizes characterizing a rough texture these characteristics of the material benefit the impregnation of the adsorbate more quickly and easily during the biosorption process 33 these properties allow a greater interaction of the dye in the structure of the biosorbent 26 these surface characteristics of the rdb besides being a property of the nature of the material can also be attributed to the fact that this residue was obtained from the process of lipid extraction through supercritical technology this technology promotes the rupture of the microbial cell wall increasing the release of intracellular lipids 34 and consequently causes an increase in the porosity of this material these characteristics found in this fungal biomass after the lipid extraction process were also observed in the work done by fontoura et al 18 which used residual microbial biomass microalgae after the lipid extraction process with organic solvents to remove the blue acid dye 161 ab 161 from aqueous solution 3 2 effects of ph and biosorbent dosage in this work the effect of initial ph on the biosorption of pr h e7b dye was investigated using 1 5 g l 1 of biosorbent with initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 varying the ph from 2 to 10 the results are presented in fig 4 a the best results for dye removal percentage 98 4 and biosorption capacity 65 61 mg g 1 were obtained at ph 2 for ph higher than 2 it was verified a sharply decrease in the removal percentage and biosorption capacity for example at ph 10 the removal percentage was only 21 7 and the biosorption capacity was 15 mg g 1 this improvement in the dye removal at ph 2 can attributed to the occurrence of the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate dye and biosorbent which are normally affected by the ionic charges of the functional groups 35 in acid solutions the biosorbent is charged with a positive charge the point of zero charge of rdb was 7 0 this allows the interactions between the functional groups of the biosorbent with the sulfonated so3 groups contained in the dye 36 when the ph is increased biosorption of the dye in the rdb decreases since the functional groups of the dye molecules are repealed electrostatically by the negatively charged surface of the biosorbent the results found here were similar to some studies in the literature akar et al 3 used the geosorbent natural mineral to remove orange reactive dye 13 and obtained a greater percentage of dye removal 98 48 at ph 2 vanaamudan et al 37 employed hydrotalcite as adsorbent to remove the dyes reactive blue 21 and reactive red 141 from aqueous solution and the maximum adsorption capacity for the two dyes 266 7 mg g 1 and 320 5 mg g 1 respectively was obtained at ph 2 the effect of the biosorbent dosage 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 g l 1 on the dye removal percentage and biosorption capacity is presented in fig 4 b the removal percentage increased from 37 to 99 when the biosorbent dosage increased from 0 3 to 1 5 g l 1 this behavior is attributed to the increase of total biosorption sites on the contrary the biosorption capacity decreased from 120 to 65 mg g 1 this decrease in biosorption capacity of the dye with increasing biosorbent dosage can be attributed to a greater number of sites that remain unloaded during biosorption as well as the agglomeration of biosorbent particles to ensure good values for both biosorption capacity and dye removal percentage the intersection of the curves in fig 4 b was selected as the more suitable biosorbent dosage this value was 0 78 g l 1 which provided removal percentage around 80 and biosorption capacity around 100 mg g 1 3 3 biosorption kinetic profile the kinetic study is fundamental to understand the biosorption process since it provides data on the mechanism of the process and biosorption rate which are of great importance in the treatment of aqueous solutions containing dyes 38 the biosorption kinetic curves were determined at different initial dye concentrations 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 and are shown in fig 5 the dye biosorption occurred in three stages in the first stage first 30 min it is verified a high biosorption rate of the dye in the rdb this behavior occurs due to the large number of active sites available on the surface of the biosorbent in the second step ranging from 30 to 120 min the biosorption rate decreased since the active sites are gradually filled other point that reduces the biosorption rate is the occurrence of the repulsive forces of the dye molecules that have already been biosorbed in the process 39 in the last step 120 to 270 min there is a little variation in the biosorption capacity since the process is near to the equilibrium and the sites are practically saturated different kinetic models see table s1 were used to fit the experimental data the estimated parameters and the fit quality are presented in table s3 the highest values for the coefficient of determination r2 and the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj associated with the lowest values of average relative error are were obtained using the general order model which was the best to fit the experimental data when compared with the ppo pso and avrami models the general order model also provided the best fit of the experimental data on the adsorption of the reactive violet dye 5 using cocoa shell activated carbon as biosorbent 40 adsorption of red procion h e7b using pretreated avocado peels 5 adsorption of reactive red 120 dye using spirulina platensis and commercial activated charcoal as adsorbents 41 and adsorption of direct blue 53 dye using carbon nanotubes and activated carbon powder as adsorbents 42 the qn values increased with the initial dye concentration reaching maximum values of 145 74 mg g 1 for dye concentration of 200 mg l 1 there is a good agreement among experimental qe and calculated qn values for all dye concentrations confirming the good fitting of the model with experimental data an important factor to consider is that the kinetic equation of the general order model presents different orders n at the moment that the concentration of the dye is modified it is necessary to estimate the initial biosorption rate h0 determined by h0 knqn n the values for h0 increased with the increase of the initial dye concentration indicating that there is coherence in the experimental data this indicates that in the initial biosorption stages the process was fast at higher dye concentrations 3 4 biosorption equilibrium isotherms the equilibrium isotherms which describe the relationship between the adsorbate concentrations dye remaining in the solution and biosorption capacity at equilibrium are shown in fig 6 for different temperatures 298 308 318 and 328 k the curves presented an inclined step in lower ce values indicating that there are several biosorption sites to be occupied by the dye also this inclined portion indicates affinity between the dye and the rdb at higher concentrations in liquid phase the curves tend to a plateau this shows that practically all the biosorption sites were occupied by the dye the biosorption capacity of the dye at equilibrium decreased with the temperature increase this trend was strongly pronounced at 328 k comparing the isotherms at 298 and 328 k it was found that the biosorption capacity was around 7 times lower at 328 k this behavior can be related with the thermosensitivity of the functional groups of the biosorbent which can be damaged at higher temperatures 43 a similar result was found in the adsorption of methylene blue dye using acid washed black cumin seeds at temperatures from 300 to 318 k 29 the parameters of biosorption equilibrium models freundlich langmuir and sips estimated from experimental data are presented in table s4 the freundlich model fig 6 and table s4 presented the best fit with the experimental data with the highest coefficients of determination and the lowest average relative errors the freundlich model was also the most adequate to interpret the adsorption equilibrium in others studies available in literature 18 26 28 the freundlich constant kf was similar in the temperatures from 298 to 308 k but was strongly lower at 328 k the evolution of this parameter confirms the explanation presented above that higher temperatures are not adequate in this biosorption system to verify if the rdb of fungus nigrospora sp is suitable as a biosorbent a comparison with other materials for uptake the dye pr h e7b was presented in table s5 it is possible to verify that there is a great difference in capacity among the materials which varies from 0 76 mg g 1 to 212 6 mg g 1 the capacities presented in table s5 were obtained in different experimental conditions but are the higher values obtained in each work the rdb evaluated in this work presented the second best biosorption capacity which was 188 79 mg g 1 this satisfactory result makes this material rdb a promising material in the removal of the dye pr h e7b from aqueous solutions in addition to this another advantage of the use of this material is the low cost since it is a residue of a biotechnological process extraction of fungal oil 4 conclusion it was demonstrated that the residual defatted biomass rdb of the fungus nigrospora sp is an alternative material that can be used as biosorbent to treat colored dyes rdb demonstrated high efficiency removal percentage around 98 and high biosorption capacity 188 79 mg g 1 to uptake pr h e7b dye from aqueous solution furthermore the rdb has low cost since is generated from the extraction of a biotechnological product microbial oil the application of rdb as biosorbent is an alternative to add value for the production of microbial oil from nigrospora sp reducing the total expenses with treatment of the substrates residues generated in the oil

14306,the residual defatted biomass rdb of the fungus nigrospora sp obtained from the oil extraction process using supercritical technology was used as a low cost biosorbent for the removal of procion red h e7b dye pr h e7b from aqueous solutions the biosorption was favored using a biosorbent dosage of 0 78 g l 1 at ph 2 biosorption kinetics was evaluated for different dye concentrations 50 200 mg

showed the best fit of the equilibrium data the maximum biosorption capacity was 188 79 mg g 1 at 298 k these results show that the rdb of nigrospora sp has potential as biosorbent in this way the nigrospora sp biomass can be used to obtain oil and as biosorbent at the same time contributing in the fields of process integration and cleaner production keywords biosorption cleaner production residual biomass oil extraction process integration 1 introduction several industrial activities use a variety of dyes in different areas 1 textile industries are responsible to generate 54 of effluents contaminated with dyes around the world 2 the residual waters of these activities contain a large quantity of dyes which are harmful to the aquatic environment 3 many dyes found in these waters are toxic with mutagenic and carcinogenic potential adversely affecting human health and aquatic biota 4 an example is procion red h e7b a dye used extensively in the textile and tanning industries this dye contains n n in the structure which can generate aromatic amines being extremely harmful 5 the treatment of dye containing wastewaters is normally performed by several separation techniques including photolysis photocatalytics coagulation electrokinetics ion exchange adsorption and biosorption 6 among these adsorption and biosorption are considered the more suitable methods 6 due its simple design ease operation and high efficiency 7 the use of adsorption or biosorption should present low cost there are a considerable number of studies using low cost materials for this purpose such as residual biomass by products of industrial and agricultural activities bagasse shells among others 2 6 8 15 the capacity of inactive microbial biomasses used as alternative materials for the removal of dyes and metals from industrial wastewaters has also been widely reported 16 20 the use of microbial biomass as biosorbent is advantageous because it is less contaminated by harmful wastes and can be regenerated and reused 19 in addition the composition of cell wall biomass mainly from fungi chitin glucan mannan proteins amino and hydroxyl groups make this residue attractive for biosorption 21 species of fungus of the genus nigrospora sp are widely studied in the literature for the production of a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites 22 23 moreover this genus of fungus is also studied as a potential microorganism in the production of microbial oil by solid state fermentation 24 and submerged fermentation 25 the extraction of microbial oil from fungal biomass generates about 800 kg of solid residue per ton of biomass 25 the reuse of the residual biomass from the oil extraction process as biosorbent would be an alternative to add value to the production of this biotechnological product microbial oil and reduce total expenses with treatment of the substrates generated in the process this study evaluated the application of the rdb of the fungus nigrospora sp obtained from the process of oil extraction as an alternative biosorbent for the removal of pr h e7b dye from aqueous media the biosorbent and the extracted oil were characterized to evaluate the efficiency of this new biosorbent rdb the influence of different process variables on the biosorption was studied the biosorption was analyzed in detail from the kinetic and equilibrium viewpoints 2 materials and methods 2 1 biosorbent oil and dye the fungus nigrospora sp was cultivated by submerged fermentation and the biomass was obtained by separation from liquid culture using centrifugation followed by lyophilization 25 this biomass was used for oil extraction using supercritical co2 80 c and 250 bar as a result of the supercritical extraction two products were generated the residual defatted biomass rdb and the oil the oil was characterized rdb was oven dried at 60 c for 12 h sieved until 60 mesh characterized and used as biosorbent fig 1 shows the scheme of process integration it was used the red dye procion h e7b pr h e7b c52h26o26s8cl2n14na8 cas number 61931 52 0 this dye was as chosen because it is common in textile and tanning effluents 26 2 2 biosorbent and oil characterization rdb was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir prestige 21210045 japan by the direct transmittance method using the kbr tablet technique the spectra were obtained in the range of 400 4500 cm 1 with scanning of 45 scans and resolution of 2 0 cm 1 the biosorbent structure was determined by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku miniflex 300 japan operating with cu kα λ 1 5418 å 30 kv 10 ma step of 0 03 and acquisition time of 0 5 s the morphology was visualized by scanning electron microscopy sem using an apparatus vega 3 tescan czech republic the zero loading point phzpc was determined according to georgin et al 5 the oil was characterized by gas chromatography shimadzu gcms qp2010 ultra japan according to sallet et al 27 2 3 biosorption experiments for the biosorption assays a stock solution of the pr h e7b dye was prepared 1000 mg l 1 with deionized water and then diluted to obtain the desired concentrations all experiments were performed in a thermostated shaker marconi ma 093 brazil with a solution volume of 50 ml and agitation rate of 150 rpm after the tests solid liquid separation was performed by centrifugation centribio 80 2b brazil at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was used for determination of absorbance using a spectrophotometer biospectro sp 22 brazil at wavelength of 538 nm initially the ph effect 2 0 10 0 was evaluated at 298 k using 1 5 g l 1 of biosorbent 100 mg l 1 of dye concentration and stirring time of 2 h the ph was adjusted with hcl and naoh the influence of biosorbent dosage was evaluated at 298 k dye concentration was 100 mg l 1 and contact time of 2 h using the best ph above determined the effects of ph and biosorbent dosage were measured in terms of dye recovery efficiency r and biosorption capacity qt by means of a one factor at a time method dye recovery efficiency r and biosorption capacity qt mg g 1 were calculated conform the following equations 1 r 100 c 0 c t c 0 2 q t c 0 c t m v where c0 is the initial dye concentration in liquid phase mg l 1 ct is the dye concentration in the liquid phase at time t mg l 1 m is the mass of biosorbent g and v is the solution volume l 2 4 kinetic and equilibrium studies the kinetic study was carried out at ph 2 0 biosorbent dosage of 0 78 g l 1 temperature of 298 k for different initial dye concentrations 50 100 200 mg l 1 and contact time from 0 to 270 min to fit the experimental data four kinetic models were used conform presented in table s1 supplementary material the equilibrium was determined for different initial dye concentrations 0 25 50 100 200 300 400 500 mg l 1 and temperatures 298 308 318 and 328 k after 5 h of contact time this time was considered after three equal measurements of dye concentration in liquid phase the biosorbent dosage was 0 78 g l 1 and ph of solution 2 0 the biosorption capacity at equilibrium qe mg g 1 was calculated according to eq 2 but using the equilibrium values of dye concentration ce mg l 1 the isotherm models of freundlich langmuir and sips were tested to fit the experimental data these models and the respective parameters are presented in table s2 supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of microbial oil and biosorbent the microbial oil yield obtained by supercritical co2 at 80 c and 250 bar from the biomass of nigrospora sp was 3 27 wt the main fatty acids found in the oil are presented in table 1 the main fatty acids of the microbial oil were oleic acid linoleic acid and palmitic acid others fatty acids in lower concentrations also were reported such as palmitoleic stearic elaidic and tricosanoic acids the microbial oil can be used for specific food and pharmaceutical applications as a result of the oil extraction a residual defatted biomass of the fungus nigrospora sp was generated fig 1 in this work the residual defatted fungal biomass was dried milled and used as biosorbent this practice is an alternative to add value to the production of microbial oil and reduce total expenses with treatment of the residues generated in the process in order to verify the structure of the biosorbent rdb the xrd study was performed as shown in figure s1 supplementary material the xrd patterns show that the material did not show any crystalline phase only a pronounced wide band at 2θ in the range of 10 to 50 indicating an amorphous structure 28 the amorphous region presents a disarranged structure with empty spaces which provides a better arrangement of large adsorbate molecules dyes for example this characteristic can favor dye biosorption 26 infrared spectra of the rdb before red line and after black line the biosorption experiments with pr h e7b are shown in fig 2 it is possible to observe the nature of the different functional groups present on the surface of rdb the major bands found in the rdb before biosorption were close to 3446 2926 2878 1650 1556 1457 1412 1318 1246 1152 1078 1041 cm 1 in the ftir of rdb before biosorption red line the broad band with a vibrational elongation around 3446 cm 1 indicates the presence of the hydroxyl oh and amino nh groups on the surface of the material 18 the bands at 2926 and 2877 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the ch groups 26 the vibrations near to 1650 cm 1 and 1556 cm 1can be attributed to co and nh of amide group bonds 29 the bands at 1457 cm 1 and 1318 cm 1 correspond to angular deformation vibrations of ch2 28 and the bands of 1246 1041 cm 1 reflect the co vibrations 30 from this analysis it can be verified that rdb contains hydroxyl carboxyl amide and amine groups which are the main functional groups present in the polysaccharides and fungal biomass proteins 31 the presence of these functional groups can be an indicative of good biosorption capacity of rdb 32 in relation to the infrared spectrum of the rdb after the biosorption it is possible to verify some changes in the bands especially in the range of 1700 1500 cm 1 referring to the groups co and nh bonds of the amide group 29 and in the range of 1220 1000 cm 1 corresponding to the co vibrations 30 suggesting that an interaction occurred between these groups present on the surface of the material and the dye prh e7b this corroborates the hypothesis that the presence of these groups is responsible for the biosorption capacity of the material fig 3 a and b shows the surface morphology details of the biosorbent before the biosorption obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem at 500 and 1500 through these images it can be observed that rdb presents an irregular surface structure with different particle sizes characterizing a rough texture these characteristics of the material benefit the impregnation of the adsorbate more quickly and easily during the biosorption process 33 these properties allow a greater interaction of the dye in the structure of the biosorbent 26 these surface characteristics of the rdb besides being a property of the nature of the material can also be attributed to the fact that this residue was obtained from the process of lipid extraction through supercritical technology this technology promotes the rupture of the microbial cell wall increasing the release of intracellular lipids 34 and consequently causes an increase in the porosity of this material these characteristics found in this fungal biomass after the lipid extraction process were also observed in the work done by fontoura et al 18 which used residual microbial biomass microalgae after the lipid extraction process with organic solvents to remove the blue acid dye 161 ab 161 from aqueous solution 3 2 effects of ph and biosorbent dosage in this work the effect of initial ph on the biosorption of pr h e7b dye was investigated using 1 5 g l 1 of biosorbent with initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 varying the ph from 2 to 10 the results are presented in fig 4 a the best results for dye removal percentage 98 4 and biosorption capacity 65 61 mg g 1 were obtained at ph 2 for ph higher than 2 it was verified a sharply decrease in the removal percentage and biosorption capacity for example at ph 10 the removal percentage was only 21 7 and the biosorption capacity was 15 mg g 1 this improvement in the dye removal at ph 2 can attributed to the occurrence of the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate dye and biosorbent which are normally affected by the ionic charges of the functional groups 35 in acid solutions the biosorbent is charged with a positive charge the point of zero charge of rdb was 7 0 this allows the interactions between the functional groups of the biosorbent with the sulfonated so3 groups contained in the dye 36 when the ph is increased biosorption of the dye in the rdb decreases since the functional groups of the dye molecules are repealed electrostatically by the negatively charged surface of the biosorbent the results found here were similar to some studies in the literature akar et al 3 used the geosorbent natural mineral to remove orange reactive dye 13 and obtained a greater percentage of dye removal 98 48 at ph 2 vanaamudan et al 37 employed hydrotalcite as adsorbent to remove the dyes reactive blue 21 and reactive red 141 from aqueous solution and the maximum adsorption capacity for the two dyes 266 7 mg g 1 and 320 5 mg g 1 respectively was obtained at ph 2 the effect of the biosorbent dosage 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 g l 1 on the dye removal percentage and biosorption capacity is presented in fig 4 b the removal percentage increased from 37 to 99 when the biosorbent dosage increased from 0 3 to 1 5 g l 1 this behavior is attributed to the increase of total biosorption sites on the contrary the biosorption capacity decreased from 120 to 65 mg g 1 this decrease in biosorption capacity of the dye with increasing biosorbent dosage can be attributed to a greater number of sites that remain unloaded during biosorption as well as the agglomeration of biosorbent particles to ensure good values for both biosorption capacity and dye removal percentage the intersection of the curves in fig 4 b was selected as the more suitable biosorbent dosage this value was 0 78 g l 1 which provided removal percentage around 80 and biosorption capacity around 100 mg g 1 3 3 biosorption kinetic profile the kinetic study is fundamental to understand the biosorption process since it provides data on the mechanism of the process and biosorption rate which are of great importance in the treatment of aqueous solutions containing dyes 38 the biosorption kinetic curves were determined at different initial dye concentrations 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 and are shown in fig 5 the dye biosorption occurred in three stages in the first stage first 30 min it is verified a high biosorption rate of the dye in the rdb this behavior occurs due to the large number of active sites available on the surface of the biosorbent in the second step ranging from 30 to 120 min the biosorption rate decreased since the active sites are gradually filled other point that reduces the biosorption rate is the occurrence of the repulsive forces of the dye molecules that have already been biosorbed in the process 39 in the last step 120 to 270 min there is a little variation in the biosorption capacity since the process is near to the equilibrium and the sites are practically saturated different kinetic models see table s1 were used to fit the experimental data the estimated parameters and the fit quality are presented in table s3 the highest values for the coefficient of determination r2 and the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj associated with the lowest values of average relative error are were obtained using the general order model which was the best to fit the experimental data when compared with the ppo pso and avrami models the general order model also provided the best fit of the experimental data on the adsorption of the reactive violet dye 5 using cocoa shell activated carbon as biosorbent 40 adsorption of red procion h e7b using pretreated avocado peels 5 adsorption of reactive red 120 dye using spirulina platensis and commercial activated charcoal as adsorbents 41 and adsorption of direct blue 53 dye using carbon nanotubes and activated carbon powder as adsorbents 42 the qn values increased with the initial dye concentration reaching maximum values of 145 74 mg g 1 for dye concentration of 200 mg l 1 there is a good agreement among experimental qe and calculated qn values for all dye concentrations confirming the good fitting of the model with experimental data an important factor to consider is that the kinetic equation of the general order model presents different orders n at the moment that the concentration of the dye is modified it is necessary to estimate the initial biosorption rate h0 determined by h0 knqn n the values for h0 increased with the increase of the initial dye concentration indicating that there is coherence in the experimental data this indicates that in the initial biosorption stages the process was fast at higher dye concentrations 3 4 biosorption equilibrium isotherms the equilibrium isotherms which describe the relationship between the adsorbate concentrations dye remaining in the solution and biosorption capacity at equilibrium are shown in fig 6 for different temperatures 298 308 318 and 328 k the curves presented an inclined step in lower ce values indicating that there are several biosorption sites to be occupied by the dye also this inclined portion indicates affinity between the dye and the rdb at higher concentrations in liquid phase the curves tend to a plateau this shows that practically all the biosorption sites were occupied by the dye the biosorption capacity of the dye at equilibrium decreased with the temperature increase this trend was strongly pronounced at 328 k comparing the isotherms at 298 and 328 k it was found that the biosorption capacity was around 7 times lower at 328 k this behavior can be related with the thermosensitivity of the functional groups of the biosorbent which can be damaged at higher temperatures 43 a similar result was found in the adsorption of methylene blue dye using acid washed black cumin seeds at temperatures from 300 to 318 k 29 the parameters of biosorption equilibrium models freundlich langmuir and sips estimated from experimental data are presented in table s4 the freundlich model fig 6 and table s4 presented the best fit with the experimental data with the highest coefficients of determination and the lowest average relative errors the freundlich model was also the most adequate to interpret the adsorption equilibrium in others studies available in literature 18 26 28 the freundlich constant kf was similar in the temperatures from 298 to 308 k but was strongly lower at 328 k the evolution of this parameter confirms the explanation presented above that higher temperatures are not adequate in this biosorption system to verify if the rdb of fungus nigrospora sp is suitable as a biosorbent a comparison with other materials for uptake the dye pr h e7b was presented in table s5 it is possible to verify that there is a great difference in capacity among the materials which varies from 0 76 mg g 1 to 212 6 mg g 1 the capacities presented in table s5 were obtained in different experimental conditions but are the higher values obtained in each work the rdb evaluated in this work presented the second best biosorption capacity which was 188 79 mg g 1 this satisfactory result makes this material rdb a promising material in the removal of the dye pr h e7b from aqueous solutions in addition to this another advantage of the use of this material is the low cost since it is a residue of a biotechnological process extraction of fungal oil 4 conclusion it was demonstrated that the residual defatted biomass rdb of the fungus nigrospora sp is an alternative material that can be used as biosorbent to treat colored dyes rdb demonstrated high efficiency removal percentage around 98 and high biosorption capacity 188 79 mg g 1 to uptake pr h e7b dye from aqueous solution furthermore the rdb has low cost since is generated from the extraction of a biotechnological product microbial oil the application of rdb as biosorbent is an alternative to add value for the production of microbial oil from nigrospora sp reducing the total expenses with treatment of the substrates residues generated in the oil

14307,fenton like reaction has been widely used to decompose organic pollutants via heterogeneous catalysis mechanism graphene based materials have attracted lots of attention in catalysis process but the catalysis efficiency and stability of these materials are still needed to improve in this work a new type of polyamine modified reduced graphene oxide rgo nanocomposite has been obtained through a facile synthesis process wherein rgo was chemically anchored by triethylenetetramine teta molecules via nucleophilic reaction forming rgo teta intermediate compounds that binds to fe3o4 nanoparticles by forming stable chelating bonds finally resulting in rgo teta fe3o4 nanocomposite this new material exhibits remarkable catalysis ability to degrade azo type dye acid orange 7 dye ao7 and excellent reusability in 10 cycles since h2o2 decomposition rate electron transfer and material stability have been highly promoted by the unique structure of this nanocomposite 1 introduction heterogeneous fenton like catalyst has attracted considerable research interests in degradation of persistent organic compounds 1 2 especially fe3o4 nanoparticles has been reported having a higher catalytic activity in many environmental reactions due to its unique properties such as low toxicity biocompatibility electric and magnetic properties 3 6 however the fe3o4 nanoparticles also have strong anisotropic dipolar interactions that make it readily to form large particles in liquid phase and thus reduce its catalysis capability hence it is necessary to find supporting materials that not only can immobilise fe3o4 nanoparticles to avoid particle agglomeration but also facilitate electron transfer between catalyst surfaces and target organic compounds in aqueous solution graphene oxide go as a graphene derivative 7 has obtained a lot of attention due to two dimensional 2d structure its availability in large quantities easy modification good conductivity and excellent chemical stability 8 10 two dimensional go nanosheets and derivatives have been widely used to anchor the fe3o4 particles on the surface to improve the performance of fenton like catalysis reactions 2 11 12 however the immobilized nanoparticles on go surface are often in the form of physical attachment which make it easy to detach the nanoparticles from go nanosheets 13 14 thus losing catalysis efficacy chemical attachment can be a better way to improve the stability of graphene based nanocomposites in particular brominated graphene derivatives with reactive c br bonds become an important intermediate product for further modification 15 16 jankovský et al 17 have systematically studied the bromination reaction of graphite oxide they demonstrated go bromination was accompanied by a high degree of reduction and a degree of graphene hydrogenation leading to the brominated reduced graphene oxide rgo br structure compared to go structure rgo based material exhibits the higher electrical conductivity and thus facilitate the efficient electron transfer during catalysis process herein we prepared a new type of polyamine modified rgo via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between triethylenetetramine teta and rgo br resulting in rgo teta nanomaterials there are two important reasons why teta molecule was chosen to modify rgo surfaces one of which is that teta molecule is a highly effective chelating agent 18 19 for binding to ferric fe3 and ferrous fe2 species on fe3o4 surfaces and thus leading to the stable rgo teta fe3o4 nanocomposite the other reason is that teta fe3 chelate complexes 20 21 and its iron anchored polymers 22 have been proven to highly promote h2o2 decomposition via a catalytic mechanism and be applied to oxidise organic compounds the catalysis performance of fenton like reaction to degrade zyo type dye ao7 orange ii by this nanocomposite was carefully investigated 2 result and discussion the rgo teta fe3o4 nanocomposite was synthesised via three steps shown in scheme 1 including go bromination to produce rgo br substitution reaction between teta and rgo br leading to rgo teta and rgo teta chelating with fe3o4 nanoparticles specific experimental details are illustrated in the supplementary materials 13c solid state nmr analysis was conducted for investigate the cbr cn bond formation after go bromination and teta substitution separately as shown in fig 1 cbr bond in rgo br intermediate was detected at the region of chemical shift below 50 ppm the peaks of residual co bond also demonstrated at from 50 to 100 ppm after the nucleophilic reaction between rgo br and teta molecules the cbr bonds were replaced by cn bonds in rgo teta material in fig 1 go rgo br and rgo teta materials were further analysed by xps to verify the bromination

catalysis temperature on ao7 degradation process have been discussed in fig s2 b d the degradation results shown in fig 4 a suggest that a small amount of rgo teta fe3o4 catalyst can significantly enhance the degradation efficiency ao7 concentration rapidly declines with the increase of weight percentage of rgo teta from 0 to 2 4 wt in fe3o4 matrix due to the increased number of active catalytic sites and thus 93 3 of total ao7 decomposed at 20 min using 2 4 wt of rgo teta on the other hand using 2 5 wt of go in fe3o4 matrix as catalyst there is no degradation enhancement at 20 min compared to 46 1 of ao7 removal by pure fe3o4 catalyst in fig 4 b the increase of go content to 5 wt in fe3o4 catalyst only leads to 58 5 degradation at 20 min and finally reaching 93 3 degradation at 120 min the results clearly indicate rgo teta fe3o4 material is the more potent catalyst than go fe3o4 material in fig 4 c uv vis spectrum of original ao7 solution at 0 min show three key peaks at 310

degradation percentage in the first 5 cycles is quite stable in the range of 95 99 while the activity of this material slightly reduced to 83 4 in 10th cycle for go fe3o4 material the degradation percentage significantly declined from 93 5 in 1 st cycle to 43 4 in 10th cycle the results of cycling performance indicate that the stable chelating bonds between fe3o4 nanoparticles and teta molecules chemically anchored on rgo surface play a key role in securing the excellent catalysis ability in the long term application finally the mechanism for rgo teta fe3o4 in h2o2 heterogeneous

14307,fenton like reaction has been widely used to decompose organic pollutants via heterogeneous catalysis mechanism graphene based materials have attracted lots of attention in catalysis process but the catalysis efficiency and stability of these materials are still needed to improve in this work a new type of polyamine modified reduced graphene oxide rgo nanocomposite has been obtained through a facile synthesis process wherein rgo was chemically anchored by triethylenetetramine teta molecules via nucleophilic reaction forming rgo teta intermediate compounds that binds to fe3o4 nanoparticles by forming stable chelating bonds finally resulting in rgo teta fe3o4 nanocomposite this new material exhibits remarkable catalysis ability to degrade azo type dye acid orange 7 dye ao7 and excellent reusability in 10 cycles since h2o2 decomposition rate electron transfer and material stability have been highly promoted by the unique structure of this nanocomposite 1 introduction heterogeneous fenton like catalyst has attracted considerable research interests in degradation of persistent organic compounds 1 2 especially fe3o4 nanoparticles has been reported having a higher catalytic activity in many environmental reactions due to its unique properties such as low toxicity biocompatibility electric and magnetic properties 3 6 however the fe3o4 nanoparticles also have strong anisotropic dipolar interactions that make it readily to form large particles in liquid phase and thus reduce its catalysis capability hence it is necessary to find supporting materials that not only can immobilise fe3o4 nanoparticles to avoid particle agglomeration but also facilitate electron transfer between catalyst surfaces and target organic compounds in aqueous solution graphene oxide go as a graphene derivative 7 has obtained a lot of attention due to two dimensional 2d structure its availability in large quantities easy modification good conductivity and excellent chemical stability 8 10 two dimensional go nanosheets and derivatives have been widely used to anchor the fe3o4 particles on the surface to improve the performance of fenton like catalysis reactions 2 11 12 however the immobilized nanoparticles on go surface are often in the form of physical attachment which make it easy to detach the nanoparticles from go nanosheets 13 14 thus losing catalysis efficacy chemical attachment can be a better way to improve the stability of graphene based nanocomposites in particular brominated graphene derivatives with reactive c br bonds become an important intermediate product for further modification 15 16 jankovský et al 17 have systematically studied the bromination reaction of graphite oxide they demonstrated go bromination was accompanied by a high degree of reduction and a degree of graphene hydrogenation leading to the brominated reduced graphene oxide rgo br structure compared to go structure rgo based material exhibits the higher electrical conductivity and thus facilitate the efficient electron transfer during catalysis process herein we prepared a new type of polyamine modified rgo via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between triethylenetetramine teta and rgo br resulting in rgo teta nanomaterials there are two important reasons why teta molecule was chosen to modify rgo surfaces one of which is that teta molecule is a highly effective chelating agent 18 19 for binding to ferric fe3 and ferrous fe2 species on fe3o4 surfaces and thus leading to the stable rgo teta fe3o4 nanocomposite the other reason is that teta fe3 chelate complexes 20 21 and its iron anchored polymers 22 have been proven to highly promote h2o2 decomposition via a catalytic mechanism and be applied to oxidise organic compounds the catalysis performance of fenton like reaction to degrade zyo type dye ao7 orange ii by this nanocomposite was carefully investigated 2 result and discussion the rgo teta fe3o4 nanocomposite was synthesised via three steps shown in scheme 1 including go bromination to produce rgo br substitution reaction between teta and rgo br leading to rgo teta and rgo teta chelating with fe3o4 nanoparticles specific experimental details are illustrated in the supplementary materials 13c solid state nmr analysis was conducted for investigate the cbr cn bond formation after go bromination and teta substitution separately as shown in fig 1 cbr bond in rgo br intermediate was detected at the region of chemical shift below 50 ppm the peaks of residual co bond also demonstrated at from 50 to 100 ppm after the nucleophilic reaction between rgo br and teta molecules the cbr bonds were replaced by cn bonds in rgo teta material in fig 1 go rgo br and rgo teta materials were further analysed by xps to verify the bromination process and the substitution of teta survey scan spectra are presented in fig 2 a where the decrease in oxygen peaks after sequential go bromination and teta substitution is clearly visible the c o

14308,this study evaluated the potential of anaerobic treatment of wastewater from washing polyterephthalate ethylene pet bottles sent to recycling wwpr in a fluidized bed reactor the reactor had a total volume of 2 16 l and was fed with the wwpr diluted in a nutritional medium operated with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and maintained at a temperature of 33 2 c coarse sand was used as a support material for the immobilization of biomass in the reactor the potential of the anaerobic system was evaluated as a result of the progressive increase in chemical oxygen demand cod and anionic surfactants both from the wwpr the biomass was subjected to an immobilization and adaptation process over 10 days and after this period concentrations of anionic surfactants were added the maximum cod load removed was 2 6 0 43 kg m³d which represented a removal of 64 8 the maximum surfactant removal was 0 063 0 001 kg m³d for an initial concentration of 15 mg l the fluidized bed reactor was stable and robust in relation to the applied load of organic matter however surfactant removal was inhibited at initial concentrations above 30 mg l keywords wastewater from pet washing fluidized bed anaerobic reactor anionic surfactants sand removal of cod 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater aims to remove possible contaminants present in effluents so that the acceptable levels of concentration of these contaminants are reached according to the current local environmental legislation and in order to avoid health and environmental problems treatment technologies are effective in removing solids organic matter pathogens nutrients and some metals however some substances known as emerging compounds are not so easily treated emerging compounds include pharmaceuticals pesticides antibiotics hormones steroids plasticizers and surfactants 1 due to the emulsifying characteristic of surfactants which results from their long apolar hydrophobic and polar hydrophilic carbon chains this class of compounds can interact with both polar water and apolar dirt substances making them difficult to treat 1 among the surfactants the most used by the industry in general belongs to the anionic surfactants group which includes the main surfactants contained in shampoos soaps and detergents 2 anionic surfactants have an alkyl chain which may have different lengths and an anionic polar group sulfate sulfonates phosphates etc 3 they are moderately soluble in water and organic solvents due to their amphiphilic character are neither volatile nor hydrolyzed by acids or bases 4 they are generally sensitive to hard water and are incompatible with cationic surfactants due to the neutralization of loads 2 in the global context of the search for renewable technologies for production the recycling of polyterephthalate ethylene pet bottles 5 stands out however when the recycling process involves the cleaning of waste from the plastic wastewater is generated according to prado 6 about 15 of the total liquid effluent generated during the life cycle of pet comes from the recycling stage due to the impurities and dirt contained in pet bottles intended for recycling and the addition of cleaners and detergents for their sanitization the wastewater from the cleaning process has a complex composition wastewater from pet bottle washing is harmful to the environment characterized by high concentrations of organic matter and surfactant agents physico chemical treatment that uses coagulants and flocculants is an alternative for the treatment of wastewater from washing pet bottles sent to recycling wwpr however the presence of high concentrations of surfactants makes this type of treatment unattractive since only flocculation coagulation are not sufficient to make the surfactant concentration appropriate to the release into the environment requiring subsequent steps which makes the process expensive buss et al 7 studied the wastewater treatment of an industrial laundry which was also rich in surfactants after analysis of different treatments the results showed that the flocculation and coagulation treatment satisfactorily removed sediment and suspended solids and cod but did not satisfactorily reduce the concentration of surfactants only the treatment in which the processes of flocculation coagulation and adsorption with activated carbon were allied promoted an effluent treated with the levels accepted by the current legislation a promising alternative is the use of anaerobic treatment which has low implantation and operational costs and is accompanied by the production of biogas which can be used as fuel for the generation of energy bioreactors with immobilized biomass in inorganic support or biomass in granules have been proposed for the biodigestion of surfactants due to their robustness in the treatment of effluents rich in toxic compounds or compounds difficult to biodegrade therefore studies using fixed bed reactors 8 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 9 and fluidized bed reactors 10 12 were performed with the purpose of verify the efficiency in the treatment of effluents with high concentrations of surfactants due to the high concentrations of anionic surfactants present in the wwpr the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr stands out as an alternative for its treatment an afbr contains an inorganic support medium for biomass immobilization which promotes maximum contact between the substrate and microorganisms this makes it possible to remove surfactants as well as dilute them by means of a high recirculation rate 13 wide variety of support material has been used for immobilization of biomass such as activated carbon sand clay spheres pellets among others the afbr presents some advantages over the other high rate configurations lower hrts better control of the biofilm thickness which allows good diffusion of the substrate to the deeper layers avoiding the presence of inactive layers besides avoiding preferential flow problems gas retention and clogging which are recurrent problems in fixed bed reactors 14 this study evaluated the performance of anaerobic biodegradation in an afbr for the treatment for wwpr 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and nutritional medium the wwpr was collected at a pet bottle recycling company located in the city of poços de caldas mg brazil before its use the effluent was stored under refrigeration at 5 c each batch of bottles for recycling was washed with a mixture of 3 4 ml l detergent 2 4 ml l caustic soda 0 70 ml l humectant and 1 1 ml l anti foaming agent about 4 m³ of wastewater was generated per ton of bottles in the washing process a basic characterization of the three wastewater samples was previously performed table 1 presents the characterization of the wwpr due to the high concentrations of carbonaceous organic matter and anionic surfactants the wwpr was diluted in nutritional medium the nutritional medium was synthesized according to sancinetti et al 15 adding the wwpr as the main source of carbon the composition of the nutritional medium is presented in table 2 2 2 inoculum the sludge used for reactor inoculation came from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb treating poultry slaughterhouse wastewater avícola dacar the sludge has a total volatile solids tvs concentration of 40 272 mg l this sludge has good microbial diversity and has already been used in several anaerobic processes studies among them sulfetogenic 16 and methanogenic processes 9 due to their versatility for this reason it was selected for use in this study the inoculation of the reactor was performed by adapting the biomass to a synthetic substrate composed of the nutritional medium and glucose without addition of residual water with surfactants the sludge was previously ground in a blender mixed with the nutrient medium and inserted into the reactor the system was kept in closed circuit for 10 days at a controlled temperature of 30 c with cod averaging 1005 10 mg l 2 3 support material the support material used was sand due to the good results obtained in previous studies 10 12 the biomass was immobilized in 600 g of coarse granulation sand which was previously oven dried at 105 2 c for 24 h the average diameter dm of the grains was 1 18 mm dm 2 0 mm determined by particle size analysis using tyler sieves the sand was then inserted into the reactor for the inoculation and immobilization of biomass prior to inoculation an assay was carried out to verify the possibility of adsorption of the effluent in the support medium and it was confirmed that there was no adsorption of the wwpr by the sand the assay lasted 58 days after which it was verified that the effluent had undergone self degradation 17 05 and that there was no adsorption of the wwpr by the support material the test report is presented in appendix a 2 4 fluidized bed reactor the reactor used was composed of an acrylic cylinder with an external diameter of 51 0 mm internal diameter 48 0 mm and a total length of 106 0 cm giving a useable volume of 1 91 l total volume 2 16 l fig 1 shows the reactor system its dimensions and sampling points recirculation in the reactor was performed with the aid of a centrifuge pump worker 195197 and the feed was made using a gilson miniplus evolution peristaltic pump the feed rate used was 60 ml min the hrt applied was 24 h and the operating temperature was maintained at approximately 33 2 c using a thermal chamber in which the reactor was placed the minimum fluidization condition was determined using a graphical method by means of the minimum fluidization curve 17 this obtained a flow rate of 300 l h for recirculation in the afbr which is equivalent to a degree of mixing of 5000 times allowing good fluidization of the bed and adherence of the sludge to the support medium the test report for the determination of the minimum fluidization is presented in appendix b 2 5 operation and monitoring of the reactor table 3 shows the different operational phases of the afbr and the conditions during its operation the biomass underwent immobilization and adaptation phase i during which glucose was used as a carbon source and which was replaced by the wwpr as the only source of carbon from phase ii onwards from phase ii the reactor was also operated in the presence of the anionic surfactants coming from the wwpr and a progressive increase in the concentration of organic matter and surfactants was introduced the conditions predicted during operation were obtained by diluting the wwpr in nutritional medium which was based on the cod values each condition was maintained until cod removal stabilized in the reactor the next phase was initiated once stability had occurred the afbr was monitored by the physicochemical analysis of cod anionic surfactants ph alkalinity expressed in mg caco3 l and total volatile acids expressed in mg acetic acid hac l these were tested three times a week and in duplicate analyses were performed following the methodologies described by apha 5220 18 jurado et al 19 ripley et al 20 and dilallo albertson 21 respectively the anionic surfactant analyses were only initiated from phase iii of the reactor operation in addition analyses of total solids in the support material were performed with each operational phase change for this biomass sand samples were collected through the samplers of the reactor fig 1 at each phase change of the afbr and total solids were determined in triplicate according to the apha methodology 2540 18 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of organic matter fig 2 shows the organic load rate olr as applied and removed throughout the reactor operating phases high olr removal was noted during phases ii iii and iv of reactor operation during phase ii cod 536 mg l iii cod 1016 mg l and iv cod 2233 mg l a mean olr removal of 0 44 0 04 kg m³d 0 73 0 04 kg m³d of 1 67 0 15 kg m³d was obtained respectively this represented 94 10 7 82 3 and 85 4 of cod removal in that order between phase iv and phase v cod 3012 mg l the average cod removal fell from 85 4 74 6 respectively and by phase vi cod 4565 mg l it had fallen to 64 8 however progressive olr removal was maintained increasing from 1 67 0 15 kg m³d during stage iv to 2 03 0 3 kg m³d during phase v and 2 6 0 4 kg m³ d during phase vi this trend was observed during the entire operation of the reactor using this system the potential for cod removal from wwpr is promising indicating high reactor robustness even when subjected to an olr of more than 4 kg m³d high cod removal efficiencies have been obtained in previous studies 10 12 for this type of reactor but when treating synthetic wastewater containing surfactants the wastewater used in this study wwpr was more complex compared to that in other studies where synthetic waters were used due to the variety of additional compounds present such as alkalizing agents emulsifiers and antifoams oliveira et al 10 evaluated the removal of organic matter and anionic surfactants in afbrs operating with a hrt of 18 h with an applied olr of 0 86 0 06 kg m³d they obtained a mean efficiency of cod removal of approximately 90 3 during 270 days of operation using an anionic surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate las between 8 mg l and 46 mg l braga et al 12 obtained a mean cod removal of 89 equivalent to 0 71 kg cod m³d using the same reactor as that in this study but for a mixture of commercial laundry wastewater and synthetic substrate with sucrose 598 723 mg l of cod and las 3 1 27 9 mg l in hrt of 19 4 h 3 2 removal of anionic surfactants the progressive increase in the volumetric loading of anionic surfactants applied in the reactor did not result in a continuous increase in the surfactant load removed fig 3 as was observed for the removal of cod the removed surfactant load obtained during phase iii with applied load of 0 0042 0 001 kg m³d was 0 0016 0 008 kg m³d 37 14 removal and this increased to 0 00631 0 0012 kg m³d 45 5 removal during phase iv when the applied load was increased to 0 0137 0 002 kg m³d however a reduction in the efficiency of removal of surfactants in phase v and phase vi was observed falling from 20 18 applied surfactant load 0 0267 0 005 kg m³d to 13 20 0 0386 0 002 kg m³d respectively one hypothesis for explaining these results is that the wwpr also contains carbonaceous organic compounds with greater biodegradability than anionic surfactants for example with greater availability of compounds that are more easily assimilated by the bacterial community in the reactor a smaller amount of surfactants is biodegraded this would explain the lower surfactant removal points during conditions of higher cod concentration i e phase v when cod 3013 mg l and phase vi when cod 4565 mg l during these phases an increase in the organic load removed was observed but there was a decrease in the surfactant load removed which was probably inhibited by a greater availability of more easily assimilated substrate okada 9 reached a similar conclusion in their study using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor they evaluated the degradation of anionic surfactants in the presence of different co substrates methanol ethanol and yeast extract at different concentrations with a hrt of 24 h and an anionic surfactant las concentration of 14 2 mg l in the presence of a complex co substrate 50 yeast extract the removal of the surfactant achieved a higher rate that in the presence of short chain alcohols 29 31 methanol and ethanol in addition they observed that greater degradation of the surfactant occurred when a lower co substrate concentration organic load was applied reaching 76 with a specific organic load of 0 03 g cod g tvsd duarte et al 8 also evaluated the degradation of anionic surfactants in a fixed bed horizontal anaerobic reactor with a surfactant las concentration of around 14 mg l only 35 of all surfactants were removed although the organic matter removal remained above 90 an indication of similar behavior to that observed in our study 3 3 ph total alkalinity and total volatile acids table 4 shows the temporal variation in ph total alkalinity and total volatile acids throughout the reactor operation during the entire operation of the reactor affluent and effluent ph were maintained between 7 and 8 5 which is near the range considered optimal for methanogenesis between 6 5 and 8 2 22 in general a drop in influent ph was observed during operation due to the addition of larger volumes of wwpr in nutritional medium to reach the expected cod concentrations however the effluent ph remained in the same range throughout operation of the afbr irrespective of the progressive increase in the concentrations of organic matter and surfactants total alkalinity affluent and effluent remained stable during the reactor operation at the input and at the output this could indicate the possible accumulation of acetate in the system however since only oxidation of acetate by methanogenic archaea produces bicarbonate and given that ph remained stable a more likely explanation for this stability is the presence of phosphates from the detergents present in the wwpr these would have a buffering effect in the system generating partial alkalinity with regards to total volatile acids a considerable increase in the affluent and effluent concentration was observed during the operation of the reactor especially from phase v to phase vi this increase in acid concentration for both affluent and effluent was due to the higher volume of wwpr used in the dilution in nutritional medium in order to reach the expected cod concentrations as discussed in section 2 1 the concentration of tvas in the raw wwpr was high between 734 4 and 1238 4 mg hac l which possibly caused an increase in acid concentration in the tributary and reactor effluent this is supported by the fact that the average reduction of acidity from biodegradation in the reactor remained positive during all the phases of operation in other words the average concentration of total volatile acids at the entrance of the reactor remained above the average concentration at the reactor output motteran et al 23 studied the anaerobic biodegradation of nonionic surfactant linear alcohol ethoxylate lae in an afbr and observed a mean ph for affluent and effluent of 7 2 0 2 and 8 0 0 1 respectively for a feed concentration of 4 7 107 4 mg l however total alkalinity values remained within the range 288 24 mgcaco3 l to 354 33 mgcaco3 l respectively showing similar behavior that observed in this study some stability was observed with output values being slightly higher than those at the input in relation to acids motteran et al 23 observed low production of total volatile acids during the reactor operation 68 7 mg l except for the adaptation phase when these increased 211 4 mg l however it is noted that the effluent used was synthetic but not real as the effluent was used in this study 3 4 biomass growth the growth of biomass immobilized in the support inside the reactor was detected by an increase in the concentration of total volatile solids in the sand during phase ii and phase iii some growth of biomass was observed changing from a concentration of 3590 mgtvs l phase ii to 3720 mg l phase iii in the course of phase iv to phase vi the total volatile solids in the sand increased significantly reaching 4175 5770 and 6630 mgtvs l respectively this confirmed growth good adhesion and adaptation of the biomass to the system 3 5 spatial profiles the mixing behavior of the afbr was verified through the realization of spatial profiles along the height of the reactor once the stability in the output variables was observed at each operational phase change the profile was performed through the collection of aliquots in each of the afbr samplers fig 4 presents the results obtained for the concentration of cod and anionic surfactants along the height of the reactor in each operational phase it is interesting to note graphically the predominant tendency of the perfect mixing condition in afbr except for the input values which were measured prior to their introduction into the reactor a certain proximity to the cod and surfactant concentrations along the afbr height is observed in each profile this characteristic is due to the recirculation current used for fluidization of the sand particles which provided a mixing coefficient of 5000 times thus it can be said that in all the operational phases the afbr presented behavior very close to the perfect mixing 4 conclusion the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr with immobilized biomass in sand was efficient in the removal of organic matter from wwpr even when the concentration of cod and anionic surfactants was progressively increased the afbr configuration allowed the operation with a wide range of organic matter and anionic surfactants concentration allowing the anaerobic process to properly function due to the dilution of the toxic compounds by the high recirculation rate of the fluidized bed however removal of surfactants was inhibited to initial concentrations above 30 mg l therefore further steps to polish the wastewater are clearly needed especially by the high concentration of effluent surfactants it can be said that the results of this study indicate an alternative to the pre treatment of the wwpr and a step can be added for greater removal efficiency of the surfactants an alternative would be the use of adsorption treatment or the use of an aerobic system such as the activated sludge system for the removal of anionic surfactants

14308,this study evaluated the potential of anaerobic treatment of wastewater from washing polyterephthalate ethylene pet bottles sent to recycling wwpr in a fluidized bed reactor the reactor had a total volume of 2 16 l and was fed with the wwpr diluted in a nutritional medium operated with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and maintained at a temperature of 33 2 c coarse sand was used as a support material for the immobilization of biomass in the reactor the potential of the anaerobic system was evaluated as a result of the progressive increase in chemical oxygen demand cod and anionic surfactants both from the wwpr the biomass was subjected to an immobilization and adaptation process over 10 days and after this period concentrations of anionic surfactants were added the maximum cod load removed was 2 6 0 43 kg m³d which represented a removal of 64 8 the maximum surfactant removal was 0 063 0 001 kg m³d for an initial concentration of 15 mg l the fluidized bed reactor was stable and robust in relation to the applied load of organic matter however surfactant removal was inhibited at initial concentrations above 30 mg l keywords wastewater from pet washing fluidized bed anaerobic reactor anionic surfactants sand removal of cod 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater aims to remove possible contaminants present in effluents so that the acceptable levels of concentration of these contaminants are reached according to the current local environmental legislation and in order to avoid health and environmental problems treatment technologies are effective in removing solids organic matter pathogens nutrients and some metals however some substances known as emerging compounds are not so easily treated emerging compounds include pharmaceuticals pesticides antibiotics hormones steroids plasticizers and surfactants 1 due to the emulsifying characteristic of surfactants which results from their long apolar hydrophobic and polar hydrophilic carbon chains this class of compounds can interact with both polar water and apolar dirt substances making them difficult to treat 1 among the surfactants the most used by the industry in general belongs to the anionic surfactants group which includes the main surfactants contained in shampoos soaps and detergents 2 anionic surfactants have an alkyl chain which may have different lengths and an anionic polar group sulfate sulfonates phosphates etc 3 they are moderately soluble in water and organic solvents due to their amphiphilic character are neither volatile nor hydrolyzed by acids or bases 4 they are generally sensitive to hard water and are incompatible with cationic surfactants due to the neutralization of loads 2 in the global context of the search for renewable technologies for production the recycling of polyterephthalate ethylene pet bottles 5 stands out however when the recycling process involves the cleaning of waste from the plastic wastewater is generated according to prado 6 about 15 of the total liquid effluent generated during the life cycle of pet comes from the recycling stage due to the impurities and dirt contained in pet bottles intended for recycling and the addition of cleaners and detergents for their sanitization the wastewater from the cleaning process has a complex composition wastewater from pet bottle washing is harmful to the environment characterized by high concentrations of organic matter and surfactant agents physico chemical treatment that uses coagulants and flocculants is an alternative for the treatment of wastewater from washing pet bottles sent to recycling wwpr however the presence of high concentrations of surfactants makes this type of treatment unattractive since only flocculation coagulation are not sufficient to make the surfactant concentration appropriate to the release into the environment requiring subsequent steps which makes the process expensive buss et al 7 studied the wastewater treatment of an industrial laundry which was also rich in surfactants after analysis of different treatments the results showed that the flocculation and coagulation treatment satisfactorily removed sediment and suspended solids and cod but did not satisfactorily reduce the concentration of surfactants only the treatment in which the processes of flocculation coagulation and adsorption with activated carbon were allied promoted an effluent treated with the levels accepted by the current legislation a promising alternative is the use of anaerobic treatment which has low implantation and operational costs and is accompanied by the production of biogas which can be used as fuel for the generation of energy bioreactors with immobilized biomass in inorganic support or biomass in granules have been proposed for the biodigestion of surfactants due to their robustness in the treatment of effluents rich in toxic compounds or compounds difficult to biodegrade therefore studies using fixed bed reactors 8 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 9 and fluidized bed reactors 10 12 were performed with the purpose of verify the efficiency in the treatment of effluents with high concentrations of surfactants due to the high concentrations of anionic surfactants present in the wwpr the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr stands out as an alternative for its treatment an afbr contains an inorganic support medium for biomass immobilization which promotes maximum contact between the substrate and microorganisms this makes it possible to remove surfactants as well as dilute them by means of a high recirculation rate 13 wide variety of support material has been used for immobilization of biomass such as activated carbon sand clay spheres pellets among others the afbr presents some advantages over the other high rate configurations lower hrts better control of the biofilm thickness which allows good diffusion of the substrate to the deeper layers avoiding the presence of inactive layers besides avoiding preferential flow problems gas retention and clogging which are recurrent problems in fixed bed reactors 14 this study evaluated the performance of anaerobic biodegradation in an afbr for the treatment for wwpr 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and nutritional medium the wwpr was collected at a pet bottle recycling company located in the city of poços de caldas mg brazil before its use the effluent was stored under refrigeration at 5 c each batch of bottles for recycling was washed with a mixture of 3 4 ml l detergent 2 4 ml l caustic soda 0 70 ml l humectant and 1 1 ml l anti foaming agent about 4 m³ of wastewater was generated per ton of bottles in the washing process a basic characterization of the three wastewater samples was previously performed table 1 presents the characterization of the wwpr due to the high concentrations of carbonaceous organic matter and anionic surfactants the wwpr was diluted in nutritional medium the nutritional medium was synthesized according to sancinetti et al 15 adding the wwpr as the main source of carbon the composition of the nutritional medium is presented in table 2 2 2 inoculum the sludge used for reactor inoculation came from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb treating poultry slaughterhouse wastewater avícola dacar the sludge has a total volatile solids tvs concentration of 40 272 mg l this sludge has good microbial diversity and has already been used in several anaerobic processes studies among them sulfetogenic 16 and methanogenic processes 9 due to their versatility for this reason it was selected for use in this study the inoculation of the reactor was performed by adapting the biomass to a synthetic substrate composed of the nutritional medium and glucose without addition of residual water with surfactants the sludge was previously ground in a blender mixed with the nutrient medium and inserted into the reactor the system was kept in closed circuit for 10 days at a controlled temperature of 30 c with cod averaging 1005 10 mg l 2 3 support material the support material used was sand due to the good results obtained in previous studies 10 12 the biomass was immobilized in 600 g of coarse granulation sand which was previously oven dried at 105 2 c for 24 h the average diameter dm of the grains was 1 18 mm dm 2 0 mm determined by particle size analysis using tyler sieves the sand was then inserted into the reactor for the inoculation and immobilization of biomass prior to inoculation an assay was carried out to verify the possibility of adsorption of the effluent in the support medium and it was confirmed that there was no adsorption of the wwpr by the sand the assay lasted 58 days after which it was verified that the effluent had undergone self degradation 17 05 and that there was no adsorption of the wwpr by the support material the test report is presented in appendix a 2 4 fluidized bed reactor the reactor used was composed of an acrylic cylinder with an external diameter of 51 0 mm internal diameter 48 0 mm and a total length of 106 0 cm giving a useable volume of 1 91 l total volume 2 16 l fig 1 shows the reactor system its dimensions and sampling points recirculation in the reactor was performed with the aid of a centrifuge pump worker 195197 and the feed was made using a gilson miniplus evolution peristaltic pump the feed rate used was 60 ml min the hrt applied was 24 h and the operating temperature was maintained at approximately 33 2 c using a thermal chamber in which the reactor was placed the minimum fluidization condition was determined using a graphical method by means of the minimum fluidization curve 17 this obtained a flow rate of 300 l h for recirculation in the afbr which is equivalent to a degree of mixing of 5000 times allowing good fluidization of the bed and adherence of the sludge to the support medium the test report for the determination of the minimum fluidization is presented in appendix b 2 5 operation and monitoring of the reactor table 3 shows the different operational phases of the afbr and the conditions during its operation the biomass underwent immobilization and adaptation phase i during which glucose was used as a carbon source and which was replaced by the wwpr as the only source of carbon from phase ii onwards from phase ii the reactor was also operated in the presence of the anionic surfactants coming from the wwpr and a progressive increase in the concentration of organic matter and surfactants was introduced the conditions predicted during operation were obtained by diluting the wwpr in nutritional medium which was based on the cod values each condition was maintained until cod removal stabilized in the reactor the next phase was initiated once stability had occurred the afbr was monitored by the physicochemical analysis of cod anionic surfactants ph alkalinity expressed in mg caco3 l and total volatile acids expressed in mg acetic acid hac l these were tested three times a week and in duplicate analyses were performed following the methodologies described by apha 5220 18 jurado et al 19 ripley et al 20 and dilallo albertson 21 respectively the anionic surfactant analyses were only initiated from phase iii of the reactor operation in addition analyses of total solids in the support material were performed with each operational phase change for this biomass sand samples were collected through the samplers of the reactor fig 1 at each phase change of the afbr and total solids were determined in triplicate according to the apha methodology 2540 18 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of organic matter fig 2 shows the organic load rate olr as applied and removed throughout the reactor operating phases high olr removal was noted during phases ii iii and iv of reactor operation during phase ii cod 536 mg l iii cod 1016 mg l and iv cod 2233 mg l a mean olr removal of 0 44 0 04 kg m³d 0 73 0 04 kg m³d of 1 67 0 15 kg m³d was obtained respectively this represented 94 10 7 82 3 and 85 4 of cod removal in that order between phase iv and phase v cod 3012 mg l the average cod removal fell from 85 4 74 6 respectively and by phase vi cod 4565 mg l it had fallen to 64 8 however progressive olr removal was maintained increasing from 1 67 0 15 kg m³d during stage iv to 2 03 0 3 kg m³d during phase v and 2 6 0 4 kg m³ d during phase vi this trend was observed during the entire operation of the reactor using this system the potential for cod removal from wwpr is promising indicating high reactor robustness even when subjected to an olr of more than 4 kg m³d high cod removal efficiencies have been obtained in previous studies 10 12 for this type of reactor but when treating synthetic wastewater containing surfactants the wastewater used in this study wwpr was more complex compared to that in other studies where synthetic waters were used due to the variety of additional compounds present such as alkalizing agents emulsifiers and antifoams oliveira et al 10 evaluated the removal of organic matter and anionic surfactants in afbrs operating with a hrt of 18 h with an applied olr of 0 86 0 06 kg m³d they obtained a mean efficiency of cod removal of approximately 90 3 during 270 days of operation using an anionic surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate las between 8 mg l and 46 mg l braga et al 12 obtained a mean cod removal of 89 equivalent to 0 71 kg cod m³d using the same reactor as that in this study but for a mixture of commercial laundry wastewater and synthetic substrate with sucrose 598 723 mg l of cod and las 3 1 27 9 mg l in hrt of 19 4 h 3 2 removal of anionic surfactants the progressive increase in the volumetric loading of anionic surfactants applied in the reactor did not result in a continuous increase in the surfactant load removed fig 3 as was observed for the removal of cod the removed surfactant load obtained during phase iii with applied load of 0 0042 0 001 kg m³d was 0 0016 0 008 kg m³d 37 14 removal and this increased to 0 00631 0 0012 kg m³d 45 5 removal during phase iv when the applied load was increased to 0 0137 0 002 kg m³d however a reduction in the efficiency of removal of surfactants in phase v and phase vi was observed falling from 20 18 applied surfactant load 0 0267 0 005 kg m³d to 13 20 0 0386 0 002 kg m³d respectively one hypothesis for explaining these results is that the wwpr also contains carbonaceous organic compounds with greater biodegradability than anionic surfactants for example with greater availability of compounds that are more easily assimilated by the bacterial community in the reactor a smaller amount of surfactants is biodegraded this would explain the lower surfactant removal points during conditions of higher cod concentration i e phase v when cod 3013 mg l and phase vi when cod 4565 mg l during these phases an increase in the organic load removed was observed but there was a decrease in the surfactant load removed which was probably inhibited by a greater availability of more easily assimilated substrate okada 9 reached a similar conclusion in their study using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor they evaluated the degradation of anionic surfactants in the presence of different co substrates methanol ethanol and yeast extract at different concentrations with a hrt of 24 h and an anionic surfactant las concentration of 14 2 mg l in the presence of a complex co substrate 50 yeast extract the removal of the surfactant achieved a higher rate that in the presence of short chain alcohols 29 31 methanol and ethanol in addition they observed that greater degradation of the surfactant occurred when a lower co substrate concentration organic load was applied reaching 76 with a specific organic load of 0 03 g cod g tvsd duarte et al 8 also evaluated the degradation of anionic surfactants in a fixed bed horizontal anaerobic reactor with a surfactant las concentration of around 14 mg l only 35 of all surfactants were removed although the organic matter removal remained above 90 an indication of similar behavior to that observed in our study 3 3 ph total alkalinity and total volatile acids table 4 shows the temporal variation in ph total alkalinity and total volatile acids throughout the reactor operation during the entire operation of the reactor affluent and effluent ph were maintained between 7 and 8 5 which is near the range considered optimal for methanogenesis between 6 5 and 8 2 22 in general a drop in influent ph was observed during operation due to the addition of larger volumes of wwpr in nutritional medium to reach the expected cod concentrations however the effluent ph remained in the same range throughout operation of the afbr irrespective of the progressive increase in the concentrations of organic matter and surfactants total alkalinity affluent and effluent remained stable during the reactor operation at the input and at the output this could indicate the possible accumulation of acetate in the system however since only oxidation of acetate by methanogenic archaea produces bicarbonate and given that ph remained stable a more likely explanation for this stability is the presence of phosphates from the detergents present in the wwpr these would have a buffering effect in the system generating partial alkalinity with regards to total volatile acids a considerable increase in the affluent and effluent concentration was observed during the operation of the reactor especially from phase v to phase vi this increase in acid concentration for both affluent and effluent was due to the higher volume of wwpr used in the dilution in nutritional medium in order to reach the expected cod concentrations as discussed in section 2 1 the concentration of tvas in the raw wwpr was high between 734 4 and 1238 4 mg hac l which possibly caused an increase in acid concentration in the tributary and reactor effluent this is supported by the fact that the average reduction of acidity from biodegradation in the reactor remained positive during all the phases of operation in other words the average concentration of total volatile acids at the entrance of the reactor remained above the average concentration at the reactor output motteran et al 23 studied the anaerobic biodegradation of nonionic surfactant linear alcohol ethoxylate lae in an afbr and observed a mean ph for affluent and effluent of 7 2 0 2 and 8 0 0 1 respectively for a feed concentration of 4 7 107 4 mg l however total alkalinity values remained within the range 288 24 mgcaco3 l to 354 33 mgcaco3 l respectively showing similar behavior that observed in this study some stability was observed with output values being slightly higher than those at the input in relation to acids motteran et al 23 observed low production of total volatile acids during the reactor operation 68 7 mg l except for the adaptation phase when these increased 211 4 mg l however it is noted that the effluent used was synthetic but not real as the effluent was used in this study 3 4 biomass growth the growth of biomass immobilized in the support inside the reactor was detected by an increase in the concentration of total volatile solids in the sand during phase ii and phase iii some growth of biomass was observed changing from a concentration of 3590 mgtvs l phase ii to 3720 mg l phase iii in the course of phase iv to phase vi the total volatile solids in the sand increased significantly reaching 4175 5770 and 6630 mgtvs l respectively this confirmed growth good adhesion and adaptation of the biomass to the system 3 5 spatial profiles the mixing behavior of the afbr was verified through the realization of spatial profiles along the height of the reactor once the stability in the output variables was observed at each operational phase change the profile was performed through the collection of aliquots in each of the afbr samplers fig 4 presents the results obtained for the concentration of cod and anionic surfactants along the height of the reactor in each operational phase it is interesting to note graphically the predominant tendency of the perfect mixing condition in afbr except for the input values which were measured prior to their introduction into the reactor a certain proximity to the cod and surfactant concentrations along the afbr height is observed in each profile this characteristic is due to the recirculation current used for fluidization of the sand particles which provided a mixing coefficient of 5000 times thus it can be said that in all the operational phases the afbr presented behavior very close to the perfect mixing 4 conclusion the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr with immobilized biomass in sand was efficient in the removal of organic matter from wwpr even when the concentration of cod and anionic surfactants was progressively increased the afbr configuration allowed the operation with a wide range of organic matter and anionic surfactants concentration allowing the anaerobic process to properly function due to the dilution of the toxic compounds by the high recirculation rate of the fluidized bed however removal of surfactants was inhibited to initial concentrations above 30 mg l therefore further steps to polish the wastewater are clearly needed especially by the high concentration of effluent surfactants it can be said that the results of this study indicate an alternative to the pre treatment of the wwpr and a step can be added for greater removal efficiency of the surfactants an alternative would be the use of adsorption treatment or the use of an aerobic system such as the activated sludge system for the removal of anionic surfactants

14309,the microelectronics industry produces significant amounts of wastewaters containing inorganic substances such as fluorides phosphates and organic pollutants such as acetic acid ch3cooh and tetramethylammonium hydroxide c4h13no tmah the objective of this manuscript is the description of the depuration process of three types of wastewaters representative of real liquid wastes coming from a multinational company of semiconductor production the first residual liquid flow ww1 contained tmah the second one ww2 contained fluorides and phosphates while the last ww3 was rich in nitrates fluorides and acetic acid aerobic treatment of ww1 was investigated by using a lab scale reactor inoculated with an activated sludge coming from the company municipal wastewater treatment plant another residual industrial effluent photoresist was added together with several micronutrients to guarantee a good carbon nitrogen ratio and a nutrient supply for bacterial growth the results showed that after one day of acclimation the microorganisms started to remove tmah and 99 of degradation was reached in seven days for ww2 and ww3 a pollutant removal of 99 was obtained by chemical precipitation with lime an attempt was made to implement the research progress made on the laboratory developed process at the pilot and industrial scale to this end a simulation of the combined process was performed by using a specific software superpro designer the process analysis showed that the treated liquids containing tmah not degraded to trace levels and other residual substances can be sent to the biological wwtp of the company for further treatment after that the treated water can be reused and or discharged to surface waters keywords electronics industry industrial wastewaters tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide process analysis reducing industrial water consumption 1 introduction in the electronics industry the production of semiconductors is a process that involves several steps with the usage of large quantities of ultra pure water consequently a significant amount of polluted process water is produced that must be treated to remove impurities before discharging or re using it for the production cycles 1 these residual solutions contain inorganic compounds e g hf hno3 h2so4 h3po4 nh4oh and others transition metals and metalloids e g cu co fe si and others 2 organic contaminants as acetic acid ch3cooh and tetramethylammonium hydroxide c4h13no tmah the first two groups of pollutants can be successfully removed by traditional chemical processes usually adopted for the treatment of semiconductor industry sewage 3 whereas the organic pollutants are only partially degraded by the conventional depuration treatments the effluents with a high fluoride content can usually be treated with different calcium salts cacl2 ca no3 2 4h2o and hydrated lime ca oh 2 to precipitate fluoride caf2 thus removing fluoride ions from solutions 4 5 fluorides like phosphates can also be removed from wastewaters by means of several techniques which include besides precipitation membrane processes 6 8 selective separation 9 fluidization 10 and adsorption 11 gouider et al 12 report their studies about the removal of phosphates and fluorides by adding lime to synthetic fertilizer plant effluents the experimental results were used to define a two step treatment process to remove pollutants by adjusting the precipitation ph the proposed process allowed the separate recovery of fluoride and phosphate ions under their insoluble calcium based salts calcium fluoride and calcium phosphate based by products can be used as raw materials in several industrial sectors such as ceramic and phosphate fertilizer industries the main drawback of the precipitation process is the formation of a huge quantity of sludge which is difficult to treat for the extraction of valuable components 13 14 it means that wastewater treatment should be optimized case by case basis depending on the pollutant in order to minimize the amounts of reagents and mostly of residual wastes to be disposed with regards to organic pollutants microelectronic wastewaters can contain compounds such as acetic acid and tetramethylammonium hydroxide the two molecules cause severe skin burns and eye damage in addition tmah is corrosive lethal if ingested slow to biodegrade and eutrophic to aquatic environments 15 therefore these substances with particular reference to tmah must be necessarily removed from wastewaters to avoid environmental and human health problems various methods used to remove acetic acid include adsorption ion exchange evaporation precipitation and membrane techniques 16 due to recent progress in the specific and relevant legislation the scientific community is now approaching the problem of tmah removal to avoid the dispersion of this substance if the tmah containing wastewaters are not properly treated before disposal the proposed treatments include chemical physical processes and biological processes lei et al 17 studied biological treatments to treat residual solutions containing tmah and other compounds dimethyl sulfoxide and mono ethanolamine the experiments were performed in aerobic and anaerobic conditions in both cases tmah degradation was possible but in anaerobic conditions some inhibitory effects were recorded with high concentrations of this salt on the contrary during the aerobic process nox substances were produced asawaka et al 18 and chang et al 19 conducted anaerobic treatments to remove tmah from wastewaters the degradation yields were about 95 and the processes produced a gas flow containing methane and carbon dioxide tmah could be removed from solutions by using chemical oxidation 20 in this case a poisonous gas containing nitrogen oxides could be produced and a conversion process should be added to decompose these oxides into nitrogen water and carbon dioxide 21 den et al 22 studied a combined treatment of photochemical oxidation with biological processes to degrade tmah from electronic wastewater obtaining a reduction of tmah about 97 other studies showed that tmah effluents could be treated by absorption onto activated carbon 23 zeolites 24 and silicate materials 25 and by membrane processes micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf 26 as for this last process already tested in several fields 27 30 it has the advantage of allowing a considerable saving of process water that after a suitable treatment can be reused in a closed loop 31 32 in this paper a single combined process to treat three types of real wastewater produced by a microelectronic industry is proposed one stream contains tmah the second one contains fluorides and phosphates while the last is rich in nitrates fluorides and acetic acid the treatments have been studied at the laboratory scale to define the optimal operating conditions for wastewater treatments for this reason a process analysis of the three treatment lines by using a process simulator superpro designer has been carried out to verify the results obtained during laboratory tests in view of the implementation of an industrial wastewater treatment plant wwtp for the combined depuration of several wastewaters from microelectronic industry through a scale up prior to pilot and then to industrial scale such a combined process offers advantages in terms of plant efficiency and is presented here for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewaters characterization three types of wastewaters produced inside the lfoundry srl plant located in avezzano l aquila italy have been used for the experiments ww1 is a residual liquid flow containing tmah ww2 is a residual liquid stream containing fluorides and phosphates ww3 is a residual liquid waste rich in nitrates fluorides and acetic acid as described in the next sections it was chosen to treat ww1 by using a biological process while ww2 and ww3 were treated by using physical chemical processes 2 2 wastewaters treatment procedure 2 2 1 biological process ww1 treatment the experiments have been carried out by using a biological reactor with a useful volume of 5 l model biostat b equipped with an oximeter thermometer and stirring system the biological oxidation of tmah stream ww1 was studied by inoculating activated sludge coming from the urban wastewater treatment plant of lfoundry company ww1 had an average concentration of tmah equal to 1800 mg l with a maximum concentration near to 2500 mg l and an initial ph 12 see also table 6 a culture medium having the following composition 0 82 g l nahco3 0 51 g l mgso4 0 23 g l na2moo4 0 21 g l k2hpo4 0 13 g l cucl2 0 1 g l fecl3 and 0 01 g l yeast extract was prepared to feed the reactor the carbon amount in the feeding was increased to balance the carbon nitrogen ratio up to 20 1 by adding another industrial wastewater named photoresist pr provided by lfoundry srl pr is a mixture of organic substances with a high total organic toc value 615 mg l it was added as a substrate to increase the amount of carbon source necessary for micro organisms growth the feeding for the bioreactor was obtained by mixing 1 5 l of tmah wastewater 12 ml of photoresist 1 2 l of growing medium and 0 3 l of inoculum before use the ww1 was neutralized to ph 7 by sulphuric acid 98 wt fluka the experiments have been performed at 25 c under 70 rpm stirring at an air flux of 2 l min with a maximum residence time of 13 days each day 100 ml of solution was sampled with a peristaltic pump centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was analysed to measure ph tmah and ammonium concentration organic pollutant load cod and total suspended solids tss biomass enrichment was obtained through a series of four consecutive batches in which one litre of sludge was kept in the reactor and fed with fresh medium as follows batch 1 the reactor was filled with 2 7 l of feeding solution tmah photoresist and culture medium and 0 3 l of inoculum subsequent batches at the beginning of each batch 1 l of active sludge coming from the previous cycle was kept in the bioreactor and fed 2 l of feeding solution 2 2 2 chemical physical processes ww2 and ww3 treatment hydrated lime calcium hydroxide carlo erba 98 wt and aluminum sulfate sigma aldrich hydrate 98 wt were used for the precipitation tests aluminum sulfate was used for the treatment of only ww2 during the experiments a suspension of lime 20 wt v was gradually added under constant stirring until reaching the desired ph value the mixture was stirred further for 2 h to ensure precipitation equilibrium precipitation tests were performed in a ph range of 1 4 12 at room temperature 25 2 c 12 the final ph was then measured and the precipitate was separated from the slurry by centrifugation and then dried at 105 c overnight for each considered ph the obtained filtrate was analyzed for determining the residual composition 2 3 analytical methods ph meter hanna instruments h 1254 was used to measure ph values of the solutions tmah concentration was analyzed by dx500 dionex column thermofisher cs17 ammonium fluoride nitrate and cod were measured with dr lange s kit cuvette test lck 303 lck 323 lck 339 and lck 514 respectively the total suspended solids were quantified by centrifugation the samples after that the solid residue was dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighted xrf spectrophotometer spectro xepos 2000 and atomic spectroscopy agilent synchronous vertical dual view 5100 icp oes were used to perform the chemical analyses of wastewater and of solid residue after treatment all quantitative analyses were run in triplicate for reproducibility of data and the results reported in the figures and tables were the average ones 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological process fig 1 presents the results of the first batch it is possible to observe that the first days were an adaptation period for the microorganisms tmah concentration remained constant for the first 24 h and after that decreased at the same time the ammonium level nh4 increased showing that this compound was the product of bio reaction the comparison between the two trends showed that the microorganisms were able to degrade tmah after 12 days 288 h tmah concentration was 0 4 mg l with 99 95 of degradation yield regarding nitrates data not reported in fig 1 the concentration was low and never exceeded 5 mg l for the entire batch this excluded the start of the nitrification process cod also shown in fig 1 decreased over time which is the sign of a good aerobic process after 288 h the degradation yield for cod was about 80 similar trends not reported here were obtained for the other three treatments in particular the results of the batches showed that the average tmah and cod degradation yields were near to 99 1 and 80 5 respectively the average concentration of ammonium was 109 mg l 9 mg l while the nitrate concentration was 2 20 mg l 0 1 mg l regarding tss the analysis showed an average concentration of 1 47 g l 0 1 g l the minimum value of tss 1 29 g l was recorded in the last batch probably the ageing process for the community started this hypothesis was also supported by the level of tmah and ammonium in the last batch in fact the degradation yields for tmah were 77 for 288 h of treatment and the ammonium concentration was around 70 mg l lower than the concentration obtained during the previous steps in the last two cycles the same degradation yields and nh4 concentrations had been achieved after 500 h of residence time the experimental data were used to define the stoichiometry of bacterial growth with tmah dissolved as ions c4h12n and photoresist c4h10o2 used as substrates the generic bacterial growth aerobic reaction is showed by the following eq 1 1 substrate oxygen biomass products in this case 2 c4h12n a c4h10o2 b o2 c ch1 7o0 45n0 2 d co2 e nh3 f h2o where the composition of aerobic biomass was derived by scientific literature 33 where a b c d e f were generic coefficients to define such coefficients it was necessary to solve the mass balances for each element c h o n the system consisted of 4 equations and 6 unknowns so it was necessary to define two other parameters by experimental data yx s that is the cell mass produced per mass of substrate consumed and the amount of nitrogen of the biomass these experimental values were yx s 0 34 gs gx grams of consumed substrate grams of produced bacteria and 21 85 of total nitrogen provided by tmah for bacterial growth the remaining nitrogen was consumed by biomass and transformed into ammonia solving the systems of equations the coefficients were found as shown in eq 3 3 c4h12n 4 c4h10o2 26 413 o2 1 75 ch1 7o0 45n0 2 18 25 co2 0 65 nh3

described by eqs 4 6 with the following initial conditions for t 0 x x0 s s0 and p p0 the system can be solved by introducing the kinetic equations by monod eq 7 pirt eq 8 and luedeking piret eq 9 34

and phosphate precipitation was examined in a series of experiments at a fixed initial wastewater sample ww2 while varying the ph in the range 8 7 12 0 aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 x18h2o was used as a coagulant in order to enhance the separation with calcium hydroxide slurry as the original wastewater was characterized by a high ph value the coagulant was added before calcium hydroxide addition the main chemical reactions describing the precipitation process are the following eqs 10 13 10 al2 so4 3 3 ca oh 2 3 ca so4 2 al oh 3 11 hno3 ca oh 2 ca no3 2 2 h2o 12 nh4f ca oh 2 caf2 2 nh4oh 13 h3po4 3 ca oh 2 ca3 po4 2 6h2o table 1 shows the results of the precipitation tests it was found that lime as a precipitating agent was effective for fluorides and phosphate removal along with an increase in the ph value from 8 7 up to 11 4 the removal efficiency of f and po4 3 ions increased up to 99 9 and 100 respectively whereas the total degree of precipitation of f reached a maximum at ph 11 5 99 9 with increasing ph up to 12 the levelof fluoride removal diminished table 1 the optimum dosage of aluminum sulfate was 40 g l in this case the final f concentration in the solution was 2 mg l against an initial concentration of 20 100 mg l and the volume of sediment was 5 times lower with good separation parameters fluoride and phosphate concentrations were below the limits for sewage effluents italian legislative decree n 152 06 35 the composition of sediments after precipitation with ca oh 2 at different ph levels are given in table 2 no other elements were detected at concentrations greater than 0 01 wt the optimal experimental conditions were used to outline the flow chart and the relative mass balance for ww2 treatment fig 2 the process consists of a precipitation step with aluminum sulfate and calcium hydroxide at 25 c for 2 h followed by suspension filtration to separate the precipitate and liquid the solid can be dried and then disposed of while the treated water could be sent to the biological treatment according to the mass balance lime consumption 20 wt v solution and aluminum sulfate hydrate consumption to treat 1 m3 of ww2 are 364 kg m3 and 40 kg m3 respectively 3 2 2 ww3 the effect of ph on fluoride precipitation was examined in a series of experiments at a fixed initial wastewater ww3 while changing the ph in the range 1 4 11 8 the main chemical reactions are described by eqs 14 16 14 hno3 ca oh 2 ca no3 2 2 h2o 15 hf ca oh 2 caf2 2 h2o 16 ch3cooh ca oh 2 ca ch3coo 2 2h2o the effect of the ph on fluoride precipitation and characteristics of the wastewater is illustrated in the following table 3 it was found that lime as a precipitating agent was effective for fluorides along with an increase in the ph value from 1 4 to 4 7 the removal efficiency of f ions increased up to 99 9 whereas the total degree of precipitation of f reached a maximum at ph 4 4 99 9 with further increasing ph up to 9 9 the effect of fluoride removal decreased as can be seen the best value for fluoride removal is ph 4 4 4 7 ca oh 2 dosage 80 g l in this case f concentration in the solution after treatment will be 11 5 mg l initial concentration in wastewater was 16 861 mg l at this ph value acetic acid was not involved in reaction a further increase of ph from 4 4 up to 6 4 did not improve f removal but resulted in an increased calcium consumption up to 100 g l the optimal ph for fluoride removal is 4 4 ca oh 2 dosage 80 g l the compositions of sediment after precipitation with ca oh 2 at different ph values are given in table 4 no other elements were detected at concentrations greater than 0 01 wt the main finding of these experiments is that the use of ca oh 2 as a precipitating reagent with ph varying in the range 4 4 4 7 gives the possibility of a further wastewater biological treatment this is because of the conversion into non hazardous fluorides of the 99 9 formerly hazardous soluble fluorides nitrate and acetic acid remaining in the wastewater can be considered as a nutrient medium for bacteria in the subsequent biological wastewater treatment the optimal experimental conditions were used to sketch the flow chart and the relative mass balance of the ww3 treatment fig 3 the process includes a precipitation step with calcium hydroxide at 25 c for 2 h then the suspension filtration to separate the precipitate and liquid the solid can be dried and subsequently disposed of while the treated water can be sent for biological treatment according to the mass balance for 1 m3 of ww3 lime consumption 20 wt v solution is equal to 579 5 kg m3 4 process analysis 4 1 process description the results of the experimental tests were used to define three lines of treatment that were simulated by using superpro designer 36 a simple description of the process is reported below and shown in fig 4 in the first line of treatment the wastewater ww1 is sent to a neutralization reactor n101 and then into three biological reactors placed in series r101 r012 and r103 see fig 4a in n101 the solution ph is adjusted up to 7 and afterwards tmah effluent is fed in the bio reactors where it is degraded by microorganisms the suspension outflowing from the last bio reactor r103 is sent to a storage tank tk203 before being fed to a biological section of a wastewater treatment plant in the real plant of lfoundry company a wwtp biological plant already exists and treats at the moment the domestic wastewaters produced by the company the second line of treatment for ww2 see fig 4b includes a process with lime in the presence of a coagulant aluminum sulfate to remove nitrates and phosphates the time of reaction is equal to 2 h after this time the suspension is filtered using a filtration system filter press fp201 and two outputs are recovered the residual solid that needs to be disposed and the liquid that is sent to a storage tank tk202 before reaching the biological section of the existing plant the third line of the treatment for ww3 see fig 4c includes a process with lime to remove nitric hydrofluoric and acetic acid from the wastewater the time of reaction is equal to 2 h after this time the suspension is filtered using a filtration system filter press fp201 and two outputs are recovered the residual solid that needs to be disposed and the liquid that is sent to a storage tank tk202 before reaching the biological section of the existing plant 4 2 process simulation by using superpro designer for the simulation the pilot plant capacity has been assumed to be 33 times smaller than the future industrial plant for wastewater treatments that the company intends to build in the future as already seen the flowsheet shown in fig 4 consists of three parts the treatment of the ww1 works in continuous operation whilst the treatments of the ww2 and ww3 are batch operations the pilot plant is designed to treat 25 l h of ww1 and 180 l batch for ww2 and ww3 considering the small amounts of the lines the treatment of ww2 is performed every three days whilst the treatment of ww3 is performed every eleven days these streams are stored in two tanks tk205 and tk206 the pilot plant has an air intake for the suction of the volatiles odours and various impurities from all equipment of the system the air pollution is sent to a scrubber sc301 for the removal of the impurities the volume of the biological reactors was calculated using the experimental values μmax ks and yx s obtained from data analysis see section 3 1 the volume of a single reactor to perform the biological reaction had a volume equal to 10 m3 v f μ and a residence time of 405 h according to a process specification in order to reduce the equipment size the volume of the bioreactors should be about 1 m3 a single equipment of 1 m3 did not ensure the performance of the process in fact it reached only 41 of tmah degradation therefore three reactors in series each having a useful capacity of 1 m3 have been provided which could guarantee 99 of tmah degradation 34 the residence time for each reactor was around 40 h moreover the biological reactors are jacketed to control the temperature table 5 summarizes the main individual operations of the process the details of the three lines of treatment are reported in the following 4 2 1 ww1 treatment line the section of the line treatment ww1 includes the following main equipment neutralization reactor n101 three bio reactors r101 102 103 the equipment of this section work in continuous mode the input of the section has the composition reported in table 6 this solution is sent to neutralization n101 in which sulfuric acid is added to adjust the ph value to 7 the reaction of neutralization time is set to 1 h the amount of sulfuric acid solution 50 wt to add is 0 1 kg h during this step the micronutrients are added 0 05 kg l for bacteria growth the solution after neutralization is sent to the biological section including three reactors in series the reactions occurring in this step are described by eqs 3 9 according to the experimental data the yields for the biological reaction are 52 75 and 83 for the first second and third reactions that occurred in the r101 r102 and r103 respectively the air supply stream is calculated from the software setting the rate equal to 0 5 vvm volume of air per volume of liquid and per minute the amount of air for every bio reactor is 31 5 m3 table 7 shows the composition of the wastewater f5 output from the third bio reactor 4 2 2 ww2 treatment line the section of ww2 treatment line includes the following main equipment reactor 104 filtration system fp201 the simulation is performed considering that all the equipment of this section works in a batch mode and considering that three days are necessary to reach the total desired volume of 180 l the input of the section is reported in table 8 in the r104 the reactions that occurred are described by eqs 10 13 the yields are higher than 99 for all reactions lime solution 20 wt v is added in the reactor 364 kg of lime solution m3 of wastewater in the presence of a coagulant 19 5 kg m3 of wastewater after 2 h of reaction the suspension is sent to the filtration system simulated as a filter press fp201 the filter press works under the following conditions 90 of removal for calcium sulfate 80 of calcium hydroxide and 100 of removal of calcium fluoride calcium phosphate aluminum hydroxide other data are filtrate flux equal to 120 l m2 h with 45 of humidity tables 9 and 10 report the compositions of the cake and the filtrate finally the filtrate is sent to storage tank tk202 and afterwards to the biological section of the existing plant 4 2 3 ww3 treatment line the section of the line treatment ww3 includes the following main equipment reactor 104 filtration system fp201 the simulation is performed hypothesizing that the equipment of this section works in batch mode and considering that eleven days are necessary to reach the desired volume of 180 l the input of the section is shown in table 11 in the reactor r104 the reactions that occurred are described by eqs 14 16 the reaction yields for the first two reactions are higher than 99 lime solution 20 wt v is added in the reactor to reach a ph 4 4 4 7 579 5 kg of lime solution m3 of wastewater in these conditions according to experimental data the last reaction did not occur and therefore the reaction yield of acetic acid degradation is zero after 2 h of reaction the suspension is sent to the filtration system simulated as a filter press fp201 the filter press works under the following conditions 80 of removal for calcium hydroxide 100 of removal of calcium fluoride other data are filtrate flux equal to 120 l m2 h with 45 of humidity tables 12 and 13 report the compositions of the cake and the filtrate the filtrate is sent to storage tank tk202 and afterwards to the biological section of the existing plant as an alternative the liquid containing acetic acid could be sent to the neutralization reactor n101 and afterwards fed to the three reactors in series r101 r102 r103 in this case the acetic acid replaces the sulfuric acid table 14 reports the recipe and gantt chart of single batch for lines ww2 and ww3 5 conclusions this manuscript reports the research performed on the treatment of three different real wastewaters produced by a multinational microelectronics company lfoundry srl these polluted streams contained fluorides nitrates acetic acid and tmah the experiments performed at laboratory scale showed that precipitation operations with lime guaranteed an anion removal of 99 while tmah could be removed by an aerobic biological treatment the kinetic data of bacterial growth were obtained on the basis of experimental results and were used to design a possible plant configuration a process analysis was performed in order to evaluate the technical feasibility with a view to the scale up of the combined process the results showed that with an opportune sequence of continuous and batch processes it is possible to treat in a combined way several industrial effluents simultaneously and directly in situ by using the local bacterial community since the microorganisms easily adapted to the new environment and to the perturbations caused by the presence of the complex tmah molecules the results obtained in this paper could open up new and definitive prospectives in the treatment of electronic industry wastewaters this is timely because due to recent progress in the specific legislation fixing the discharge

14309,the microelectronics industry produces significant amounts of wastewaters containing inorganic substances such as fluorides phosphates and organic pollutants such as acetic acid ch3cooh and tetramethylammonium hydroxide c4h13no tmah the objective of this manuscript is the description of the depuration process of three types of wastewaters representative of real liquid wastes coming from a multinational company of semiconductor production the first residual liquid flow ww1 contained tmah the second one ww2 contained fluorides and phosphates while the last ww3 was rich in nitrates fluorides and acetic acid aerobic treatment of ww1 was investigated by using a lab scale reactor inoculated with an activated sludge coming from the company municipal wastewater treatment plant another residual industrial effluent photoresist was added together with several micronutrients to guarantee a good carbon nitrogen ratio and a nutrient supply for bacterial growth the results showed that after one day of acclimation the microorganisms started to remove tmah and 99 of degradation was reached in seven days for ww2 and ww3 a pollutant removal of 99 was obtained by chemical precipitation with lime an attempt was made to implement the research progress made on the laboratory developed process at the pilot and industrial scale to this end a simulation of the combined process was performed by using a specific software superpro designer the process analysis showed that the treated liquids containing tmah not degraded to trace levels and other residual substances can be sent to the biological wwtp of the company for further treatment after that the treated water can be reused and or discharged to surface waters keywords electronics industry industrial wastewaters tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide process analysis reducing industrial water consumption 1 introduction in the electronics industry the production of semiconductors is a process that involves several steps with the usage of large quantities of ultra pure water consequently a significant amount of polluted process water is produced that must be treated to remove impurities before discharging or re using it for the production cycles 1 these residual solutions contain inorganic compounds e g hf hno3 h2so4 h3po4 nh4oh and others transition metals and metalloids e g cu co fe si and others 2 organic contaminants as acetic acid ch3cooh and tetramethylammonium hydroxide c4h13no tmah the first two groups of pollutants can be successfully removed by traditional chemical processes usually adopted for the treatment of semiconductor industry sewage 3 whereas the organic pollutants are only partially degraded by the conventional depuration treatments the effluents with a high fluoride content can usually be treated with different calcium salts cacl2 ca no3 2 4h2o and hydrated lime ca oh 2 to precipitate fluoride caf2 thus removing fluoride ions from solutions 4 5 fluorides like phosphates can also be removed from wastewaters by means of several techniques which include besides precipitation membrane processes 6 8 selective separation 9 fluidization 10 and adsorption 11 gouider et al 12 report their studies about the removal of phosphates and fluorides by adding lime to synthetic fertilizer plant effluents the experimental results were used to define a two step treatment process to remove pollutants by adjusting the precipitation ph the proposed process allowed the separate recovery of fluoride and phosphate ions under their insoluble calcium based salts calcium fluoride and calcium phosphate based by products can be used as raw materials in several industrial sectors such as ceramic and phosphate fertilizer industries the main drawback of the precipitation process is the formation of a huge quantity of sludge which is difficult to treat for the extraction of valuable components 13 14 it means that wastewater treatment should be optimized case by case basis depending on the pollutant in order to minimize the amounts of reagents and mostly of residual wastes to be disposed with regards to organic pollutants microelectronic wastewaters can contain compounds such as acetic acid and tetramethylammonium hydroxide the two molecules cause severe skin burns and eye damage in addition tmah is corrosive lethal if ingested slow to biodegrade and eutrophic to aquatic environments 15 therefore these substances with particular reference to tmah must be necessarily removed from wastewaters to avoid environmental and human health problems various methods used to remove acetic acid include adsorption ion exchange evaporation precipitation and membrane techniques 16 due to recent progress in the specific and relevant legislation the scientific community is now approaching the problem of tmah removal to avoid the dispersion of this substance if the tmah containing wastewaters are not properly treated before disposal the proposed treatments include chemical physical processes and biological processes lei et al 17 studied biological treatments to treat residual solutions containing tmah and other compounds dimethyl sulfoxide and mono ethanolamine the experiments were performed in aerobic and anaerobic conditions in both cases tmah degradation was possible but in anaerobic conditions some inhibitory effects were recorded with high concentrations of this salt on the contrary during the aerobic process nox substances were produced asawaka et al 18 and chang et al 19 conducted anaerobic treatments to remove tmah from wastewaters the degradation yields were about 95 and the processes produced a gas flow containing methane and carbon dioxide tmah could be removed from solutions by using chemical oxidation 20 in this case a poisonous gas containing nitrogen oxides could be produced and a conversion process should be added to decompose these oxides into nitrogen water and carbon dioxide 21 den et al 22 studied a combined treatment of photochemical oxidation with biological processes to degrade tmah from electronic wastewater obtaining a reduction of tmah about 97 other studies showed that tmah effluents could be treated by absorption onto activated carbon 23 zeolites 24 and silicate materials 25 and by membrane processes micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf 26 as for this last process already tested in several fields 27 30 it has the advantage of allowing a considerable saving of process water that after a suitable treatment can be reused in a closed loop 31 32 in this paper a single combined process to treat three types of real wastewater produced by a microelectronic industry is proposed one stream contains tmah the second one contains fluorides and phosphates while the last is rich in nitrates fluorides and acetic acid the treatments have been studied at the laboratory scale to define the optimal operating conditions for wastewater treatments for this reason a process analysis of the three treatment lines by using a process simulator superpro designer has been carried out to verify the results obtained during laboratory tests in view of the implementation of an industrial wastewater treatment plant wwtp for the combined depuration of several wastewaters from microelectronic industry through a scale up prior to pilot and then to industrial scale such a combined process offers advantages in terms of plant efficiency and is presented here for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewaters characterization three types of wastewaters produced inside the lfoundry srl plant located in avezzano l aquila italy have been used for the experiments ww1 is a residual liquid flow containing tmah ww2 is a residual liquid stream containing fluorides and phosphates ww3 is a residual liquid waste rich in nitrates fluorides and acetic acid as described in the next sections it was chosen to treat ww1 by using a biological process while ww2 and ww3 were treated by using physical chemical processes 2 2 wastewaters treatment procedure 2 2 1 biological process ww1 treatment the experiments have been carried out by using a biological reactor with a useful volume of 5 l model biostat b equipped with an oximeter thermometer and stirring system the biological oxidation of tmah stream ww1 was studied by inoculating activated sludge coming from the urban wastewater treatment plant of lfoundry company ww1 had an average concentration of tmah equal to 1800 mg l with a maximum concentration near to 2500 mg l and an initial ph 12 see also table 6 a culture medium having the following composition 0 82 g l nahco3 0 51 g l mgso4 0 23 g l na2moo4 0 21 g l k2hpo4 0 13 g l cucl2 0 1 g l fecl3 and 0 01 g l yeast extract was prepared to feed the reactor the carbon amount in the feeding was increased to balance the carbon nitrogen ratio up to 20 1 by adding another industrial wastewater named photoresist pr provided by lfoundry srl pr is a mixture of organic substances with a high total organic toc value 615 mg l it was added as a substrate to increase the amount of carbon source necessary for micro organisms growth the feeding for the bioreactor was obtained by mixing 1 5 l of tmah wastewater 12 ml of photoresist 1 2 l of growing medium and 0 3 l of inoculum before use the ww1 was neutralized to ph 7 by sulphuric acid 98 wt fluka the experiments have been performed at 25 c under 70 rpm stirring at an air flux of 2 l min with a maximum residence time of 13 days each day 100 ml of solution was sampled with a peristaltic pump centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was analysed to measure ph tmah and ammonium concentration organic pollutant load cod and total suspended solids tss biomass enrichment was obtained through a series of four consecutive batches in which one litre of sludge was kept in the reactor and fed with fresh medium as follows batch 1 the reactor was filled with 2 7 l of feeding solution tmah photoresist and culture medium and 0 3 l of inoculum subsequent batches at the beginning of each batch 1 l of active sludge coming from the previous cycle was kept in the bioreactor and fed 2 l of feeding solution 2 2 2 chemical physical processes ww2 and ww3 treatment hydrated lime calcium hydroxide carlo erba 98 wt and aluminum sulfate sigma aldrich hydrate 98 wt were used for the precipitation tests aluminum sulfate was used for the treatment of only ww2 during the experiments a suspension of lime 20 wt v was gradually added under constant stirring until reaching the desired ph value the mixture was stirred further for 2 h to ensure precipitation equilibrium precipitation tests were performed in a ph range of 1 4 12 at room temperature 25 2 c 12 the final ph was then measured and the precipitate was separated from the slurry by centrifugation and then dried at 105 c overnight for each considered ph the obtained filtrate was analyzed for determining the residual composition 2 3 analytical methods ph meter hanna instruments h 1254 was used to measure ph values of the solutions tmah concentration was analyzed by dx500 dionex column thermofisher cs17 ammonium fluoride nitrate and cod were measured with dr lange s kit cuvette test lck 303 lck 323 lck 339 and lck 514 respectively the total suspended solids were quantified by centrifugation the samples after that the solid residue was dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighted xrf spectrophotometer spectro xepos 2000 and atomic spectroscopy agilent synchronous vertical dual view 5100 icp oes were used to perform the chemical analyses of wastewater and of solid residue after treatment all quantitative analyses were run in triplicate for reproducibility of data and the results reported in the figures and tables were the average ones 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological process fig 1 presents the results of the first batch it is possible to observe that the first days were an adaptation period for the microorganisms tmah concentration remained constant for the first 24 h and after that decreased at the same time the ammonium level nh4 increased showing that this compound was the product of bio reaction the comparison between the two trends showed that the microorganisms were able to degrade tmah after 12 days 288 h tmah concentration was 0 4 mg l with 99 95 of degradation yield regarding nitrates data not reported in fig 1 the concentration was low and never exceeded 5 mg l for the entire batch this excluded the start of the nitrification process cod also shown in fig 1 decreased over time which is the sign of a good aerobic process after 288 h the degradation yield for cod was about 80 similar trends not reported here were obtained for the other three treatments in particular the results of the batches showed that the average tmah and cod degradation yields were near to 99 1 and 80 5 respectively the average concentration of ammonium was 109 mg l 9 mg l while the nitrate concentration was 2 20 mg l 0 1 mg l regarding tss the analysis showed an average concentration of 1 47 g l 0 1 g l the minimum value of tss 1 29 g l was recorded in the last batch probably the ageing process for the community started this hypothesis was also supported by the level of tmah and ammonium in the last batch in fact the degradation yields for tmah were 77 for 288 h of treatment and the ammonium concentration was around 70 mg l lower than the concentration obtained during the previous steps in the last two cycles the same degradation yields and nh4 concentrations had been achieved after 500 h of residence time the experimental data were used to define the stoichiometry of bacterial growth with tmah dissolved as ions c4h12n and photoresist c4h10o2 used as substrates the generic bacterial growth aerobic reaction is showed by the following eq 1 1 substrate oxygen biomass products in this case 2 c4h12n a c4h10o2 b o2 c ch1 7o0 45n0 2 d co2 e nh3 f h2o where the composition of aerobic biomass was derived by scientific literature 33 where a b c d e f were generic coefficients to define such coefficients it was necessary to solve the mass balances for each element c h o n the system consisted of 4 equations and 6 unknowns so it was necessary to define two other parameters by experimental data yx s that is the cell mass produced per mass of substrate consumed and the amount of nitrogen of the biomass these experimental values were yx s 0 34 gs gx grams of consumed substrate grams of produced bacteria and 21 85 of total nitrogen provided by tmah for bacterial growth the remaining nitrogen was consumed by biomass and transformed into ammonia solving the systems of equations the coefficients were found as shown in eq 3 3 c4h12n 4 c4h10o2 26 413 o2 1 75 ch1 7o0 45n0 2 18 25 co2 0 65 nh3

described by eqs 4 6 with the following initial conditions for t 0 x x0 s s0 and p p0 the system can be solved by introducing the kinetic equations by monod eq 7 pirt eq 8 and luedeking piret eq 9 34

and phosphate precipitation was examined in a series of experiments at a fixed initial wastewater sample ww2 while varying the ph in the range 8 7 12 0 aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 x18h2o was used as a coagulant in order to enhance the separation with calcium hydroxide slurry as the original wastewater was characterized by a high ph value the coagulant was added before calcium hydroxide addition the main chemical reactions describing the precipitation process are the following eqs 10 13 10 al2 so4 3 3 ca oh 2 3 ca so4 2 al oh 3 11 hno3 ca oh 2 ca no3 2 2 h2o 12 nh4f ca oh 2 caf2 2 nh4oh 13 h3po4

in the ph value from 8 7 up to 11 4 the removal efficiency of f and po4 3 ions increased up to 99 9 and 100 respectively whereas the total degree of precipitation of f reached a maximum at ph 11 5 99

against an initial concentration of 20 100 mg l and the volume of sediment was 5 times lower with good separation parameters fluoride and phosphate concentrations were below the limits for sewage effluents italian legislative decree n 152 06 35 the composition of sediments after precipitation with ca oh 2 at different ph levels are given in table 2 no other elements were detected at concentrations greater than 0 01 wt the optimal experimental conditions were used to outline the flow chart and the relative mass balance for ww2 treatment fig 2 the process consists of a precipitation step with aluminum sulfate and calcium hydroxide at 25 c for 2 h followed by suspension filtration to separate the precipitate and liquid the solid can be dried and then disposed of while the treated water could be sent to the biological treatment according to the mass balance lime consumption 20 wt v solution and aluminum sulfate hydrate consumption to treat 1 m3 of ww2 are 364 kg m3 and 40 kg m3 respectively 3 2 2 ww3 the effect of ph on fluoride precipitation was examined in a series of experiments at a fixed initial wastewater ww3 while changing the ph in the range 1 4 11 8 the main chemical reactions are described by eqs 14 16 14 hno3 ca oh 2 ca no3 2 2 h2o 15 hf ca oh 2 caf2 2 h2o 16 ch3cooh ca oh 2 ca ch3coo 2 2h2o the effect of the ph on fluoride precipitation and characteristics of the wastewater is illustrated in the following table 3 it was found that lime as a precipitating agent was effective for fluorides along with an increase in the ph value from 1 4 to 4 7 the removal efficiency of f ions increased up to 99 9 whereas the total degree of precipitation of f reached a maximum at ph 4 4 99 9 with further increasing ph up to 9 9 the effect of fluoride removal decreased as can be seen the best value for fluoride removal is ph 4 4 4 7 ca oh 2 dosage 80 g l in this case f concentration in the solution after treatment will be 11 5 mg l initial concentration in wastewater was 16 861 mg l at this ph value acetic acid was not involved in reaction a further increase of ph from 4 4 up to 6 4 did not improve f removal but resulted in an increased calcium consumption up to 100 g l the optimal ph for fluoride removal is 4 4 ca oh 2 dosage 80 g l the compositions of sediment after precipitation with ca oh 2 at different ph values are given in table 4 no other elements were detected at concentrations greater than 0 01 wt the main finding of these experiments is that the use of ca oh 2 as a precipitating reagent with ph varying in the range 4 4 4 7 gives the possibility of a further wastewater biological treatment this is because of the conversion into non hazardous fluorides of the 99 9 formerly hazardous soluble fluorides nitrate and acetic acid remaining in the wastewater can be considered as a nutrient medium for bacteria in the subsequent biological wastewater treatment the optimal experimental conditions were used to sketch the flow chart and the relative mass balance of the ww3 treatment fig 3 the process includes a precipitation step with calcium hydroxide at 25 c for 2 h then the suspension filtration to separate the precipitate and liquid the solid can be dried and subsequently disposed of while the treated water can be sent for biological treatment according to the mass balance for 1 m3 of ww3 lime consumption 20 wt v solution is equal to 579 5 kg m3 4 process analysis 4 1 process description the results of the experimental tests were used to define three lines of treatment that were simulated by using superpro designer 36 a simple description of the process is reported below and shown in fig 4 in the first line of treatment the wastewater ww1 is sent to a neutralization reactor n101 and then into three biological reactors placed in series r101 r012 and r103 see fig 4a in n101 the solution ph is adjusted up to 7 and afterwards tmah effluent is fed in the bio reactors where it is degraded by microorganisms the suspension outflowing from the last bio reactor r103 is sent to a storage tank tk203 before being fed to a biological section of a wastewater treatment plant in the real plant of lfoundry company a wwtp biological plant already exists and treats at the moment the domestic wastewaters produced by the company the second line of treatment for ww2 see fig 4b includes a process with lime in the presence of a coagulant aluminum sulfate to remove nitrates and phosphates the time of reaction is equal to 2 h after this time the suspension is filtered using a filtration system filter press fp201 and two outputs are recovered the residual solid that needs to be disposed and the liquid that is sent to a storage tank tk202 before reaching the biological section of the existing plant the third line of the treatment for ww3 see fig 4c includes a process with lime to remove nitric hydrofluoric and acetic acid from the wastewater the time of reaction is equal to 2 h after this time the suspension is filtered using a filtration system filter press fp201 and two outputs are recovered the residual solid that needs to be disposed and the liquid that is sent to a storage tank tk202 before reaching the biological section of the existing plant 4 2 process simulation by using superpro designer for the simulation the pilot plant capacity has been assumed to be 33 times smaller than the future industrial plant for wastewater treatments that the company intends to build in the future as already seen the flowsheet shown in fig 4 consists of three parts the treatment of the ww1 works in continuous operation whilst the treatments of the ww2 and ww3 are batch operations the pilot plant is designed to treat 25 l h of ww1 and 180 l batch for ww2 and ww3 considering the small amounts of the lines the treatment of ww2 is performed every three days whilst the treatment of ww3 is performed every eleven days these streams are stored in two tanks tk205 and tk206 the pilot plant has an air intake for the suction of the volatiles odours and various impurities from all equipment of the system the air pollution is sent to a scrubber sc301 for the removal of the impurities the volume of the biological reactors was calculated using the experimental values μmax ks and yx s obtained from data analysis see section 3 1 the volume of a single reactor to perform the biological reaction had a volume equal to 10 m3 v f μ and a residence time of 405 h according to a process specification in order to reduce the equipment size the volume of the bioreactors should be about 1 m3 a single equipment of 1 m3 did not ensure the performance of the process in fact it reached only 41 of tmah degradation therefore three reactors in series each having a useful capacity of 1 m3 have been provided which could guarantee 99 of tmah degradation 34 the residence time for each reactor was around 40 h moreover the biological reactors are jacketed to control the temperature table 5 summarizes the main individual operations of the process the details of the three lines of treatment are reported in the following 4 2 1 ww1 treatment line the section of the line treatment ww1 includes the following main equipment neutralization reactor n101 three bio reactors r101 102 103 the equipment of this section work in continuous mode the input of the section has the composition reported in table 6 this solution is sent to neutralization n101 in which sulfuric acid is added to adjust the ph value to 7 the reaction of neutralization time is set to 1 h the amount of sulfuric acid solution 50 wt to add is 0 1 kg h during this step the micronutrients are added 0 05 kg l for bacteria growth the solution after neutralization is sent to the biological section including three reactors in series the reactions occurring in this step are described by eqs 3 9 according to the experimental data the yields for the biological reaction are 52 75 and 83 for the first second and third reactions that occurred in the r101 r102 and r103 respectively the air supply stream is calculated from the software setting the rate equal to 0 5 vvm volume of air per volume of liquid and per minute the amount of air for every bio reactor is 31 5 m3 table 7 shows the composition of the wastewater f5 output from the third bio reactor 4 2 2 ww2 treatment line the section of ww2 treatment line includes the following main equipment reactor 104 filtration system fp201 the simulation is performed considering that all the equipment of this section works in a batch mode and considering that three days are necessary to reach the total desired volume of 180 l the input of the section is reported in table 8 in the r104 the reactions that occurred are described by eqs 10 13 the yields are higher than 99 for all reactions lime solution 20 wt v is added in the reactor 364 kg of lime solution m3 of wastewater in the presence of a coagulant 19 5 kg m3 of wastewater after 2 h of reaction the suspension is sent to the filtration system simulated as a filter press fp201 the filter press works under the following conditions 90 of removal for calcium sulfate 80 of calcium hydroxide and 100 of removal of calcium fluoride calcium phosphate aluminum hydroxide other data are filtrate flux equal to 120 l m2 h with 45 of humidity tables 9 and 10 report the compositions of the cake and the filtrate finally the filtrate is sent to storage tank tk202 and afterwards to the biological section of the existing plant 4 2 3 ww3 treatment line the section of the line treatment ww3 includes the following main equipment reactor 104 filtration system fp201 the simulation is performed hypothesizing that the equipment of this section works in batch mode and considering that eleven days are necessary to reach the desired volume of 180 l the input of the section is shown in table 11 in the reactor r104 the reactions that occurred are described by eqs 14 16 the reaction yields for the first two reactions are higher than 99 lime solution 20 wt v is added in the reactor to reach a ph 4 4 4 7 579 5 kg of lime solution m3 of wastewater in these conditions according to experimental data the last reaction did not occur and therefore the reaction yield of acetic acid degradation is zero after 2 h of reaction the suspension is sent to the filtration system simulated as a filter press fp201 the filter press works under the following conditions 80 of removal for calcium hydroxide 100 of removal of calcium fluoride other data are filtrate flux equal to 120 l m2 h with 45 of humidity tables 12 and 13 report the compositions of the cake and the filtrate the filtrate is sent to storage tank tk202 and afterwards to the biological section of the existing plant as an alternative the liquid containing acetic acid could be sent to the neutralization reactor n101 and afterwards fed to the three reactors in series r101 r102 r103 in this case the acetic acid replaces the sulfuric acid table 14 reports the recipe and gantt chart of single batch for lines ww2 and ww3 5 conclusions this manuscript reports the research performed on the treatment of three different real wastewaters produced by a multinational microelectronics company lfoundry srl these polluted streams contained fluorides nitrates acetic acid and tmah the experiments performed at laboratory scale showed that precipitation operations with lime guaranteed an anion removal of 99 while tmah could be removed by an aerobic biological treatment the kinetic data of bacterial growth were obtained on the basis of experimental results and were used to design a possible plant configuration a process analysis was performed in order to evaluate the technical feasibility with a view to the scale up of the combined process the results showed that with an opportune sequence of continuous and batch processes it is possible to treat in a combined way several industrial effluents simultaneously and directly in situ by using the local bacterial community since the microorganisms easily adapted to the new environment and to the perturbations caused by the presence of the complex tmah molecules the results obtained in this paper could open up new and definitive prospectives in the treatment of electronic industry wastewaters this is timely because due to recent progress in the specific legislation fixing the discharge limits for microelectronics sewage effluents the scientific community is now approaching the problem of tmah disposal acknowledgements these activities have been performed within the life bitmaps
