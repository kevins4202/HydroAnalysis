15470,a combined system consisting of an upflow blanket filter ubf and a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was developed for the simultaneous removal of organic matters and ammonia from high strength wastewater with a constant cod of approximately 2000 mg l and ammonium nitrogen in a series of concentrations e g 50 200 and 400 mg l in stages i to iii of the influent wastewater the removal efficiencies of cod ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen reached 96 10 98 19 100 and 79 12 82 15 respectively with the increase of influent ammonia nitrogen concentration the specific methanogenic activity of the ubf granules decreased significantly while the specific denitrification rates of the ubf granules and specific nitrification rates of the mbbr biofilms increased significantly microbial community analysis showed that methanobacterium and methanosaeta were the dominant methanogens in the ubf granules while candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter were identified as dominant denitrifiers in addition nitrifiers were enriched in mbbr biofilms at 11 33 and 13 87 of the average abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira respectively at stage iii influent ammonium at 400 mg l cod nh4 n 5 the ecological network analysis including full networks and sub networks indicated that the interactions between methanogens and denitrifiers in the ubf granules were strong when the influent ammonium concentration reached 400 mg l no intensive interactions were observed among the functional bacteria in the mbbr biofilms over the entire operation overall this study provides a new strategy for the application and construction of efficient biological processes to achieve simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrogen for high strength wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ubf mbbr high strength wastewater c n ratio microbial community ecological network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction high strength wastewater such as swine wastewater hai et al 2015 coking wastewater he et al 2022 and landfill leachate teng et al 2021 usually contains large amounts of the organics and nitrogen such high strength wastewater has raised widespread concern owing to its the high biotoxicity and notable treatment difficulties if released directly into aquatic environments the large amount of wastewater produced could significantly contribute to water pollution and eutrophication cheng et al 2018 nikolaeva et al 2002 therefore it is of great interest to develop green and sustainable technologies that can achieve synergistic treatment of these co existing pollutants or nutrients simultaneous methanogenesis and denitrification smd can simultaneously remove organics and nitrogen in a single reactor yi et al 2020 hanaki and polprasert 1989 sun et al 2008 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 smd can simplify the wastewater treatment process particularly for high strength wastewater thus substantially reducing construction and operation costs xie et al 2012 the upflow blanket filter ubf a combination of anaerobic granular sludge and anaerobic biofilm processes can create favorable aggregation situations for various anaerobic microorganisms such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb wang et al 2020 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob qin et al 2017 and methanogens yang et al 2019 thus the ubf has the potential to achieve smd processes in addition it should be noted that the smd process is usually combined with nitrification n when treating various wastewaters the combined smd n process has been reported to be efficient for treating piggery wastewater huang et al 2005 landfill leachate im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 and slaughterhouse wastewater del pozo and diez 2003 compared with conventional processes saghir and hajjar 2022 tian et al 2022 smd n can significantly simplify the wastewater treatment process in this type of treatment system only a two stage process is required to simultaneously remove organic matter and nitrogen from wastewater nitrification can be achieved using conventional activated sludge huang et al 2005 sequencing batch reactors akizuki et al 2016 and membrane bioreactors an et al 2008 however such activated sludge processes have a problem of sludge bulking shi et al 2022 complex operational strategies bournazou et al 2013 and membrane fouling xin et al 2020 the biofilm process owning to its advantages of easy biosolid liquid separation and low space requirement has been widely used for the removal of organic carbon and nutrients in waste water treatment plants wwtp bio carriers can maintain a higher biomass retention time encouraging the growth of slow growing microorganisms e g nitrifiers navada et al 2020 a biofilm based reactor such as moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr di biase et al 2019 can achieve satisfactory performance in ammonium oxidation via enrichment of nitrifying bacteria on the bio carriers cimbritz et al 2019 therefore a novel combined process with an upflow blanket filter ubf and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is worth studying to achieve a stable and high efficiency smd n system although the smd n system has been proven to be an effective process for high strength wastewater treatment the unique microbial community structure and complex microbial interactions in such systems remain unclear recently ecological network analysis has been widely used to reveal the interplay between co occurring species in various systems li et al 2021 olesen et al 2007 microbial ecological networks can also illustrate important microbial community attributes and show more complexity in the resistance of microbial populations than community composition gao et al 2022 hirano and takemoto 2019 wang et al 2018 therefore more comprehensive information about the microbial ecology in the smd n system would help understand the transformation of organics and nitrogen as well as the operation and optimization of combined processes therefore in this study a novel lab scale ubf mbbr process was developed for the treatment of synthetic high strength wastewater the performance and microbial activity of this process at three different c n ratios cod nh4 n 40 10 and 5 was systematically investigated high throughput sequencing was conducted to investigate the microbial community composition diversity functional traits and microbial interactions in the smd n process the novelty of this study to our current knowledge is that i developing a compact bioprocess that can achieve simultaneous removal of organics and nitrogen from high strength wastewater and ii providing comprehensive information regarding the microbial communities and microbial interactions in smd n system overall this work enhances our understanding of high strength wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 smd n setup and operation the configuration of the laboratory scale ubf mbbr process is shown in fig 1 the effective volume of both the ubf and mbbr was 5 l and the total hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 2 days the hrt of both the reactors was set at 24 h polyurethane biocarriers dimensions 2 2

reactor was inoculated with 0 75 l granular sludge taken from a distillery and 0 75 l activated sludge taken from a wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china before connecting to the ubf the mbbr was inoculated with activated sludge the mbbr was aerated for 24 h after which the residual activated sludge was discharged from the reactor to warrant denitrification the reactor bulk of the mbbr was recirculated to the bottom of the ubf reactor with a recirculation ratio of 300 to maintain a satisfactory upflow velocity in the ubf column the ubf effluent was recirculated at an internal recirculation ratio of 800 the operating temperature of the ubf was controlled to approximately 30 c using heating tape whereas the mbbr was operated at room temperature 20 25 c no sludge was discharged during the operation the dissolved oxygen do concentration of the mbbr was maintained above 4 0 mg l to clearly understand the reactor performance as well as the underlying mechanisms synthetic wastewater which can be used to mimick readily biodegradable wastewater e g livestock wastewater was used as feed wastewater table s1 the ammonium nitrogen concentrations were 50 200 and 400 mg l for stages i ii and iii respectively resulting in c n ratios of 40 10 and 5 respectively the cod concentrations of the influent were maintained at approximately 2000 mg l glucose sodium acetate 8 2 as the ratio of cod throughout the operation period and to provide sufficient alkalinity for nitrification of the mbbr the ph of the influent was maintained above 9 in stages ii and iii by adding na2co3 co3 2 nh4 1 1 as the molar ratio the designed organic loading rate olr of the ubf was 2 0 kg cod m3 d the designed ammonia loading rates alr of the mbbr were 0 05 0 20 and 0 40 kg n m3 d respectively and the designed nitrate loading rates nalr of the ubf were 0 0375 0 15 and 0 30 kg n m3 d respectively notably in order to adapt anaerobic granular sludge to a high nitrate concentration

parafac modeling was performed using matlab r2019a with the domfluor toolbox according to the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 2 3 calculation methods to quantify the contribution rate of denitrification and methanogenesis in the ubf reactor the rates of cod removal by total anaerobic bacteria denitrification and methanogenesis were calculated using eqs 1 3 respectively according to

construction to determine the impact of elevated c n ratios on network interactions in the smd n system an online molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena molecular ecological network analysis mena was employed to construct phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens of the microbial communities within the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms from the three different stages six full networks were constructed for this study the construction of pmens is based on the random matrix theory rmt luo et al 2006 to evaluate the interactions between several key functional genera and other bacteria in ubf granules and mbbr biofilms 18 sub networks were constructed using mena the six full networks of ubf granules and mbbr biofilms were constructed using rarefied asv tables while the genus tables were used to construct 18 sub networks the detailed process of pmens construction has been provided in a previous study xu et al 2021 the topological roles of microbiomes were determined by among module connectivity pi and with module connectivity zi and gephi software version 0 9 2 was used to visualize the pmens 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the ubf mbbr process during the entire operation cod was efficiently removed by the combined ubf mbbr in three stages 98 19 0 31 96 10 1 10 97 99 0 62 p 0 01 fig 2 a the ubf contributed more than 96 in cod removal measurement by eem fluorescence indicated that the anaerobic treatment by ubf yielded considerable aromatic proteins which were then removed by the mbbr process fig s1 the results also showed that the methane yield of the ubf decreased gradually p 0 01 0 23 0 01 0 18 0 02 and 0 12 0 01 m3 kg cod with decreasing influent c n ratios 40 20 and 10 fig 2d since the occurrence of denitrification can consume a large portion of organics however no significant difference p 0 05 2800 9 122 1 2646 1 201 0 and 2718 4 126 2 ml d respectively was found in gas production fig 2d among the three stages the decreased methane production and stable total gas production can be attributed to the increased nitrogen gas production with increasing ammonium nitrogen loadings for example increasing biogas ratio of n2 and ch4 with decreasing c n ratios in the influent fig s2f except for the fluctuations at the beginning of stage ii days 70 75 and iii days 123 151 the ammonium concentrations of the mbbr effluent were maintained below 0 33 mg n l fig 2b the mbbr exhibited satisfactory nitrification during the stable operation of the three stages no obvious accumulation of nitrite was observed in the mbbr effluent in the first two stages fig s2a owing to the sudden decrease in the influent c n ratio slight fluctuations in nitrite 0 702 7 878 mg n l were observed at the beginning of stage iii as shown in fig 2c nitrate was the main nitrogen species of the effluent of the smd n system the effluent nitrate averaged at 11 8 mg n l 9 2 mg n l and 81 8 mg n l at stages i ii and iii respectively no significant difference was found in the removal efficiency of total nitrogen among the three operational stages p 0 05 81 6 1 5 82 2 0 9 and 79 1 0 7 respectively fig s2b indicating that the decrease in c n ratio did not significantly affect the removal of total nitrogen according to the mass balance calculations fig s4b the role of denitrification increased in the cod degradation 7 31 25 14 and 47 62 respectively along with the reactor operation meanwhile the removal efficiency of total nitrogen 79 83 over the entire operation was slightly higher than the theoretical nitrogen removal rate 75 likely due to microbial assimilation and the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd processes tugtas et al 2010 as shown in table s3 our compact ubf mbbr process harbors satisfying or greater carbon and nitrogen removal performance compared with other traditional biological processes in contrast to ahn et al 2007 no significant dissimilatory nitrate reduction phenomenon was observed in this study even when the influent nh4 n concentration reached 400 mg l in brief 1 75 1 80 kg cod m3 d of orr and 0 037 0 24 kg n m3 d of narr were achieved in the ubf reactor while 0 061 0 36 kg n m3 d of arr were detected in the mbbr fig s5 3 2 metabolic activity and morphology of ubf granules and mbbr biofilms to explore the activity of functional bacteria methanogens denitrifiers and nitrifiers in the combined ubf mbbr system a series of batch tests were conducted to determine the specific rates of ch4 production and nitrogen removal as the influent c n ratio decreased from 40 to 5 the smas of the ubf granules decreased significantly fig 3 a table s4 and the sdnrs increased substantially fig 3b table s4 similar smas results have been reported by sun 2018 the sdnrs of the ubf granules in our study were similar to those of thermophilic denitrifying granular sludge cultivated by shi et al 2022 as shown in fig 3b the snrs of mbbr biofilms were determined to be 43 77 1 87 51 90 3 85 and 103 61 14 79 mg n g vss h respectively at stage i ii and iii the changing smas sdnrs and snrs of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms might be associated with the varying abundance of functional bacteria in the three stages the sem images of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms are shown in fig s6 compared to stage i more eps and cocci were detected in the ubf granules at stages ii and iii according to wang et al 2020 denitrifiers would release a large amount of extracellular protein on the surface of ubf granules when they predominate outside the granules in stage i a large number of filamentous bacteria were observed on the surface of the ubf granules fig s6 which is in agreement with previous smd research sun et al 2018 the sizes of the ubf granules are shown in fig s4a and table s5 the seeding sludge of ubf had a mean size of 55 6 Î¼m the mean sizes of the ubf granules increased to 885 960 and 1050 Î¼m at the end of stages i ii and iii respectively li et al 2016 also reported that denitrification can effectively accelerate anaerobic sludge granulation at stage i a large number of cocci were detected in the mbbr biofilms however as the c n ratio decreased from 40 to 10 and 5 the biomass of the mbbr biofilms increased significantly and filamentous bacteria gradually replaced cocci to become the dominant bacteria on the carrier surfaces fig s6 3 3 microbial community diversity and composition in ubf mbbr process a 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis was performed to further investigate the dynamic changes in the microbial community structure in the ubf mbbr system after clustering the clean sequences into asvs 5776 asvs were obtained from the 150 samples according to the Î± diversity analysis shannon and chao 1 as the influent ammonium concentrations increased from 50 to 200 and 400 mg l the microbial diversity of ubf granules exhibited a decreasing trend p 0 05 while that of mbbr biofilms showed an opposite trend p 0 05 fig s7 in this study over 1405 bacterial taxa were detected at the genus level the top 30 genera in the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms were analyzed as shown in fig 4 the nmds results fig 4a and 4b showed that the bacterial groups from the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms at the three stages were clearly separated indicating that the changing ammonium loadings significantly affected the community structures of the two reactors methanobacterium average of 2 18 and methanosaeta average of 19 06 were the two archaea with the high abundances in the ubf reactor fig 4c this finding is consistent with those reported by sun et al 2018 and yi et al 2016 besides they also observed that methanosaeta a type of methanogen that uses acetate as carbon source to produce methane was the dominant methanogen in the smd system with a decline in c n ratios from 40 to 5 the relative abundances of the two methanogens in the ubf granules decreased from 33 91 to 14 48 three highly abundant denitrifiers have been recognized in ubf granules i e candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter camejo et al 2016 notably the relative abundances of three key denitrifiers in the ubf granules were relatively low at stage i and averaged at 0 98 3 20 and 0 76 for candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter respectively the relative abundance of these three genera increased to 14 07 16 80 and 1 14 at stage iii nitrosomonas and nitrospira were detected as the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob respectively in the mbbr biofilms the average abundance of genera nitrosomonas from 0 92 to 11 33 and nitrospira from 5 15 to 13 87 increased significantly as the influent ammonium nitrogen increased from 50 to 400 mg l 3 4 full network and sub network of bacterial community to further understand the microbial interactions in the ubf mbbr process six rmt based full networks were constructed fig 5 a the small world coefficients Ï of the six full networks were all greater than 1 indicating that the constructed networks had typical modularity structures and small world characteristics table 1 the connectivity distributions of these networks fitted well with the r2 of power law model r2 0 7 it can be seen that the network of ubf granules displayed higher average clustering coefficient avgcc average connectivity avgk and shorter harmonic geodesic distance hd at stage iii compared to those in the first two stages the pmens of stage â² had a lower degree of modularity 0 284 as compared to those of the ubf granules in the first two stages 0 587 and 0 576 indicating that the microbial niche differentiation in the ubf at stage iii was relatively low similar to the ubf granules the pmens of the mbbr biofilms also harbored a smaller modularity and a higher avgk at stage iii accordingly the influent c n ratios had a similar impact on the topological characteristics of the ecological network of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms the topological roles of the nodes and the ecological contribution of asvs were analyzed by calculating the within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi in different samples only one network hub asv235 anaerolineaceae g is was found in ubf granules at stage i among the six full networks fig s8 additionally 34 keystone asvs were detected in the three pmens of ubf granules which harbored more keystone species than mbbr biofilms 7 interestingly methanosaeta asv192 the dominant methanogen in the ubf granules was detected as a keystone species at stage i asv90 delftia were detected as the shared keystone species of ubf granules and mbbr biofilms in addition anaerolineaceae g is asv235 97 539 93 306 224 57 considered as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria hfb liu et al 2020 was identified as an important genus in ubf granules this result indicates that hfb seems to play a critical role in the formation and stabilization the of smd community however fewer keystone species were found in the mbbr biofilms 2 3 and 2 at stages i ii and iii respectively as shown in section 3 2 the ubf granules played a dominant role in denitrification and methanogenesis in the ubf reactor while the mbbr biofilms played a major role in nitrification thus sub networks of the related high abundance functional bacteria and their side populations in the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms were constructed to further reveal the potential interspecies interaction under the three different stages fig 5b a few side populations of methanosaeta 7 and 4 and candidatus competibacter 1 and 6 were found in stages i and ii while the numbers increased to 46 and 43 respectively in stage iii however thauera and acinetobacter exhibited different trends the number of side populations of thauera reached a peak at stage ii while a decreasing trend of that of acinetobacter was observed with an increase in influent ammonium concentrations suggesting that a high concentration of nitrate supplied to the ubf might reduce interspecies correlations among thauera acinetobacter and their neighbors notably negative correlations were detected between methanosaeta and denitrifiers candidatus competibacter denitratisoma and candidatus accumulibacter as discussed in section 3 3 nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the major players in ammonia oxidation in the mbbr compared with the functional genera in the ubf nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the mbbr harbored fewer side populations the sub networks of nitrosomonas and nitrospira at stage iii had more complex interactions and larger sizes than those at stage i and ii indicating that elevated influent ammonium concentrations might enhance the interactions among aob nob and other microorganisms as mentioned above the abundance of ch4 in biogas declined and that of n2 increased with the increasing c n ratios fig s2f in addition the role of denitrification in cod degradation increased to 47 62 in stage iii fig s4b this phenomenon was consistent with the significant interactions between methanogens and denitrifiers in stage iii a high concentration of no3 n returned to the bottom of the ubf which not only led to an increase of denitrifiers abundance but also intensified the competition between methanogens and denitrifiers for carbon sources it is assumed that although low c n ratios caused the lowest sma at stage iii fig s3a strong interactions between functional bacteria might enhance substrate availability lovley 2011 3 5 implications for high strength wastewater treatment the efficient removal of cod and tn in the novel ubf mbbr system indicates that high strength wastewater can be treated using a simple and compact process in general the conventional technologies applied for nutrient removal are based on a temporal or spatial sequence of different anaerobic anoxic and aerobic steps lacalle et al 2001 whereas our ubf mbbr system can achieve simultaneous removal of organics and ammonia using only two independent reactors integration of heterotrophic denitrification and methanogenesis in a single reactor can significantly reduce substrate costs energy consumption material and space andalib et al 2011 high free ammonia fa in wastewater might suppress methanogens lemaigre et al 2018 and nob wu et al 2021 in biological technology while the recirculation of mbbr effluent to the ubf could greatly dilute influent fa concentrations and reduce the inhibitory effects on functional bacteria moreover the ubf mbbr process was relatively insensitive to the influent c n ratio achieving excellent pollutant removal performance when the c n ratio varied in the range of 5 40 these results suggest that the smd n process has the potential to treat wastewater that contains various nitrogen sources however it takes a long time to develop stable nitrifying biofilms which limits the start up of nitrifying biofilm systems according to previous reports the presence of a moderate amount of organic matter can boost nitrifying biofilm growth via the cross feeding role of heterotrophic bacteria bassin et al 2012 luo and meng 2020 navada et al 2020 owing to the environmental limitations our study was based on synthetic wastewater further investigations removal kinetics of c and n functional bacteria operation parameters of real high strength wastewater treated by our ubf mbbr process are needed before its large scale application one more important limitation for this process is the co existence n2 and ch4 which will be a challenge to the usage of bio gas or the post purification of ch4 overall the results of this study provide new insights into the application and construction of simultaneous organics and nitrogen removal processes 4 conclusion to sum up the following conclusions can be drawn 1 this study proposed a novel ubf mbbr process for treatment of high strength wastewater which achieved satisfactory nutrient removal with an influent cod of 2000 mg l and varying ammonium concentrations 50 100 and 200 mg l 2 increasing ammonium concentrations in the influent led to a decrease in the relative abundance of methanogens e g methanobacterium and methanosaeta and lower smas while the abundance of denitrifiers e g candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter in ubf granules and nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira in mbbr reactors increased as ammonium increased contributing to the increasing sdnrs of ubf granules and snrs of mbbr biofilms 3 the high concentrations of nitrate from the mbbr induced strong competition between methanogens and denitrifiers in the ubf granules as the ammonium concentration increased to 200 mg l the aob and nob in the mbbr biofilms maintained a relatively weak correlation with their neighbors over the entire operation supporting information file the followings are the supplementary data related to this article 3d eem spectra and

15470,a combined system consisting of an upflow blanket filter ubf and a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was developed for the simultaneous removal of organic matters and ammonia from high strength wastewater with a constant cod of approximately 2000 mg l and ammonium nitrogen in a series of concentrations e g 50 200 and 400 mg l in stages i to iii of the influent wastewater the removal efficiencies of cod ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen reached 96 10 98 19 100 and 79 12 82 15 respectively with the increase of influent ammonia nitrogen concentration the specific methanogenic activity of the ubf granules decreased significantly while the specific denitrification rates of the ubf granules and specific nitrification rates of the mbbr biofilms increased significantly microbial community analysis showed that methanobacterium and methanosaeta were the dominant methanogens in the ubf granules while candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter were identified as dominant denitrifiers in addition nitrifiers were enriched in mbbr biofilms at 11 33 and 13 87 of the average abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira respectively at stage iii influent ammonium at 400 mg l cod nh4 n 5 the ecological network analysis including full networks and sub networks indicated that the interactions between methanogens and denitrifiers in the ubf granules were strong when the influent ammonium concentration reached 400 mg l no intensive interactions were observed among the functional bacteria in the mbbr biofilms over the entire operation overall this study provides a new strategy for the application and construction of efficient biological processes to achieve simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrogen for high strength wastewater treatment graphical

high strength wastewater such as swine wastewater hai et al 2015 coking wastewater he et al 2022 and landfill leachate teng et al 2021 usually contains large amounts of the organics and nitrogen such high strength wastewater has raised widespread concern owing to its the high biotoxicity and notable treatment difficulties if released directly into aquatic environments the large amount of wastewater produced could significantly contribute to water pollution and eutrophication cheng et al 2018 nikolaeva et al 2002 therefore it is of great interest to develop green and sustainable technologies that can achieve synergistic treatment of these co existing pollutants or nutrients simultaneous methanogenesis and denitrification smd can simultaneously remove organics and nitrogen in a single reactor yi et al 2020 hanaki and polprasert 1989 sun et al 2008 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 smd can simplify the wastewater treatment process particularly for high strength wastewater thus substantially reducing construction and operation costs xie et al 2012 the upflow blanket filter ubf a combination of anaerobic granular sludge and anaerobic biofilm processes can create favorable aggregation situations for various anaerobic microorganisms such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb wang et al 2020 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob qin et al 2017 and methanogens yang et al 2019 thus the ubf has the potential to achieve smd processes in addition it should be noted that the smd process is usually combined with nitrification n when treating various wastewaters the combined smd n process has been reported to be efficient for treating piggery wastewater huang et al 2005 landfill leachate im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 and slaughterhouse wastewater del pozo and diez 2003 compared with conventional processes saghir and hajjar 2022 tian et al 2022 smd n can significantly simplify the wastewater treatment process in this type of treatment system only a two stage process is required to simultaneously remove organic matter and nitrogen from wastewater nitrification can be achieved using conventional activated sludge huang et al 2005 sequencing batch reactors akizuki et al 2016 and membrane bioreactors an et al 2008 however such activated sludge processes have a problem of sludge bulking shi et al 2022 complex operational strategies bournazou et al 2013 and membrane fouling xin et al 2020 the biofilm process owning to its advantages of easy biosolid liquid separation and low space requirement has been widely used for the removal of organic carbon and nutrients in waste water treatment plants wwtp bio carriers can maintain a higher biomass retention time encouraging the growth of slow growing microorganisms e g nitrifiers navada et al 2020 a biofilm based reactor such as moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr di biase et al 2019 can achieve satisfactory performance in ammonium oxidation via enrichment of nitrifying bacteria on the bio carriers cimbritz et al 2019 therefore a novel combined process with an upflow blanket filter ubf and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is worth studying to achieve a stable and high efficiency smd n system although the smd n system has been proven to be an effective process for high strength wastewater treatment the unique microbial community structure and complex microbial interactions in such systems remain unclear recently ecological network analysis has been widely used to reveal the interplay between co occurring species in various systems li et al 2021 olesen et al 2007 microbial ecological networks can also illustrate important microbial community attributes and show more complexity in the resistance of microbial populations than community composition gao et al 2022 hirano and takemoto 2019 wang et al 2018 therefore more comprehensive information about the microbial ecology in the smd n system would help understand the transformation of organics and nitrogen as well as the operation and optimization of combined processes therefore in this study a novel lab scale ubf mbbr process was developed for the treatment of synthetic high strength wastewater the performance and microbial activity of this process at three different c n ratios cod nh4 n 40 10 and 5 was systematically investigated high throughput sequencing was conducted to investigate the microbial community composition diversity functional traits and microbial interactions in the smd n process the novelty of this study to our current knowledge is that i developing a compact bioprocess that can achieve simultaneous removal of organics and nitrogen from high strength wastewater and ii providing comprehensive information regarding the microbial communities and microbial interactions in smd n system overall this work enhances our understanding of high strength wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 smd n setup and operation the configuration of the laboratory scale ubf mbbr process is shown in fig 1 the effective volume of both the ubf and mbbr was 5 l and the total hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 2 days the hrt of both the reactors was set at 24 h polyurethane biocarriers dimensions 2 2

reactor was inoculated with 0 75 l granular sludge taken from a distillery and 0 75 l activated sludge taken from a wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china before connecting to the ubf the mbbr was inoculated with activated sludge the mbbr was aerated for 24 h after which the residual activated sludge was discharged from the reactor to warrant denitrification the reactor bulk of the mbbr was recirculated to the bottom of the ubf reactor with a recirculation ratio of 300 to maintain a satisfactory upflow velocity in the ubf column the ubf effluent was recirculated at an internal recirculation ratio of 800 the operating temperature of the ubf was controlled to approximately 30 c using heating tape whereas the mbbr was operated at room temperature 20 25 c no sludge was

na2co3 co3 2 nh4 1 1 as the molar ratio the designed organic loading rate olr of the ubf was 2 0 kg cod m3 d the designed ammonia loading rates alr of the mbbr were 0 05 0 20 and 0 40 kg n m3 d respectively and the designed nitrate loading rates nalr of the ubf were 0 0375 0 15 and 0 30 kg n m3 d respectively notably in order to adapt anaerobic granular sludge to a high nitrate concentration the ubf was acclimated over 100 d by using specific culture solution cod 2000 mg l no3 n 100 mg l before running the smd n process 2 2 chemical analyses and batch experiments influent ubf effluent and

detailed procedures of these batch tests were presented in a previous study wang et al 2021 and each test was performed thrice the morphologies of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms at different stages were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6330f jeol corp japan the particle size distribution psd of the ubf granules was determined using a mastersizer malvern 3000 uk

emission wavelengths em were set from 200 to 550 nm with a 5 nm step while the excitation wavelengths ex were detected from 200 to 400 nm with a 2 nm step the scan speed was set at 30 000 nm min parafac modeling was performed using matlab r2019a with the domfluor toolbox according to the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 2 3 calculation methods to quantify the contribution rate of denitrification and methanogenesis in the ubf reactor the rates of cod removal by total anaerobic bacteria denitrification and methanogenesis were calculated using eqs 1 3 respectively according to

construction to determine the impact of elevated c n ratios on network interactions in the smd n system an online molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena molecular ecological network analysis mena was employed to construct phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens of the microbial communities within the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms from the three different stages six full networks were constructed for this study the construction of pmens is based on the random matrix theory rmt luo et al 2006 to evaluate the interactions between several key functional genera and other bacteria in ubf granules and mbbr biofilms 18 sub networks were constructed using mena the six full networks of ubf granules and mbbr biofilms were constructed using rarefied asv tables while the genus tables were used to construct 18 sub networks the detailed process of pmens construction has been provided in a previous study xu et al 2021 the topological roles of microbiomes were determined by among module connectivity pi and with module connectivity zi and gephi software version 0 9 2 was used to visualize the pmens 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the ubf mbbr process during the entire operation cod was efficiently removed by the combined ubf mbbr in three stages 98 19 0 31 96 10 1 10 97 99 0 62 p 0 01 fig 2 a the ubf contributed more than 96 in cod removal measurement by eem fluorescence indicated that the anaerobic treatment by ubf yielded considerable aromatic proteins which were then removed by the mbbr process fig s1 the results also showed that the methane yield of the ubf decreased gradually p 0 01 0 23 0 01 0 18 0 02 and 0 12 0 01 m3 kg cod with decreasing influent c n ratios 40 20 and 10 fig 2d since the occurrence of denitrification can consume a large portion of organics however no significant difference p 0 05 2800 9 122 1 2646 1 201 0 and 2718 4 126 2 ml d respectively was found in gas production fig 2d among the three stages the decreased methane production and stable total gas production can be attributed to the increased nitrogen gas production with increasing ammonium nitrogen loadings for example increasing biogas ratio of n2 and ch4 with decreasing c n ratios in the influent fig s2f except for the fluctuations at the beginning of stage ii days 70 75 and iii days 123 151 the ammonium concentrations of the mbbr effluent were maintained below 0 33 mg n l fig 2b the mbbr exhibited satisfactory nitrification during the stable operation of the three stages no obvious accumulation of nitrite was observed in the mbbr effluent in the first two stages fig s2a owing to the sudden decrease in the influent c n ratio slight fluctuations in nitrite 0 702 7 878 mg n l were observed at the beginning of stage iii as shown in fig 2c nitrate was the main nitrogen species of the effluent of the smd n system the effluent nitrate averaged at 11 8 mg n l 9 2 mg n l and 81 8 mg n l at stages i ii and iii respectively no significant difference was found in the removal efficiency of total nitrogen among the three operational stages p 0 05 81 6 1 5 82 2 0 9 and 79 1 0 7 respectively fig s2b indicating that the decrease in c n ratio did not significantly affect the removal of total nitrogen according to the mass balance calculations fig s4b the role of denitrification increased in the cod degradation 7 31 25 14 and 47 62 respectively along with the reactor operation meanwhile the removal efficiency of total nitrogen 79 83 over the entire operation was slightly higher than the theoretical nitrogen removal rate 75 likely due to microbial assimilation and the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd processes tugtas et al 2010 as shown in table s3 our compact ubf mbbr process harbors satisfying or greater carbon and nitrogen removal performance compared with other traditional biological processes in contrast to ahn et al 2007 no significant dissimilatory nitrate reduction phenomenon was observed in this study even when the influent nh4 n concentration reached 400 mg l in brief 1 75 1 80 kg cod m3 d of orr and 0 037 0 24 kg n m3 d of narr were achieved in the ubf reactor while 0 061 0 36 kg n m3 d of arr were detected in the mbbr fig s5 3 2 metabolic activity and morphology of ubf granules and mbbr biofilms to explore the activity of functional bacteria methanogens denitrifiers and nitrifiers in the combined ubf mbbr system a series of batch tests were conducted to determine the specific rates of ch4 production and nitrogen removal as the influent c n ratio decreased from 40 to 5 the smas of the ubf granules decreased significantly fig 3 a table s4 and the sdnrs increased substantially fig 3b table s4 similar smas results have been reported by sun 2018 the sdnrs of the ubf granules in our study were similar to those of thermophilic denitrifying granular sludge cultivated by shi et al 2022 as shown in fig 3b the snrs of mbbr biofilms were determined to be 43 77 1 87 51 90 3 85 and 103 61 14 79 mg n g vss h respectively at stage i ii and iii the changing smas sdnrs and snrs of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms might be associated with the varying abundance of functional bacteria in the three stages the sem images of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms are shown in fig s6 compared to stage i more eps and cocci were detected in the ubf granules at stages ii and iii according to wang et al 2020 denitrifiers would release a large amount of extracellular protein on the surface of ubf granules when they predominate outside the granules in stage i a large number of filamentous bacteria were observed on the surface of the ubf granules fig s6 which is in agreement with previous smd research sun et al 2018 the sizes of the ubf granules are shown in fig s4a and table s5 the seeding sludge of ubf had a mean size of 55 6 Î¼m the mean sizes of the ubf granules increased to 885 960 and 1050 Î¼m at the end of stages i ii and iii respectively li et al 2016 also reported that denitrification can effectively accelerate anaerobic sludge granulation at stage i a large number of cocci were detected in the mbbr biofilms however as the c n ratio decreased from 40 to 10 and 5 the biomass of the mbbr biofilms increased significantly and filamentous bacteria gradually replaced cocci to become the dominant bacteria on the carrier surfaces fig s6 3 3 microbial community diversity and composition in ubf mbbr process a 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis was performed to further investigate the dynamic changes in the microbial community structure in the ubf mbbr system after clustering the clean sequences into asvs 5776 asvs were obtained from the 150 samples according to the Î± diversity analysis shannon and chao 1 as the influent ammonium concentrations increased from 50 to 200 and 400 mg l the microbial diversity of ubf granules exhibited a decreasing trend p 0 05 while that of mbbr biofilms showed an opposite trend p 0 05 fig s7 in this study over 1405 bacterial taxa were detected at the genus level the top 30 genera in the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms were analyzed as shown in fig 4 the nmds results fig 4a and 4b showed that the bacterial groups from the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms at the three stages were clearly separated indicating that the changing ammonium loadings significantly affected the community structures of the two reactors methanobacterium average of 2 18 and methanosaeta average of 19 06 were the two archaea with the high abundances in the ubf reactor fig 4c this finding is consistent with those reported by sun et al 2018 and yi et al 2016 besides they also observed that methanosaeta a type of methanogen that uses acetate as carbon source to produce methane was the dominant methanogen in the smd system with a decline in c n ratios from 40 to 5 the relative abundances of the two methanogens in the ubf granules decreased from 33 91 to 14 48 three highly abundant denitrifiers have been recognized in ubf granules i e candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter camejo et al 2016 notably the relative abundances of three key denitrifiers in the ubf granules were relatively low at stage i and averaged at 0 98 3 20 and 0 76 for candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter respectively the relative abundance of these three genera increased to 14 07 16 80 and 1 14 at stage iii nitrosomonas and nitrospira were detected as the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob respectively in the mbbr biofilms the average abundance of genera nitrosomonas from 0 92 to 11 33 and nitrospira from 5 15 to 13 87 increased significantly as the influent ammonium nitrogen increased from 50 to 400 mg l 3 4 full network and sub network of bacterial community to further understand the microbial interactions in the ubf mbbr process six rmt based full networks were constructed fig 5 a the small world coefficients Ï of the six full networks were all greater than 1 indicating that the constructed networks had typical modularity structures and small world characteristics table 1 the connectivity distributions of these networks fitted well with the r2 of power law model r2 0 7 it can be seen that the network of ubf granules displayed higher average clustering coefficient avgcc average connectivity avgk and shorter harmonic geodesic distance hd at stage iii compared to those in the first two stages the pmens of stage â² had a lower degree of modularity 0 284 as compared to those of the ubf granules in the first two stages 0 587 and 0 576 indicating that the microbial niche differentiation in the ubf at stage iii was relatively low similar to the ubf granules the pmens of the mbbr biofilms also harbored a smaller modularity and a higher avgk at stage iii accordingly the influent c n ratios had a similar impact on the topological characteristics of the ecological network of the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms the topological roles of the nodes and the ecological contribution of asvs were analyzed by calculating the within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi in different samples only one network hub asv235 anaerolineaceae g is was found in ubf granules at stage i among the six full networks fig s8 additionally 34 keystone asvs were detected in the three pmens of ubf granules which harbored more keystone species than mbbr biofilms 7 interestingly methanosaeta asv192 the dominant methanogen in the ubf granules was detected as a keystone species at stage i asv90 delftia were detected as the shared keystone species of ubf granules and mbbr biofilms in addition anaerolineaceae g is asv235 97 539 93 306 224 57 considered as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria hfb liu et al 2020 was identified as an important genus in ubf granules this result indicates that hfb seems to play a critical role in the formation and stabilization the of smd community however fewer keystone species were found in the mbbr biofilms 2 3 and 2 at stages i ii and iii respectively as shown in section 3 2 the ubf granules played a dominant role in denitrification and methanogenesis in the ubf reactor while the mbbr biofilms played a major role in nitrification thus sub networks of the related high abundance functional bacteria and their side populations in the ubf granules and mbbr biofilms were constructed to further reveal the potential interspecies interaction under the three different stages fig 5b a few side populations of methanosaeta 7 and 4 and candidatus competibacter 1 and 6 were found in stages i and ii while the numbers increased to 46 and 43 respectively in stage iii however thauera and acinetobacter exhibited different trends the number of side populations of thauera reached a peak at stage ii while a decreasing trend of that of acinetobacter was observed with an increase in influent ammonium concentrations suggesting that a high concentration of nitrate supplied to the ubf might reduce interspecies correlations among thauera acinetobacter and their neighbors notably negative correlations were detected between methanosaeta and denitrifiers candidatus competibacter denitratisoma and candidatus accumulibacter as discussed in section 3 3 nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the major players in ammonia oxidation in the mbbr compared with the functional genera in the ubf nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the mbbr harbored fewer side populations the sub networks of nitrosomonas and nitrospira at stage iii had more complex interactions and larger sizes than those at stage i and ii indicating that elevated influent ammonium concentrations might enhance the interactions among aob nob and other microorganisms as mentioned above the abundance of ch4 in biogas declined and that of n2 increased with the increasing c n ratios fig s2f in addition the role of denitrification in cod degradation increased to 47 62 in stage iii fig s4b this phenomenon was consistent with the significant interactions between methanogens and denitrifiers in stage iii a high concentration of no3 n returned to the bottom of the ubf which not only led to an increase of denitrifiers abundance but also intensified the competition between methanogens and denitrifiers for carbon sources it is assumed that although low c n ratios caused the lowest sma at stage iii fig s3a strong interactions between functional bacteria might enhance substrate availability lovley 2011 3 5 implications for high strength wastewater treatment the efficient removal of cod and tn in the novel ubf mbbr system indicates that high strength wastewater can be treated using a simple and compact process in general the conventional technologies applied for nutrient removal are based on a temporal or spatial sequence of different anaerobic anoxic and aerobic steps lacalle et al 2001 whereas our ubf mbbr system can achieve simultaneous removal of organics and ammonia using only two independent reactors integration of heterotrophic denitrification and methanogenesis in a single reactor can significantly reduce substrate costs energy consumption material and space andalib et al 2011 high free ammonia fa in wastewater might suppress methanogens lemaigre et al 2018 and nob wu et al 2021 in biological technology while the recirculation of mbbr effluent to the ubf could greatly dilute influent fa concentrations and reduce the inhibitory effects on functional bacteria moreover the ubf mbbr process was relatively insensitive to the influent c n ratio achieving excellent pollutant removal performance when the c n ratio varied in the range of 5 40 these results suggest that the smd n process has the potential to treat wastewater that contains various nitrogen sources however it takes a long time to develop stable nitrifying biofilms which limits the start up of nitrifying biofilm systems according to previous reports the presence of a moderate amount of organic matter can boost nitrifying biofilm growth via the cross feeding role of heterotrophic bacteria bassin et al 2012 luo and meng 2020 navada et al 2020 owing to the environmental limitations our study was based on synthetic wastewater further investigations removal kinetics of c and n functional bacteria operation parameters of real high strength wastewater treated by our ubf mbbr process are needed before its large scale application one more important limitation for this process is the co existence n2 and ch4 which will be a challenge to the usage of bio gas or the post purification of ch4 overall the results of this study provide new insights into the application and construction of simultaneous organics and nitrogen removal processes 4 conclusion to sum up the following conclusions can be drawn 1 this study proposed a novel ubf mbbr process for treatment of high strength wastewater which achieved satisfactory nutrient removal with an influent cod of 2000 mg l and varying ammonium concentrations 50 100 and 200 mg l 2 increasing ammonium concentrations in the influent led to a decrease in the relative abundance of methanogens e g methanobacterium and methanosaeta and lower smas while the abundance of denitrifiers e g candidatus competibacter thauera and acinetobacter in ubf granules and nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira in mbbr reactors increased as ammonium increased contributing to the increasing sdnrs of ubf granules and snrs of mbbr biofilms 3 the high concentrations of nitrate from the mbbr induced strong competition between methanogens and denitrifiers in the ubf granules as the ammonium concentration increased to 200 mg l the aob and nob in the mbbr biofilms maintained a relatively weak correlation with their neighbors over the entire operation supporting information file the followings are the supplementary data related to this article 3d eem spectra and

whether mps in the river would also selectively enrich args and the underlying mechanisms shaping the resistome on mps remains largely unknown in this study we explored the occurrence of args bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements mges on mps and in waters from the huangpu river in china microplastics were widely distributed in the river 1 78 0 84 items l with overwhelming percentages of polyethylene terephthalate fibers although reduced arg abundances were observed on mps than in waters mps selectively enriched the args resistant to rifamycin and vancomycin a clear variation for arg profiles was elucidated between water and mps samples network analysis suggested that mps created a unique niche for the genus afipia to colonize potentially contributing to the vertical dissemination of args additionally the co occurrence between args and mges revealed that the mps favor the propagation of some plasmid associated args mediated by horizontal gene transfer the null model based stochasticity ratio and the neutral community model suggested that the arg assembly on mps was dominantly driven by stochastic process the results further indicated that microbial communities and mges played significant roles in shaping arg profiles and dynamics on mps our findings provided new insights into the ecological processes of antibiotic resistome of the aquatic plastisphere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics metagenomics antibiotic resistant genes mobile genetic elements selective enrichment network analysis 1 introduction microplastics mps defined as synthetic polymers 5 mm in size have aroused ever increasing concerns due to their ubiquity in global environments and the potential threat to future generations hamid et al 2018 wright and kelly 2017 although more than 96 mps studies focused on the marine system li et al 2018 the near permanent contaminants in lakes and rivers are of paramount importance as freshwater systems can transport mps from land to the sea peng et al 2017 xu et al 2020 in addition to posing choking hazards liao et al 2021 as well as arising mortality neurotoxicity and genotoxicity by absorbing toxic chemicals hirai et al 2011 mei et al 2020 rochman et al 2013 mps surfaces act as a substrate for biofilm formation constituting a unique niche called the plastisphere zettler et al 2013 previous studies have reported the significant differences in taxonomic community compositions between mps surfaces and surrounding environmental media basili et al 2020 mccormick et al 2014 zhu et al 2022 additionally recent studies found that mps could enable the selective recruitment of the opportunistic pathogens and resistance genes which may represent a risk to human health and ecosystem safety arias andres et al 2018 shen et al 2021 antibiotic resistance genes args are regarded as emerging contaminants and have been ranked as a priority in the recent one health operational framework white and hughes 2019 currently over 200 subtypes of args have been detected in haihe river china luo et al 2010 river ganges india reddy and dubey 2019 mediterranean river calero cÃ¡ceres et al 2017 and even in antarctica na et al 2021 microplastics in these water systems provide bacterial niches and serve as dispersal vectors for disseminating args affecting their bio accessibility and increasing the ecological hazards to biogeochemical cycles keswani et al 2016 wang et al 2020b selective enrichment of args on mps has been previously reported for instance elevated absolute abundances of args sul2 on mps than surrounding waters were found in a coastal recirculating aquaculture system in china lu et al 2019 several intracellular args i e i teta i tetc i teto i sul1 and extracellular args i e e teta and e blatem were preferentially absorbed on the mps surfaces from a simulate adsorption experiment in the laboratory zhang et al 2022a 2022b however these studies have drawn the selective adsorption conclusions based on laboratory incubation experiments with specific polymers whether mps in the field would also selectively enrich args and the underlying mechanisms shaping the resistome on mps were still not sufficiently explored revealing the ecological mechanism of how args are assembled is of vital importance to understanding the arg characteristics on mps the studies about community assembly processes on mps have been previously estimated for instance based on the null and neutral model sun et al 2021 reported that stochastic processes dominantly contributed to the bacterial community assembly on mps collected from the estuary and urban rivers however which processes stochastic or deterministic is the main driver shaping the arg profiles on mps remains largely unknown additionally rivers and lakes are also recognized as hotspots for args since they harbor huge microbial genetic diversity and promote the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args the bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements mges are confirmed to be associated with the vertical and horizontal spread of args forsberg et al 2014 gillings et al 2015 thus clarifying the networks between bacterial community args and mges on mps would be critical for the comprehensive understanding of the effects of mps on the dissemination of args in the water systems liu et al 2022 shanghai located at the east coast of china is the most prosperous metropolis in the yangtze river delta as a landmark in shanghai the huangpu river starts from the dianshan lake and flows into the east china sea covering a total length of 113 km zhang et al 2017 it plays a significant role in the drinking water supply shipping transportation irrigation and tourism for the citizens zhang 2007 since the huangpu river is highly affected by anthropogenic activities and urbanization investigation of mps contamination in the river and its role in driving the assembling of args is of great importance to ecological security and human health along this river estuary sea continuum luo et al 2019 wu et al 2019a therefore we carried out this study based on the hypothesis that the bacterial assemblages on mps facilitate a higher rate of gene transfer and induce the enrichment of args by using a metagenomics approach guo et al 2017 the specific objectives of this study were set as follows 1 explore the spatial distributions of mps in the huangpu river and describe their abundances shapes sizes colors and polymer types 2 clarify the compositions and co occurrence of bacterial communities and args on mps and in surface waters and 3 disentangle the ecological processes shaping microbial community and args profiles on mps these findings can fill the gap regarding the co occurrence of mps and args in freshwater systems and elucidate the potential roles of mps in disseminating args at the watershed scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and mps characteristics according to the length and geographic background of the huangpu river microplastic particles and surrounding surface waters from 10 sampling sites were collected along the huangpu river in shanghai china in october 2021 fig s1 table s1 briefly 20 l of bulk water was sampled at each location the mp quantification was carried out in duplicates parallelly 5 l of sampled water was immediately filtered through a 50 Î¼m mesh sieve in situ residues on the sieve were washed using distilled water into 500 ml pre cleaned glass bottles which were marked as the pretreated mp samples and used for the quantification for the mp associated dna extraction 5 l of sampled water was also filtered through a 50 Î¼m mesh sieve in situ and the suspected mps were picked the left 5 l of sampled water was used for water dna extraction all the mps and water samples were then transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c prior to analysis approximately 2 5 l of water at each location was also parallelly sampled to measure the water physicochemical parameters the pretreated mp samples were further filtered and used for the identification the details can be found in the supporting information si after pretreatment processes mps were analyzed under a stereomicroscope followed by micro fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet in 10 mx thermo fisher usa in attenuated total reflectance atr mode the physical and chemical parameters at each sampling site including ph dissolved oxygen total nitrogen total phosphorus cod and toc were also measured table s2 2 2 dna extraction amplicon and metagenomic sequencing five l of water was used to extract the total water dna the water was filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m filter membrane and the membranes were stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction for mps the mps particle samples were collected from water and filtered through a 50 Î¼m mesh sieve in situ all suspected mps were picked using sterilized forceps observed under a stereomicroscope zsa0850t coic china at 40 and 200 magnification and placed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube for subsequent dna extraction the criteria of picking mps was following previous study hurley et al 2018 bacterial dna was extracted from water samples and mps using the e z n a stool dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s protocols after qualification the extracted dna was sequenced by metagenomic shotgun sequencing technology at shanghai biozeron biological technology co ltd in brief for each sample 1 Î¼g of genomic dna was sheared using a covaris s220 focused ultrasonicator woburn ma usa sequencing libraries were prepared with a fragment length of approximately 450 bp all samples were sequenced in the illumina hiseq x instrument in pair end 150 bp pe150 mode raw sequence reads underwent quality trimming by trimmomatic http www usadellab org cms uploads supplementary trimmomatic to remove adaptor contaminants and low quality reads bolger et al 2014 the raw sequence data were deposited in genome sequence archive under accession number prjca011465 the datasets generated during and or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 2 3 args and mges quantification after quality control the taxonomy of clean reads for each sample was determined by kraken2 wood and salzberg 2014 using the customized kraken database all reads were classified into seven phylogenetic levels domain phylum class order family genus species or unclassified the abundances of taxonomy were estimated by bracken https ccb jhu edu software bracken which can produce accurate species and genus level abundance even in multiple near identical species relative abundance of a certain level in the article is a total of the abundance of species belonging to a certain level the arg abundance was determined using the args oap pipeline version 2 2 the parameters were set at e value of 10 7 sequence identity of 90 and alignment length of more than 25 amino acids the abundance of args was calculated and normalized by the number of 16s rrna genes which was expressed as copies of args per copy of 16s rrna gene yin et al 2018 to quantify the abundance of mges the args oap was used after replacing the reference database with a recently published mges database parnanen et al 2018 the abundance of mges was also normalized by the number of 16s rrna genes 2 4 quality assurance and quality control strict quality assurance and quality control measures were implemented throughout the experiment to avoid potential atmospheric airborne particles and aquatic plastic debris contamination all tools and equipment were cleaned with deionized water non plastic components were used all researchers wore cotton coats masks and nitrile gloves during the process the samples were covered by aluminum foil when not in use procedural blanks were also analyzed simultaneously to estimate the level of ambient environmental contamination distilled water 5 l was treated the same as the sampled water during the laboratory pretreatment process and the number of mps on the filter membrane was 2 2 1 3 items compared with precious studies the contamination of mps in procedural blanks could be omitted mao et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b 2 5 statistical analysis and data visualization various statistical analysis was carried out in r software version 4 0 2 the alpha diversity indexes were calculated by the vegan package principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis coupled with non parametric multivariate analysis of variance adonis was used to determine the significant differences in bacterial communities and arg profiles between mps and water samples procrustes analysis which seeks to superimpose align and scale multiple graphical structures was performed to assess the congruency of sample separations based on the bacterial community arg and meg signatures network visualization and topological properties were obtained using the gephi 9 1 with the correlation of r 0 7 and p 0 01 networks of args and bacterial communities from mps and water samples were constructed to check underlying relationships between args and dominant bacteria to predict the probable source of args detected in this study a bayesian modeling classification sourcetracker was employed and the source args was obtained from a previous study chen et al 2021 where 835 metagenomes were used and divided into human or animal associated sources to evaluate the contribution of bacterial communities and args in water to those on mps the sourcetracker was also used with planktonic bacteria and args as the source to evaluate the importance of stochastic process on bacterial communities and args assembly the sloan neutral community model ncm and null model based normalized stochasticity ratio nst were carried out ning et al 2019 sloan et al 2006 the parameter r 2 in ncm indicated the overall fit to the neutral model with positive values indicating the fit and negative values revealing no fit for the index nst higher values suggested the greater importance of stochastic processes the contribution of water quality taxonomic community and mges to the variation of args on microplastics were analyzed by variance partitioning analysis vpa to evaluate the potential links among the water quality taxonomic community mges and arg abundance on microplastics the partial least squares path modeling pls pm was carried out using the plspm package the direct and indirect effects on antibiotic resistome were further determined the overall prediction performance of this model was validated using the goodness of fit index gof with a higher value indicating better prediction performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 geographic distributions of mps in huangpu river microplastics were widely distributed at 10 sampling sites in huangpu river with the abundances ranging from 0 40 to 3 20 items l 1 78 0 84 items l figs 1 and s2 and table s3 no significant association was found between mps abundance and water quality indexes of do tn tp cod and toc table s4 the peak level occurred near downtown shanghai at site 7 which was probably derived from the intense human activity and high gross domestic product gdp density nearby huang et al 2020 kataoka et al 2019 the abundances of mps at sites downstream of site 8 9 and 10 were relatively higher than those upstream this observation was consistent with the previous studies in the nakdong river south korea and in rivers of the tibetan plateau and the lijiang river in guangxi china eo et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a these downstream environments received runoff and mps from the entire river flow which are deemed as ideal sites for mps accumulation furthermore site 1 and 2 also exhibited elevated mps contaminations which might be related to the neighboring industrial parks with nine plastic products co ltd included with regard to morphological characteristics the sizes of detected mps fig s3 a ranged from 43 47 to 5765 Î¼m and mps between 100 and 500 Î¼m made up 40 28 of all mps the shapes of mps included fiber fragment film and foam fig s3 b fibers represented the overwhelming percentages average 93 2 of the total population the most common colors observed in the mps particles were blue and transparent 41 06 and 39 13 respectively followed by black and red fig s3 c based on the Î¼ ftir results 11 polymers were identified in this study polyethylene terephthalate pet represented 62 50 of all mps polyamide pa was the second largest contributor accounting for 13 64 of the total population other polymers were ranked as follows polymethyl methacrylate pmma polyethylene pe polypropylene pp fig 2 table s3 consistently pet originating from wastewater treatment plants occupied the major proportion of all mps in xiamen bay china long et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 also observed the predominant polymers of pet and nylon in the yongjiang river in southeast china which was plausibly attributable to the fishery and textile industries 3 2 args and mges on mps and in surrounding waters retrieved from metagenomics data the relative abundances of args on mps ranged from 0 016 to 0 15 copies 16s rrna 0 060 0 042 copies 16s rrna which was significantly lower than the surrounding surface waters 0 17 0 032 copies 16s rrna p 0 05 fig 3 a a total of 19 args types were identified and the predominant proportion was given to multidrug resistant genes 0 059 and 0 027 copies 16s rrna respectively in both matrixes followed by genes encoding resistance to bacitracin 0 040 copies 16s rrna and sulfonamide 0 022 copies 16s rrna in waters and tetracycline 0 0086 copies 16s rrna and chloramphenicol 0 0078 copies 16s rrna on mps fig 3 b in accordance with our results the multidrug resistant genes had the highest percentage among all the arg types in sediments from 18 estuaries of the chinese coast zhu et al 2017 geographically speaking the abundance of args resistant to multidrug bacitracin and sulfonamide gradually increased along the huangpu river from the suburbs through downtown and towards the estuary fig s4 which reflected the intensity gradient of human activities and urbanization li et al 2021 although the majority of arg types showed lower abundances on mps markedly increased levels of the genes encoding resistance to rifamycin and vancomycin were observed on mps than in waters p 0 05 fig 3 b a significant separation along the primary principal coordinate 55 was observed in pcoa results with adonis r 2 0 694 and p 0 001 indicating distinct args profiles between these two matrixes fig 3 c additionally the beta diversity within mps and water samples further indicated the plastisphere args displayed a significantly higher dispersion than those in water for instance the average sample dissimilarity and the mean distance to group centroid for args on microplastics were 0 598 and 0 398 respectively which were significantly higher than the values for water args this finding suggested that the arg profiles on mps were more heterogeneous compared with those in water with regard to detailed subtypes 313 and 428 args subtypes were identified on mps and in waters fig s5 a the gene of baca encoding bacitracin resistance was the most abundant args subtypes in water samples 0 039 0 005 copies 16s rrna followed by sul1 and mext within sulfonamide and multidrug resistance genes the highest args subtypes on mps was also given to baca 0 007 0 007 copies 16s rrna followed by tet39 and cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase within tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistant genes according to previous studies bacitracin resistance genes were intrinsic in bacteria because its homologues can be widespread in 153 genera hu et al 2016 as a main subtype of bacitracin resistance gene baca is essential for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and other cell wall components el ghachi et al 2005 which may contribute to the survival of their bacterial hosts under various living environments this might be the reason accounting for the highest abundances of baca in both two matrixes in this study microplastics selectively enriched args subtypes of lnua tetracycline resistance protein adp ribosylating transferase arr mexl lra 12 rosa with the abundances of 5 3 172 6 folds higher than that in waters fig 4 a however baca sul1 sul2 macb mext qacedelta1 and mexw preferred occurred in waters than mps surface in this study the selective recruitment of args on microplastics has also been reported in previous studies for instance wang et al 2020 observed that the field collected mps harbored lower abundances of args than urban river waters but several subtypes of args e g tetm and tets showed higher relative abundances on mps similarly with laboratory incubation experiments wu et al 2019b reported that unique arg subtypes e g smee mdsc lnue arr 5 and cmx were selectively accumulated on polyvinyl chloride microplastic pellets our study coupled with previous observation potentially suggested that mp surfaces may selectively recruit specific args further studies were still needed to explore the underlying mechanisms five types of mges were identified i e plasmid transposase insertion sequence transposase ist insertion sequence is and integrase with transposase being the predominant mge in both matrix and mainly composed of is family and tn family the diversity of mges was higher in the water samples than those on mps with 82 and 101 subtypes of mges detected in mps and waters respectively fig s5 b additionally the mean abundances of mges on mps 0 077 copies 16s rrna were relatively lower than that in the waters 0 56 copies 16s rrna fig s6 however in comparison with the other four types of mges the relative abundances of plasmid on mps were significantly higher than the values in the waters several plasmids e g rep13 rep21 and rep7 were obviously enriched on mps this observation potentially suggested the importance of plasmid to the microbiome and resistome on mps arisa andres et al 2018 have demonstrate an increased frequency of plasmid transfer in bacteria associated with mps compared to the free living bacteria which further increased the gene exchange yuan et al 2022 explored the transfer frequency of intracellular plasmid borne args extracellular plasmid carried args and phage borne args on polystyrene mps and found that the transfer frequency of plasmid borne args were the highest among the three args types furthermore a recent study has observed that the conjugative antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 promoted the irreversible bacterial colonization of mps which to a certain extent revealed the contribution of plasmid to the microbiome and resistome on mps zhang et al 2022b considering the significant higher levels of plasmid on mps in this study more studies about the plasmid mediated arg propagation on mps should be necessary 3 3 bacterial community structure on mps and in surface waters the alpha diversity indexes were figured at the species level to estimate the richness and diversity of the microbial communities as fig 5 showed the richness and diversity of bacterial communities on mps were lower than those in waters with average chao1 index values of 3967 and 5264 and shannon index values of 7 43 and 8 22 respectively similar observations were previously reported from two coastal sites in mediterranean sea basili et al 2020 two urbanized rivers in zhejiang china wang et al 2020a and multiple locations in north atlantic zettler et al 2013 these findings revealed that surfaces of mps might harbor only certain kinds of bacteria from the surrounding aquatic environment the phylum proteobacteria predominated in both matrixes in this study average 52 1 on mps and 76 5 in waters fig 5 c however the relative proportion of bacteroidetes on mps 30 4 was markedly higher than that in waters 2 2 the compositions of bacterial communities in the huangpu river were similar to those in the yangtze river and the east china sea dong et al 2014 yang et al 2021 besides the phyla proteobacteria cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant on mps collected from zhoushan china li et al 2020 the major species on mps were also given to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes from an intensified mariculture area in the southeast of china dong et al 2021 pcoa results further indicated a significant separation r 2 0 501 p 0 001 along the primary principal coordinate 70 between bacterial communities on mps and in waters similar to the arg results the microbial communities on mps also showed greater heterogeneity than the planktonic communities fig 5 e f the significantly higher within group variation of microbial community and args for plastisphere on mps may be attributed to their uncertain history where the original sources and transport processes of mps in the aquatic environments are not clear to further illustrate the differentiation of microbiota and resistome between plastisphere and planktonic communities we calculated the relative contribution of bacteria and args in water samples to those on mps by using sourcetracker analysis fig s7 the planktonic communities contributed 3 8 23 7 to the plastisphere microbiome and the relative contribution of args in water samples was estimated to be 7 1 59 4 however the potential contribution of known human or animal associated sources on the args in the plastisphere was severely limited the substantial contributions from the unknown sources to the plastisphere may play vital roles in this unique niche 3 4 co occurrence among args mges and microbial communities the network analysis based on significant correlations r 0 7 and p 0 01 revealed the co occurrence patterns between args and microbial species in waters and mps r 0 7 and p 0 01 as the fig 6 a b demonstrated the nodes and diameters 137 and 11 respectively of the mps network were smaller than those of the waters 208 and 12 respectively which showed fewer bacteria and args subtypes on the mps reduced average path length 2 339 and modularity 0 104 of the mps network indicated stronger correlations between the bacterial communities and args on mps higher values of edges 3168 average degree 46 511 density 0 342 and clustering coefficient 0 793 observed in the network of mps revealed more complex network relationships and communications between bacterial genera on mps table s5 concretely speaking taxonomic profiles of bacterial genera and connections with arg populations were distinct between waters and mps in water samples a total of 104 bacterial genera and 58 arg subtypes constituted the network plot under cutoffs among these potential bacterial hosts of args dechloromonas and delftia within phylum proteobacteria were highly correlated with the most diverse args 14 subtypes including sul1 sul2 tetc tetg qacedltal followed by acidovorax that was correlated with 12 args subtypes ampc amrb class c beta lactamase and tet a were the most significant args subtypes which highly correlated with over 20 bacterial genera in waters sul1 and sul2 also solely linked to 19 and 17 bacterial genera respectively on mps particles a total of 82 bacterial genera and 43 args subtypes constituted the network plots the genus afipia was highly correlated with 28 args subtypes including aac 2 i adp ribosylating transferase arr cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mexi tem 1 and tetv these six args subtypes were also selectively enriched on mps themselves thus mps may create a special niche for the genus afipia from phylum proteobacteria to live and act as a potential host for these args disseminating in addition cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase also had strong positive correlations with bradyrhizobium and nitrobacter indicating the significant roles of the two bacterial genera in vertical gene transfer of cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase via active biomass growth on mps colonization of mps by these specific bacteria may provide advantages in terms exchange and acquisition of new genetic traits dang et al 2008 the co occurrence patterns of mges and args subtypes in waters and mps was further explored in water samples the most significant mges was is91 that linked 14 subtypes of args the gene of tnpa 2 also solely linked 8 subtypes of args and jointly connected some other subtypes of args with transposase subtypes fig 6 c as the largest contributor of args abundance in waters baca was only positively associated with tnpa 1 indicating the hgt mediated by tnpa 1 additionally sul1 and sul2 were most significant args in waters and exhibited dense connections with 17 and 14 subtypes of args both sul1 and sul2 jointly connected with transposase tnpa 2 tnpa2 tnpa13 tnpa 1 tnpa1 tnpa insertion sequence is91 and integrase intl1 the class 1 integron integrase gene was represented as a proxy for anthropogenic args contamination gillings et al 2015 another watershed study also found that inti1 was positively correlated with the sul1 and sul2 indicating inti1 played a vital role in the hgt of sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes among different media in ganjiang river hu et al 2021 with regard to mps tnpab was the most significant mges that linked 13 subtypes of args the gene of baca was the most significant args that linked to 8 mges on the mps fig 6 d it was noteworthy that significant enrichment of the mge subtypes of isrj1 rep7 and rep21 was observed on mps with the abundances of 34 5 374 9 folds higher than that in waters figs s5 b and 4 b rep7 and rep21 were considered as hallmark genes for plasmids the strong positive association between rep21 and lnua r 0 927 p 0 01 as well as rep7 and tetracycline resistance protein r 0 985 p 0 01 were only observed on mps rather than waters considering mps selectively enriched args subtypes of lnua and tetracy cline resistance protein from surrounding water it could be hypothesized that novel niche created by the presence of mps favors disseminating of some plasmid associated args mediated by hgt 3 5 assembly processes of args and microbiota the frequency of arg occurrence in water and mps samples showed well fit to the neutral model with r 2 values of 0 631 and 0 516 respectively indicating the neutral processes were an important mechanism in shaping the arg profiles fig 7 the null model based nst values for args in water samples mean 78 2 were significantly higher than those in the plastisphere 58 7 potentially suggesting that the importance of stochastic processes was greater for args in aquatic environments for the microbial communities the frequency of the microbial species occurrence in water and mps were also well described by the neutral model with r 2 values of 0 465 and 0 569 respectively suggesting a high proportion of the contribution of stochasticity on the community assembly the mean nst values of microbial community assemblages in water and mps were 89 1 and 62 9 confirming that those communities were predominately governed by stochastic processes 50 additionally the m values in the neutral models which described the migration rate of args or taxa were significantly higher in water samples than those on mps suggesting the less dispersal of microplastic carried args or microbiota when compared with the planktonic args or microorganisms in the lotic ecosystems the finding that stochastic processes were the main driver of taxonomic community variability on mps was consistent with previous studies for instance sun et al 2021 reported that the stochastic processes of drift and dispersal limitation dominantly shaped the bacterial community assembly on field collected mps even for the soil plastisphere the importance of stochastic processes was also observed zhu et al 2022 this may be attributed to that the plastisphere communities are stable microbial assemblages which may be resistant against the changing environmental factors while for arg assembly the stochastic processes also dominantly drove the args variability in water and mps samples in this study the samples were collected from an urbanizing river where mild water environmental changes were observed the homogeneous environmental condition may contribute to the stochastic assembly of args in water samples with regard to args on mps they may vary following the changes in microbial communities furthermore the contribution of stochastic processes on arg assembly in water was relatively greater than those on mps which may be potentially attributable to the higher abundance of mges detected in the water samples to better illustrate the correlation among args mges and microbial communities we applied the mantel test and procrustes analysis to evaluate their relationships fig 8 significant correlations p 0 001 were observed between args and microbial communities as well as args and mges the variance partitioning analysis was further carried out to evaluate the contribution of environmental conditions microbial communities and mges to the variation in arg profiles on mps the microbial community explained 36 6 of arg variation followed by water quality 26 1 and mges 21 3 fig 8 c the pls pm model was parallelly used to estimate the effects of the three aspects on arg abundance on mps the microbial community had the highest direct positive effect on arg abundance on mps suggesting a coupling function and taxonomy in the microbial communities on mps all these findings confirmed that the plastisphere communities play an important role in the dissemination and dynamics of args on microplastics in aquatic environments 4 conclusion microplastics have been widely detected in the huangpu river in shanghai with pet fibers were identified as the major contributor in this study we leveraged metagenomics combined with various statistical analysis to investigate the variarion and disentangled the relationships of bacterial communities args and mges on mps and in waters from the huangpu river in china the majority of arg types showed lower abundances on mps while mps selectively enriched the args encoding resistance to rifamycin and vancomycin results of bacterial community structures illustrated mps might harbor only certain kinds of bacteria from the surrounding waters however the unique niche created by mps for the genus afipia to colonize potentially contribute to the vertical spread of args and the presence of mps favors the dissemination of some plasmid associated args mediated by horizontal gene transfer in addition mechanism analysis revealed the stronger stochastic processes of args profiles and microbial communities on mps the plastisphere communities had direct solid effects on arg distribution on mps these findings highlighted the significant roles of mps in the enrichment and transfer of pathogenic bacteria and args in natural environment for the future study considering the global spread of mps in aquatic environments whether a habitable niche formed on the mps surface will exacerbate the potential risks of args to ecologic health remains need further investigation more studies are still required to assess the microplastic flux from the rivers to seas and the potential risk of args colonized on the mps via the food web moreover the co occurrence of antibiotics and resistance genes in waters and mps and their network associations also deserved further investigation these together with proposed perspectives require continuous efforts to formulate priority lists of args and their bacterial hosts declaration of competing interest the

15471,microplastics in urban rivers provide bacterial niches and serve as dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistant genes args dissemination which may exacerbate risks in the aquatic systems however whether mps in the river would also selectively enrich args and the underlying mechanisms shaping the resistome on mps remains largely unknown in this study we explored the occurrence of args

percentages of polyethylene terephthalate fibers although reduced arg abundances were observed on mps than in waters mps selectively enriched the args resistant to rifamycin and vancomycin a clear variation for arg profiles was elucidated between water and mps samples network analysis suggested that mps created a unique niche for the genus afipia to colonize potentially contributing to the vertical dissemination of args additionally the co occurrence between args and mges revealed that the mps favor the propagation of some plasmid associated args mediated by horizontal gene transfer the null model based stochasticity ratio and the neutral community model suggested that the arg assembly on mps was dominantly driven by stochastic process the results further indicated that microbial

2013 previous studies have reported the significant differences in taxonomic community compositions between mps surfaces and surrounding environmental media basili et al 2020 mccormick et al 2014 zhu et al 2022 additionally recent studies found that mps could enable the selective recruitment of the opportunistic pathogens and resistance genes which may represent a risk to human health and ecosystem safety arias andres et al 2018 shen et al 2021 antibiotic resistance genes args are regarded as emerging contaminants and have been ranked as a priority in the recent one health operational framework white and hughes 2019 currently over 200 subtypes of args have been detected in haihe river china luo et al 2010 river ganges india reddy and dubey 2019 mediterranean river calero cÃ¡ceres et al 2017 and even in antarctica na et al 2021 microplastics in these water systems provide bacterial niches and serve as dispersal vectors for disseminating args affecting their bio accessibility and increasing the ecological hazards to biogeochemical cycles keswani et al 2016 wang et al 2020b selective enrichment of args on mps has been previously reported for instance elevated absolute abundances of args sul2 on mps than surrounding waters were found in a coastal recirculating aquaculture system in china lu et al 2019 several intracellular args i e i teta i tetc i teto i sul1 and extracellular args i e e teta and e blatem were preferentially absorbed on the mps surfaces from a simulate adsorption experiment in the laboratory zhang et al 2022a 2022b however these studies have drawn the selective adsorption conclusions based on laboratory incubation experiments with specific polymers whether mps in the field would also selectively enrich args and the underlying mechanisms shaping the resistome on mps were still not sufficiently explored revealing the ecological mechanism of how args are assembled is of vital importance to understanding the arg characteristics on mps the studies about community assembly processes on mps have been previously estimated for instance based on the null and neutral model sun et al 2021 reported that stochastic processes dominantly contributed to the bacterial community assembly on mps collected from the estuary and urban rivers however which processes stochastic or deterministic is the main driver shaping the arg profiles on mps remains largely unknown additionally rivers and lakes are also recognized as hotspots for args since they harbor huge microbial genetic diversity and promote the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args the bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements mges are confirmed to be associated with the vertical and horizontal spread of args forsberg et al 2014 gillings et al 2015 thus clarifying the networks between bacterial community args and mges on mps would be critical for the comprehensive understanding of the effects of mps on the dissemination of args in the water systems liu et al 2022 shanghai located at the east coast of china is the most prosperous metropolis in the yangtze river delta as a landmark in shanghai the huangpu river starts from the dianshan lake and flows into the east china sea covering a total length of 113 km zhang et al 2017 it plays a significant role in the drinking water supply shipping transportation irrigation and tourism for the citizens zhang 2007 since the huangpu river is highly affected by anthropogenic activities and urbanization investigation of mps contamination in the river and its role in driving the assembling of args is of great importance to ecological security and human health along this river estuary sea continuum luo et al 2019 wu et al 2019a therefore we carried out this study based on the hypothesis that the bacterial assemblages on mps facilitate a higher rate of gene transfer and induce the enrichment of args by using a metagenomics approach guo et al 2017 the specific objectives of this study were set as follows 1 explore the spatial distributions of mps in the huangpu river and describe their abundances shapes sizes colors and polymer types 2 clarify the compositions and co occurrence of bacterial communities and args on mps and in surface waters and 3 disentangle the ecological processes shaping microbial community and args profiles on mps these findings can fill the gap regarding the co occurrence of mps and args in freshwater systems and elucidate the potential roles of mps in disseminating args at the watershed scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and mps characteristics according to the length and geographic background of the huangpu river microplastic particles and surrounding surface waters from 10 sampling sites were collected along the huangpu river in shanghai china in october 2021 fig s1 table s1 briefly 20 l of bulk water was sampled at each location the mp quantification was carried out in duplicates parallelly 5 l of sampled water was immediately filtered through a 50 Î¼m mesh sieve in situ residues on the sieve were washed using distilled water into 500 ml pre cleaned glass bottles which were marked as the pretreated mp samples and used for the quantification for the mp associated dna extraction 5 l of sampled water was also filtered through a 50 Î¼m mesh sieve in situ and the suspected mps were picked the left 5 l of sampled water was used for water dna extraction all the mps and water samples were then transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c prior to analysis approximately 2 5 l of water at each location was also parallelly sampled to measure the water physicochemical parameters the pretreated mp samples were further filtered and used for the identification the details can be found in the supporting information si after pretreatment processes mps were analyzed under a stereomicroscope followed by micro fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet in 10 mx thermo fisher usa in attenuated total reflectance atr mode the physical and chemical parameters at each sampling site including ph dissolved oxygen total nitrogen total phosphorus cod and toc were also measured table s2 2 2 dna extraction amplicon and metagenomic sequencing five l of water was used to extract the total water dna the water was filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m filter membrane and the membranes were stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction for mps the mps particle samples were collected from water and filtered through a 50 Î¼m mesh sieve in situ all suspected mps were picked using sterilized forceps observed under a stereomicroscope zsa0850t coic china at 40 and 200 magnification and placed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube for subsequent dna extraction the criteria of picking mps was following previous study hurley et al 2018 bacterial dna was extracted from water samples and mps using the e z n a stool dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s protocols after qualification the extracted dna was sequenced by metagenomic shotgun sequencing technology at shanghai biozeron biological technology co ltd in brief for each sample 1 Î¼g of genomic dna was sheared using a covaris s220 focused ultrasonicator woburn ma usa sequencing libraries were prepared with a fragment length of approximately 450 bp all samples were sequenced in the illumina hiseq x instrument in pair end 150 bp pe150 mode raw sequence reads underwent quality trimming by trimmomatic http www usadellab org cms uploads supplementary trimmomatic to remove adaptor contaminants and low quality reads bolger et al 2014 the raw sequence data were deposited in genome sequence archive under accession number prjca011465 the datasets generated during and or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 2 3 args and mges quantification after quality control the taxonomy of clean reads for each sample was determined by kraken2 wood and salzberg 2014 using the customized kraken database all reads were classified into seven phylogenetic levels domain phylum class order family genus species or unclassified the abundances of taxonomy were estimated by bracken https ccb jhu edu software bracken which can produce accurate species and genus level abundance even in multiple near identical species relative abundance of a certain level in the article is a total of the abundance of species belonging to a certain level the arg abundance was determined using the args oap pipeline version 2 2 the parameters were set at e value of 10 7 sequence identity of 90 and alignment length of more than 25 amino acids the abundance of args was calculated and normalized by the number of 16s rrna genes which was expressed as copies of args per copy of 16s rrna gene yin et al 2018 to quantify the abundance of mges the args oap was used after replacing the reference database with a recently published mges database parnanen et al 2018 the abundance of mges was also normalized by the number of 16s rrna genes 2 4 quality assurance and quality control strict quality assurance and quality control measures were implemented throughout the experiment to avoid potential atmospheric airborne particles and aquatic plastic debris contamination all tools and equipment were cleaned with deionized water non plastic components were used all researchers wore cotton coats masks and nitrile gloves during the process the samples were covered by aluminum foil when not in use procedural blanks were also analyzed simultaneously to estimate the level of ambient environmental contamination distilled water 5 l was treated the same as the sampled water during the laboratory pretreatment process and the number of mps on the filter membrane was 2 2 1 3 items compared with precious studies the contamination of mps in procedural blanks could be omitted mao et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b 2 5 statistical analysis and data visualization various statistical analysis was carried out in r software version 4 0 2 the alpha diversity indexes were calculated by the vegan package principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis coupled with non parametric multivariate analysis of variance adonis was used to determine the significant differences in bacterial communities and arg profiles between mps and water samples procrustes analysis which seeks to superimpose align and scale multiple graphical structures was performed to assess the congruency of sample separations based on the bacterial community arg and meg signatures network visualization and topological properties were obtained using the gephi 9 1 with the correlation of r 0 7 and p 0 01 networks of args and bacterial communities from mps and water samples were constructed to check underlying relationships between args and dominant bacteria to predict the probable source of args detected in this study a bayesian modeling classification sourcetracker was employed and the source args was obtained from a previous study chen et al 2021 where 835 metagenomes were used and divided into human or animal associated sources to evaluate the contribution of bacterial communities and args in water to those on mps the sourcetracker was also used with planktonic bacteria and args as the source to evaluate the importance of stochastic process on bacterial communities and args assembly the sloan neutral community model ncm and null model based normalized stochasticity ratio nst were carried out ning et al 2019 sloan et al 2006 the parameter r 2 in ncm indicated the overall fit to the neutral model with positive values indicating the fit and negative values revealing no fit for the index nst higher values suggested the greater importance of stochastic processes the contribution of water quality taxonomic community and mges to the variation of args on microplastics were analyzed by variance partitioning analysis vpa to evaluate the potential links among the water quality taxonomic community mges and arg abundance on microplastics the partial least squares path modeling pls pm was carried out using the plspm package the direct and indirect effects on antibiotic resistome were further determined the overall prediction performance of this model was validated using the goodness of fit index gof with a higher value indicating better prediction performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 geographic distributions of mps in huangpu river microplastics were widely distributed at 10 sampling sites in huangpu river with the abundances ranging from 0 40 to 3 20 items l 1 78 0 84 items l figs 1 and s2 and table s3 no significant association was found between mps abundance and water quality indexes of do tn tp cod and toc table s4 the peak level occurred near downtown shanghai at site 7 which was probably derived from the intense human activity and high gross domestic product gdp density nearby huang et al 2020 kataoka et al 2019 the abundances of mps at sites downstream of site 8 9 and 10 were relatively higher than those upstream this observation was consistent with the previous studies in the nakdong river south korea and in rivers of the tibetan plateau and the lijiang river in guangxi china eo et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a these downstream environments received runoff and mps from the entire river flow which are deemed as ideal sites for mps accumulation furthermore site 1 and 2 also exhibited elevated mps contaminations which might be related to the neighboring industrial parks with nine plastic products co ltd included with regard to morphological characteristics the sizes of detected mps fig s3 a ranged from 43 47 to 5765 Î¼m and mps between 100 and 500 Î¼m made up 40 28 of all mps the shapes of mps included fiber fragment film and foam fig s3 b fibers represented the overwhelming percentages average 93 2 of the total population the most common colors observed in the mps particles were blue and transparent 41 06 and 39 13 respectively followed by black and red fig s3 c based on the Î¼ ftir results 11 polymers were identified in this study polyethylene terephthalate pet represented 62 50 of all mps polyamide pa was the second largest contributor accounting for 13 64 of the total population other polymers were ranked as follows polymethyl methacrylate pmma polyethylene pe polypropylene pp fig 2 table s3 consistently pet originating from wastewater treatment plants occupied the major proportion of all mps in xiamen bay china long et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 also observed the predominant polymers of pet and nylon in the yongjiang river in southeast china which was plausibly attributable to the fishery and textile industries 3 2 args and mges on mps and in surrounding waters retrieved from metagenomics data the relative abundances of args on mps ranged from 0 016 to 0 15 copies 16s rrna 0 060 0 042 copies 16s rrna which was significantly lower than the surrounding surface waters 0 17 0 032 copies 16s rrna p 0 05 fig 3 a a total of 19 args types were identified and the predominant proportion was given to multidrug resistant genes 0 059 and 0 027 copies 16s rrna respectively in both matrixes followed by genes encoding resistance to bacitracin 0 040 copies 16s rrna and sulfonamide 0 022 copies 16s rrna in waters and tetracycline 0 0086 copies 16s rrna and chloramphenicol 0 0078 copies 16s rrna on mps fig 3 b in accordance with our results the multidrug resistant genes had the highest percentage among all the arg types in sediments from 18 estuaries of the chinese coast zhu et al 2017 geographically speaking the abundance of args resistant to multidrug bacitracin and sulfonamide gradually increased along the huangpu river from the suburbs through downtown and towards the estuary fig s4 which reflected the intensity gradient of human activities and urbanization li et al 2021 although the majority of arg types showed lower abundances on mps markedly increased levels of the genes encoding resistance to rifamycin and vancomycin were observed on mps than in waters p 0 05 fig 3 b a significant separation along the primary principal coordinate 55 was observed in pcoa results with adonis r 2 0 694 and p 0 001 indicating distinct args profiles between these two matrixes fig 3 c additionally the beta diversity within mps and water samples further indicated the plastisphere args displayed a significantly higher dispersion than those in water for instance the average sample dissimilarity and the mean distance to group centroid for args on microplastics were 0 598 and 0 398 respectively which were significantly higher than the values for water args this finding suggested that the arg profiles on mps were more heterogeneous compared with those in water with regard to detailed subtypes 313 and 428 args subtypes were identified on mps and in waters fig s5 a the gene of baca encoding bacitracin resistance was the most abundant args subtypes in water samples 0 039 0 005 copies 16s rrna followed by sul1 and mext within sulfonamide and multidrug resistance genes the highest args subtypes on mps was also given to baca 0 007 0 007 copies 16s rrna followed by tet39 and cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase within tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistant genes according to previous studies bacitracin resistance genes were intrinsic in bacteria because its homologues can be widespread in 153 genera hu et al 2016 as a main subtype of bacitracin resistance gene baca is essential for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and other cell wall components el ghachi et al 2005 which may contribute to the survival of their bacterial hosts under various living environments this might be the reason accounting for the highest abundances of baca in both two matrixes in this study microplastics selectively enriched args subtypes of lnua tetracycline resistance protein adp ribosylating transferase arr mexl lra 12 rosa with the abundances of 5 3 172 6 folds higher than that in waters fig 4 a however baca sul1 sul2 macb mext qacedelta1 and mexw preferred occurred in waters than mps surface in this study the selective recruitment of args on microplastics has also been reported in previous studies for instance wang et al 2020 observed that the field collected mps harbored lower abundances of args than urban river waters but several subtypes of args e g tetm and tets showed higher relative abundances on mps similarly with laboratory incubation experiments wu et al 2019b reported that unique arg subtypes e g smee mdsc lnue arr 5 and cmx were selectively accumulated on polyvinyl chloride microplastic pellets our study coupled with previous observation potentially suggested that mp surfaces may selectively recruit specific args further studies were still needed to explore the underlying mechanisms five types of mges were identified i e plasmid transposase insertion sequence transposase ist insertion sequence is and integrase with transposase being the predominant mge in both matrix and mainly composed of is family and tn family the diversity of mges was higher in the water samples than those on mps with 82 and 101 subtypes of mges detected in mps and waters respectively fig s5 b additionally the mean abundances of mges on mps 0 077 copies 16s rrna were relatively lower than that in the waters 0 56 copies 16s rrna fig s6 however in comparison with the other four types of mges the relative abundances of plasmid on mps were significantly higher than the values in the waters several plasmids e g rep13 rep21 and rep7 were obviously enriched on mps this observation potentially suggested the importance of plasmid to the microbiome and resistome on mps arisa andres et al 2018 have demonstrate an increased frequency of plasmid transfer in bacteria associated with mps compared to the free living bacteria which further increased the gene exchange yuan et al 2022 explored the transfer frequency of intracellular plasmid borne args extracellular plasmid carried args and phage borne args on polystyrene mps and found that the transfer frequency of plasmid borne args were the highest among the three args types furthermore a recent study has observed that the conjugative antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 promoted the irreversible bacterial colonization of mps which to a certain extent revealed the contribution of plasmid to the microbiome and resistome on mps zhang et al 2022b considering the significant higher levels of plasmid on mps in this study more studies about the plasmid mediated arg propagation on mps should be necessary 3 3 bacterial community structure on mps and in surface waters the alpha diversity indexes were figured at the species level to estimate the richness and diversity of the microbial communities as fig 5 showed the richness and diversity of bacterial communities on mps were lower than those in waters with average chao1 index values of 3967 and 5264 and shannon index values of 7 43 and 8 22 respectively similar observations were previously reported from two coastal sites in mediterranean sea basili et al 2020 two urbanized rivers in zhejiang china wang et al 2020a and multiple locations in north atlantic zettler et al 2013 these findings revealed that surfaces of mps might harbor only certain kinds of bacteria from the surrounding aquatic environment the phylum proteobacteria predominated in both matrixes in this study average 52 1 on mps and 76 5 in waters fig 5 c however the relative proportion of bacteroidetes on mps 30 4 was markedly higher than that in waters 2 2 the compositions of bacterial communities in the huangpu river were similar to those in the yangtze river and the east china sea dong et al 2014 yang et al 2021 besides the phyla proteobacteria cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant on mps collected from zhoushan china li et al 2020 the major species on mps were also given to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes from an intensified mariculture area in the southeast of china dong et al 2021 pcoa results further indicated a significant separation r 2 0 501 p 0 001 along the primary principal coordinate 70 between bacterial communities on mps and in waters similar to the arg results the microbial communities on mps also showed greater heterogeneity than the planktonic communities fig 5 e f the significantly higher within group variation of microbial community and args for plastisphere on mps may be attributed to their uncertain history where the original sources and transport processes of mps in the aquatic environments are not clear to further illustrate the differentiation of microbiota and resistome between plastisphere and planktonic communities we calculated the relative contribution of bacteria and args in water samples to those on mps by using sourcetracker analysis fig s7 the planktonic communities contributed 3 8 23 7 to the plastisphere microbiome and the relative contribution of args in water samples was estimated to be 7 1 59 4 however the potential contribution of known human or animal associated sources on the args in the plastisphere was severely limited the substantial contributions from the unknown sources to the plastisphere may play vital roles in this unique niche 3 4 co occurrence among args mges and microbial communities the network analysis based on significant correlations r 0 7 and p 0 01 revealed the co occurrence patterns between args and microbial species in waters and mps r 0 7 and p 0 01 as the fig 6 a b demonstrated the nodes and diameters 137 and 11 respectively of the mps network were smaller than those of the waters 208 and 12 respectively which showed fewer bacteria and args subtypes on the mps reduced average path length 2 339 and modularity 0 104 of the mps network indicated stronger correlations between the bacterial communities and args on mps higher values of edges 3168 average degree 46 511 density 0 342 and clustering coefficient 0 793 observed in the network of mps revealed more complex network relationships and communications between bacterial genera on mps table s5 concretely speaking taxonomic profiles of bacterial genera and connections with arg populations were distinct between waters and mps in water samples a total of 104 bacterial genera and 58 arg subtypes constituted the network plot under cutoffs among these potential bacterial hosts of args dechloromonas and delftia within phylum proteobacteria were highly correlated with the most diverse args 14 subtypes including sul1 sul2 tetc tetg qacedltal followed by acidovorax that was correlated with 12 args subtypes ampc amrb class c beta lactamase and tet a were the most significant args subtypes which highly correlated with over 20 bacterial genera in waters sul1 and sul2 also solely linked to 19 and 17 bacterial genera respectively on mps particles a total of 82 bacterial genera and 43 args subtypes constituted the network plots the genus afipia was highly correlated with 28 args subtypes including aac 2 i adp ribosylating transferase arr cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mexi tem 1 and tetv these six args subtypes were also selectively enriched on mps themselves thus mps may create a special niche for the genus afipia from phylum proteobacteria to live and act as a potential host for these args disseminating in addition cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase also had strong positive correlations with bradyrhizobium and nitrobacter indicating the significant roles of the two bacterial genera in vertical gene transfer of cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase via active biomass growth on mps colonization of mps by these specific bacteria may provide advantages in terms exchange and acquisition of new genetic traits dang et al 2008 the co occurrence patterns of mges and args subtypes in waters and mps was further explored in water samples the most significant mges was is91 that linked 14 subtypes of args the gene of tnpa 2 also solely linked 8 subtypes of args and jointly connected some other subtypes of args with transposase subtypes fig 6 c as the largest contributor of args abundance in waters baca was only positively associated with tnpa 1 indicating the hgt mediated by tnpa 1 additionally sul1 and sul2 were most significant args in waters and exhibited dense connections with 17 and 14 subtypes of args both sul1 and sul2 jointly connected with transposase tnpa 2 tnpa2 tnpa13 tnpa 1 tnpa1 tnpa insertion sequence is91 and integrase intl1 the class 1 integron integrase gene was represented as a proxy for anthropogenic args contamination gillings et al 2015 another watershed study also found that inti1 was positively correlated with the sul1 and sul2 indicating inti1 played a vital role in the hgt of sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes among different media in ganjiang river hu et al 2021 with regard to mps tnpab was the most significant mges that linked 13 subtypes of args the gene of baca was the most significant args that linked to 8 mges on the mps fig 6 d it was noteworthy that significant enrichment of the mge subtypes of isrj1 rep7 and rep21 was observed on mps with the abundances of 34 5 374 9 folds higher than that in waters figs s5 b and 4 b rep7 and rep21 were considered as hallmark genes for plasmids the strong positive association between rep21 and lnua r 0 927 p 0 01 as well as rep7 and tetracycline resistance protein r 0 985 p 0 01 were only observed on mps rather than waters considering mps selectively enriched args subtypes of lnua and tetracy cline resistance protein from surrounding water it could be hypothesized that novel niche created by the presence of mps favors disseminating of some plasmid associated args mediated by hgt 3 5 assembly processes of args and microbiota the frequency of arg occurrence in water and mps samples showed well fit to the neutral model with r 2 values of 0 631 and 0 516 respectively indicating the neutral processes were an important mechanism in shaping the arg profiles fig 7 the null model based nst values for args in water samples mean 78 2 were significantly higher than those in the plastisphere 58 7 potentially suggesting that the importance of stochastic processes was greater for args in aquatic environments for the microbial communities the frequency of the microbial species occurrence in water and mps were also well described by the neutral model with r 2 values of 0 465 and 0 569 respectively suggesting a high proportion of the contribution of stochasticity on the community assembly the mean nst values of microbial community assemblages in water and mps were 89 1 and 62 9 confirming that those communities were predominately governed by stochastic processes 50 additionally the m values in the neutral models which described the migration rate of args or taxa were significantly higher in water samples than those on mps suggesting the less dispersal of microplastic carried args or microbiota when compared with the planktonic args or microorganisms in the lotic ecosystems the finding that stochastic processes were the main driver of taxonomic community variability on mps was consistent with previous studies for instance sun et al 2021 reported that the stochastic processes of drift and dispersal limitation dominantly shaped the bacterial community assembly on field collected mps even for the soil plastisphere the importance of stochastic processes was also observed zhu et al 2022 this may be attributed to that the plastisphere communities are stable microbial assemblages which may be resistant against the changing environmental factors while for arg assembly the stochastic processes also dominantly drove the args variability in water and mps samples in this study the samples were collected from an urbanizing river where mild water environmental changes were observed the homogeneous environmental condition may contribute to the stochastic assembly of args in water samples with regard to args on mps they may vary following the changes in microbial communities furthermore the contribution of stochastic processes on arg assembly in water was relatively greater than those on mps which may be potentially attributable to the higher abundance of mges detected in the water samples to better illustrate the correlation among args mges and microbial communities we applied the mantel test and procrustes analysis to evaluate their relationships fig 8 significant correlations p 0 001 were observed between args and microbial communities as well as args and mges the variance partitioning analysis was further carried out to evaluate the contribution of environmental conditions microbial communities and mges to the variation in arg profiles on mps the microbial community explained 36 6 of arg variation followed by water quality 26 1 and mges 21 3 fig 8 c the pls pm model was parallelly used to estimate the effects of the three aspects on arg abundance on mps the microbial community had the highest direct positive effect on arg abundance on mps suggesting a coupling function and taxonomy in the microbial communities on mps all these findings confirmed that the plastisphere communities play an important role in the dissemination and dynamics of args on microplastics in aquatic environments 4 conclusion microplastics have been widely detected in the huangpu river in shanghai with pet fibers were identified as the major contributor in this study we leveraged metagenomics combined with various statistical analysis to investigate the variarion and disentangled the relationships of bacterial communities args and mges on mps and in waters from the huangpu river in china the majority of arg types showed lower abundances on mps while mps selectively enriched the args encoding resistance to rifamycin and vancomycin results of bacterial community structures illustrated mps might harbor only certain kinds of bacteria from the surrounding waters however the unique niche created by mps for the genus afipia to colonize potentially contribute to the vertical spread of args and the presence of mps favors the dissemination of some plasmid associated args mediated by horizontal gene transfer in addition mechanism analysis revealed the stronger stochastic processes of args profiles and microbial communities on mps the plastisphere communities had direct solid effects on arg distribution on mps these findings highlighted the significant roles of mps in the enrichment and transfer of pathogenic bacteria and args in natural environment for the future study considering the global spread of mps in aquatic environments whether a habitable niche formed on the mps surface will exacerbate the potential risks of args to ecologic health remains need further investigation more studies are still required to assess the microplastic flux from the rivers to seas and the potential risk of args colonized on the mps via the food web moreover the co occurrence of antibiotics and resistance genes in waters and mps and their network associations also deserved further investigation these together with proposed perspectives require continuous efforts to formulate priority lists of args and their bacterial hosts declaration of competing interest the

15472,iodinated disinfection by products i dbps have attracted extensive interests because of their higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues our recent studies have firstly demonstrated that cooking with seaweed salt could enhance the formation of i dbps with several tens of Î¼g l level here i dbp formation and mitigation from the reaction of disinfectant with laminaria japonica haidai an edible seaweed with highest iodine content upon simulated household cooking process was systematically investigated the total iodine content in haidai ranged from 4 6 mg i g haidai to 10 0 mg i g haidai and more than 90 of iodine is soluble iodide during simulated cooking the presence of disinfectant simultaneously decreased iodide by 15 0 32 8 to 2 7 5 8 mg l and increased total organic iodine by 1 3 10 9 times to 0 5 1 8 mg l in haidai soup proving i dbp formation the concentrations of iodinated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were at the levels of several hundreds of Î¼g l and several Î¼g l respectively which are 2 3 orders and 1 2 orders of magnitude more than those in drinking water effects of key factors including disinfectant specie disinfectant dose temperature and time on i dbp formation were also ascertained and temperature and disinfectant specie played a decisive role in the formation and speciation of i dbps in order to avoid the potential health risk from the exposure of i dbps in haidai soup it is prerequisite to soak and wash dry haidai sample over 30 0 min before cooking which could effectively remove major soluble iodide in general this study provided the new insight into i dbp formation from daily household cooking with haidai and the corresponding enlightenment for inhabitants to eat haidai in daily life graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodinated disinfection by products laminaria japonica haidai seaweed tap water household cooking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disinfection is an important composition of drinking water treatment process due to its effective inactivation of water borne pathogens plewa et al 2004 rosario ortiz et al 2016 however the commonly used chlorine containing disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramines can react with naturally occurring organic matter anthropogenic contaminants and halides to produce unwanted halogenated disinfection by products dbps zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 ding et al 2019a simpson and mitch 2021 among these halogenated dbps the toxicity of iodinated dbps i dbps is several orders of magnitude greater than chlorinated and brominated analogues owing to the higher bond length of alkyl iodide and leaving tendency of iodine in sn2 reaction richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms are several times more cytotoxic in chinese hamster ovary cho cells than their chlorinated and brominated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 hanigan et al 2017 found that monoiodoacetic acid miaa had developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryo at low concentrations 100 0 Î¼m while monochloroacetic acid mcaa and monobromoacetic acid mbaa did not exhibit developmental toxicity even at the concentration up to 500 0 Î¼m the mutagenicity of miaa to cho cells was 2 6 times and 523 3 times higher than that of mbaa and mcaa respectively richardson et al 2007 while the cytotoxicity of miaa to salmonella typhimurium was 2 9 times and 53 5 times higher than that of mbaa and mcaa respectively plewa et al 2004 although i dbps have higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated counterparts i dbp concentrations in finished water which are several orders of magnitude lower than their chlorinated and brominated analogues are generally at a level of several tens ng l several Î¼g l fuge and johnson 1986 dong et al 2019 yang et al 2019 lau et al 2020 the lower i dbp level in finished water is attributed to the lower concentration of iodine source which could be divided into three categories iodide iodate and iodinated organic compound hu et al 2018 postigo et al 2018 it was previously reported that iodide iodate and iodinated organic matter concentration in source water which are dependent on geologic dissolution seawater intrusion and human activities ranged from 0 5 Î¼g l to 200 0 Î¼g l from 0 5 Î¼g l to 3 4 Î¼g l and from limits of detection to 100 0 Î¼g l respectively and the total iodine ti content of source water was generally below than 10 0 Î¼g l dong et al 2019 given that dbp associated toxicity is dependent on both concentration of specific dbps and its toxic potency the contributions of i dbps to overall dbp associated toxicity are determined by the concentration of iodine in source water to some extent dong et al 2017 the trace iodine level at which they generally occur in source water indicates that i dbps might be relatively unimportant contributors to overall dbp associated toxicity under certain condition hu et al 2018 lau et al 2020 in addition to iodine derived from source water iodine derived from food can also serve as iodine source of i dbps becalski et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 to deal with health problems caused by iodine deficiency many countries promulgated documents of which the addition of iodine in edible salt as supplement was stipulated mphc 2011 the dominant iodine specie for iodine enhancers in commercial iodized salt is iodate rather than iodide owing to its chemical stability yan et al 2016 as a result household cooking with commercial iodized salts could slightly enhance the formation of i dbps with a concentration up to 20 0 Î¼g l becalski et al 2006 yan et al 2016 moreover previous studies have identified several aromatic dbps with higher toxic potency in boiling cooking samples pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 our recent study found that i thms and total organic iodine toi upon simulated household cooking with seaweed salt and tap water reached the levels of several tens Î¼g l cao et al 2022 qu et al 2022 moreover the toxicity of tap water after simulated household cooking with the addition of seaweed salt was several orders higher than that without the addition of seaweed salt this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the iodine species of seaweed salt are different from those of widely edible iodi zhang et al 2020 zed salt the iodine in seaweed salt is extracted from natural iodine rich marine products e g laminaria japonica haidai porphyra umbilicalis undaria pinnatifida of which the dominant iodine species are iodide and organic iodine doh et al 2018 among these seaweeds haidai has the highest ti content hou et al 1997 it was reported that ti content in haidai is generally around 0 3 of the dry weight and the highest can reach 0 7 0 9 which is far higher than that in surface water 10 20 Î¼g l given that haidai is also the commonly edible marine product in asian countries the iodine leached from haidai during household cooking might react with residual disinfectant in tap water to form unwanted i dbps to our knowledge there was no similar research on the i dbp formation from edible seaweed during household cooking moreover the reaction scenarios of drinking water disinfection for i dbp formation are obviously different from those of household cooking chen et al 2021 for example the reaction temperature of household cooking is substantially higher than that of drinking water disinfection whereas the reaction time and disinfectant dose of household cooking process are much lower than those of drinking water disinfection liu and reckhow 2015 accordingly the features of i dbp formation upon household cooking might be different from those upon drinking water disinfection zhou et al 2014 besides a certain amount of processing for haidai sample e g soak and wash before cooking is required which might also affect i dbp formation during cooking these have stimulated us to investigate the i dbp formation from haidai during simulated household cooking therefore the purpose of this paper was to study the i dbp formation from haidai during simulated household cooking moreover the effects of various key factors reaction temperature reaction time disinfectant specie and disinfectant dose and food pretreatment soak time on i dbp formation were also investigated 2

cooking with haidai to comprehensively assess the formation of i dbps during simulated household cooking with haidai 6 haidai samples produced from china s four major sea areas bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and south china sea were performed for experiments fig 1 illustrates the iodine content of 6 haidai samples and their leachates as shown ti content in 6 haidai samples ranged from 4 6 mg i g haidai to 10 0 mg i g haidai which were approximate to previous studies hou et al 1997 zava and zava 2011 as shown in supplementary table s2 ti content of haidai over the world ranged from 0 151 mg l to 11 096 mg g which are dependent on production areas the state of haidai fresh or dry and etc after 10 0 min cooking at 80 0 ti content in haidai samples were lower than 0 7 mg i g haidai indicating that the majority of iodine more than 90 0 in haidai samples is soluble although the presence of nh2cl or cl2 could not promote the leaching of iodine from haidai sample the proportions of iodine species in leachate significantly changed in the absence of disinfectants iodide content 4 0 mg l 8 0 mg l in leachate accounted for 80 4 87 2 of ti content while the proportions of toi 0 08 mg l 0 5 mg l in leachate to ti content ranged from 1 6 to 6 2 mass balance of iodine indicated that there were some other iodine species in leachate e g iodate with the addition of chloramine the aggregate iodine content in leachate iodide and toi and cooked haidai sample kept constant whereas the increase of toi and the decrease of iodide in leachate were simultaneously observed it could be found in fig 1 that toi concentration increased by 2 9 times 10 9 times from 0 08 mg l 0 5 mg l to 0 7 mg l 1 8 mg l as the presence of chloramine indicating that the reaction of chloramine with the extracts of haidai sample contributed to the formation of i dbps it should be noted that toi concentrations in leachate are 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in drinking water however the addition of chlorine resulted in the reduction of aggregate iodine content in leachate iodide and toi and cooked haidai sample by 15 6 24 4 from 4 1 mg l 7 5 mg l to 3 4 mg l 6 4 mg l this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the different reactivity of chlorine or chloramine to iodide and reactive iodine i e hypoiodous acid and i2 hou et al 1997 bichsel and von gunten 1999 during chlorination iodide was firstly oxidized by chlorine to iodine kapp 4 3 108 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 which could be further oxidized to iodate kapp 21 0 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 bichsel and von gunten 1999 whereas during chloramination iodide was readily oxidized by monochloramine to form iodine kapp 2 4 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 which was hardly transformed into iodate kapp 2 0 10 3 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 as a result the aggregate iodine content in leachate iodide and toi and cooked haidai sample decreased moreover the toi concentrations in chlorinated leachate increased to 0 6 mg l 1 3 mg l which were lower than those in chloraminated leachate the lower toi concentrations upon chlorination were attributed to the higher reactivity of chlorine to organic matter iodide and iodine bichsel and von gunten 1999 deborde and von gunten 2008b on the one hand chlorine or chloramine could be consumed via oxidation of organic matters and the oxidation iodide to iodate in which halogenated dbps were not produced zhu and zhang 2016 the stronger oxidizability for chlorine than chloramine led to the more consumption of chlorine during above mentioned oxidation process deborde and von gunten 2008a on the other hand the reactivity of reactive sites in organic matter with reactive halogen which was responsible for the formation of halogenated dbps were dependent on specific halogen specie it was reported by one previous study that the reactivity of reactive site in organic matter with reactive iodine kapp 20 0 m 1s 1 is several orders of magnitude higher than that with monochloramine kapp 1 8 10 3 m 1s 1 but is slightly higher than that with chlorine kapp 0 95 m 1s 1 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore the reaction of organic matter toward chlorine competes with that toward reactive iodine leading to the decrease of i dbp formation it should be noted that the water matrix in this study is ultrapure water rather than drinking water given that organic matters ubiquitously existed in drinking water they can also serve as the precursor of dbps however the organic matter contents in drinking water 2 0 4 0 mg l are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in haidai leachates 30 3 157 5 mg l supplementary table s1 as a result the dominant precursors of dbps in haidai soup are the organic matter leached from haidai rather than organic matter in drinking water the formation of specific dbp species during simulated household cooking with haidai samples was further investigated in the absence of disinfectants thm and haa concentrations in leachate of haidai samples after 10 0 min cooking at 80 0 were all below the limits of detection data were not shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the presence of disinfectant led to the formation of thms and haas in leachate however thm concentrations 260 4 19 2 mg l 926 0 65 3 mg l were 2 orders of magnitude higher than haa concentration 1 4 0 2 mg l 11 1 0 9 mg l in mimic household cooking which is obviously different from that in drinking water treatment this phenomenon was attributed to that haas readily decomposed to corresponding halomethanes under high temperature e g 80 0 via decarboxylic reaction zhang and minear 2002 specifically tim 266 4 23 1 Î¼g l 672 3 52 5 Î¼g l accounting for 81 7 98 7 of total thms on a mass basis was the dominant thm specie during chloramination nevertheless the dominant thm species during chlorination were tim and two chlorine iodine mixed thms cdim and dcim whose concentrations were in the ranges of 109 0 6 8 Î¼g l 426 6 23 8 Î¼g l 61 6 11 9 Î¼g l 197 7 8 6 Î¼g l and 37 5 4 2 Î¼g l 123 9 11 2 Î¼g l respectively it was worth noting that the concentrations of i thms in leachate are several hundred times more than those in drinking water and are even slightly higher than the concentrations of chlorinated and brominated thms in drinking water richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 dong et al 2019 the concentrations of other thms formed from the chlor am ination of haidai were far much lower than those of above mentioned i thm species the higher tim yield upon chloramination resulted in that the aggregate thm yields upon chloramination were comparable to and even slightly higher than those upon corresponding chlorination this phenomenon was consistent with the formation of toi as for haas the dominant haa specie in leachate upon chloramination was diaa except for sample b and sample e while the speciation and concentration of haas in leachate upon chloramination was dependent on the production area of haidai although the aggregate haa concentration 1 7 0 2 Î¼g l 11 0 0 9 Î¼g l in leachate was lower than that in drinking water the concentration of i haas with higher toxicity in leachate was higher than those in drinking water krasner et al 2006 wagner and plewa 2017 dong et al 2019 toward better understanding of the speciation of thms and haas iodine substitution factor isf for thms and haas which were defined in eq 1 and eq 2 were calculated as shown in supplementary table s3 isfs for thms upon chloramination of haidai leachate were all higher than 90 0 while isfs for thms upon corresponding chlorination ranged from 58 4 to 78 1 the isfs for haas were comparable to those for thms the higher isfs for thms and haas indicated that the reaction of disinfectant with leachate during simulated household cooking with haidai tended to form i dbps in conclusion the reaction of disinfectant with leachate of haidai during mimic household cooking greatly promoted the formation of i dbps with the higher toxic potency than chlorinated and brominated analogues 1 i s f t h m n 0 3 m 0 3 n n c h c l 3 n m b r m i n 3 n 0 3 m 0 3 n c h c l 3 n m b r m i n 2 i s f m h a a d h a a m i a a c i a a 2 d i a a m c a a m i a a 2 d c a a 2 c i a a 2 d i a a 3 2 effects of reaction factors on i dbp formation during simulated household cooking with haidai 3 2 1 effect of temperature the biggest difference of reaction condition between household cooking and drinking water treatment was the reaction temperature here four temperatures 25 0 50 0 75 0 and 100 0 were chosen to investigate the effect of temperature on i dbp formation it could be obviously found in fig 3 a and b that under ambient temperature 25 0 thm and haa formation were much lower than those in high temperature 50 0 75 0 and 100 0 at 25 0 the aggregate thm concentrations upon chlorination and chloramination were 95 3 11 8 Î¼g l and 54 6 8 1 Î¼g l respectively which significantly increased by 9 1 and 20 6 times to 960 5 166 1 Î¼g l and 1179 0 92 3 Î¼g l as the reaction temperature increased to 50 as the reaction temperature further increased from 50 0 to 100 0 the aggregate thm concentration exhibited a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend whereas the rangeability of aggregate thm concentration in these two stages 50 0 75 0 and 75 0 100 0 was far much less than in former stage 25 0 50 0 the decrease of the aggregate thm formation was attributed to the hydrolysis and volatilization zhang et al 2015 haa formation also exhibited the similar phenomenon as reaction temperature increased in summary the reaction temperature played a decisive role in the formation of i dbps during mimic household cooking with haidai 3 2 2 effect of reaction time it was commonly known that i thm and i haa formation increased as the prolonging of reaction time on the one hand the longer time allowed the oxidation of iodide to form more hoi and further allowed the full reactions of reactive iodines with organic matter bichsel and von gunten 1999 on the other hand i thms and i haas were relatively stable under ambient condition zhang and minear 2002 however the higher temperature for condition mimicking household cooking might affect the effect of reaction time on i thm and i haa formation effect of cooking time 5 0 min 10 0 min 15 0 min and 20 0 min which were selected according to realistic cooking condition on the formation of i dbps during mimic household cooking with haidai was investigated as shown in fig 3c thm formation upon chlorination and chloramination presented a continuously falling trend with the increase of reaction period during which part of thms dbim and dcim were even disappeared this phenomenon reflected that the high temperature accelerated the reaction of reactive halogen with iodide and organic matter wu et al 2001 for which reactive halogen reactive chlorine and iodine might be completely consumed within several minutes the decline of thm concentration with prolonging reaction time was mainly ascribed to the hydrolysis and volatilization at high temperatures 80 0 liu and reckhow 2015 zhang et al 2015 as shown in figure s2 the higher temperature accelerated the decrease of tim it should be noted that the decrease of tim from 5 0 min to 20 0 min is lower than 17 3 owing to the high boiling point tim 214 0 c adapted from https comptox epa gov dashboard xiao et al 2022 moreover the sorption of thms onto haidai also slightly led to the reduction of thms in leachate figure s3 as a whole a decreasing trend of aggregate haas was also observed in the time range of 5 0 min 20 0 min the aggregate haa concentration upon chlorination and chloramination after 5 0 min cooking were 9 0 1 5 Î¼g l and 14 7 1 3 Î¼g l respectively and decreased by 15 1 and 29 8 to 7 7 1 0 Î¼g l and 10 3 0 8 Î¼g l the decrease of aggregate haas was attributed to that the high temperature accelerated the destruction of haas to form corresponding halomethanes zhang and minear 2002 3 2 3 effect of disinfectant dose fig 3e and f showed the dependence of i dbp formation during simulated household cooking with haidai on disinfectant dose it could be obviously found that both aggregate thm and aggregate haa formation increased with the increase of disinfectant dose the continuous increases of i thm and i haa formation with the increase of disinfectant dose were also observed this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the iodide content was overdosed compare to disinfectant dose 0 5 mg l 2 0 mg l the increasing disinfectant dose increased the formation of reactive halogen and iodine which in turn promoted the formation of aggregate dbps and i dbps when the chlorine and chloramine doses were set at 0 5 mg l which was close to the realistic residual disinfectant dose of tap water the aggregate thm concentrations for chlorination and chloramination were 88 9 8 5 Î¼g l and 122 0 15 2 Î¼g l respectively among thms i thm concentration upon chlorination and chloramination were 67 8 5 3 Î¼g l and 119 5 14 9 Î¼g l which accounted for 76 2 and 98 0 of aggregate thms on a mass basis although the aggregate haa concentration in leachate was close to or slightly lower than that in drinking water i haa concentrations 0 8 0 07 Î¼g l and 0 5 0 04 Î¼g l for chlorination and chloramination in leachate were higher than that in drinking water dong et al 2019 as disinfectant dose increased to 2 0 mg l the aggregate thm concentrations upon chlorination and chloramination increased to 497 8 73 3 Î¼g l and 1026 8 52 7 Î¼g l in which i thm concentrations were 485 0 72 2 Î¼g l and 1020 1 51 8 Î¼g l in brief the extremely high concentration of i thms in haidai soup might pose potential health risk to human who adopted haidai as commonly edible food 3 3 effect of food preparation soak on i dbp formation during household cooking with haidai it could be obviously found from the above discussion that household cooking with haidai and tap water substantially increased i dbp formation and exhibited the potential health risk to human therefore it is indispensable to take measures to mitigate i dbp formation during above mentioned process in general seaweed usually needs to be washed and soaked before cooking to remove impurities and dirt given that the dominant iodine specie of haidai is soluble iodide the commonly used soak method for food preparation might effectively mitigate i dbp formation during household cooking with haidai the 0 5 g dry sample of haidai was firstly added into 0 5 l up water at ambient temperature to achieve corresponding soak time and then wet haidai sample after soak was withdrawn and added into beaker to initiate the reaction of haidai with disinfectant the effect of soak time 5 0 min 10 0 min 15 0 min 30 0 min and 60 0 min on i thm formation during mimic household cooking with haidai was performed there were encouraging signs that soak of haidai before cooking could extremely abate the formation of aggregate thms and i thms fig 4 when the soak time was lower than 10 0 min the abatement of i dbps were relatively lower with the increase of soak time to 15 0 min i thms upon chlorination and chloramination decreased by 42 9 and 81 1 to 256 9 20 6 Î¼g l and 174 6 19 7 Î¼g l when the soak time increased to 60 0 min i thms upon chlorination and chloramination decreased by 85 2 and 97 7 respectively with a maximal decrease from 449 7 57 6 Î¼g l to 66 5 7 5 Î¼g l for chlorination and 924 3 97 3 Î¼g l to 21 0 1 5 Î¼g l for chloramination it should be noted that the removal ratios of i thms upon chlorination were lower than those upon chloramination after 30 0 min and 60 0 min of soak chlorination of haidai produced 81 2 9 8 Î¼g l and 66 5 7 5 Î¼g l of i thms whereas the concentrations of i thms during chloramination were lower than 21 1 1 5 Î¼g l this phenomenon was attributed to the leaching characteristics of iodide and iodinated organic compound from haidai as shown in figure s4 the leaching rate of iodide was higher than that of iodinated organic compound the iodide concentration in leachate reached to 6 88 mg l after 30 0 min soak and kept relatively constant until 60 0 min soak indicating that the majority of iodide in haidai was leached within 30 0 min the first fast and then slow leaching rate of iodide from haidai sample indicated that the iodide in both the surface of haidai sample and the biological tissue of haidai sample could serve as the iodine source of i dbps it could be found that the iodide content in leachate of haidai after 30 0 min of soak at 25 was close to that after 10 0 min of cooking at 80 indicating that the prolonging of soak time is an effective method to remove iodide in the surface and the biological tissue of haidai sample as for iodinated organic compound toi concentration in leachate after 60 0 min soak at ambient temperature was 0 26 mg l which is lower than that in leachate 0 36 mg l after 10 0 min cooking at 80 0 thus iodinated organic matter was incompletely leached after 60 0 min soak therefore the dominant iodinated organic matter existed in biological tissue of haidai sample rather than in surface of haidai sample and the prolonging of soak time is an effective method to remove iodinated organic matter in the biological tissue of haidai sample the formation and speciation of i dbps upon chlorination and chloramination were dependent on the species of iodine source when iodide served as iodine source iodide was readily oxidized by chlorine or monochloramine to form reactive iodines mackeown et al 2022 which outperform chlorine or monochloramine on the reaction with organic compound to produce halogenated dbps zhu and zhang 2016 as a result the dominant species of halogenated dbps were pure i dbps e g tim miaa and diaa rather than chlorine iodine mixed dbps dcim cdim and ciaa thereby the increase of soak time significantly decreased the formation of tim during chlorination and chloramination when iodinated organic compound served as iodine source of i dbps it preferentially produced chlorine iodine mixed dbps e g dcim and cdim rather than pure i dbps e g tim wang et al 2014 li et al 2017 moreover the reaction rate of iodinated organic compound with chlorine was much higher than that with monochloramine deborde and von gunten 2008b dong et al 2019 resulting in that the chlorine iodine mixed dbp yields upon chlorination are more than those upon chloramination as a result chlorine iodine mixed dbp concentrations upon chlorination were higher than those upon chloramination during cooking with haidai in general it is necessary to perform the wash and soak procedure before cooking with haidai for the mitigation of i dbps moreover the consumption of residual disinfectants by heating before cooking of haidai is an alternative strategy to mitigate i dbp formation 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that i dbps can be generated during simulated household cooking process which involves the reaction of residual disinfectant in tap water with iodide and organic matter in haidai specific findings are listed as follows 1 the extremely higher iodine content 4 6 mg i g haidai 10 0 mg i g haidai in haidai significantly increased the toi concentration of haidai soup by 1 3 10 9 times to 0 5 1 8 mg l meanwhile the concentrations of i thms and i haas in haidai soup were at the level of several hundreds of Î¼g l and several Î¼g l respectively which are 2 3 orders and 1 2 orders of magnitude more than those in drinking water 2 disinfectant specie and temperature played a decisive role in the formation and speciation of i dbps chlorination facilitated the formation of pure i dbps and chlorine iodine mixed dbps while the dominant i dbp species upon chloramination were pure i dbps the increase of reaction temperature from ambient temperature 25 to 50 and higher temperature significantly increased i thm and i haa formation by several times during simulated household cooking with haidai 3 the soak of dry haidai sample for the removal of impurities and dirt over 30 0 min before household cooking could remove more than 90 of iodide and part of iodinated organic matter which in turn decreased i thm formation by 80 4 this study provided the new insight into i dbp formation from daily household cooking with seaweed and spotlighted that the concentration of i dbps in tap water

15472,iodinated disinfection by products i dbps have attracted extensive interests because of their higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues our recent studies have firstly demonstrated that cooking with seaweed salt could enhance the formation of i dbps with several tens of Î¼g l level here i dbp formation and mitigation from the reaction of disinfectant with laminaria japonica haidai an edible seaweed with highest iodine content upon simulated household cooking process was systematically investigated the total iodine content in haidai ranged from 4 6 mg i g haidai to 10 0 mg i g haidai and more than 90 of iodine is soluble iodide during simulated cooking the presence of disinfectant simultaneously decreased iodide by 15 0 32 8 to 2 7 5 8 mg l and increased total organic iodine by 1 3 10 9 times to 0 5 1 8 mg l in haidai soup proving i dbp formation the concentrations of iodinated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were at the levels of several hundreds of Î¼g l and several Î¼g l respectively which are 2 3 orders and 1 2 orders of magnitude more than those in drinking water effects of key factors including disinfectant specie disinfectant dose temperature and time on i dbp formation were also ascertained and temperature and disinfectant specie played a decisive role in the formation and speciation of i dbps in order to avoid the potential health risk from the exposure of i dbps in haidai soup it is prerequisite to soak and wash dry haidai sample over 30 0 min before cooking which could effectively remove major soluble iodide in general this study provided the new insight into i dbp formation from daily household cooking with haidai and the corresponding enlightenment for inhabitants to eat haidai in daily life graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodinated disinfection by products laminaria japonica haidai seaweed tap water household cooking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disinfection is an important composition of drinking water treatment process due to its effective inactivation of water borne pathogens plewa et al 2004 rosario ortiz et al 2016 however the commonly used chlorine containing disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramines can react with naturally occurring organic matter anthropogenic contaminants and halides to produce unwanted halogenated disinfection by products dbps zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 ding et al 2019a simpson and mitch 2021 among these halogenated dbps the toxicity of iodinated dbps i dbps is several orders of magnitude greater than chlorinated and brominated analogues owing to the higher bond length of alkyl iodide and leaving tendency of iodine in sn2 reaction richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms are several times more cytotoxic in chinese hamster ovary cho cells than their chlorinated and brominated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 hanigan et al 2017 found that monoiodoacetic acid miaa had developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryo at low concentrations 100 0 Î¼m while monochloroacetic acid mcaa and monobromoacetic acid mbaa did not exhibit developmental toxicity even at the concentration up to 500 0 Î¼m the mutagenicity of miaa to cho cells was 2 6 times and 523 3 times higher than that of mbaa and mcaa respectively richardson et al 2007 while the cytotoxicity of miaa to salmonella typhimurium was 2 9 times and 53 5 times higher than that of mbaa and mcaa respectively plewa et al 2004 although i dbps have higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated counterparts i dbp concentrations in finished water which are several orders of magnitude lower than their chlorinated and brominated analogues are generally at a level of several tens ng l several Î¼g l fuge and johnson 1986 dong et al 2019 yang et al 2019 lau et al 2020 the lower i dbp level in finished water is attributed to the lower concentration of iodine source which could be divided into three categories iodide iodate and iodinated organic compound hu et al 2018 postigo et al 2018 it was previously reported that iodide iodate and iodinated organic matter concentration in source water which are dependent on geologic dissolution seawater intrusion and human activities ranged from 0 5 Î¼g l to 200 0 Î¼g l from 0 5 Î¼g l to 3 4 Î¼g l and from limits of detection to 100 0 Î¼g l respectively and the total iodine ti content of source water was generally below than 10 0 Î¼g l dong et al 2019 given that dbp associated toxicity is dependent on both concentration of specific dbps and its toxic potency the contributions of i dbps to overall dbp associated toxicity are determined by the concentration of iodine in source water to some extent dong et al 2017 the trace iodine level at which they generally occur in source water indicates that i dbps might be relatively unimportant contributors to overall dbp associated toxicity under certain condition hu et al 2018 lau et al 2020 in addition to iodine derived from source water iodine derived from food can also serve as iodine source of i dbps becalski et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 to deal with health problems caused by iodine deficiency many countries promulgated documents of which the addition of iodine in edible salt as supplement was stipulated mphc 2011 the dominant iodine specie for iodine enhancers in commercial iodized salt is iodate rather than iodide owing to its chemical stability yan et al 2016 as a result household cooking with commercial iodized salts could slightly enhance the formation of i dbps with a concentration up to 20 0 Î¼g l becalski et al 2006 yan et al 2016 moreover previous studies have identified several aromatic dbps with higher toxic potency in boiling cooking samples pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 our recent study found that i thms and total organic iodine toi upon simulated household cooking with seaweed salt and tap water reached the levels of several tens Î¼g l cao et al 2022 qu et al 2022 moreover the toxicity of tap water after simulated household cooking with the addition of seaweed salt was several orders higher than that without the addition of seaweed salt this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the iodine species of seaweed salt are different from those of widely edible iodi zhang et al 2020 zed salt the iodine in seaweed salt is extracted from natural iodine rich marine products e g laminaria japonica haidai porphyra umbilicalis undaria pinnatifida of which the dominant iodine species are iodide and organic iodine doh et al 2018 among these seaweeds haidai has the highest ti content hou et al 1997 it was reported that ti content in haidai is generally around 0 3 of the dry weight and the highest can reach 0 7 0 9 which is far higher than that in surface water 10 20 Î¼g l given that haidai is also the commonly edible marine product in asian countries the iodine leached from haidai during household cooking might react with residual disinfectant in tap water to form unwanted i dbps to our knowledge there was no similar research on the i dbp formation from edible seaweed during household cooking moreover the reaction scenarios of drinking water disinfection for i dbp formation are obviously different from those of household cooking chen et al 2021 for example the reaction temperature of household cooking is substantially higher than that of drinking water disinfection whereas the reaction time and disinfectant dose of household cooking process are much lower than those of drinking water disinfection liu and reckhow 2015 accordingly the features of i dbp formation upon household cooking might be different from those upon drinking water disinfection zhou et al 2014 besides a certain amount of processing for haidai sample e g soak and wash before cooking is required which might also affect i dbp formation during cooking these have stimulated us to investigate the i dbp formation from haidai during simulated household cooking therefore the purpose of this paper was to study the i dbp formation from haidai during simulated household cooking moreover the effects of various key factors reaction temperature reaction time disinfectant specie and disinfectant dose and food pretreatment soak time on i dbp formation were also investigated 2

cooking with haidai to comprehensively assess the formation of i dbps during simulated household cooking with haidai 6 haidai samples produced from china s four major sea areas bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and south china sea were performed for experiments fig 1 illustrates the iodine content of 6 haidai samples and their leachates as shown ti content in 6 haidai samples ranged from 4 6 mg i g haidai to 10 0 mg i g haidai which were approximate to previous studies hou et al 1997 zava and zava 2011 as shown in supplementary table s2 ti content of haidai over the world ranged from 0 151 mg l to 11 096 mg g which are dependent on production areas the state of haidai fresh or dry and etc after 10 0 min cooking at 80 0 ti content in haidai samples were lower than 0 7 mg i g haidai indicating that the majority of iodine more than 90 0 in haidai samples is soluble although the presence of nh2cl or cl2 could not promote the leaching of iodine from haidai sample the proportions of iodine species in leachate significantly changed in the absence of disinfectants iodide content 4 0 mg l 8 0 mg l in leachate accounted for 80 4 87 2 of ti content while the proportions of toi 0 08 mg l 0 5 mg l in leachate to ti content ranged from 1 6 to 6 2 mass balance of iodine indicated that there were some other iodine species in leachate e g iodate with the addition of chloramine the aggregate iodine content in leachate iodide and toi and cooked haidai sample kept constant whereas the increase of toi and the decrease of iodide in leachate were simultaneously observed it could be found in fig 1 that toi concentration increased by 2 9 times 10 9 times from 0 08 mg l 0 5 mg l to 0 7 mg l 1 8 mg l as the presence of chloramine indicating that the reaction of chloramine with the extracts of haidai sample contributed to the formation of i dbps it should be noted that toi concentrations in leachate are 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in drinking water however the addition of chlorine resulted in the reduction of aggregate iodine content in leachate iodide and toi and cooked haidai sample by 15 6 24 4 from 4 1 mg l 7 5 mg l to 3 4 mg l 6 4 mg l this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the different reactivity of chlorine or chloramine to iodide and reactive iodine i e hypoiodous acid and i2 hou et al 1997 bichsel and von gunten 1999 during chlorination iodide was firstly oxidized by chlorine to iodine kapp 4 3 108 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 which could be further oxidized to iodate kapp 21 0 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 bichsel and von gunten 1999 whereas during chloramination iodide was readily oxidized by monochloramine to form iodine kapp 2 4 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 which was hardly transformed into iodate kapp 2 0 10 3 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 as a result the aggregate iodine content in leachate iodide and toi and cooked haidai sample decreased moreover the toi concentrations in chlorinated leachate increased to 0 6 mg l 1 3 mg l which were lower than those in chloraminated leachate the lower toi concentrations upon chlorination were attributed to the higher reactivity of chlorine to organic matter iodide and iodine bichsel and von gunten 1999 deborde and von gunten 2008b on the one hand chlorine or chloramine could be consumed via oxidation of organic matters and the oxidation iodide to iodate in which halogenated dbps were not produced zhu and zhang 2016 the stronger oxidizability for chlorine than chloramine led to the more consumption of chlorine during above mentioned oxidation process deborde and von gunten 2008a on the other hand the reactivity of reactive sites in organic matter with reactive halogen which was responsible for the formation of halogenated dbps were dependent on specific halogen specie it was reported by one previous study that the reactivity of reactive site in organic matter with reactive iodine kapp 20 0 m 1s 1 is several orders of magnitude higher than that with monochloramine kapp 1 8 10 3 m 1s 1 but is slightly higher than that with chlorine kapp 0 95 m 1s 1 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore the reaction of organic matter toward chlorine competes with that toward reactive iodine leading to the decrease of i dbp formation it should be noted that the water matrix in this study is ultrapure water rather than drinking water given that organic matters ubiquitously existed in drinking water they can also serve as the precursor of dbps however the organic matter contents in drinking water 2 0 4 0 mg l are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in haidai leachates 30 3 157 5 mg l supplementary table s1 as a result the dominant precursors of dbps in haidai soup are the organic matter leached from haidai rather than organic matter in drinking water the formation of specific dbp species during simulated household cooking with haidai samples was further investigated in the absence of disinfectants thm and haa concentrations in leachate of haidai samples after 10 0 min cooking at 80 0 were all below the limits of detection data were not shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the presence of disinfectant led to the formation of thms and haas in leachate however thm concentrations 260 4 19 2 mg l 926 0 65 3 mg l were 2 orders of magnitude higher than haa concentration 1 4 0 2 mg l 11 1 0 9 mg l in mimic household cooking which is obviously different from that in drinking water treatment this phenomenon was attributed to that haas readily decomposed to corresponding halomethanes under high temperature e g 80 0 via decarboxylic reaction zhang and minear 2002 specifically tim 266 4 23 1 Î¼g l 672 3 52 5 Î¼g l accounting for 81 7 98 7 of total thms on a mass basis was the dominant thm specie during chloramination nevertheless the dominant thm species during chlorination were tim and two chlorine iodine mixed thms cdim and dcim whose concentrations were in the ranges of 109 0 6 8 Î¼g l 426 6 23 8 Î¼g l 61 6 11 9 Î¼g l 197 7 8 6 Î¼g l and 37 5 4 2 Î¼g l 123 9 11 2 Î¼g l respectively it was worth noting that the concentrations of i thms in leachate are several hundred times more than those in drinking water and are even slightly higher than the concentrations of chlorinated and brominated thms in drinking water richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 dong et al 2019 the concentrations of other thms formed from the chlor am ination of haidai were far much lower than those of above mentioned i thm species the higher tim yield upon chloramination resulted in that the aggregate thm yields upon chloramination were comparable to and even slightly higher than those upon corresponding chlorination this phenomenon was consistent with the formation of toi as for haas the dominant haa specie in leachate upon chloramination was diaa except for sample b and sample e while the speciation and concentration of haas in leachate upon chloramination was dependent on the production area of haidai although the aggregate haa concentration 1 7 0 2 Î¼g l 11 0 0 9 Î¼g l in leachate was lower than that in drinking water the concentration of i haas with higher toxicity in leachate was higher than those in drinking water krasner et al 2006 wagner and plewa 2017 dong et al 2019 toward better understanding of the speciation of thms and haas iodine substitution factor isf for thms and haas which were defined in eq 1 and eq 2 were calculated as shown in supplementary table s3 isfs for thms upon chloramination of haidai leachate were all higher than 90 0 while isfs for thms upon corresponding chlorination ranged from 58 4 to 78 1 the isfs for haas were comparable to those for thms the higher isfs for thms and haas indicated that the reaction of disinfectant with leachate during simulated household cooking with haidai tended to form i dbps in conclusion the reaction of disinfectant with leachate of haidai during mimic household cooking greatly promoted the formation of i dbps with the higher toxic potency than chlorinated and brominated analogues 1 i s f t h m n 0 3 m 0 3 n n c h c l 3 n m b r m i n 3 n 0 3 m 0 3 n c h c l 3 n m b r m i n 2 i s f m h a a d h a a m i a a c i a a 2 d i a a m c a a m i a a 2 d c a a 2 c i a a 2 d i a a 3 2 effects of reaction factors on i dbp formation during simulated household cooking with haidai 3 2 1 effect of temperature the biggest difference of reaction condition between household cooking and drinking water treatment was the reaction temperature here four temperatures 25 0 50 0 75 0 and 100 0 were chosen to investigate the effect of temperature on i dbp formation it could be obviously found in fig 3 a and b that under ambient temperature 25 0 thm and haa formation were much lower than those in high temperature 50 0 75 0 and 100 0 at 25 0 the aggregate thm concentrations upon chlorination and chloramination were 95 3 11 8 Î¼g l and 54 6 8 1 Î¼g l respectively which significantly increased by 9 1 and 20 6 times to 960 5 166 1 Î¼g l and 1179 0 92 3 Î¼g l as the reaction temperature increased to 50 as the reaction temperature further increased from 50 0 to 100 0 the aggregate thm concentration exhibited a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend whereas the rangeability of aggregate thm concentration in these two stages 50 0 75 0 and 75 0 100 0 was far much less than in former stage 25 0 50 0 the decrease of the aggregate thm formation was attributed to the hydrolysis and volatilization zhang et al 2015 haa formation also exhibited the similar phenomenon as reaction temperature increased in summary the reaction temperature played a decisive role in the formation of i dbps during mimic household cooking with haidai 3 2 2 effect of reaction time it was commonly known that i thm and i haa formation increased as the prolonging of reaction time on the one hand the longer time allowed the oxidation of iodide to form more hoi and further allowed the full reactions of reactive iodines with organic matter bichsel and von gunten 1999 on the other hand i thms and i haas were relatively stable under ambient condition zhang and minear 2002 however the higher temperature for condition mimicking household cooking might affect the effect of reaction time on i thm and i haa formation effect of cooking time 5 0 min 10 0 min 15 0 min and 20 0 min which were selected according to realistic cooking condition on the formation of i dbps during mimic household cooking with haidai was investigated as shown in fig 3c thm formation upon chlorination and chloramination presented a continuously falling trend with the increase of reaction period during which part of thms dbim and dcim were even disappeared this phenomenon reflected that the high temperature accelerated the reaction of reactive halogen with iodide and organic matter wu et al 2001 for which reactive halogen reactive chlorine and iodine might be completely consumed within several minutes the decline of thm concentration with prolonging reaction time was mainly ascribed to the hydrolysis and volatilization at high temperatures 80 0 liu and reckhow 2015 zhang et al 2015 as shown in figure s2 the higher temperature accelerated the decrease of tim it should be noted that the decrease of tim from 5 0 min to 20 0 min is lower than 17 3 owing to the high boiling point tim 214 0 c adapted from https comptox epa gov dashboard xiao et al 2022 moreover the sorption of thms onto haidai also slightly led to the reduction of thms in leachate figure s3 as a whole a decreasing trend of aggregate haas was also observed in the time range of 5 0 min 20 0 min the aggregate haa concentration upon chlorination and chloramination after 5 0 min cooking were 9 0 1 5 Î¼g l and 14 7 1 3 Î¼g l respectively and decreased by 15 1 and 29 8 to 7 7 1 0 Î¼g l and 10 3 0 8 Î¼g l the decrease of aggregate haas was attributed to that the high temperature accelerated the destruction of haas to form corresponding halomethanes zhang and minear 2002 3 2 3 effect of disinfectant dose fig 3e and f showed the dependence of i dbp formation during simulated household cooking with haidai on disinfectant dose it could be obviously found that both aggregate thm and aggregate haa formation increased with the increase of disinfectant dose the continuous increases of i thm and i haa formation with the increase of disinfectant dose were also observed this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the iodide content was overdosed compare to disinfectant dose 0 5 mg l 2 0 mg l the increasing disinfectant dose increased the formation of reactive halogen and iodine which in turn promoted the formation of aggregate dbps and i dbps when the chlorine and chloramine doses were set at 0 5 mg l which was close to the realistic residual disinfectant dose of tap water the aggregate thm concentrations for chlorination and chloramination were 88 9 8 5 Î¼g l and 122 0 15 2 Î¼g l respectively among thms i thm concentration upon chlorination and chloramination were 67 8 5 3 Î¼g l and 119 5 14 9 Î¼g l which accounted for 76 2 and 98 0 of aggregate thms on a mass basis although the aggregate haa concentration in leachate was close to or slightly lower than that in drinking water i haa concentrations 0 8 0 07 Î¼g l and 0 5 0 04 Î¼g l for chlorination and chloramination in leachate were higher than that in drinking water dong et al 2019 as disinfectant dose increased to 2 0 mg l the aggregate thm concentrations upon chlorination and chloramination increased to 497 8 73 3 Î¼g l and 1026 8 52 7 Î¼g l in which i thm concentrations were 485 0 72 2 Î¼g l and 1020 1 51 8 Î¼g l in brief the extremely high concentration of i thms in haidai soup might pose potential health risk to human who adopted haidai as commonly edible food 3 3 effect of food preparation soak on i dbp formation during household cooking with haidai it could be obviously found from the above discussion that household cooking with haidai and tap water substantially increased i dbp formation and exhibited the potential health risk to human therefore it is indispensable to take measures to mitigate i dbp formation during above mentioned process in general seaweed usually needs to be washed and soaked before cooking to remove impurities and dirt given that the dominant iodine specie of haidai is soluble iodide the commonly used soak method for food preparation might effectively mitigate i dbp formation during household cooking with haidai the 0 5 g dry sample of haidai was firstly added into 0 5 l up water at ambient temperature to achieve corresponding soak time and then wet haidai sample after soak was withdrawn and added into beaker to initiate the reaction of haidai with disinfectant the effect of soak time 5 0 min 10 0 min 15 0 min 30 0 min and 60 0 min on i thm formation during mimic household cooking with haidai was performed there were encouraging signs that soak of haidai before cooking could extremely abate the formation of aggregate thms and i thms fig 4 when the soak time was lower than 10 0 min the abatement of i dbps were relatively lower with the increase of soak time to 15 0 min i thms upon chlorination and chloramination decreased by 42 9 and 81 1 to 256 9 20 6 Î¼g l and 174 6 19 7 Î¼g l when the soak time increased to 60 0 min i thms upon chlorination and chloramination decreased by 85 2 and 97 7 respectively with a maximal decrease from 449 7 57 6 Î¼g l to 66 5 7 5 Î¼g l for chlorination and 924 3 97 3 Î¼g l to 21 0 1 5 Î¼g l for chloramination it should be noted that the removal ratios of i thms upon chlorination were lower than those upon chloramination after 30 0 min and 60 0 min of soak chlorination of haidai produced 81 2 9 8 Î¼g l and 66 5 7 5 Î¼g l of i thms whereas the concentrations of i thms during chloramination were lower than 21 1 1 5 Î¼g l this phenomenon was attributed to the leaching characteristics of iodide and iodinated organic compound from haidai as shown in figure s4 the leaching rate of iodide was higher than that of iodinated organic compound the iodide concentration in leachate reached to 6 88 mg l after 30 0 min soak and kept relatively constant until 60 0 min soak indicating that the majority of iodide in haidai was leached within 30 0 min the first fast and then slow leaching rate of iodide from haidai sample indicated that the iodide in both the surface of haidai sample and the biological tissue of haidai sample could serve as the iodine source of i dbps it could be found that the iodide content in leachate of haidai after 30 0 min of soak at 25 was close to that after 10 0 min of cooking at 80 indicating that the prolonging of soak time is an effective method to remove iodide in the surface and the biological tissue of haidai sample as for iodinated organic compound toi concentration in leachate after 60 0 min soak at ambient temperature was 0 26 mg l which is lower than that in leachate 0 36 mg l after 10 0 min cooking at 80 0 thus iodinated organic matter was incompletely leached after 60 0 min soak therefore the dominant iodinated organic matter existed in biological tissue of haidai sample rather than in surface of haidai sample and the prolonging of soak time is an effective method to remove iodinated organic matter in the biological tissue of haidai sample the formation and speciation of i dbps upon chlorination and chloramination were dependent on the species of iodine source when iodide served as iodine source iodide was readily oxidized by chlorine or monochloramine to form reactive iodines mackeown et al 2022 which outperform chlorine or monochloramine on the reaction with organic compound to produce halogenated dbps zhu and zhang 2016 as a result the dominant species of halogenated dbps were pure i dbps e g tim miaa and diaa rather than chlorine iodine mixed dbps dcim cdim and ciaa thereby the increase of soak time significantly decreased the formation of tim during chlorination and chloramination when iodinated organic compound served as iodine source of i dbps it preferentially produced chlorine iodine mixed dbps e g dcim and cdim rather than pure i dbps e g tim wang et al 2014 li et al 2017 moreover the reaction rate of iodinated organic compound with chlorine was much higher than that with monochloramine deborde and von gunten 2008b dong et al 2019 resulting in that the chlorine iodine mixed dbp yields upon chlorination are more than those upon chloramination as a result chlorine iodine mixed dbp concentrations upon chlorination were higher than those upon chloramination during cooking with haidai in general it is necessary to perform the wash and soak procedure before cooking with haidai for the mitigation of i dbps moreover the consumption of residual disinfectants by heating before cooking of haidai is an alternative strategy to mitigate i dbp formation 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that i dbps can be generated during simulated household cooking process which involves the reaction of residual disinfectant in tap water with iodide and organic matter in haidai specific findings are listed as follows 1 the extremely higher iodine content 4 6 mg i g haidai 10 0 mg i g haidai in haidai significantly increased the toi concentration of haidai soup by 1 3 10 9 times to 0 5 1 8 mg l meanwhile the concentrations of i thms and i haas in haidai soup were at the level of several hundreds of Î¼g l and several Î¼g l respectively which are 2 3 orders and 1 2 orders of magnitude more than those in drinking water 2 disinfectant specie and temperature played a decisive role in the formation and speciation of i dbps chlorination facilitated the formation of pure i dbps and chlorine iodine mixed dbps while the dominant i dbp species upon chloramination were pure i dbps the increase of reaction temperature from ambient temperature 25 to 50 and higher temperature significantly increased i thm and i haa formation by several times during simulated household cooking with haidai 3 the soak of dry haidai sample for the removal of impurities and dirt over 30 0 min before household cooking could remove more than 90 of iodide and part of iodinated organic matter which in turn decreased i thm formation by 80 4 this study provided the new insight into i dbp formation from daily household cooking with seaweed and spotlighted that the concentration of i dbps in tap water might not accurately reflect the true exposure level of i dbps accordingly epidemiological exposure level of i dbps should take into consideration i dbp formation during household cooking when is

15473,internal phosphorus p loading can increase the p level in the water column and further sustains cyanobacterial blooms this study focused on the role of benthic fauna bioturbation in affecting the sediment p release and the p level of water column in a eutrophic lake lake taihu the macrofauna density decreased from 4766 56 10541 80 ind m2 in 2007 to 345 447 63 ind m2 in 2020 due to the frequent bottom water hypoxia in lake taihu the reduced macrofauna density majorly resulted from grandidierella taihuensis limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and tanypus chinensis larvae and their total density decreased by approximately 97 in 2020 compared to 2007 g taihuensis one of the major benthic faunas was further used as a representative to investigate the effects of bioturbation on sediment p release using high resolution sampling and imaging techniques the results show that g taihuensis can increase the o2 penetration depth by more than 20 mm through bio irrigation and causes the redox conditions in burrows and surrounding sediments to change dramatically within a few minutes due to the intermittent ventilation subsequent oxidation of the soluble fe ii led to the formation of fe oxide bound p in the surface sediments thereby increasing the p retention in the sediments when the g taihuensis density was 1563 ind m2 at the sampling site approximately 0 12 g m 2 yr 1 p can be retained in sediments as previous studies have shown that l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis played a similar role in increasing the p retention in sediments through their bioturbation activities the sharp decline in benthic fauna density and burrowing activities in lake taihu should be an important reason for maintaining the high p level in the water column by decreasing the p retention in sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophic lakes shallow lakes bioturbation redox conditions internal phosphorus cycling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction lake eutrophication as a severe global environmental issue results from the excess input of nutrients into lakes by natural and anthropogenic activities duhamel et al 2021 it has led to many negative effects such as the frequent harmful cyanobacterial blooms the reduction in biodiversity and the decline in water quality hamilton et al 2018 reducing external nutrient loading is a widely accepted approach to control lake eutrophication lurling and van oosterhout 2013 despite massive efforts to control the direct nutrient input the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms continue to increase huisman et al 2018 orihel et al 2017 internal nutrient loading especially phosphorus p has been considered an important factor in sustaining lake eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms ding et al 2018 schindler et al 2008 studies have shown that the internal p loading of eutrophic lakes is similar to or higher than the external p loading during summer which delays the lake recovery from eutrophication after the reduction of external p loading sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2012 wang et al 2019 therefore understanding the factors and mechanisms that affect the internal p release is of great significance for the management and remediation of eutrophic lakes traditionally sediment p release has been thought to be driven by the reductive dissolution of iron oxides fe oxides which may be caused by various external environmental factors such as bottom water oxygen o2 levels orihel et al 2015 welsh 2003 cyanobacterial blooms lake warming high water levels and organic matter decomposition can mobilize p from sediments to the overlying water by depleting the o2 concentration in the bottom water column tong et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 bioturbation is also thought to play an important role in the internal p cycling in sediments kristensen et al 2012 welsh 2003 wyness et al 2021 in lake ecosystems the surface sediments are often inhabited by benthic fauna which can directly affect the sediment biogeochemical cycles through movement ingestion gallery construction and ventilation kristensen et al 2012 welsh 2003 these bioturbation processes include bio mixing and bio irrigation which may alter the p release fluxes by affecting the transport of particles and the supply of o2 in sediments respectively van de velde et al 2018 different macrofauna species have various modes of bioturbation which have significantly different effects on the sediment p release tarhan et al 2021 some benthic faunas can vertically horizontally or diffusely transport the p containing minerals via bio mixing which may affect the p mobility by altering the p burial in sediments dale et al 2016 however a recent study has demonstrated that bioturbation has a limited effect on the p burial in salt marsh sediments through field observations van de velde et al 2021 on the other hand the bio irrigation induced changes in o2 availability may have greater control over p mobility in sediments than the transport of bio mixing induced solid phase particles most benthic fauna lives in the burrows surrounded by anoxic sediments and they can ventilate their burrows with the o2 rich overlying water to meet the metabolic requirements for o2 shull 2019 welsh 2003 through bio irrigation macrofauna increases the penetration depth of o2 and the thickness of the oxic layer thereby inhibiting the sediment p release through the high p co precipitation capacity of the produced fe oxides in sediments benelli and bartoli 2021 in addition to bio mixing and bio irrigation macrofaunal respiration also changes the redox conditions in sediments which in turn further affects sediment p release for example corbicula fluminea can increase the internal p release by the reductive dissolution of fe oxides as their respiration depletes o2 in the surface sediments chen et al 2016b the effect of bioturbation on the solute exchange is not only associated with bioturbation styles but also with the density of benthic faunas bianchi et al 2021 lam gordillo et al 2022 a previous study found that the p release fluxes from sediments increased with the increase in the density of c fluminea zhang et al 2011 the changes in the density of benthic faunas can affect the bioturbation intensity such as the burrow size burrow depth and burrow density which further affects the penetration depth and reservoir size of o2 in sediments bonaglia et al 2014 michaud et al 2021 consequently the biogeochemical processes associated with redox reactions such as the p adsorption desorption in sediments due to the fe redox cycling can be affected by the changes in macrofauna density which may influence the sediment p release considering the fact that the effects of benthic faunas on the sediment p release depend on both bioturbation patterns and their densities associating the macrofaunal bioturbation patterns with their density changes is of great significance for assessing the overall impact of bioturbation on the internal p release in eutrophic lakes lake taihu a large shallow and eutrophic lake in china is often subjected to cyanobacterial blooms qin et al 2019 due to eutrophication its macrofaunal composition and density have undergone considerable change cai et al 2015 compared with 1987 1988 limnodrilus hoffmeisteri a pollution tolerant species replaced the c fluminea as the dominant in lake taihu cai et al 2015 while the densities of l hoffmeisteri significantly decreased in recent years peng et al 2020 in order to prevent cyanobacterial blooms external nutrient loading has been significantly reduced in lake taihu since 2007 the extent and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms and the total p tp concentrations showed no downward trends qin et al 2021 many studies have indicated that the internal p release largely determines the tp concentration in the water column which contributes 23 90 to the p demand of cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the rising water temperatures decreasing wind speeds and persistent cyanobacterial blooms are considered to be the major causes of internal p loading in lake taihu deng et al 2018 qin et al 2021 however whether changes in the macrofauna density affect the internal p release and the p level in the water column remains underexplored in lake taihu the knowledge about the effects of the bioturbation patterns and density changes of benthic fauna on sediment p release can be used to better understand the role of benthic fauna in internal p cycling and lake eutrophication which would help to provide constructive guidance for the future management and restoration of eutrophic lakes this study aimed to i investigate the changes in macrofauna density in lake taihu from 2007 to 2020 ii investigate the effects of bioturbation on the sediment mixing o2 dynamics and sediment p release using g taihuensis one of the dominant benthic faunas in lake taihu and iii elucidate the effects of changes in macrofaunal density on the sediment p release and water column p level in lake taihu specifically we hypothesized that i the g taihuensis can reduce the sediment p release by increasing supply of o2 to anoxic sediments and ii the decrease in benthic fauna density increases the sediment p release and maintains the high p level of water column in lake taihu 2 materials and methods 2 1 macrofauna density monitoring and environmental parameters measuring from 2007 to 2020 benthic samples were collected from 32 regular sampling sites in lake taihu catchment area 36 500 km2 lake area 2 338 km2 mean depth 1 90 m in february may august and november respectively fig 1 a sediments were sampled using peterson grabs 0 05 m2 and sieved in situ through a 0 25 mm mesh size cai et al 2017 the residual samples from the sieve were collected and transported to the laboratory where macrofauna was sorted and their numbers recorded the density of macrofauna individuals per square meter ind m2 was calculated according to their number and the sampling area the overlying water at each sampling site was collected to determine the tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations tp concentration was measured using molybdenum blue colorimetric method after persulfate digestion and chl a was measured spectrophotometrically after extraction by hot ethanol 90 2 2 collection of sediments and g taihuensis surface sediments were collected using a peterson grab in november 2020 at meiliang bay lake bay area 140 km2 mean depth 2 85 m taihu lake mlw sampling site 31 26 18 n 120 11 12 e fig 1a in addition six sediment cores were sampled using the modified highly transparent plexiglass tubes which has a flat surface and could be used to attach the o2 optodes for investigating o2 dynamics in the stable burrows fig s1 the overlying water at the same sampling site was collected using plastic barrels for incubation experiments in the laboratory g taihuensis was collected from the sampled sediments sieving the surface sediments using a 0 6 mm pore size mesh to remove macrofauna and debris and then homogenized the homogenized sediments were added to six plexiglass tubes diameter 9 cm length 30 cm six large transparent polycarbonate tanks 20 cm in height 10 cm in length 5 cm in width and six small transparent polycarbonate tanks 10 cm in height 10 cm in length 2 cm in width six plexiglass tubes were used to measure the soluble p concentration and p diffusive flux three big transparent polycarbonate tanks were used to record the behavior of g taihuensis and the o2 dynamics during the bioturbation while the other three big tanks were used to measure the two dimensional 2d distribution of labile p three small tanks were used to measure the flow velocities in the burrow and other small tanks were used to investigate the sediment reworking 2 3 color tracer measurements and tracer particle imaging rhodamine b was used as a color tracer to determine flow velocities in this study fig 1f it was firstly dissolved in water 10 mg l and added via a pipette over the inlet of the burrow and the time until the tracer reached the outlet was recorded the fluorescent images were recorded at 1s interval with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos equipped with a macro lens and a 520 nm long pass filter under the 500 nm excitation light the sudden and rapid water flow through the burrow was identified as ventilation activity the sediment reworking was simulated using tracer particles fig 1f gilbert et al 2021 roche et al 2016 the dpa pan the fluorophore diphenylanthracene was incorporated into polyacrylonitrile particle was chosen as the simulated sediment particle because it was insensitive to the dissolved gases and ions meier et al 2011 details of the fabrication method can be found in the supplementary materials 100 mg of dpa pan particles were added to the sediment surface followed by six g taihuensis in the small tanks the fluorescent images were then obtained using a cmos camera under the 395 nm excitation light the blue channel of the fluorescent image was extracted to investigate the sediment reworking 2 4 o2 imaging o2 dynamics were measured using o2 planar optodes in both big transparent polycarbonate tanks and modified plexiglass tubes figs 1f and s1 planar optodes consisted of a o2 sensitive indicator dye and a reference dye dispersed in a o2 permeable polymer and coated on optically transparent solid supports scholz et al 2021 the imaging principle of planar optodes for o2 is based on the dynamic quenching of a fluorophore in the presence of o2 polerecky et al 2006 details of the fabrication and calculation of o2 optodes can be found in the supplementary materials the imaging system easysensor po 1100 https global easysensor com consisted of a cmos camera equipped with a macro lens and a 460 nm long pass filter and two 405 nm light emitting diodes five g taihuensis were added to the three big tanks to investigate o2 dynamics during burrowing o2 images were recorded every 30 s until stable burrows were formed the modified plexiglass tubes attached to o2 optodes were applied to map the o2 dynamics in the stable burrows 2 5 measurement of soluble reactive p srp and labile p in the six plexiglass tubes ten g taihuensis were added to three tubes as bioturbated group and the other three tubes served as controls non bioturbated group fig 1 the amount of g taihuensis added was determined according to the density of g taihuensis at the sampling sites 1563 ind m2 all tubes were incubated at 18 c using a water thermostat system ten days later six high resolution dialysis samplers hr peeper easysensor ltd nanjing china were inserted into the sediment for 48 h to obtain the soluble reactive p srp and soluble fe concentrations fig 1g based on the diffusive equilibrium principle five g taihuensis were added to the other three big tanks and incubated at 18 c for ten days and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were applied to obtain the labile p distribution in sediments fig 1g labile p determined by dgt includes soluble p in porewater and the weakly bound p released from solids in sediments ding et al 2013 the zr oxide dgt was provided by easysensor ltd nanjing china its fabrication and analysis can be found in the supplementary materials the 5 5 cm zr oxide binding gel was mounted onto polyethylene terephthalate pet plate 400 Î¼m in thickness then overlaid with a vinylidene fluoride membrane 0 45 Î¼m pore size 100 Î¼m in thickness and finally the dgt gel and membrane were fixed to pet with sealing tapes the thin probe was inserted into the sediment perpendicular and parallel to the burrow for 24 h 2 6 data analysis to assess the advective flow of overlying water through burrows by g taihuensis flow velocity v mm s volumetric flow rate q Î¼l s and area specific water volume pumped by g taihuensis populations q pop m3 m 2 d 1 were calculated based on color tracer measurement results according to roskosch et al 2010 furthermore the time of the whole lake water was pumped through the sediment by g taihuensis can be estimated by applying the q pop to the lake volume roskosch et al 2010 detailed calculation procedures can be found in the supplementary materials o2 penetration depth below the burrow sediment interface was estimated from the fluorescent images and the o2 penetration depth was defined as the value where the o2 concentration value was lower than the lowest detection limit of the planar optode 1 2 Î¼mol l 1 the diffusive oxygen uptake dou mmol m 2 d 1 in sediments was calculated from the fluorescent images based on fick s first law glud 2008 according the o2 dynamics in the burrow the time interval from the o2 concentration started to increase and increased to the maximum value in the burrow was considered as the ventilation period polerecky et al 2006 the diffusion flux of srp j mg m 2 d 1 across the sediment water interface swi was calculated based on fick s first law and the dgt measurements were typically interpreted as the time averaged fluxes f pg cm 2 s 1 detailed calculation processes can be found in the supplementary materials furthermore the sediment p release mass under g taihuensis bioturbation for each year can be estimated by multiplying the diffusive flux of srp with the number of days within the year ding et al 2018 in this study the graphs were produced using origin 2018 matlab 2016 and surfer 13 pearson correlation analysis was performed using spss 25 to evaluate the associations between the parameters two sample t tests p 0 05 using spss 25 were used to assess the difference of bioturbated group and non bioturbated group 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in macrofauna density in lake taihu as shown in fig 2 a the total macrofauna density decreased from 4766 56 10541 80 ind m2 in 2007 to 345 00 447 63 ind m2 in 2020 the dominant faunas were g taihuensis tanypus chinensis larvae l hoffmeisteri c fluminea and bellamya aeruginosa which accounted for more than 80 of the total macrofauna the densities of g taihuensis and l hoffmeisteri showed a decreasing trend with their average densities dropping from 240 47 272 22 ind m2 and 3447 34 9292 97 ind m2 in 2007 to 11 36 38 57 ind m2 and 27 11 69 51 ind m2 in 2020 respectively fig 2b and c moreover t chinensis showed a decline trend with its densities ranging from 199 06 653 86 ind m2 in 2007 to 74 80 269 10 ind m2 in 2020 fig 2d other two benthic species c fluminea and b aeruginosa remained stable in densities with their mean densities ranging from 148 91 301 47 ind m2 and 24 06 61 14 ind m2 in 2007 to 124 44 261 86 ind m2 and 25 76 92 54 ind m2 in 2020 respectively fig 2e and f in lake taihu the highest density of g taihuensis one of the dominant macrofauna can reach 5760 ind m2 fig 3 the high densities of g taihuensis were in the north bay areas and the northwest part of the open lake areas fig 3 which were known as the eutrophication areas in lake taihu deng et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 according to previous studies l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis were also mainly found in eutrophic lake areas while c fluminea and b aeruginosa mainly inhabited the open lake area and the east bay area far from the eutrophication areas of lake taihu cai et al 2015 2017 eutrophication can provide more food for benthic faunas in lakes but can also lead to o2 depletion near sediments affecting the survival of hypoxia sensitive species tomaÅ¡ovÃ½ch et al 2018 especially in lake taihu the persistent cyanobacterial blooms elevated water temperatures and climatically modulated decline in wind speed have led to an increased frequency of bottom water hypoxia deng et al 2018 qin et al 2021 2019 studies have indicated that bottom water o2 levels can affect the composition density and diversity of benthic communities bianchi et al 2021 levin 2003 g taihuensis and l hoffmeisteri are known to be sensitive to anoxic conditions spicer et al 2002 volpers and neumann 2005 so the high frequency of bottom water hypoxia should lead to a decrease in their density c fluminea and b aeruginosa mainly inhabited the non eutrophication areas their density remained stable due to they were not affected by eutrophication a negative correlation r 0 524 p 0 05 was further found between the macrofauna density and chl a concentration table s1 all evidence suggested that the high frequency of bottom water hypoxia caused by persistent cyanobacterial blooms may be the main reason for the decline in the macrofauna density in lake taihu 3 2 effects of g taihuensis bioturbation on sediment mixing o2 dynamics and sediment p release in the unbioturbated sediments solutes generally diffused upward from porewater to the overlying water through molecular diffusion along the concentration gradient between the sediment porewater phase and the overlying water phase luther et al 1999 bioturbation can alter the simple one dimensional diffusion patterns into more complex three dimensional reaction patterns volkenborn et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to study the effects of bioturbation on the sediment environment at high spatial resolutions in this study g taihuensis was selected as a representative to investigate the effects of bioturbation on the transport of particles o2 dynamics and sediment p release using high resolution sampling and imaging methods including fluorescence imaging of color tracers and tracer particles planar optodes and dgt sediment mixing the sediment reworking by the g taihuensis was mainly related to the construction and maintenance of burrows in this study the depth of burrows varied from 3 2 mm to 60 mm below the swi and the width ranged from 1 mm to 3 mm slightly wider than the g taihuensis body figs s2 s3 and s4 g taihuensis used their pereopods to dig down into sediment to build burrows which resulted in the rapid mixing of the tracer particles in the surface sediments fig s2 during the burrowing a part of tracer particles could be transported into the deeper sediments while some sediment particles in the deeper sediment could be transported to the surface through excavation activities fig s2 the depth of particle reworking which depended on the burrowing depth was approximately 0 80 cm by g taihuensis fig s2 this is consistent with previous findings that sediment mixing depth by some amphipods gammarus pulex and corophium volutator was less than 2 cm de backer et al 2011 mermillod blondin et al 2004 moreover g taihuensis bioturbation could re distributed the tracer particles into the sediments near the burrows close to the oxidation areas caused by bio irrigation figs s2 and s3 g taihuensis drove the transport of sediment particles from the oxic zone in the top sediment layer to the other oxidation areas around the burrows which may produce a negligible effect on the burial of organic matter in sediments o2 dynamics the changes in the redox conditions in sediments can be regarded as one of the most significant effects of bioturbation in this study g taihuensis excavated the sediments to establish burrows resulting in the o2 rich overlying water being irrigated into burrows fig 4 they could wiggle their pereopods to ventilate or flush their burrows with the oxygenated overlying water which also increased the supply of o2 into the sediments fig 4 according to the measured time of the tracer passing through the burrow roskosch et al 2010 the flow velocity and volumetric flow rate were calculated to be 4 96 1 09 mm s and 31 12 6 87 Î¼l s in the burrows of g taihuensis respectively which were higher than those in the abandoned burrows 0 18 0 01 mm s and 0 86 0 02 Î¼l s p 0 05 table 1 the area specific water volume q pop was calculated to be 0 25 m3 m 2 d 1 and 0 09 m3 m 2 d 1 respectively according to the average densities of g taihuensis 463 75 ind m2 in 2007 and 165 40 ind m2 in 2007 in the meiliang bay based on the calculated q pop values the lake water of meiliang bay 3 78 108 m3 could be irrigated through their burrows within 10 63 d and 30 d in 2007 and 2020 respectively through the above mentioned drilling and ventilation activities of the g taihuensis the o2 rich overlying water was irrigated into the burrows and the o2 penetration depth was increased pronouncedly from a few millimeters to more than 20 mm figs s3 s4 and 4 therefore the high density of g taihuensis considerably increased the o2 reservoir size in the sediments in addition o2 concentrations in the burrow fluctuated at a minute scale fig 4 the o2 concentrations in burrows the o2 penetration depths and the diffusive o2 uptake rates in sediments below the burrows ranged from 15 20 Âµmol l 1 0 88 mm and 1 40 mmol m 2 d 1 to 177 21Âµmol l 1 3 28 mm and 12 11 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively fig s6 the highly dynamic redox oscillations in the burrows and the surrounding sediments were the results of the intermittent ventilating activities of g taihuensis by pleopod swing compared to the surficial sediments the sediments surrounding the burrows experienced much more dynamic redox conditions due to the intermittent ventilating activities fig 4 we further calculated the ventilation period of g taihuensis was 12 215 2 595 min h according to the o2 dynamic in the burrow table 1 fig s5 the oxic anoxic oscillations were also observed in the burrows with other benthic species for example chironomus plumosus h diversicolor and arenicola marina intermittently ventilated their burrows by pumping overlying water through their burrows pischedda et al 2011 polerecky et al 2006 volkenborn et al 2010 and the ghost shrimp neotrypaea californiensis intermittently ventilated their burrows by pleopod beating volkenborn et al 2012 after abandonment of the burrows by g taihuensis the o2 concentrations decreased rapidly and eventually the burrows and their surrounding sediments became anaerobic with the highest o2 consumption rate of 400 mmol m 3 s 1 in the center of the burrows figs 4 s6 and s7 these results demonstrated that the bioturbation of g taihuensis considerably increased the o2 availability in sediments sediment p release there was no labile p flux in the burrow and sediments above the burrow fig 5 a the labile p fluxes gradually increased from 15 to 30 pg cm 2 s 1 at the burrow sediment interface to 80 120 pg cm 2 s 1 in the bulk sediments with a 3 5 mm gradient zone between them fig 5a the concentrations of srp and soluble fe in the bioturbated sediments were also significantly lower than those in the bulk sediments p 0 05 fig 5b furthermore there was a clear positive correlation between the srp and soluble fe concentrations r 0 984 p 0 01 table s2 which demonstrated that the p mobility in sediments was controlled by the fe redox cycling the release fluxes of srp and soluble fe across the swi were 0 48 0 23 and 3 68 1 69 mg m 2 d 1 respectively which were lower than those of the control 0 82 0 06 and 6 97 0 22 mg m 2 d 1 fig 5c therefore approximately 0 12 g m 2 yr 1 p was retained in sediments when the g taihuensis density was 1563 ind m2 at the sampling site it is evident that the low labile p fluxes and srp concentrations in the sediments were due to the increase in o2 availability by burrowing and ventilating activities of g taihuensis figs 4 and 5a they irrigated the o2 rich overlying water into the burrows and subsequently o2 diffused through the burrow walls into the surrounding sediments resulting in an oxide layer around the burrows figs 4 s3 and s4 fe ii diffused from the anaerobic sediments to the aerobic zones where it was oxidized and precipitated in the aerobic zones before reaching the inside of the burrow subsequently the soluble p released from sediments was sequestered in this oxidized zone in the form of fe oxide bound p thus the amount of sediment p release was reduced hupfer and lewandowski 2008 lam gordillo et al 2022 furthermore we observed thin layers of organic material inside the burrows formed by g taihuensis fig s8 the burrow linings often contained negatively charged functional groups that can act as molecular sieves and reduce the diffusion of small inorganic solutes especially anions such as p aller 1983 thereby fe oxide coupled with the low permeability of burrow lining became a barrier to increase p retention in sediments which confirmed that g taihuensis bioturbation can strongly inhibit the release of p from sediments 3 3 effect of decrease in macrofauna density on the internal p release according to the field monitoring data the average chl a concentration increased from 2007 to 2020 fig 6 a which indicated that cyanobacterial blooms exhibited an increasing trend tp concentrations in lake taihu declined slightly followed by a recent increase while remaining generally high 0 10 mg l 1 fig 6b the external p loading and internal p supply are considered to be the key reasons for maintaining high p level in the water column and frequent cyanobacterial blooms xu et al 2021 in this study we found that non significant between tp concentrations and external p loading r 0 421 p 0 05 but strong positive correlation with internal p loading r 0 667 p 0 01 figs 6b c and s9 table s1 a significant positive correlation r 0 766 p 0 01 was further observed between the internal p loading and chl a concentration table s1 therefore it can be inferred that the internal p loading is mainly responsible for the high p levels in the water column and cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu different macrofauna can play different roles in influencing the internal p release combined with our previous studies we further analyzed the effects of the other four dominant benthic faunas on redox conditions and internal p release table 2 t chinensis belonged to the gallery diffusor group which significantly increased the o2 penetration depth and the oxygenated sediment volume via bio irrigation and further inhibited sediment p release by the redox controlled p fixation in sediments table 2 fig s10a chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 l hoffmeisteri was a head down deposit feeder that can transport a small amount of o2 into sediments by the swinging its posterior end fig s10b ding et al 2011 in addition due to worm undulation oxic particles on the sediment surface can moved downward providing electron acceptors for fe ii around the worm burrows which also promoted the formation of fe oxide bound p and reduced p release from sediments table 2 chen et al 2016a c fluminea and b aeruginosa belonged to the bio diffusor group and often inhabited the top sediment layer o2 in the surface of sediment was consumed by their respiration fig s10c which increased p release from sediments by driving the reductive dissolution of fe oxide table 2 chen et al 2016b yang et al 2020 the total density of benthic fauna has decreased by approximately 93 in the past decade in lake taihu fig 2a among them the total density of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis which can reduce the sediment p release through bioturbation decreased by approximately 97 in 2020 compared with 2007 fig 2 other benthic species including c fluminea and b aeruginosa can increase the release of p from sediments with little change in density fig 2 the reduced densities of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis implied a reduction in burrowing and ventilating activities which further led to a decrease in o2 availability in sediments as a consequence the fe oxide was dissolved in surface sediments and caused the release of the trapped p into the overlying water which amplified the sediment p release and further maintained the p levels in the water column therefore the sharp decreases in the total density of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis should further exacerbate eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms by intensifying sediment p release in lake taihu previous studies have revealed that the lake warming low wind speed and persistent cyanobacterial blooms induced bottom water hypoxia in lake taihu were the major causes of the increased sediment p release deng et al 2018 qin et al 2021 xu et al 2021 this study for the first time confirmed that the decrease in the density of benthic faunas should also be an important reason for aggravating internal p release and maintaining the high p levels of water column in lake taihu 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that bioturbation played an important role in affecting the sediment p release and the p levels of water column in lakes the benthic species including g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis can reduce the sediment p release and their densities decrease significantly while the densities of those benthic species that can increase the sediment p release including c fluminea and b aeruginosa showed little change therefore the reduction in the density of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis should be an important factor to exacerbate internal p release and maintain the p level of the water column in lake taihu further quantification of the effects of the changes in density and dominant communities of benthic faunas on sediment p

15473,internal phosphorus p loading can increase the p level in the water column and further sustains cyanobacterial blooms this study focused on the role of benthic fauna bioturbation in affecting the sediment p release and the p level of water column in a eutrophic lake lake taihu the macrofauna density decreased from 4766 56 10541 80 ind m2 in 2007 to 345 447 63 ind m2 in 2020 due to the frequent bottom water hypoxia in lake taihu the reduced macrofauna density majorly resulted from grandidierella taihuensis limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and tanypus chinensis larvae and their total density decreased by approximately 97 in 2020 compared to 2007 g taihuensis one of the major benthic faunas was further used as a representative to investigate the effects of bioturbation on sediment p release using high resolution sampling and imaging techniques the results show that g taihuensis can increase the o2 penetration depth by more than 20 mm through bio irrigation and causes the redox conditions in burrows and surrounding sediments to change dramatically within a few minutes due to the intermittent ventilation subsequent oxidation of the soluble fe ii led to the formation of fe oxide bound p in the surface sediments thereby increasing the p retention in the sediments when the g taihuensis density was 1563 ind m2 at the sampling site approximately 0 12 g m 2 yr 1 p can be retained in sediments as previous studies have shown that l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis played a similar role in increasing the p retention in sediments through their bioturbation activities the sharp decline in benthic fauna density and burrowing activities in lake taihu should be an important reason for maintaining the high p level in the water column by decreasing the p retention in sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophic lakes shallow lakes bioturbation redox conditions internal phosphorus cycling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction lake eutrophication as a severe global environmental issue results from the excess input of nutrients into lakes by natural and anthropogenic activities duhamel et al 2021 it has led to many negative effects such as the frequent harmful cyanobacterial blooms the reduction in biodiversity and the decline in water quality hamilton et al 2018 reducing external nutrient loading is a widely accepted approach to control lake eutrophication lurling and van oosterhout 2013 despite massive efforts to control the direct nutrient input the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms continue to increase huisman et al 2018 orihel et al 2017 internal nutrient loading especially phosphorus p has been considered an important factor in sustaining lake eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms ding et al 2018 schindler et al 2008 studies have shown that the internal p loading of eutrophic lakes is similar to or higher than the external p loading during summer which delays the lake recovery from eutrophication after the reduction of external p loading sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2012 wang et al 2019 therefore understanding the factors and mechanisms that affect the internal p release is of great significance for the management and remediation of eutrophic lakes traditionally sediment p release has been thought to be driven by the reductive dissolution of iron oxides fe oxides which may be caused by various external environmental factors such as bottom water oxygen o2 levels orihel et al 2015 welsh 2003 cyanobacterial blooms lake warming high water levels and organic matter decomposition can mobilize p from sediments to the overlying water by depleting the o2 concentration in the bottom water column tong et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 bioturbation is also thought to play an important role in the internal p cycling in sediments kristensen et al 2012 welsh 2003 wyness et al 2021 in lake ecosystems the surface sediments are often inhabited by benthic fauna which can directly affect the sediment biogeochemical cycles through movement ingestion gallery construction and ventilation kristensen et al 2012 welsh 2003 these bioturbation processes include bio mixing and bio irrigation which may alter the p release fluxes by affecting the transport of particles and the supply of o2 in sediments respectively van de velde et al 2018 different macrofauna species have various modes of bioturbation which have significantly different effects on the sediment p release tarhan et al 2021 some benthic faunas can vertically horizontally or diffusely transport the p containing minerals via bio mixing which may affect the p mobility by altering the p burial in sediments dale et al 2016 however a recent study has demonstrated that bioturbation has a limited effect on the p burial in salt marsh sediments through field observations van de velde et al 2021 on the other hand the bio irrigation induced changes in o2 availability may have greater control over p mobility in sediments than the transport of bio mixing induced solid phase particles most benthic fauna lives in the burrows surrounded by anoxic sediments and they can ventilate their burrows with the o2 rich overlying water to meet the metabolic requirements for o2 shull 2019 welsh 2003 through bio irrigation macrofauna increases the penetration depth of o2 and the thickness of the oxic layer thereby inhibiting the sediment p release through the high p co precipitation capacity of the produced fe oxides in sediments benelli and bartoli 2021 in addition to bio mixing and bio irrigation macrofaunal respiration also changes the redox conditions in sediments which in turn further affects sediment p release for example corbicula fluminea can increase the internal p release by the reductive dissolution of fe oxides as their respiration depletes o2 in the surface sediments chen et al 2016b the effect of bioturbation on the solute exchange is not only associated with bioturbation styles but also with the density of benthic faunas bianchi et al 2021 lam gordillo et al 2022 a previous study found that the p release fluxes from sediments increased with the increase in the density of c fluminea zhang et al 2011 the changes in the density of benthic faunas can affect the bioturbation intensity such as the burrow size burrow depth and burrow density which further affects the penetration depth and reservoir size of o2 in sediments bonaglia et al 2014 michaud et al 2021 consequently the biogeochemical processes associated with redox reactions such as the p adsorption desorption in sediments due to the fe redox cycling can be affected by the changes in macrofauna density which may influence the sediment p release considering the fact that the effects of benthic faunas on the sediment p release depend on both bioturbation patterns and their densities associating the macrofaunal bioturbation patterns with their density changes is of great significance for assessing the overall impact of bioturbation on the internal p release in eutrophic lakes lake taihu a large shallow and eutrophic lake in china is often subjected to cyanobacterial blooms qin et al 2019 due to eutrophication its macrofaunal composition and density have undergone considerable change cai et al 2015 compared with 1987 1988 limnodrilus hoffmeisteri a pollution tolerant species replaced the c fluminea as the dominant in lake taihu cai et al 2015 while the densities of l hoffmeisteri significantly decreased in recent years peng et al 2020 in order to prevent cyanobacterial blooms external nutrient loading has been significantly reduced in lake taihu since 2007 the extent and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms and the total p tp concentrations showed no downward trends qin et al 2021 many studies have indicated that the internal p release largely determines the tp concentration in the water column which contributes 23 90 to the p demand of cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the rising water temperatures decreasing wind speeds and persistent cyanobacterial blooms are considered to be the major causes of internal p loading in lake taihu deng et al 2018 qin et al 2021 however whether changes in the macrofauna density affect the internal p release and the p level in the water column remains underexplored in lake taihu the knowledge about the effects of the bioturbation patterns and density changes of benthic fauna on sediment p release can be used to better understand the role of benthic fauna in internal p cycling and lake eutrophication which would help to provide constructive guidance for the future management and restoration of eutrophic lakes this study aimed to i investigate the changes in macrofauna density in lake taihu from 2007 to 2020 ii investigate the effects of bioturbation on the sediment mixing o2 dynamics and sediment p release using g taihuensis one of the dominant benthic faunas in lake taihu and iii elucidate the effects of changes in macrofaunal density on the sediment p release and water column p level in lake taihu specifically we hypothesized that i the g taihuensis can reduce the sediment p release by increasing supply of o2 to anoxic sediments and ii the decrease in benthic fauna density increases the sediment p release and maintains the high p level of water column in lake taihu 2 materials and methods 2 1 macrofauna density monitoring and environmental parameters measuring from 2007 to 2020 benthic samples were collected from 32 regular sampling sites in lake taihu catchment area 36 500 km2 lake area 2 338 km2 mean depth 1 90 m in february may august and november respectively fig 1 a sediments were sampled using peterson grabs 0 05 m2 and sieved in situ through a 0 25 mm mesh size cai et al 2017 the residual samples from the sieve were collected and transported to the laboratory where macrofauna was sorted and their numbers recorded the density of macrofauna individuals per square meter ind m2 was calculated according to their number and the sampling area the overlying water at each sampling site was collected to determine the tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations tp concentration was measured using molybdenum blue colorimetric method after persulfate digestion and chl a was measured spectrophotometrically after extraction by hot ethanol 90 2 2 collection of sediments and g taihuensis surface sediments were collected using a peterson grab in november 2020 at meiliang bay lake bay

flat surface and could be used to attach the o2 optodes for investigating o2 dynamics in the stable burrows fig s1 the overlying water at the same sampling site was collected using plastic barrels for incubation experiments in the laboratory g taihuensis was collected from the sampled sediments sieving the surface sediments using a 0 6 mm pore size mesh to remove macrofauna and debris and then homogenized the homogenized sediments were added to six plexiglass tubes diameter 9 cm length 30 cm six large transparent polycarbonate tanks 20 cm in height 10 cm in length 5 cm in width and six small transparent polycarbonate tanks 10 cm in height 10 cm in length 2 cm in width six plexiglass tubes were used to measure the soluble p concentration and p diffusive flux three big transparent polycarbonate tanks were used to record the behavior of g taihuensis and the o2 dynamics during the bioturbation while the other three big tanks were used to measure the two dimensional 2d distribution of labile p three small tanks were used to measure the flow velocities in the burrow and other small tanks were used to investigate the sediment reworking 2 3 color tracer measurements and tracer particle imaging rhodamine b was used as a color tracer to determine flow velocities in this study fig 1f it was firstly dissolved in water 10 mg l and added via a pipette over the inlet of the burrow and the time until the tracer reached the outlet was recorded the fluorescent images were recorded at 1s interval with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos equipped with a macro lens and a 520 nm long pass filter under the 500 nm excitation light the sudden and rapid water flow through the burrow was identified as ventilation activity the sediment reworking was simulated using tracer particles fig 1f gilbert et al 2021 roche et al 2016 the dpa pan the fluorophore diphenylanthracene was incorporated into polyacrylonitrile particle was chosen as the simulated sediment particle because it was insensitive to the dissolved gases and ions meier et al 2011 details of the fabrication method can be found in the supplementary materials 100 mg of dpa pan particles were added to the sediment surface followed by six g taihuensis in the small tanks the fluorescent images were then obtained using a cmos camera under the 395 nm excitation light the blue channel of the fluorescent image was extracted to investigate the sediment reworking 2 4 o2 imaging o2 dynamics were measured using o2 planar optodes in both big transparent polycarbonate tanks and modified plexiglass tubes figs 1f and s1 planar optodes consisted of a o2 sensitive indicator dye and a reference dye dispersed in a o2 permeable polymer and coated on optically transparent solid supports scholz et al 2021 the imaging principle of planar optodes for o2 is based on the dynamic quenching of a fluorophore in the presence of o2 polerecky et al 2006 details of the fabrication and calculation of o2 optodes can be found in the supplementary materials the imaging system easysensor po 1100 https global easysensor com consisted of a cmos camera equipped with a macro lens and a 460 nm long pass filter and two 405 nm light emitting diodes five g taihuensis were added to the three big tanks to investigate o2 dynamics during burrowing o2 images were recorded every 30 s until stable burrows were formed the modified plexiglass tubes attached to o2 optodes were applied to map the o2 dynamics in the stable burrows 2 5 measurement of soluble reactive p srp and labile p in the six plexiglass tubes ten g taihuensis were added to three tubes as bioturbated group and the other three tubes served as controls non bioturbated group fig 1 the amount of g taihuensis added was determined according to the density of g taihuensis at the sampling sites 1563 ind m2 all tubes were incubated at 18 c using a water thermostat system ten days later six high resolution dialysis samplers hr peeper easysensor ltd nanjing china were inserted into the sediment for 48 h to obtain the soluble reactive p srp and soluble fe concentrations fig 1g based on the diffusive equilibrium principle five g taihuensis were added to the other three big tanks and incubated at 18 c for ten days and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were applied to obtain the labile p distribution in sediments fig 1g labile p determined by dgt includes soluble p in porewater and the weakly bound p released from solids in sediments ding et al 2013 the zr oxide dgt was provided by easysensor ltd nanjing china its fabrication and analysis can be found in the supplementary materials the 5 5 cm zr oxide binding gel was mounted onto polyethylene terephthalate pet plate 400 Î¼m in thickness then overlaid with a vinylidene fluoride membrane 0 45 Î¼m pore size 100 Î¼m in thickness and finally the dgt gel and membrane were fixed to pet with sealing tapes the thin probe was inserted into the sediment perpendicular and parallel to the burrow for 24 h 2 6 data analysis to assess the advective flow of overlying water through burrows by g taihuensis flow velocity v mm s volumetric flow rate q Î¼l s and area specific water volume pumped by g taihuensis populations q pop m3 m 2 d 1 were calculated based on color tracer measurement results according to roskosch et al 2010 furthermore the time of the whole lake water was pumped through the sediment by g taihuensis can be estimated by applying the q pop to the lake volume roskosch et al 2010 detailed calculation procedures can be found in the supplementary materials o2 penetration depth below the burrow sediment interface was estimated from the fluorescent images and the o2 penetration depth was defined as the value where the o2 concentration value was lower than the lowest detection limit of the planar optode 1 2 Î¼mol l 1 the diffusive oxygen uptake dou mmol m 2 d 1 in sediments was calculated from the fluorescent images based on fick s first law glud 2008 according the o2 dynamics in the burrow the time interval from the o2 concentration started to increase and increased to the maximum value in the burrow was considered as the ventilation period polerecky et al 2006 the diffusion flux of srp j mg m 2 d 1 across the sediment water interface swi was calculated based on fick s first law and the dgt measurements were typically interpreted as the time averaged fluxes f pg cm 2 s 1 detailed calculation processes can be found in the supplementary materials furthermore the sediment p release mass under g taihuensis bioturbation for each year can be estimated by multiplying the diffusive flux of srp with the number of days within the year ding et al 2018 in this study the graphs were produced using origin 2018 matlab 2016 and surfer 13 pearson correlation analysis was performed using spss 25 to evaluate the associations between the parameters two sample t tests p 0 05 using spss 25 were used to assess the difference of bioturbated group and non bioturbated group 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in macrofauna density in lake taihu as shown in fig 2 a the total macrofauna density decreased from 4766 56 10541 80 ind m2 in 2007 to 345 00 447 63 ind m2 in 2020 the dominant faunas were g taihuensis tanypus chinensis larvae l hoffmeisteri c fluminea and bellamya aeruginosa which accounted for more than 80 of the total macrofauna the densities of g taihuensis and l hoffmeisteri showed a decreasing trend with their average densities dropping from 240 47 272 22 ind m2 and 3447 34 9292 97 ind m2 in 2007 to 11 36 38 57 ind m2 and 27 11 69 51 ind m2 in 2020 respectively fig 2b and c moreover t chinensis showed a decline trend with its densities ranging from 199 06 653 86 ind m2 in 2007 to 74 80 269 10 ind m2 in 2020 fig 2d other two benthic species c fluminea and b aeruginosa remained stable in densities with their mean densities ranging from 148 91 301 47 ind m2 and 24 06 61 14 ind m2 in 2007 to 124 44 261 86 ind m2 and 25 76 92 54 ind m2 in 2020 respectively fig 2e and f in lake taihu the highest density of g taihuensis one of the dominant macrofauna can reach 5760 ind m2 fig 3 the high densities of g taihuensis were in the north bay areas and the northwest part of the open lake areas fig 3 which were known as the eutrophication areas in lake taihu deng et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 according to previous studies l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis were also mainly found in eutrophic lake areas while c fluminea and b aeruginosa mainly inhabited the open lake area and the east bay area far from the eutrophication areas of lake taihu cai et al 2015 2017 eutrophication can provide more food for benthic faunas in lakes but can also lead to o2 depletion near sediments affecting the survival of hypoxia sensitive species tomaÅ¡ovÃ½ch et al 2018 especially in lake taihu the persistent cyanobacterial blooms elevated water temperatures and climatically modulated decline in wind speed have led to an increased frequency of bottom water hypoxia deng et al 2018 qin et al 2021 2019 studies have indicated that bottom water o2 levels can affect the composition density and diversity of benthic communities bianchi et al 2021 levin 2003 g taihuensis and l hoffmeisteri are known to be sensitive to anoxic conditions spicer et al 2002 volpers and neumann 2005 so the high frequency of bottom water hypoxia should lead to a decrease in their density c fluminea and b aeruginosa mainly inhabited the non eutrophication areas their density remained stable due to they were not affected by eutrophication a negative correlation r 0 524 p 0 05 was further found between the macrofauna density and chl a concentration table s1 all evidence suggested that the high frequency of bottom water hypoxia caused by persistent cyanobacterial blooms may be the main reason for the decline in the macrofauna density in lake taihu 3 2 effects of g taihuensis bioturbation on sediment mixing o2 dynamics and sediment p release in the unbioturbated sediments solutes generally diffused upward from porewater to the overlying water through molecular diffusion along the concentration gradient between the sediment porewater phase and the overlying water phase luther et al 1999 bioturbation can alter the simple one dimensional diffusion patterns into more complex three dimensional reaction patterns volkenborn et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to study the effects of bioturbation on the sediment environment at high spatial resolutions in this study g taihuensis was selected as a representative to investigate the effects of bioturbation on the transport of particles o2 dynamics and sediment p release using high resolution sampling and imaging methods including fluorescence imaging of color tracers and tracer particles planar optodes and dgt sediment mixing the sediment reworking by the g taihuensis was mainly related to the construction and maintenance of burrows in this study the depth of burrows varied from 3 2 mm to 60 mm below the swi and the width ranged from 1 mm to 3 mm slightly wider than the g taihuensis body figs s2 s3 and s4 g taihuensis used their pereopods to dig down into sediment to build burrows which resulted in the rapid mixing of the tracer particles in the surface sediments fig s2 during the burrowing a part of tracer particles could be transported into the deeper sediments while some sediment particles in the deeper sediment could be transported to the surface through excavation activities fig s2 the depth of particle reworking which depended on the burrowing depth was approximately 0 80 cm by g taihuensis fig s2 this is consistent with previous findings that sediment mixing depth by some amphipods gammarus pulex and corophium volutator was less than 2 cm de backer et al 2011 mermillod blondin et al 2004 moreover g taihuensis bioturbation could re distributed the tracer particles into the sediments near the burrows close to the oxidation areas caused by bio irrigation figs s2 and s3 g taihuensis drove the transport of sediment particles from the oxic zone in the top sediment layer to the other oxidation areas around the burrows which may produce a negligible effect on the burial of organic matter in sediments o2 dynamics the changes in the redox conditions in sediments can be regarded as one of the most significant effects of bioturbation in this study g taihuensis excavated the sediments to establish burrows resulting in the o2 rich overlying water being irrigated into burrows fig 4 they could wiggle their pereopods to ventilate or flush their burrows with the oxygenated overlying water which also increased the supply of o2 into the sediments fig 4 according to the measured time of the tracer passing through the burrow roskosch et al 2010 the flow velocity and volumetric flow rate were calculated to be 4 96 1 09 mm s and 31 12 6 87 Î¼l s in the burrows of g taihuensis respectively which were higher than those in the abandoned burrows 0 18 0 01 mm s and 0 86 0 02 Î¼l s p 0 05 table 1 the area specific water volume q pop was calculated to be 0 25 m3 m 2 d 1 and 0 09 m3 m 2 d 1 respectively according to the average densities of g taihuensis 463 75 ind m2 in 2007 and 165 40 ind m2 in 2007 in the meiliang bay based on the calculated q pop values the lake water of meiliang bay 3 78 108 m3 could be irrigated through their burrows within 10 63 d and 30 d in 2007 and 2020 respectively through the above mentioned drilling and ventilation activities of the g taihuensis the o2 rich overlying water was irrigated into the burrows and the o2 penetration depth was increased pronouncedly from a few millimeters to more than 20 mm figs s3 s4 and 4 therefore the high density of g taihuensis considerably increased the o2 reservoir size in the sediments in addition o2 concentrations in the burrow fluctuated at a minute scale fig 4 the o2 concentrations in burrows the o2 penetration depths and the diffusive o2 uptake rates in sediments below the burrows ranged from 15 20 Âµmol l 1 0 88 mm and 1 40 mmol m 2 d 1 to 177 21Âµmol l 1 3 28 mm and 12 11 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively fig s6 the highly dynamic redox oscillations in the burrows and the surrounding sediments were the results of the intermittent ventilating activities of g taihuensis by pleopod swing compared to the surficial sediments the sediments surrounding the burrows experienced much more dynamic redox conditions due to the intermittent ventilating activities fig 4 we further calculated the ventilation period of g taihuensis was 12 215 2 595 min h according to the o2 dynamic in the burrow table 1 fig s5 the oxic anoxic oscillations were also observed in the burrows with other benthic species for example chironomus plumosus h diversicolor and arenicola marina intermittently ventilated their burrows by pumping overlying water through their burrows pischedda et al 2011 polerecky et al 2006 volkenborn et al 2010 and the ghost shrimp neotrypaea californiensis intermittently ventilated their burrows by pleopod beating volkenborn et al 2012 after abandonment of the burrows by g taihuensis the o2 concentrations decreased rapidly and eventually the burrows and their surrounding sediments became anaerobic with the highest o2 consumption rate of 400 mmol m 3 s 1 in the center of the burrows figs 4 s6 and s7 these results demonstrated that the bioturbation of g taihuensis considerably increased the o2 availability in sediments sediment p release there was no labile p flux in the burrow and sediments above the burrow fig 5 a the labile p fluxes gradually increased from 15 to 30 pg cm 2 s 1 at the burrow sediment interface to 80 120 pg cm 2 s 1 in the bulk sediments with a 3 5 mm gradient zone between them fig 5a the concentrations of srp and soluble fe in the bioturbated sediments were also significantly lower than those in the bulk sediments p 0 05 fig 5b furthermore there was a clear positive correlation between the srp and soluble fe concentrations r 0 984 p 0 01 table s2 which demonstrated that the p mobility in sediments was controlled by the fe redox cycling the release fluxes of srp and soluble fe across the swi were 0 48 0 23 and 3 68 1 69 mg m 2 d 1 respectively which were lower than those of the control 0 82 0 06 and 6 97 0 22 mg m 2 d 1 fig 5c therefore approximately 0 12 g m 2 yr 1 p was retained in sediments when the g taihuensis density was 1563 ind m2 at the sampling site it is evident that the low labile p fluxes and srp concentrations in the sediments were due to the increase in o2 availability by burrowing and ventilating activities of g taihuensis figs 4 and 5a they irrigated the o2 rich overlying water into the burrows and subsequently o2 diffused through the burrow walls into the surrounding sediments resulting in an oxide layer around the burrows figs 4 s3 and s4 fe ii diffused from the anaerobic sediments to the aerobic zones where it was oxidized and precipitated in the aerobic zones before reaching the inside of the burrow subsequently the soluble p released from sediments was sequestered in this oxidized zone in the form of fe oxide bound p thus the amount of sediment p release was reduced hupfer and lewandowski 2008 lam gordillo et al 2022 furthermore we observed thin layers of organic material inside the burrows formed by g taihuensis fig s8 the burrow linings often contained negatively charged functional groups that can act as molecular sieves and reduce the diffusion of small inorganic solutes especially anions such as p aller 1983 thereby fe oxide coupled with the low permeability of burrow lining became a barrier to increase p retention in sediments which confirmed that g taihuensis bioturbation can strongly inhibit the release of p from sediments 3 3 effect of decrease in macrofauna density on the internal p release according to the field monitoring data the average chl a concentration increased from 2007 to 2020 fig 6 a which indicated that cyanobacterial blooms exhibited an increasing trend tp concentrations in lake taihu declined slightly followed by a recent increase while remaining generally high 0 10 mg l 1 fig 6b the external p loading and internal p supply are considered to be the key reasons for maintaining high p level in the water column and frequent cyanobacterial blooms xu et al 2021 in this study we found that non significant between tp concentrations and external p loading r 0 421 p 0 05 but strong positive correlation with internal p loading r 0 667 p 0 01 figs 6b c and s9 table s1 a significant positive correlation r 0 766 p 0 01 was further observed between the internal p loading and chl a concentration table s1 therefore it can be inferred that the internal p loading is mainly responsible for the high p levels in the water column and cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu different macrofauna can play different roles in influencing the internal p release combined with our previous studies we further analyzed the effects of the other four dominant benthic faunas on redox conditions and internal p release table 2 t chinensis belonged to the gallery diffusor group which significantly increased the o2 penetration depth and the oxygenated sediment volume via bio irrigation and further inhibited sediment p release by the redox controlled p fixation in sediments table 2 fig s10a chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 l hoffmeisteri was a head down deposit feeder that can transport a small amount of o2 into sediments by the swinging its posterior end fig s10b ding et al 2011 in addition due to worm undulation oxic particles on the sediment surface can moved downward providing electron acceptors for fe ii around the worm burrows which also promoted the formation of fe oxide bound p and reduced p release from sediments table 2 chen et al 2016a c fluminea and b aeruginosa belonged to the bio diffusor group and often inhabited the top sediment layer o2 in the surface of sediment was consumed by their respiration fig s10c which increased p release from sediments by driving the reductive dissolution of fe oxide table 2 chen et al 2016b yang et al 2020 the total density of benthic fauna has decreased by approximately 93 in the past decade in lake taihu fig 2a among them the total density of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis which can reduce the sediment p release through bioturbation decreased by approximately 97 in 2020 compared with 2007 fig 2 other benthic species including c fluminea and b aeruginosa can increase the release of p from sediments with little change in density fig 2 the reduced densities of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis implied a reduction in burrowing and ventilating activities which further led to a decrease in o2 availability in sediments as a consequence the fe oxide was dissolved in surface sediments and caused the release of the trapped p into the overlying water which amplified the sediment p release and further maintained the p levels in the water column therefore the sharp decreases in the total density of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis should further exacerbate eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms by intensifying sediment p release in lake taihu previous studies have revealed that the lake warming low wind speed and persistent cyanobacterial blooms induced bottom water hypoxia in lake taihu were the major causes of the increased sediment p release deng et al 2018 qin et al 2021 xu et al 2021 this study for the first time confirmed that the decrease in the density of benthic faunas should also be an important reason for aggravating internal p release and maintaining the high p levels of water column in lake taihu 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that bioturbation played an important role in affecting the sediment p release and the p levels of water column in lakes the benthic species including g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis can reduce the sediment p release and their densities decrease significantly while the densities of those benthic species that can increase the sediment p release including c fluminea and b aeruginosa showed little change therefore the reduction in the density of g taihuensis l hoffmeisteri and t chinensis should be an important factor to exacerbate internal p release and maintain the p level of the water column in lake taihu further quantification of the effects of the changes in density and dominant communities of benthic faunas on sediment p

15474,many factors have been reported to affect material cycling in lakes but the combined and cascading impacts of external environmental factors and in lake biota on lake carbon cycling are poorly understood we elucidated the influencing pathways of geoclimatic factors lake morphometry land use type chemical and physical factors and biological taxa phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates on the concentrations of two important components of carbon cycling i e dissolved organic matter dom and methane ch4 based on datasets from 64 plateau lakes in southwest china partial least squares path modelling pls pm indicated that 1 geoclimatic factors influenced dom and ch4 by affecting land use and lake physical factors e g water temperature 2 lake morphometry water depth and lake area had a direct and great negative effect on the ch4 concentration related to the production and oxidation of ch4 and affected phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates by influencing chemical and physical factors 3 land use type affected dom and ch4 concentrations in both direct and indirect ways 4 terrestrial humic like dom was mainly discharged from forestland and also affected by macroinvertebrates while the impacts of agricultural and construction land on autochthonous dom and ch4 concentrations mainly occurred by changing nutrients and then the aquatic biota moreover changes in aquatic biota primarily affected by water quality influenced dom spectral properties and the two biotas affected dom and ch4 concentrations differently phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria contributed to protein like and humic like dom in both direct and indirect ways related to eutrophication whereas macroinvertebrates influenced dom possibly by utilization bioturbation and microbial decomposition of feces according to their different relationships with dom spectral indices additionally ch4 production can be enhanced by dom accumulation and the significant positive correlations of ch4 concentrations with protein like dom and biological index indicate that autochthonous dom may play an important role for the ch4 production our findings contribute to the understanding of lake carbon cycling under natural conditions and anthropogenic disturbances graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter dom methane ch4 phytoplankton macroinvertebrates landuse water depth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake ecosystems provide essential goods and valuable services to human society heino et al 2021 and regulate global biogeochemical cycles heino et al 2021 tranvik et al 2009 yang et al 2015 however global lake ecosystems have been identified as important sources of natural greenhouse gases e g methane ch4 contributing about 30 to global natural ch4 emissions although lakes occupy only 3 of the global land surface area downing et al 2006 concentrations of ch4 in lakes are governed by external drivers or inputs from the surrounding catchment as well as by internal biogeochemical processes e g organic matter decomposition methanogenesis and oxidation among which the decomposition of dissolved organic matter dom is an important driver of ch4 production li et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 dom in natural waters is derived from both allochthonous e g terrestrial and atmospheric input and autochthonous e g phytoplankton and bacterial excretion or metabolism sources stedmon et al 2007 zhang et al 2021b therefore the abundance of dom is also governed by both external and internal factors the complexity of the internal and external controls on ch4 and dom in lakes poses a challenge in predicting changes in their concentrations external drivers such as geoclimatic factors e g altitude and precipitation lake morphometry e g water depth and lake area and land use type affect the production of ch4 and dom abundance altitude generally affects ch4 and dom by impacting temperature and human activity intensity in catchments davidson et al 2018 delsontro et al 2016 zhang et al 2021b precipitation not only carries organic matter from the air into lakes it may also bring terrestrial dom into the lake via runoff bastidas navarro and modenutti 2012 with potential effects on ch4 production lake area which is related to water residence time and fetch can impact dom degradation du et al 2021 and the emission of ch4 li et al 2020a rasilo et al 2015 water depth affects the formation and release of ch4 yuan et al 2021 and generally shows a negative correlation with ch4 concentration sundh et al 1994 li et al 2020a for example less ch4 will be transported from the sediment to the water surface in deep lakes partially because it is oxidized on the way whereas more ch4 could be released from shallow lakes which are also more vulnerable to eutrophication li et al 2020a qin et al 2020 moreover land use changes in catchments affect nutrient levels in lakes zhou et al 2022b and subsequently dom and ch4 concentrations yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b studies have shown that freshwater greenhouse gas concentrations were positively associated with the proportion of human impacted land types in the watershed wang et al 2021 in particular agricultural and urban land can influence the soil characteristics in the surrounding terrestrial systems and these changes can increase the input of nutrients and organic matter into waters huotari et al 2013 thereby enhancing their contents stedmon et al 2003 yang et al 2020 in addition to external environmental factors aquatic biotas in lakes are also important in the assimilation and release of carbon ren et al 2022 zhou et al 2019b methanogens generally regulate carbon cycling e g ch4 through anaerobic degradation of organic matter conrad 2005 algae make a large contribution to dom and ch4 after they die and are decomposed li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b and the massive amount of dead algae in eutrophic lakes can create an anaerobic environment that accelerates the formation of ch4 bartosiewicz et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b besides algae can produce ch4 via other pathways such as by demethylation and by converting fixed inorganic carbon biÅ¾iÄ et al 2020 tang et al 2016 furthermore material circulation through benthic organisms is part of the linkages between producers and higher level consumers which may indirectly affect the dynamics of dom and ch4 amaral et al 2021 belle et al 2016 bioturbation by benthic animals can enhance organic matter release and microbiome mineralization through feeding flipping particles and feces across the sediment water interface aller 1980 dom transformed carbon feeding by benthic collectors cummins and klug 1979 may limit ch4 formation by reducing dom mineralization at the sediment water interface for instance ch4 derived carbon is an important food source for chironomids a high density of chironomids can affect the abundance of ch4 oxidizing bacteria and ch4 cycling agasild et al 2018 jones and grey 2011 however organisms in waters interact with each other variations in one taxon community may have direct and indirect effects on others further affecting the material cycling in the whole system therefore it is important to explore the impact of the synergy or antagonism among multiple biotas on dom and ch4 in lakes jones and grey 2011 lennon et al 2006 although studies have extensively analyzed the independent influence of a few vital factors such as water depth li et al 2020a temperature chen et al 2021 eutrophication beaulieu et al 2019 and phytoplankton bartosiewicz et al 2021 liu et al 2021 on dom or ch4 dynamics in lakes the cascading effects of multidimensional factors including various abiotic and biotic factors on dom and ch4 concentrations have not been adequately addressed which constrains our knowledge of the roles of external and internal factors in driving the carbon cycling in waters in this study we explored how environmental factors and aquatic biota i e phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates impact dom and ch4 concentrations in lakes on the yunnan guizhou plateau the main objectives were to 1 elucidate the effects of external factors on dom and ch4 concentrations and 2 reveal how multiple organisms respond to external factors and affect dom and ch4 concentrations in lakes we hypothesized that both external factors and in lake biota are important in influencing the dom and ch4 concentrations 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the yunnan guizhou plateau lake zone in southwest china fig 1 one of the five lake zones in china this region contains plenty of freshwater lakes being surrounded by mountains most of the lakes are located in catchments with numerous inflows but few outflows resulting in a long water residence time and substantial sedimentation zhuo et al 2021 in addition the heterogenous mountain landscape makes the catchments as important ecosystems for biodiversity however with the increasing population and economic development in recent decades many yunnan guizhou plateau lakes have suffered from the impacts of anthropogenic activities which has led to eutrophication zhou et al 2019a biodiversity decline ding et al 2017 and changes in biogeochemical cycles zhuo et al 2021 2 2 dataset collection 2 2 1 field sampling and local environmental variables a total of 64 lakes 166 samples were included in this study fig 1 field samplings were conducted in the wet season july september 2017 and august september 2018 in lake fuxian and lake puzhehei we investigated 16 and 6 sites respectively while for other lakes 1 4 sampling points were investigated the altitude al of the studied lakes ranges from 463 to 4478 m a s l the lake area larea ranges from less than 0 01 to 242 5

parameters total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chla spectral properties of dom and phytoplankton composition if the water depth was less than 0 5 m the corresponding water samples were collected from a shallower depth three peterson grab samples were collected from surface sediment at each sampling point for macroinvertebrate analysis the concentrations of tn tp and chla were determined following standard methods state environmental protection administration of china 2002 2 2 2 phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates analysis water samples 1000 ml for phytoplankton analysis were preserved with lugol s solution and concentrated to 30 ml for counting by category zhou et al 2022b all algal taxa were counted at 400 magnification using a light microscope olympus japan the phytoplankton was identified to the species or genus level according to hu and wei 2006 algal biovolume was determined based on cell numbers and cell size measurements and a volume of 1 mm3 was considered to be equivalent to 1 mg of fresh weight biomass zhang et al 2021a macroinvertebrate samplings were conducted in 55 lakes of which macroinvertebrate specimens were successfully collected from 40 lakes macroinvertebrate specimens were manually sorted from the sediment in the field and preserved in 70 ethanol for identification in the laboratory macroinvertebrate specimens were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level using relevant literature brinkhurst 1986 epler 2001 morse et al 1994 macroinvertebrate biomass was the sum of all individual weights at each sampling site and was converted into weight at m 2 based on the sample area 2 2 3 dom and ch4 analysis the absorbance and fluorescence of dom were determined according to zhou et al 2016 and the absorption at 254 nm a254 m 1 was selected to represent dom abundance meanwhile the fluorescent components of dom were identified by parallel factor analysis parafac modelling based on stedmon et al 2003 fluorescent components 1 and 2 c1 and c2 are humic like materials while components 3 and 4 c3 and c4 correspond to tryptophan like and tyrosine like materials respectively fig s1 table s3 the humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi were calculated from the excitation emission matrix fluorescence and the details are shown in table s3 ch4 concentrations were measured following xiao et al 2017 at each sampling site bubble free lake water was collected at 0 5 m below the water surface into a 61 ml glass bottle with the excess water overflowing the bottle the bottle was immediately capped without headspace using a butyl rubber stopper ultrahigh purity n2 gas 99 999 was injected into the glass bottle to create a 10 ml headspace to determine the concentration of ch4 dissolved in the water samples the dissolved ch4 concentration was calculated according to a temperature dependent henry s law constant accounting for ch4 in the headspace johnson et al 1990 2 2 4 land use and climatic variables the land use dataset in 2017 was extracted from landsat 8 images downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn we applied the rgb band combination of the landsat 8 oli satellite with red band 5 green band 4 blue band 3 for visual interpretation after geometric correction radiometric calibration and flaash atmospheric correction of each image the training samples were selected with the help of google earth and then the land use classification was made through the maximum likelihood classification algorithm the kappa coefficients

modelling pls pm was performed to show the linkage among all the variables full model first and we then eliminated the indicators with loadings of less than 0 4 absolute value to the latent variable hulland 1999 fischer 2012 we kept the variables with loadings greater than 0 4 to the latent variable for further pls pm analysis the partial correlation coefficients factor loadings to latent variables and goodness of fits gof were computed using the plspm package in r and missing values were interpolated during this analysis we further conducted a generalized additive model gam analysis using r with the mgcv package to predict the relationships of selected biota taxa based on the pls pm results with dom and ch4 concentrations 3 results 3 1 general characteristics environmental factors land use type biological taxa dom abundance dom components and ch4 concentration varied considerably among the studied lakes figs 1 and 2 table s2 water temperature decreased linearly with increasing altitude the nutrient levels of the studied lakes ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic with transparency varying from 0 29 to 8 75 m for land use type forestland was included in all studied lakes and grassland was included in only 15 6 of the studied lakes the sum proportion of agricultural and construction land ranged from 0 to 78 3 and 81 3 of the lakes were surrounded by these two types of land fig 1 a total of 234 phytoplankton 7 phyla and 37 macroinvertebrate taxa were identified cyanophyta accounted for a large proportion of the phytoplankton biomass in lakes with high proportions of agricultural and construction land whereas bacillariophyta accounted for a large proportion in lakes with low proportions of agricultural and construction land fig 2a for macroinvertebrates we defined four functional feeding groups i e filter collector gather collector predator scraper according to taxa in the studied lakes and the gather collector mainly chironomids and oligochaeta biomass accounted for a large proportion in most lakes fig 2b dom abundance ranged from 1 3 to 101 m 1 table s2 and among the four dom components c1 accounted for the largest percentage 34 8 of the total dom fmax fig 2c the ch4 concentration varied among the 64 studied lakes fig 2d and it did not show any pattern in the gradient of the sum proportions of agricultural and construction land 3 2 correlation analysis of variables pearson correlation analysis revealed dom abundance to be negatively correlated with water depth lake area water temperature bare land transparency and bacillariophyta and positively correlated with ch4 concentration forestland nutrients chlorophyll a cyanophyta cryptophyta euglenophyta gather collectors filter collectors and predators the ch4 concentration was negatively correlated with water depth lake area forestland transparency and bacillariophyta and positively correlated with agricultural land construction land nutrients water temperature cyanophyta c1 c2 c3 c4 and bix in terms of land use agricultural and construction land had positive correlations with total phosphorus total nitrogen water temperature dissolved oxygen phytoplankton taxa c3 c4 bix and fi and had negative correlations with transparency gather collectors filter collectors and hix however forestland showed opposite correlations with these variables than for agricultural and construction land fig 3 3 3 the influence path of external factors and biota on dom and ch4 concentrations the full pls pm model indicated that some explanatory variables such as surface solar radiation downwards grassland present lake other lakes water transparency bacillariophyta chrysophyta and scrapers exhibited low loadings absolute value 0 4 to latent variables fig s2 thus we removed these variables and reran the pls pm analysis fig 4 the results demonstrated that lake morphometry not only had a direct and negative influence r 0 53 on the ch4 concentration it also indirectly affected dom and ch4 concentrations via changing chemical and physical conditions besides the direct impact on dom abundance r 0 27 land use indirectly influenced dom and ch4 concentrations via changing chemical factors subsequently affecting physical factors phytoplankton and or macroinvertebrate biomass geoclimatic factors influenced dom and ch4 by strongly impacting land use and physical factors 3 4 predicting the relationship among variables gam models revealed the relationships among the biological taxa selected in the pls pm and dom abundance or ch4 concentration fig 5 the results showed significant relationships between the selected phytoplankton macroinvertebrate taxa except for chlorophyta and dom abundance all phytoplankton taxa except cyanophyta and all macroinvertebrate taxa exhibited no significant relationships with the ch4 concentration fig 5f h m p cyanophyta cryptophyta filter collectors and predators were positively related to dom abundance fig 5a b k l whereas euglenophyta and gather collectors exhibited unimodal relationships with dom abundance fig 5c j 4 discussion 4 1 external drivers of dom characteristics and ch4 concentration pls pm and correlation analysis clearly showed that the lake morphometric variables included in the analysis depth and area had a strong negative effect on dom and ch4 concentrations enhanced water depth and lake area were associated with high water transparency fig 3 and water residence time which may promote the photo and microbial degradation of larger molecular dom du et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b as a result dom abundance especially humic like components c1 c2 and hix decreased indirectly with increases in these lake morphometric variables likewise lake morphometry can influence water column mixing dissolved oxygen concentration piston velocity and sediment carbon accumulation thus further impacting ch4 production and oxidation read et al 2012 li et al 2020a for example deeper water depth increases the oxidation probability of ch4 ebulliated from the bottom to the surface and larger fetch mixing with lake area promotes reoxygenation and diffusion of ch4 li et al 2020a rasilo et al 2015 in addition shallow lakes are more vulnerable to eutrophication as a result of high nutrient loadings and biogeochemical processes qin et al 2020 nutrient enrichment not only allows algae to bloom and provide more organic matter e g dom as the substrate for ch4 production it also causes poor transparency which weakens the dom photodegradation zhang et al 2021b and an anaerobic environment which promotes benthic ch4 formation by methanogens li et al 2021 in addition although the increase of irradiation can promote the photoproduction of ch4 the dom absorption loss normalized ch4 photoproduction may decrease with increasing dom abundance li et al 2020b which may be related to the negative impact of dom on light penetration these observations from previous studies are in line with our results that water depth was significantly and negatively correlated to tn tp and chla concentrations and positively correlated to transparency and that ch4 concentration increased with growing phytoplankton biomass and dom abundance and shallowing water transparency figs 3 and 4 land use affected dom characteristics and ch4 concentrations in direct and indirect ways allochthonous dom is mainly directly discharged from terrestrial parts terrestrial humic like c1 and its proportion as well as hix were significantly positively correlated with forestland indicating that the input of allochthonous dom partially came from forestland meanwhile construction land was also related to anthropogenic humic like c2 abundance figs 3 and s3 the indirect way of land use affecting dom and ch4 concentrations occurs via changing water quality causing changes in aquatic biota biomass according to the pls pm the concentrations of tn and tp in lakes with agricultural and construction land are prone to increase due to the use of fertilizers and the discharge of domestic sewage this increased nutrient input may enhance autochthonous dom abundance by promoting the biomass of microorganisms in waters for example increasing nitrogen sources can increase phytoplankton and bacteria biomass and more labile dom goldberg et al 2017 lake ch4 production and emissions are positively correlated with nutrient levels beaulieu et al 2019 li et al 2021 rasilo et al 2015 thus agricultural and construction land had large contributions to autochthonous dom and further to ch4 in our study figs 3 and s3 the joint effect of other factors belle et al 2016 heino et al 2021 for example altitude and precipitation further complicates the mechanisms behind the changes of dom and ch4 in lakes our results showed that geoclimatic factors had indirect impacts on dom and ch4 concentrations by mediating the effects of land use and physical factors lakes at low altitudes tend to be more affected by human activities e g agriculture and construction which results in a higher nutrient input as discussed above fig 4 moreover lakes at low altitudes tend to be characterized by higher water temperature and increased temperature can simultaneously promote microbial production and decomposition of dom zhang et al 2021b here although the increased temperature stimulated the growth of most phytoplankton and the production of autochthonous dom fig 3 the negative correlation between water temperature and dom abundance suggests that dom decomposition cannot be ignored moreover the increased surface water temperature may strengthen thermocline and subsequent oxygen stratification particularly in deep lakes zhang et al 2014 2015 which may result in an anoxic environment in the hypolimnion unfavoring benthic macroinvertebrates that impact dom and favor ch4 production figs 3 and 4 besides increased water temperature can enhance ch4 production by increasing the activity of methanogenic microorganisms especially at higher nutrient levels davidson et al 2018 delsontro et al 2016 and may promote gas release so that more ch4 was detected chen et al 2021 davidson et al 2018 as also found in a large scale study by rasilo et al 2015 in addition precipitation has different influencing paths on dom dynamics precipitation can increase or decrease dom through runoff or dilution and impact dom by affecting algal and microbial metabolism as well as photodegradation kellerman et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b at a regional scale it is difficult to decouple the positive and negative influences of precipitation on dom and even ch4 dynamics in the present study 4 2 aquatic biota influence dom characteristics and ch4 concentrations the significantly positive impact of phytoplankton on dom fig 4 indicated that large proportions of the phytoplankton biomass contributed significantly to dom abundance liu et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b phytoplankton contributes directly to dom in two ways by residues derived from the microbial decomposition of phytoplankton and by metabolites of phytoplankton and bacteria zhang et al 2021b the former was partially embodied in the significant positive correlation of phytoplankton with hix and the latter was reflected in the significant positive correlation of phytoplankton with c3 c4 and fi fig 3 of the phytoplankton taxa cyanobacteria contributed the most to dom abundance fig 5 cyanobacteria derived dom represents a potentially important source of autochthonous material due to eutrophication which favors cyanobacterial spread and even blooms patriarca et al 2021 in our study cyanobacterial biomass increased most markedly in lakes with agricultural and construction land in the watersheds suggesting that it was a major source of algal derived dom in watersheds with strong anthropogenic activities for example agricultural and industrial activities however c1 c2 hix and the percentages of c1 and c2 were all positively correlated with cyanophyta biomass and its proportion figs 3 and s4 which could be attributed to other factors e g loss of submerged macrophytes involving eutrophication and the possibility that algal blooms may accumulate more aromatic dom after decomposition reitsema et al 2018 cryptophyta are favored in habitats rich in organic matter e g humic like hu and wei 2006 and thus exhibited positive correlations with dom abundance hix and the percentages of humic like components figs 5b ans s4 however this taxon constituted a small proportion of the phytoplankton in most lakes fig 2a suggesting a low contribution to dom in general nonlinear relationships of euglenophyta and dinophyta versus dom abundance fig 5c d may be related to their mixotrophic characteristic hu and wei 2006 we also noticed that only cyanobacteria exhibited a significant positive relationship with the ch4 concentration fig 5d probably because large proportions of the cyanobacteria biomass in eutrophic lakes create an anaerobic environment after they die creating conditions for anaerobic methanogenesis zhou et al 2022a in addition cyanobacteria can drive the ch4 production by accumulating algae derived bio labile dom and microbially degraded biological dom from algae represents a significant fraction of bio labile dom its pool has been shown to produce large amounts of ch4 under anoxic and oxic conditions repeta et al 2016 zhou et al 2019b an increasing number of studies have shown that algae can produce ch4 under oxic conditions tang et al 2016 which might also be a pathway to increase ch4 in lakes although at low rates biÅ¾iÄ et al 2020 in addition to the influence of phytoplankton the increase in dom abundance may also be caused by macroinvertebrates a significant positive relationship was observed between macroinvertebrate biomass and dom abundance but macroinvertebrates apparently contributed differently to dom than phytoplankton significant relationships between macroinvertebrates with hix positive and fi negative indicated that macroinvertebrates influence dom by utilization bioturbation and incomplete microbial mineralization of feces for example chironomids and oligochaetes which were the dominant macroinvertebrates in our set of lakes favored by an environment enriched with organic matter can transfer detritus and particulate organic matter into dom cummins and klug 1979 parr et al 2019 in addition increased bioturbation by these macroinvertebrates might promote a larger release of accumulated allochthonous dom from the sediment to the water column aller 1980 perhaps especially for forestland dominated lakes as we found a positive relationship of most macroinvertebrate functional groups with c1 and hix figs 3 and s5 however excess use of dom derived carbon by benthic animals e g transformation of dom to fine particulate organic matter and feeding by collectors cummins and klug 1979 may reduce dom abundance in the sediment and its spread to the water surface fig 5j we found that macroinvertebrates had no significant influence on the ch4 concentration fig 4 which may reflect that we measured ch4 in the surface layer of the water column and ch4 produced at the bottom will be oxidized as it ascends to the water surface therefore it is hard to conclude that macroinvertebrates do not contribute to ch4 production as it has been reported that burrowing activities by macroinvertebrates can trigger ch4 bubble release from the sediment chakraborty et al 2022 and macroinvertebrates can also feed on ch4 derived carbon agasild et al 2018 jones and grey 2011 indicating that the importance of macroinvertebrates for lake carbon cycling should not be ignored demars et al 2021 4 3 the relationships between dom characteristics and ch4 concentration in general ch4 is produced via methanogenesis during the final stage of organic matter degradation at anoxic lake bottoms in the present study dom was measured in the surface water but a positive relationship between dom abundance and ch4 concentration was still detected this may reflect that the increase and accumulation of dom can directly and indirectly promote ch4 production at the bottom yuan et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 and dom can be a substrate for aerobic methanogenesis in surface water li et al 2020b repeta et al 2016 amaral et al 2021 revealed that dissolved ch4 was related to various sources of dom in an estuary as also found in lakes e g ebullitive flux in zhou et al 2019b while allochthonous dom can enhance dissolved ch4 fig 3 via multiple mechanisms amaral et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the significantly positive correlations of the ch4 concentration with c3 c4 and bix shown in our study fig 3 indicate that autochthonous e g algae derived dom may play an important role in dissolved ch4 see in section 4 2 yet we cannot disentangle which component of dom contributed most to the production of ch4 because of the lack of dom data from the sediments and the complexity of ch4 dynamics for instance complex dynamics of ch4 oxidation versus aerobic production are implied by the insignificant correlation between surface dissolved oxygen and ch4 concentrations while the dissolved oxygen could be synchronously enhanced by algal photosynthesis but reduced by aerobic microbial decomposition of dom in different depth of the lakes fig 3 4 4 implications and limitations our study revealed the importance of including key organism groups to expand our understanding of the impact of multiple factors on lake carbon cycling the findings provide information on the carbon cycling of lakes in different geographical regions and with different morphologies and human activities in the lake catchments appropriate governance of land use and lake morphometry e g water level can effectively control the level of greenhouse gas in lakes while lake location cannot be artificially changed for example mitigating eutrophication by changing agricultural practices and pipe networks may facilitate lake ch4 control beaulieu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however there are some limitations in the current study and caution is therefore needed when interpreting the results besides external factors we focused on the influences of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates on lake dom and ch4 concentrations but the biogeochemical processes in sediment trophic linkages including other organisms e g microbes zooplankton and fish and terrestrial inputs might also be of importance drake et al 2018 ravinet et al 2010 yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b all of this must be coupled to obtain more information on dom and ch4 and their causalities in lake watersheds especially seen in the light of the ongoing global changes in addition we did only measure the concentration of ch4 not the actual release to the atmosphere 5 conclusions our results provided evidence that geoclimatic factors particularly lake morphometry and land use had clear impacts on lake water quality phytoplankton and macroinvertebrate biomass and further led to changes in dom and ch4 concentrations the pls pm model indicated that 1 geoclimatic factors influenced dom and ch4 by strongly affecting land use and lake physical factors e g water temperature 2 lake morphometry not only had a great and direct influence on ch4 concentrations it also indirectly influenced dom and ch4 concentrations by changing the water quality and aquatic biota 3 land use types mainly agricultural and construction land affected autochthonous dom and ch4 concentrations in relation to eutrophication whereas forestland was positively associated with both macroinvertebrate biomass and terrestrial humic like dom biota biomass affected by chemical and physical factors can complicate dom abundance and composition cyanophyta can drive ch4 production by the accumulation of bio labile dom and partially by aerobic methanogenesis besides abiotic factors this study found two possible biological pathways affecting lake carbon cycling by phytoplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates overall the highlighted complex linkages indicate that more studies are needed to further explore the biogeochemical processes via the joint action of multiple organisms to improve our understanding of the lake carbon cycling

15474,many factors have been reported to affect material cycling in lakes but the combined and cascading impacts of external environmental factors and in lake biota on lake carbon cycling are poorly understood we elucidated the influencing pathways of geoclimatic factors lake morphometry land use type chemical and physical factors and biological taxa phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates on the concentrations of two important components of carbon cycling i e dissolved organic matter dom and methane ch4 based on datasets from 64 plateau lakes in southwest china partial least squares path modelling pls pm indicated that 1 geoclimatic factors influenced dom and ch4 by affecting land use and lake physical factors e g water temperature 2 lake morphometry water depth and lake area had a direct and great negative effect on the ch4 concentration related to the production and oxidation of ch4 and affected phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates by influencing chemical and physical factors 3 land use type affected dom and ch4 concentrations in both direct and indirect ways 4 terrestrial humic like dom was mainly discharged from forestland and also affected by macroinvertebrates while the impacts of agricultural and construction land on autochthonous dom and ch4 concentrations mainly occurred by changing nutrients and then the aquatic biota moreover changes in aquatic biota primarily affected by water quality influenced dom spectral properties and the two biotas affected dom and ch4 concentrations differently phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria contributed to protein like and humic like dom in both direct and indirect ways related to eutrophication whereas macroinvertebrates influenced dom possibly by utilization bioturbation and microbial decomposition of feces according to their different relationships with dom spectral indices additionally ch4 production can be enhanced by dom accumulation and the significant positive correlations of ch4 concentrations with protein like dom and biological index indicate that autochthonous dom may play an important role for the ch4 production our findings contribute to the understanding of lake carbon cycling under natural conditions and anthropogenic disturbances graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter dom methane ch4 phytoplankton macroinvertebrates landuse water depth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake ecosystems provide essential goods and valuable services to human society heino et al 2021 and regulate global biogeochemical cycles heino et al 2021 tranvik et al 2009 yang et al 2015 however global lake ecosystems have been identified as important sources of natural greenhouse gases e g methane ch4 contributing about 30 to global natural ch4 emissions although lakes occupy only 3 of the global land surface area downing et al 2006 concentrations of ch4 in lakes are governed by external drivers or inputs from the surrounding catchment as well as by internal biogeochemical processes e g organic matter decomposition methanogenesis and oxidation among which the decomposition of dissolved organic matter dom is an important driver of ch4 production li et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 dom in natural waters is derived from both allochthonous e g terrestrial and atmospheric input and autochthonous e g phytoplankton and bacterial excretion or metabolism sources stedmon et al 2007 zhang et al 2021b therefore the abundance of dom is also governed by both external and internal factors the complexity of the internal and external controls on ch4 and dom in lakes poses a challenge in predicting changes in their concentrations external drivers such as geoclimatic factors e g altitude and precipitation lake morphometry e g water depth and lake area and land use type affect the production of ch4 and dom abundance altitude generally affects ch4 and dom by impacting temperature and human activity intensity in catchments davidson et al 2018 delsontro et al 2016 zhang et al 2021b precipitation not only carries organic matter from the air into lakes it may also bring terrestrial dom into the lake via runoff bastidas navarro and modenutti 2012 with potential effects on ch4 production lake area which is related to water residence time and fetch can impact dom degradation du et al 2021 and the emission of ch4 li et al 2020a rasilo et al 2015 water depth affects the formation and release of ch4 yuan et al 2021 and generally shows a negative correlation with ch4 concentration sundh et al 1994 li et al 2020a for example less ch4 will be transported from the sediment to the water surface in deep lakes partially because it is oxidized on the way whereas more ch4 could be released from shallow lakes which are also more vulnerable to eutrophication li et al 2020a qin et al 2020 moreover land use changes in catchments affect nutrient levels in lakes zhou et al 2022b and subsequently dom and ch4 concentrations yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b studies have shown that freshwater greenhouse gas concentrations were positively associated with the proportion of human impacted land types in the watershed wang et al 2021 in particular agricultural and urban land can influence the soil characteristics in the surrounding terrestrial systems and these changes can increase the input of nutrients and organic matter into waters huotari et al 2013 thereby enhancing their contents stedmon et al 2003 yang et al 2020 in addition to external environmental factors aquatic biotas in lakes are also important in the assimilation and release of carbon ren et al 2022 zhou et al 2019b methanogens generally regulate carbon cycling e g ch4 through anaerobic degradation of organic matter conrad 2005 algae make a large contribution to dom and ch4 after they die and are decomposed li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b and the massive amount of dead algae in eutrophic lakes can create an anaerobic environment that accelerates the formation of ch4 bartosiewicz et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b besides algae can produce ch4 via other pathways such as by demethylation and by converting fixed inorganic carbon biÅ¾iÄ et al 2020 tang et al 2016 furthermore material circulation through benthic organisms is part of the linkages between producers and higher level consumers which may indirectly affect the dynamics of dom and ch4 amaral et al 2021 belle et al 2016 bioturbation by benthic animals can enhance organic matter release and microbiome mineralization through feeding flipping particles and feces across the sediment water interface aller 1980 dom transformed carbon feeding by benthic collectors cummins and klug 1979 may limit ch4 formation by reducing dom mineralization at the sediment water interface for instance ch4 derived carbon is an important food source for chironomids a high density of chironomids can affect the abundance of ch4 oxidizing bacteria and ch4 cycling agasild et al 2018 jones and grey 2011 however organisms in waters interact with each other variations in one taxon community may have direct and indirect effects on others further affecting the material cycling in the whole system therefore it is important to explore the impact of the synergy or antagonism among multiple biotas on dom and ch4 in lakes jones and grey 2011 lennon et al 2006 although studies have extensively analyzed the independent influence of a few vital factors such as water depth li et al 2020a temperature chen et al 2021 eutrophication beaulieu et al 2019 and phytoplankton bartosiewicz et al 2021 liu et al 2021 on dom or ch4 dynamics in lakes the cascading effects of multidimensional factors including various abiotic and biotic factors on dom and ch4 concentrations have not been adequately addressed which constrains our knowledge of the roles of external and internal factors in driving the carbon cycling in waters in this study we explored how environmental factors and aquatic biota i e phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates impact dom and ch4 concentrations in lakes on the yunnan guizhou plateau the main objectives were to 1 elucidate the effects of external factors on dom and ch4 concentrations and 2 reveal how multiple organisms respond to external factors and affect dom and ch4 concentrations in lakes we hypothesized that both external factors and in lake biota are important in influencing the dom and ch4 concentrations 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the yunnan guizhou plateau lake zone in southwest china fig 1 one of the five lake zones in china this region contains plenty of freshwater lakes being surrounded by mountains most of the lakes are located in catchments with numerous inflows but few outflows resulting in a long water residence time and substantial sedimentation zhuo et al 2021 in addition the heterogenous mountain landscape makes the catchments as important ecosystems for biodiversity however with the increasing population and economic development in recent decades many yunnan guizhou plateau lakes have suffered from the impacts of anthropogenic activities which has led to eutrophication zhou et al 2019a biodiversity decline ding et al 2017 and changes in biogeochemical cycles zhuo et al 2021 2 2 dataset collection 2 2 1 field sampling and local environmental variables a total of 64 lakes 166 samples were included in this study fig 1 field samplings were conducted in the wet season july september 2017 and august september 2018 in lake fuxian and lake puzhehei we investigated 16 and 6 sites respectively while for other lakes 1 4 sampling points were investigated the altitude al of the studied lakes ranges from 463 to 4478 m a s l the lake area larea ranges from less than 0 01 to 242 5

parameters total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chla spectral properties of dom and phytoplankton composition if the water depth was less than 0 5 m the corresponding water samples were collected from a shallower depth three peterson grab samples were collected from surface sediment at each sampling point for macroinvertebrate analysis the concentrations of tn tp and chla were determined following standard methods state environmental protection administration of china 2002 2 2 2 phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates analysis water samples 1000 ml for phytoplankton analysis were preserved with lugol s solution and concentrated to 30 ml for counting by category zhou et al 2022b all algal taxa were counted at 400 magnification using a light microscope olympus japan the phytoplankton was identified to the species or genus level according to hu and wei 2006 algal biovolume was determined based on cell numbers and cell size measurements and a volume of 1 mm3 was considered to be equivalent to 1 mg of fresh weight biomass zhang et al 2021a macroinvertebrate samplings were conducted in 55 lakes of which macroinvertebrate specimens were successfully collected from 40 lakes macroinvertebrate specimens were manually sorted from the sediment in the field and preserved in 70 ethanol for identification in the laboratory macroinvertebrate specimens were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level using relevant literature brinkhurst 1986 epler 2001 morse et al 1994 macroinvertebrate biomass was the sum of all individual weights at each sampling site and was converted into weight at m 2 based on the sample area 2 2 3 dom and ch4 analysis the absorbance and fluorescence of dom were determined according to zhou et al 2016 and the absorption at 254 nm a254 m 1 was selected to represent dom abundance meanwhile the fluorescent components of dom were identified by parallel factor analysis parafac modelling based on stedmon et al 2003 fluorescent components 1 and 2 c1 and c2 are humic like materials while components 3 and 4 c3 and c4 correspond to tryptophan like and tyrosine like materials respectively fig s1 table s3 the humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi were calculated from the excitation emission matrix fluorescence and the details are shown in table s3 ch4 concentrations were measured following xiao et al 2017 at each sampling site bubble free lake water was collected at 0 5 m below the water surface into a 61 ml glass bottle with the excess water overflowing the bottle the bottle was immediately capped without headspace using a butyl rubber stopper ultrahigh purity n2 gas 99 999 was injected into the glass bottle to create a 10 ml headspace to determine the concentration of ch4 dissolved in the water samples the dissolved ch4 concentration was calculated according to a temperature dependent henry s law constant accounting for ch4 in the headspace johnson et al 1990 2 2 4 land use and climatic variables the land use dataset in 2017 was extracted from landsat 8 images downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn we applied the rgb band combination of the landsat 8 oli satellite with red band 5 green band 4 blue band 3 for visual interpretation after geometric correction radiometric calibration and flaash atmospheric correction of each image the training samples were selected with the help of google earth and then the land use classification was made through the maximum likelihood classification algorithm the kappa coefficients

modelling pls pm was performed to show the linkage among all the variables full model first and we then eliminated the indicators with loadings of less than 0 4 absolute value to the latent variable hulland 1999 fischer 2012 we kept the variables with loadings greater than 0 4 to the latent variable for further pls pm analysis the partial correlation coefficients factor loadings to latent variables and goodness of fits gof were computed using the plspm package in r and missing values were interpolated during this analysis we further conducted a generalized additive model gam analysis using r with the mgcv package to predict the relationships of selected biota taxa based on the pls pm results with dom and ch4 concentrations 3 results 3 1 general characteristics environmental factors land use type biological taxa dom abundance dom components and ch4 concentration varied considerably among the studied lakes figs 1 and 2 table s2 water temperature decreased linearly with increasing altitude the nutrient levels of the studied lakes ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic with transparency varying from 0 29 to 8 75 m for land use type forestland was included in all studied lakes and grassland was included in only 15 6 of the studied lakes the sum proportion of agricultural and construction land ranged from 0 to 78 3 and 81 3 of the lakes were surrounded by these two types of land fig 1 a total of 234 phytoplankton 7 phyla and 37 macroinvertebrate taxa were identified cyanophyta accounted for a large proportion of the phytoplankton biomass in lakes with high proportions of agricultural and construction land whereas bacillariophyta accounted for a large proportion in lakes with low proportions of agricultural and construction land fig 2a for macroinvertebrates we defined four functional feeding groups i e filter collector gather collector predator scraper according to taxa in the studied lakes and the gather collector mainly chironomids and oligochaeta biomass accounted for a large proportion in most lakes fig 2b dom abundance ranged from 1 3 to 101 m 1 table s2 and among the four dom components c1 accounted for the largest percentage 34 8 of the total dom fmax fig 2c the ch4 concentration varied among the 64 studied lakes fig 2d and it did not show any pattern in the gradient of the sum proportions of agricultural and construction land 3 2 correlation analysis of variables pearson correlation analysis revealed dom abundance to be negatively correlated with water depth lake area water temperature bare land transparency and bacillariophyta and positively correlated with ch4 concentration forestland nutrients chlorophyll a cyanophyta cryptophyta euglenophyta gather collectors filter collectors and predators the ch4 concentration was negatively correlated with water depth lake area forestland transparency and bacillariophyta and positively correlated with agricultural land construction land nutrients water temperature cyanophyta c1 c2 c3 c4 and bix in terms of land use agricultural and construction land had positive correlations with total phosphorus total nitrogen water temperature dissolved oxygen phytoplankton taxa c3 c4 bix and fi and had negative correlations with transparency gather collectors filter collectors and hix however forestland showed opposite correlations with these variables than for agricultural and construction land fig 3 3 3 the influence path of external factors and biota on dom and ch4 concentrations the full pls pm model indicated that some explanatory variables such as surface solar radiation downwards grassland present lake other lakes water transparency bacillariophyta chrysophyta and scrapers exhibited low loadings absolute value 0 4 to latent variables fig s2 thus we removed these variables and reran the pls pm analysis fig 4 the results demonstrated that lake morphometry not only had a direct and negative influence r 0 53 on the ch4 concentration it also indirectly affected dom and ch4 concentrations via changing chemical and physical conditions besides the direct impact on dom abundance r 0 27 land use indirectly influenced dom and ch4 concentrations via changing chemical factors subsequently affecting physical factors phytoplankton and or macroinvertebrate biomass geoclimatic factors influenced dom and ch4 by strongly impacting land use and physical factors 3 4 predicting the relationship among variables gam models revealed the relationships among the biological taxa selected in the pls pm and dom abundance or ch4 concentration fig 5 the results showed significant relationships between the selected phytoplankton macroinvertebrate taxa except for chlorophyta and dom abundance all phytoplankton taxa except cyanophyta and all macroinvertebrate taxa exhibited no significant relationships with the ch4 concentration fig 5f h m p cyanophyta cryptophyta filter collectors and predators were positively related to dom abundance fig 5a b k l whereas euglenophyta and gather collectors exhibited unimodal relationships with dom abundance fig 5c j 4 discussion 4 1 external drivers of dom characteristics and ch4 concentration pls pm and correlation analysis clearly showed that the lake morphometric variables included in the analysis depth and area had a strong negative effect on dom and ch4 concentrations enhanced water depth and lake area were associated with high water transparency fig 3 and water residence time which may promote the photo and microbial degradation of larger molecular dom du et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b as a result dom abundance especially humic like components c1 c2 and hix decreased indirectly with increases in these lake morphometric variables likewise lake morphometry can influence water column mixing dissolved oxygen concentration piston velocity and sediment carbon accumulation thus further impacting ch4 production and oxidation read et al 2012 li et al 2020a for example deeper water depth increases the oxidation probability of ch4 ebulliated from the bottom to the surface and larger fetch mixing with lake area promotes reoxygenation and diffusion of ch4 li et al 2020a rasilo et al 2015 in addition shallow lakes are more vulnerable to eutrophication as a result of high nutrient loadings and biogeochemical processes qin et al 2020 nutrient enrichment not only allows algae to bloom and provide more organic matter e g dom as the substrate for ch4 production it also causes poor transparency which weakens the dom photodegradation zhang et al 2021b and an anaerobic environment which promotes benthic ch4 formation by methanogens li et al 2021 in addition although the increase of irradiation can promote the photoproduction of ch4 the dom absorption loss normalized ch4 photoproduction may decrease with increasing dom abundance li et al 2020b which may be related to the negative impact of dom on light penetration these observations from previous studies are in line with our results that water depth was significantly and negatively correlated to tn tp and chla concentrations and positively correlated to transparency and that ch4 concentration increased with growing phytoplankton biomass and dom abundance and shallowing water transparency figs 3 and 4 land use affected dom characteristics and ch4 concentrations in direct and indirect ways allochthonous dom is mainly directly discharged from terrestrial parts terrestrial humic like c1 and its proportion as well as hix were significantly positively correlated with forestland indicating that the input of allochthonous dom partially came from forestland meanwhile construction land was also related to anthropogenic humic like c2 abundance figs 3 and s3 the indirect way of land use affecting dom and ch4 concentrations occurs via changing water quality causing changes in aquatic biota biomass according to the pls pm the concentrations of tn and tp in lakes with agricultural and construction land are prone to increase due to the use of fertilizers and the discharge of domestic sewage this increased nutrient input may enhance autochthonous dom abundance by promoting the biomass of microorganisms in waters for example increasing nitrogen sources can increase phytoplankton and bacteria biomass and more labile dom goldberg et al 2017 lake ch4 production and emissions are positively correlated with nutrient levels beaulieu et al 2019 li et al 2021 rasilo et al 2015 thus agricultural and construction land had large contributions to autochthonous dom and further to ch4 in our study figs 3 and s3 the joint effect of other factors belle et al 2016 heino et al 2021 for example altitude and precipitation further complicates the mechanisms behind the changes of dom and ch4 in lakes our results showed that geoclimatic factors had indirect impacts on dom and ch4 concentrations by mediating the effects of land use and physical factors lakes at low altitudes tend to be more affected by human activities e g agriculture and construction which results in a higher nutrient input as discussed above fig 4 moreover lakes at low altitudes tend to be characterized by higher water temperature and increased temperature can simultaneously promote microbial production and decomposition of dom zhang et al 2021b here although the increased temperature stimulated the growth of most phytoplankton and the production of autochthonous dom fig 3 the negative correlation between water temperature and dom abundance suggests that dom decomposition cannot be ignored moreover the increased surface water temperature may strengthen thermocline and subsequent oxygen stratification particularly in deep lakes zhang et al 2014 2015 which may result in an anoxic environment in the hypolimnion unfavoring benthic macroinvertebrates that impact dom and favor ch4 production figs 3 and 4 besides increased water temperature can enhance ch4 production by increasing the activity of methanogenic microorganisms especially at higher nutrient levels davidson et al 2018 delsontro et al 2016 and may promote gas release so that more ch4 was detected chen et al 2021 davidson et al 2018 as also found in a large scale study by rasilo et al 2015 in addition precipitation has different influencing paths on dom dynamics precipitation can increase or decrease dom through runoff or dilution and impact dom by affecting algal and microbial metabolism as well as photodegradation kellerman et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b at a regional scale it is difficult to decouple the positive and negative influences of precipitation on dom and even ch4 dynamics in the present study 4 2 aquatic biota influence dom characteristics and ch4 concentrations the significantly positive impact of phytoplankton on dom fig 4 indicated that large proportions of the phytoplankton biomass contributed significantly to dom abundance liu et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b phytoplankton contributes directly to dom in two ways by residues derived from the microbial decomposition of phytoplankton and by metabolites of phytoplankton and bacteria zhang et al 2021b the former was partially embodied in the significant positive correlation of phytoplankton with hix and the latter was reflected in the significant positive correlation of phytoplankton with c3 c4 and fi fig 3 of the phytoplankton taxa cyanobacteria contributed the most to dom abundance fig 5 cyanobacteria derived dom represents a potentially important source of autochthonous material due to eutrophication which favors cyanobacterial spread and even blooms patriarca et al 2021 in our study cyanobacterial biomass increased most markedly in lakes with agricultural and construction land in the watersheds suggesting that it was a major source of algal derived dom in watersheds with strong anthropogenic activities for example agricultural and industrial activities however c1 c2 hix and the percentages of c1 and c2 were all positively correlated with cyanophyta biomass and its proportion figs 3 and s4 which could be attributed to other factors e g loss of submerged macrophytes involving eutrophication and the possibility that algal blooms may accumulate more aromatic dom after decomposition reitsema et al 2018 cryptophyta are favored in habitats rich in organic matter e g humic like hu and wei 2006 and thus exhibited positive correlations with dom abundance hix and the percentages of humic like components figs 5b ans s4 however this taxon constituted a small proportion of the phytoplankton in most lakes fig 2a suggesting a low contribution to dom in general nonlinear relationships of euglenophyta and dinophyta versus dom abundance fig 5c d may be related to their mixotrophic characteristic hu and wei 2006 we also noticed that only cyanobacteria exhibited a significant positive relationship with the ch4 concentration fig 5d probably because large proportions of the cyanobacteria biomass in eutrophic lakes create an anaerobic environment after they die creating conditions for anaerobic methanogenesis zhou et al 2022a in addition cyanobacteria can drive the ch4 production by accumulating algae derived bio labile dom and microbially degraded biological dom from algae represents a significant fraction of bio labile dom its pool has been shown to produce large amounts of ch4 under anoxic and oxic conditions repeta et al 2016 zhou et al 2019b an increasing number of studies have shown that algae can produce ch4 under oxic conditions tang et al 2016 which might also be a pathway to increase ch4 in lakes although at low rates biÅ¾iÄ et al 2020 in addition to the influence of phytoplankton the increase in dom abundance may also be caused by macroinvertebrates a significant positive relationship was observed between macroinvertebrate biomass and dom abundance but macroinvertebrates apparently contributed differently to dom than phytoplankton significant relationships between macroinvertebrates with hix positive and fi negative indicated that macroinvertebrates influence dom by utilization bioturbation and incomplete microbial mineralization of feces for example chironomids and oligochaetes which were the dominant macroinvertebrates in our set of lakes favored by an environment enriched with organic matter can transfer detritus and particulate organic matter into dom cummins and klug 1979 parr et al 2019 in addition increased bioturbation by these macroinvertebrates might promote a larger release of accumulated allochthonous dom from the sediment to the water column aller 1980 perhaps especially for forestland dominated lakes as we found a positive relationship of most macroinvertebrate functional groups with c1 and hix figs 3 and s5 however excess use of dom derived carbon by benthic animals e g transformation of dom to fine particulate organic matter and feeding by collectors cummins and klug 1979 may reduce dom abundance in the sediment and its spread to the water surface fig 5j we found that macroinvertebrates had no significant influence on the ch4 concentration fig 4 which may reflect that we measured ch4 in the surface layer of the water column and ch4 produced at the bottom will be oxidized as it ascends to the water surface therefore it is hard to conclude that macroinvertebrates do not contribute to ch4 production as it has been reported that burrowing activities by macroinvertebrates can trigger ch4 bubble release from the sediment chakraborty et al 2022 and macroinvertebrates can also feed on ch4 derived carbon agasild et al 2018 jones and grey 2011 indicating that the importance of macroinvertebrates for lake carbon cycling should not be ignored demars et al 2021 4 3 the relationships between dom characteristics and ch4 concentration in general ch4 is produced via methanogenesis during the final stage of organic matter degradation at anoxic lake bottoms in the present study dom was measured in the surface water but a positive relationship between dom abundance and ch4 concentration was still detected this may reflect that the increase and accumulation of dom can directly and indirectly promote ch4 production at the bottom yuan et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 and dom can be a substrate for aerobic methanogenesis in surface water li et al 2020b repeta et al 2016 amaral et al 2021 revealed that dissolved ch4 was related to various sources of dom in an estuary as also found in lakes e g ebullitive flux in zhou et al 2019b while allochthonous dom can enhance dissolved ch4 fig 3 via multiple mechanisms amaral et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the significantly positive correlations of the ch4 concentration with c3 c4 and bix shown in our study fig 3 indicate that autochthonous e g algae derived dom may play an important role in dissolved ch4 see in section 4 2 yet we cannot disentangle which component of dom contributed most to the production of ch4 because of the lack of dom data from the sediments and the complexity of ch4 dynamics for instance complex dynamics of ch4 oxidation versus aerobic production are implied by the insignificant correlation between surface dissolved oxygen and ch4 concentrations while the dissolved oxygen could be synchronously enhanced by algal photosynthesis but reduced by aerobic microbial decomposition of dom in different depth of the lakes fig 3 4 4 implications and limitations our study revealed the importance of including key organism groups to expand our understanding of the impact of multiple factors on lake carbon cycling the findings provide information on the carbon cycling of lakes in different geographical regions and with different morphologies and human activities in the lake catchments appropriate governance of land use and lake morphometry e g water level can effectively control the level of greenhouse gas in lakes while lake location cannot be artificially changed for example mitigating eutrophication by changing agricultural practices and pipe networks may facilitate lake ch4 control beaulieu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however there are some limitations in the current study and caution is therefore needed when interpreting the results besides external factors we focused on the influences of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates on lake dom and ch4 concentrations but the biogeochemical processes in sediment trophic linkages including other organisms e g microbes zooplankton and fish and terrestrial inputs might also be of importance drake et al 2018 ravinet et al 2010 yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b all of this must be coupled to obtain more information on dom and ch4 and their causalities in lake watersheds especially seen in the light of the ongoing global changes in addition we did only measure the concentration of ch4 not the actual release to the atmosphere 5 conclusions our results provided evidence that geoclimatic factors particularly lake morphometry and land use had clear impacts on lake water quality phytoplankton and macroinvertebrate biomass and further led to changes in dom and ch4 concentrations the pls pm model indicated that 1 geoclimatic factors influenced dom and ch4 by strongly affecting land use and lake physical factors e g water temperature 2 lake morphometry not only had a great and direct influence on ch4 concentrations it also indirectly influenced dom and ch4 concentrations by changing the water quality and aquatic biota 3 land use types mainly agricultural and construction land affected autochthonous dom and ch4 concentrations in relation to eutrophication whereas forestland was positively associated with both macroinvertebrate biomass and terrestrial humic like dom biota biomass affected by chemical and physical factors can complicate dom abundance and composition cyanophyta can drive ch4 production by the accumulation of bio labile dom and partially by aerobic methanogenesis besides abiotic factors this study found two possible biological pathways affecting lake carbon cycling by phytoplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates overall the highlighted complex linkages indicate that more studies are needed to further explore the biogeochemical processes via the joint action of multiple organisms to improve our understanding of the lake carbon cycling
