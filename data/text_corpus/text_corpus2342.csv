11710,field work was conducted to understand the possible influence of on site sanitation on groundwater quality estimate minimum bore well volumes of water to be purged from large wells to obtain representative aquifer samples and unravel possible trends in variability in physico chemical water quality of water samples from wells lying between the hills and discharge areas we applied a chemical pollution risk assessment of wells modified from microbial risk assessment to enable the quantification of risk to chemical pollution of wells from on site sanitation for two wells 3 2 well volumes were purged with progressive sampling and physico chemical quality of purged and recovered water physico chemical quality of samples was analyzed for wells lying between hills and discharge areas commonly identified contamination sources are sullage drains pit latrines waste dumps and septic tanks and 14 out of the 15 wells 93 studied at risk to pollution anion concentrations and ec values increased during purging and were stable and high during recovery indicating inflow of water with high ion content possibly from identified risks to chemical anion pollution stabilised physical water quality ec and ph during recovery indicate representative aquifer samples from large diameter wells in the shallow aquifer of the area may be possible after removing at least three well volumes of water apart from nitrate average concentrations of anions and ec were high in water samples from wells in the low lying area results of pump test and sampling between the hills and discharge areas we respectively conclude that the wells are hydraulically connected to contamination sources and the observed groundwater quality may due to effluents from identified contamination sources and dissolution of minerals and increased infiltration of contaminants may be responsible for high electrical conductivity and anion concentration in the low lying discharge areas of the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords hand dug well purging water quality on site sanitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the absence of sewage treatment facilities many poor communities in sub saharan africa ssa and other parts of the world rely on on site sanitation e g pit latrines and septic tanks for the containment disposal and or treatment of excreta and wastewater martínez santos et al 2017 saxena and den 2022 in many cases nutrients including phosphates po4 nitrates no3 and sulfates so4 from these improper sanitation management facilities leach into shallow aquifers nyenje et al 2014a ravenscroft et al 2017 thereby impairing the quality of water from groundwater sources boreholes springs and hand dug wells from which the communities depend on as their main and or alternative sources for their drinking and domestic water needs lapworth et al 2017 grönwall 2016 it is common knowledge that the consumption of water contaminated with nutrients together with their associated microbial pathogens results in adverse health impacts saxena and den 2022 and can sometimes lead to death amongst the highly vulnerable and children landrigan et al 2018 the importance of groundwater in many poor settlements in ssa has influenced recent research to focus on the quality van de vossenberg et al 2021 and vulnerability of groundwater sources hand dug wells boreholes and springs to pollution ercumen et al 2017 misati et al 2017 in addition to quantitative understanding of the hydrogeology of aquifer systems foppen et al 2020 andries et al 2021 though recent research reports have implicated on site sanitation for the poor water quality from groundwater sources in many parts of the ssa region chaúque et al 2021 ferrante et al 2018 the conclusions of many of these works have been drawn from the association between risk to pollution values and poor groundwater quality without assessing the possible connections between pollution sources and groundwater points this possibly has contributed to the lack of good understanding of the association between sanitary inspections and results of water quality analysis kelly et al 2021 snoad et al 2017 even though the who recommends both to quantify the risk of water source contamination note that erroneous interpretation of results due to the variability in both the transport behaviour of contaminants and the geology discontinuities and geochemical heterogeneity of an aquifer can occur variability in water quality parameters are known to exist and this is more linked to characteristic properties of contaminants for example the fate and transport behaviour of nitrates as tracers differs from phosphates which undergo sorption in aquifers nyenje et al 2014a kazmierczak et al 2020 in addition the ubiquitous presence of spatial and temporal variabilities in hydrogeological and hydraulic properties of aquifers e g patton et al 2021 together with the geochemical heterogeneity in aquifer media appelo et al 2005 may also contribute to variability in water quality parameters which remain a crucial determinant of groundwater use revealing the mechanisms of groundwater contamination from identified pollution sources is therefore crucial to groundwater source protection strategies in recent works lutterodt et al 2018 2021 has asserted that an increment in the radius of influence through groundwater abstraction increases the likelihood of pollution of large diameter hand dug wells by effluents from on site sanitation four decades ago schmidt 1977 and wilson and rouse 1983 respectively acknowledged the effect of well pumping on short term variability in well water quality resulting from induced leakage and mixing of vertical and horizontal flow components when pump rates are high much work has been done on pollution risk assessment of hand dug wells but direct measurement of water quality changes under forced induced convection to assess the direct influence of on site sanitation on well water quality is lacking in the literature this is the case in many parts of ssa where on site sanitation has been implicated for poor groundwater quality braimah et al 2021 diaw et al 2020 establishing hydraulic connection between on site sanitation and groundwater sources could confirm the correlation between risk scores and microbial and poor chemical quality as reported by mushi et al 2012 even though other workers ercumen et al 2017 misati et al 2017 reported non correlation between microbial cells and sanitary risk scores in addition knowledge of hydraulic connection between wells and their immediate surrounding can influence groundwater management strategies and landuse options to prevent pollution of groundwater sources apart from boreholes and springs large diameter hand dug wells diameter 1 m remain an important source of groundwater for many communities in both rural and urban areas in many parts of the developing world schram and wamper 2018 gomo et al 2019 braimah et al 2021 the importance of large diameter hand dug wells stems from their affordability gomo et al 2019 as they can be constructed using traditional methods mainly manual excavations through weathered unconsolidated rocks and alluvial aquifers in spite of their importance in the supply of water the hydrogeology of large diameter wells is poorly understood for example gomo et al 2019 has stated the challenges associated with the understanding of well hydraulics due to their large diameter also though there are numerous research articles in the literature on quality of water from large diameter wells but reports of volume of water needed to be purged from the wells before representative aquifer samples can be obtained are uncommon or lacking consequences include sampling water standing in the wells and not actual aquifer samples the result would be of understanding of groundwater quality and the vulnerability of hand dug wells to pollution this can lead to employing wrong groundwater source protection strategies for specific aquifers the main objective of this work is to unravel the possibility of hydraulic connection between peri urban large diameter wells and their immediate surroundings through physico chemical analyses of water samples during progressive pumping of shallow large diameter wells in a saprolite and to determine the minimum bore well volume needed to be purged to obtain representative aquifer sample from large diameter wells additionally this work involves sanitary risk inspection at locations of wells with an aim of identifying pollution sources likely to introduce chemical anion nutrients po4 so4 and no3 into the wells we also explore the possible trends in dissolved nutrient anion po4 so4 and no3 concentrations and physical quality parameter values through spatio temporal sampling and analysis of water from wells lying on transects that span between the hills where groundwater is assumed to recharge minka 2016 and discharge areas in the dodowa township of accra in order to understand transport in the shallow sub surface of the study area ghana 2 methods 2 1 the study area dodowa is a peri urban poor community and lies on the eastern fringes of the akwapim togo ranges trending from ghana into togo location and physical features have previously been described lutterodt et al 2018 foppen et al 2020 two rainfall peaks occur between may and july and between september and october with a mean annual rainfall of 900 mm year annual mean temperature in the area is 27 c kortatsi and jørgensen 2001 topographically the akwapim togo ranges lie towards the north western part of the township with elevations ranging which comprises of the togo quartzites outcrops in the north western part of the township with elevations ranging between 125 and 150 m a s l while the south and south eastern is almost flat with elevations of 55 65 m a s l the geo hydrological system of the dodowa area has been described by foppen et al 2020 the geology of the area is made up of the togo structural unit tsu which comprises of phyllites and quartzites attoh et al 1997 outcropping in the north western part of the township the dahomeyan structural unit dsu consisting of alternating bands of acid gneisses and basic gneisses forms the other major rocky type found in the dodowa area and outcrops in the eastern part of the township see fig 2 the hydrogeology of the area is controlled by groundwater occurrence in the saprolites of the tsu at shallow depths and fractures at relatively lower depths within the dsu foppen et al 2020 reports that both aquifers are semi confined with phreatic water levels of wells and boreholes within the area indicating groundwater level reduces towards the south 80 a m sl in the north to 60 a m s l south from the hills in the north with a general northwest south east trending of horizontal groundwater head gradient minka 2016 fig 2 in addition groundwater levels in the area drop during the dry season and recovers to initial levels during the wet season with fluctuations ranging between 1 and 2 m transmissivities in the two aquifers are low with values less than 6e 5 m2 s foppen et al 2020 the dodowa river drains the area and flows from the hills in the north to the low lying area in the south foppen et al 2020 has speculated the fractured quartzites as the likely source of discharge in springs in the southern part of the township the ghana statistical service reports a population of 12 075 living in the township in the 2010 population census buadee and yirenkyi 2010 the community enjoy multiple sources of water and includes supplies from the ghana water company limited self supplies from groundwater sources boreholes and wells with at least some 80 sources distributed over an area of 5 km2 according to grönwall 2016 approximately 38 and 73 use groundwater sources as main and second sources respectively well location map showing the study area is given in fig 1 2 2 risk to well contamination by pollution indicator anions sanitary risk assessment of well surroundings was conducted for all wells under the study tables 1 and 2 the objective was to quantify the risk to pollution of wells by anions from on site sanitation and from activities within the neighbourhood of wells that are likely to introduce pollution indicator anions into the aquifer system to do this we modified the british geological survey sanitary risk assessment method howard et al 2003 lutterodt et al 2018 used to assess the risk of microbial contamination of wells the modification was based on the fact that when microbes are leached into the soils from effluent of waste they are therefore transported together with the pollution indicator anions in the effluent as a plume note that the modification also involved omission of risks that may not introduce microbes without effluents into the wells for example rope bucket left at potentially contaminated point lutterodt et al 2018 diagnostic information for assessment of risk to pollution of wells that would lead to likely changes in physical parameters ec and ph and most importantly increment in the concentrations of anions i e dissolved phosphate orthophosphate sulfate and nitrates and their corresponding risk scores in brackets are as follows latrine within 10 30 m of well 1 latrine upstream of well 1 septic tank within 5 30 m of well 1 septic tank upstream of well 1 waste refuse dump within 5 30 m of well 1 waste refuse dump upstream of well 1 sullage drain wastewater from bathroom within 5 30 m from well 1 sullage drain wastewater from bathroom upstream of well 1 drainage causing stagnant water within 2 m of well 1 these are summed up to give a final risk score total risk scores 8 are considered very high risk scores ranging between 5 and 8 high scores 3 4 and 0 2 are respectively considered as intermediate and low the modification was necessary due to the presence of more than one identified source s of pollution in the neighbourhood of the wells in the study area lutterodt et al 2018 for e g the method as used previously lutterodt et al 2021 howard et al 2003 cannot quantify the risk to pollution in situations where more than one identified pollution source e g 2 pit latrines are mapped within neighbourhood of wells therefore the risk posed by the presence of for example more than one pit latrine in the neighbourhood of a groundwater source is not captured by the method in such a scenario 2 3 well discharge and recovery with sampling and analysis of water quality parameters to assess the possible influence of on site sanitation on wells within the area two wells zo 3 and zo 1 were selected for forced convection experiments depth and diameter of the wells were 5 6 m and 1 18 m for zo 1 and 5 2 m and 1 14 m for zo 3 and depth of column of water standing in the wells prior to pumping were respectively 3 88 m and 4 04 m for zo 1 and zo 3 this gives well volume wv of 4 24 m3 for zo 1 and 4 67 m3 for zo 3 water from the wells were discharged at constant at rate 58 l min and allowed to recover after at least two wvs have been discharged to do this a one horse power pump pedrollo italy was connected to a 5 kw generator ryobi china to supply the needed energy to purge the wells fig 3 the pump is initially connected to a 2 inch diameter water hose of length 50 m and the hose together with the pump lowered into a well under study and pump set at 0 5 m from the bottom of the well the pump is set to the maximum discharge rate and water discharge from the well q measured by sampling water in a bucket of a known volume 20 l over a measured period of time t and q computed from an average of 3 tests initial samples for water quality were taken by pumping with mini pump and tubes and some batteries thus 200 ml sample was taken directly into 250 ml clean plastic containers at regular time intervals 15 min water samples were taken for the analysis of physical parameters ph ec and temperature and chemical parameters nitrate phosphate and sulfate temperature and ec were determined using a conductivity meter cond340i wtw gmbh weilheim germany calibrated at 25 c and ph was determined using a ph meter ph340i wtw gmbh weilheim germany no3 so4 and po4 were determined on site via hach dr spectrophotometer immediately after each sample taken to do this 200 ml of sampled water was filtered through 0 45 μm lead acetate paper into a 250 ml sterile sampling bottles 25 ml of filtered samples are transferred into a cell followed by addition of a reagent from pemachm reagents and vigorously shaken for a minute and allowed to react for 5 min then the prepared sample was placed into the cell holder to determine the nitrate concentration after a blank filtered sample has been used to calibrate the hach dr reagents used for respective chemical analyses are one nitraver 5 nitrate reagent powder pillow phosver 3 phosphate powder pillow reagent sulfver 5 2 4 spatio temporal sampling and analysis of water quality parameters to understand the possible existence of trends in anion pollutant content in shallow groundwater between recharge and discharge areas the physical ec ph and temperature and chemical no3 so4 po4 were measured weekly over a period of 8 weeks in samples of water from wells located on two selected transects t1 9 wells and t2 6 wells trending nw se and ne sw respectively fig 1 and at varying distances from the recharge area at the foot of the mountain foppen et al 2020 physical parameters were measured in situ measurement of chemical and physical parameters followed same procedure as was done for well discharge and recovery water quality measurements above to avoid sampling stagnant water wells were sampled late morning to afternoon when large volumes of water have been abstracted from the wells nlend et al 2021 lutterodt et al 2021 2 5 statistical analyses the degree of association between average values of physico chemical parameters measured in water samples from wells on the transects and with scores of risk to anion contamination of the wells were determined with the parametric correlation coefficient r using ibm spss statistics version 25 ibm corp armonk ny usa 2019 r values 0 9 or 0 9 were considered strong analyses were considered good for 0 7 r 0 9 or 0 7 r 0 9 and non correlation for r 0 6 or r 0 6 correlation analysis were considered to be statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 sanitary risk scores correlation between risk scores and water quality parameters results of sanitary risk inspection conducted at the wells are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively for wells on transect 1 t1 and transect 2 t2 commonly identified contamination sources on both transects are sullage drains pit latrines septic tanks and refuse rubbish dump seven of the wells four on t1 and three 3 on t2 are at high risk risk score 5 8 of contamination and represents 46 7 five wells 33 3 are at intermediate risk risk score 3 4 3 on t1 and 2 on t2 and three wells 20 two on t1 and a single well on t2 are at low risk 0 2 risk score to contamination tables 1 and 2 and overall 14 out of 15 93 wells at risk to contamination from the identified risk sources the table also give the distances of the wells from the foot of the mountains where recharge takes place foppen et al 2020 and water is considered to be comparatively cleaner than samples from wells downstream range of distances of wells from recharge to discharge are 0 41 1 26 m and 1 1 2 47 m respectively for t1 and t2 depths of wells range between 3 6 to 8 9 m and 4 1 5 7 m respectively for t1 and t2 well diameter for both transects is between 1 0 and 1 6 m for all wells under study 3 2 measured water quality parameters during pumping and recovery 3 2 1 physical quality in well zo 1 electrical conductivity ec values increased after pumping 0 6 wv 2 5 m3 fig 4 a measured values was unstable and increased between 544 μs cm to 823 μs cm with an average of 699 5 μs cm during pumping well volume purged was 3 2 ec of samples increased during recovery ranging between 779 μs cm and 943 6 μs cm with an average of 893 6 μs cm values were more stable beyond cumulative recovery of 2 41 wv for well zo 3 the ec increased with cumulative volume purged from the well fig 4b values ranged from 950 μs cm to 1 6 ms cm and stabilised after purging 3 1 wv high and stable ec values of water samples were measured during recovery maximum and minimum values measured were respectively 1 49 ms cm and 1 65 ms cm with an average of 1 58 ms cm from the observed trends in the two wells we can conclude that ec values increased with increasing wv purged becoming more stable during recovery in addition stable ec values for large diameter wells may be obtained after purging for at least 3 wv measured ph values of water samples during pumping and recovery respectively ranged between 6 23 and 7 09 average 6 66 and 6 02 and 6 83 6 43 for zo 1 values were unstable from start of pumping to a cumulative of 1 73 wv fig 4c further pumping resulted in a trend of increasing ph with values ranging between 6 53 and 6 83 measured ph of water samples during recovery indicated slightly acidic water entering the well fig 4c compared with values measured during purging ph stabilised after recovery of 3 2 wv for well zo 3 ph reduced more acidic with cumulative purged volume fig 4d maximum and minimum ph values recorded were respectively 7 21 and 6 51 with an average of value of 6 75 recovered water samples showed more stable ph conditions ranging between 6 58 and 6 51 with an average of 6 54 from the results we conclude that water within the aquifer in the neighbourhood of the two wells are acidic and groundwater standing in the wells prior to pumping may not represent the actual ph conditions of the aquifer typical of groundwater environments measured temperatures for the two wells did not vary much for water samples during well purging and recovery fig 4e and f values ranged from 27 c to 29 2 c mean 28 3 c and 28 3 c 29 2 c mean 28 9 c respectively for zo 1 and zo 3 during pumping values during recovery ranged between 28 c and 29 5 c average 28 c for zo 1 and 28 3 c 29 2 c average 28 9 c based on results from ec and ph measurement of well water samples during purging and recovery we conclude that the physical properties of well water samples stabilises after purging for at least 3 well volumes 3 2 2 chemical quality nitrate content in water samples with corresponding volume of water purged and recovered for well zo 1 are shown in fig 4a initial no3 content prior to pumping was 20 7 mg l and increased with pumping to 70 4 mg l after purging 0 63 wv water from the well values ranged from 3 1 mg l to 70 4 mg l mean 34 8 mg l and from 17 2 mg l to 68 6 mg l mean 48 1 mg l respectively for pumping and recovery fig 5 a show a high and more stable no3 content in recovered water compared to purged water for well zo 3 measured no3 values remained fairly uniform with cumulative volume pumped from the start to 2 11 wv fig 5b no3 values then increased with increased volume purged no3 content in water samples during purging ranged between 22 3 mg l to 89 7 mg l computed mean nitrate content was 53 13 mg l slightly above the whos recommended limit of 50 mg l for drinking water nitrate content in water samples reduced with increasing volumes of water recovered values ranged between 28 4 mg l to 88 9 mg l with an average of 50 4 mg l the observed trends in nitrate content in both wells i e stable values above 50 mg l for zo 1 during recovery and average values above 50 mg l for both purging and recovering for zo 3 we conclude that there may be sources in the neighbourhood of the wells that are supplying no3 to the wells so4 values in water samples from zo 1 during purging ranged between 5 mg l to 65 mg l with an average of 35 50 mg l graph display non uniform sulfate content in purged water during recovery so4 content was more stable after an initial minimum value of 17 mg l values ranged to 50 mg l the graph fig 5c shows a more stable concentrations of so4 in water recovered with increase cumulative volume recovered for zo 3 so4 concentrations measured during pumping ranged between 67 mg l to 133 mg l mean 94 1 mg l study rise from an initial value of 74 mg l rising to 133 mg l after pumping 2 41 wv a general reduction in so4 concentration was observed as pumping increased beyond 2 41 wv so4 content in recovered samples varied between 46 mg l and 128 mg l mean 85 mg l phosphate values measured for wells zo 1 and zo 3 for purged samples respectively ranged from 2 83 mg l to 17 2 mg l average 8 6 mg l and 3 53 mg l to 18 6 mg l average 11 6 mg l po4 content in water samples during recovery varied between 2 83 mg l and 29 4 mg l with an average of 12 41 mg l for well zo 1 whilst for zo 3 po4 content was between 4 5 and 18 9 mg l with an average of 10 81 mg l for both wells po4 content in purged and recovered water did not show any trend fig 5e and f 3 2 3 pollution indicator parameters along transects average concentrations of nutrients phosphate nitrate and sulfate or pollution indicator parameters and average values of physical parameters measured over a period of 8 weeks in water samples of wells located at distances from the recharge area are respectively shown in figs 6 and 7 so4 content in wells along t1 ranged between 8 4 mg l to 67 4 mg l with an average of 26 5 mg l an increasing trend of so4 content in the wells is observed from the recharge area to the low lying area on t1 on t2 average values of so4 in well water samples varied between 36 6 mg l to 105 3 mg l the mean of the averages calculated over 8 weeks was 56 7 mg l a seemingly increasing average so4 concentration with distance from the recharge area is observed fig 6 with high average values in samples from wells in t2 than wells on t1 measured no3 content in hand dug wells along t1 varied between 49 3 mg l to 149 8 mg l with an average of 97 6 mg l with the exception a single well nitrate content in all wells were above the 50 mg l recommended limit in drinking water by the who for t2 average nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples ranged between 17 mg l to 33 mg l with an average of 27 8 mg l phosphate content in water samples from wells on t1 ranged between 2 6 mg l to 8 1 mg l with an average of 4 9 mg l on t2 values ranged between 5 8 mg l to 28 6 mg l with a mean of 10 8 mg l mean po4 content is comparatively higher in discharge area this is even though average values are within drinking water standards it can be concluded that groundwater in the discharge area has high ion content compared to those closer to foothills of the mountain 3 2 4 physical water quality parameters along transects no trend in measured temperature values along the transects values ranged from 28 8 c to 30 5 c along t1 with an average of 29 5 c similar observation of non trending values of temperatures was observed on t2 measured temperature values ranged from 29 1 to 30 c with a mean of 29 7 c values of ph measured along t1 ranged between 5 75 and 6 05 with an average of 5 91 for t2 mean ph values obtained from measurements varied from 6 3 to 6 9 with an average of 6 5 results indicate a general acidic conditions in groundwater of the area with a comparatively more acidic conditions in water samples from wells closer to the recharge area in addition ph of water from all wells on t1 are outside the 6 5 to 8 5 recommended range in groundwater by the who fig 4 b show an overall less acidic groundwater on t2 where water levels are closer to the surface and towards discharge areas lutterodt et al 2018 ph values show low variation and ranged between 6 3 and 6 9 with an average of 6 5 electrical conductivity ec values measured along t1 varied between 293 6 μs cm to 531 9 μs cm average ec was 293 8 μs cm average ec values measured in water from wells on t2 ranged between 0 94 ms cm to 3 25 ms cm with a mean of 1 4 ms cm from the results we conclude that typical of groundwater temperatures there was no distinct variation in measured temperatures in the area and ph of shallow groundwater in the low lying discharge area is less acidic compared to ph of water samples in wells closer to the recharge area also an overall high ec values in wells located within or close to the hills than those in the low lying area fig 7c 3 2 5 corrlation between parameters with the exception of ec and ph that showed a strong correlation r 0 9 p 0 00 and the inverse good relations between no3 and ph r 0 8 p 0 00 and between no3 and ec r 0 6 p 0 02 correlation analysis results amongst the parameters and also with risk to contamination results indicate non correlation between average values of the parameters with r values 0 6 table 3 4 discussions from results obtained during well purging and recovery for ec and anions no3 po4 and so4 it was concluded that values measured was influenced by on site sanitation within the neighbourhood of the two wells the observation is attributable to location of all wells in the built area within dodowa foppen et al 2020 where on site sanitation facilities are common the results indicate the possibility of hydraulic connection between the wells and point sources of pollution located within their immediate surroundings observation of increasing ec values during purging together with high and stable ec values measured in recovered water is an indication of inflow of water with increasing ion concentration into the two wells note that the ec itself represents total dissolved solids in water high ec may therefore be due to a combination of natural dissolution of minerals in groundwater and anthropogenic sources as observed in an earlier work foppen et al 2020 the observed rapid changes in well water quality during pumping has recently been reported chatterjee and chowdhury 2020 the pump and recovery test involved purging large volumes of groundwater from the wells thereby lowering the water level and inducing rapid flow from the immediate surroundings of the well the result of increased concentrations of chemical water quality parameters and ec is an indication of hydraulic connection between the wells and their immediate surroundings where contamination sources waste dumps and pit latrines are located similarly chen et al 2021 reports of increased vulnerability of groundwater under intensive groundwater abstraction groundwater levels in the tsu aquifer are known to be shallow foppen et al 2020 and increases the vulnerability of the resource to pollution by on site sanitation lutterodt et al 2018 it is difficult to understand the observed unstable concentration of the anions during pumping especially concentrations of so4 and no3 in water samples we speculate the possibility of unstable redox conditions associated with water standing in wells and within the immediate groundwater surrounding the well note that we earlier on revealed the semi confined nature of the aquifer foppen et al 2020 indicating the possible presence of spatio temporal variability in aerobic and anaerobic conditions within the neighbourhood of wells and might have led to various biogeochemical processes leading to transformations of the anions in water within the neighbourhood of the wells prior to pumping this observation is supported by the non stable ph values measured in both wells after purging between 1 and 1 5 wvs see fig 4c and d reflecting standing well water and water under atmospheric influence more stable values recorded beyond pumping three wvs and during recovery for both wells are representative of groundwater from the aquifer entering wells we therefore conclude that accurate and representative aquifer samples from large diameter wells in the dodowa area may be possible after purging at least three well volumes of water the observed non variability in groundwater temperatures amongst the wells is a common feature in research when sampling is conducted over the same time regime within a single well field as we have done the differences observed in temperature can be attributed to sampling time of the day samples taken after mid day usually recorded temperatures of 1 2 c higher than the norm strangely temperatures of recovered groundwater during well purging exercise appear to be stable fig 4e and f generally we conclude that dilution of the anions both in recovered and purged water might have occurred this assertion is supported by expectations of high average no3 content in samples due to 1 the high and intermediate risks of contamination of the two wells under study and 2 the tracer characteristic behaviour property of nitrates in groundwater environments note that possible nitrate sources located at distances less than 30 m from the wells tables 1 and 2 and therefore denitrification process might not have taken place within the duration of the pump test we therefore attribute the observation to the possible occurrence of mixing dilution which might have occurred through contributions of water from different groundwater flow paths those intersecting effluents leaching from pollution sources and contributions from pollution free water in addition the stable no3 values of above 50 mg l recorded during pump test exercise for both wells reflect the tracer characteristic property of nitrates in groundwater environment and indicate and confirms the presence of pollution sources nearby also the extended pumping of the wells might have created induced leakage allowing rapid flow of contaminated water from near surface of the shallow aquifer of the tsu where these on site sanitation facilities are located this assertion has previously been observed by wilson and rouse 1983 due to differences in characteristic properties and behaviour in groundwater environments of the chemical parameters under study mechanisms that led to the observations made during well purging and recovery would differ for each parameter this assertion is reflected in the largely non correlation between water quality parameters table 3 even though pollution risk assessment of wells reveals the presence of known sources of the anions under study tables 1 and 2 typically po4 content of groundwater is known to be low due to their limited transport in groundwater environments nyenje et al 2014b note that previous work in the area foppen et al 2020 revealed the presence clay minerals from the saprolite of the phyllites and quartzites of the tsu known to influence the attenuation of phosphate the observed high average po4 content in between 2 6 and 3 6 wvs of recovered water can be attributed to the possible agitation within the aquifer system in the neighbourhood of the wells during well purging rapid changes in hydrodynamic conditions velocity and porosity due to purging might have influenced the possible release of previously adsorbed po4 back into groundwater sources of so4 in groundwater are known to be either natural through the dissolution of minerals such as gypsum and atmospheric deposition or anthropogenic through the release of domestic and or industrial wastewater torres martínez et al 2020 sharma and kumar 2020 wilson and rouse 1983 in our case the so4 content in groundwater during well test exercise and those measured on transects are well below the 250 mg l recommended by the who and also lower than values reported in the literature gejl et al 2019 comparable to values obtained at depths ranging between 2 1 and 8 4 m porowski et al 2019 and can be attributed to the infiltration of wastewater and effluents leaching from pit latrines and faulty septic tanks identified results indicate high ion content in groundwater of the low lying areas compared to recharge areas on the hills this is reflected in the high average concentration of chemical parameters and ec with the exception of no3 which was low on t2 fig 6 overall results are comparable to results by bala et al 2022 who observed high contaminant concentrations in groundwater flow direction results generally comparable to reports of increasing concentration of so4 ions dissolved in groundwater with decreasing hydraulic gradient by gejl et al 2019 also an example of the observed variability in dissolved po4 in groundwater has previously been reported by meinikmann et al 2015 though much of the groundwater quality observed in the area is attributable to anthropogenic influence additional factors may be contributing to the observed high average values on t2 compared to t1 t2 falls within the low lying area of the township that experiences seasonal flooding due to run off from the hills with stormwater remaining stagnant in the area over long periods of time this increases the possibility of infiltration of dissolved solids in ponded water also the long residence time of groundwater in the area is known to influence dissolution of minerals nlend et al 2021 in the case of high ec values low nitrate content on t2 is difficult to explain as risk to contamination results table 2 indicate the presence of nitrate contamination sources in the vicinity of the wells with the exception of a single well with zero risk we can only speculate the ever present possibility of mixing of polluted water with clean groundwater lutterodt et al 2021 and most importantly biogeochemical transformation denitrification of nitrate during the long residence time of both ponded stormwater and during transport of groundwater to the low lying area this assertion is supported by the findings of nyenje et al 2014a and harris et al 2022 who attributed low nitrate content in shallow groundwater samples to denitrification the speculation of contaminated water mixing with clean water biogeochemical processes and sorption of the contaminants might be responsible for the general non correlation between risk to pollution values and anion concentrations table 3 in addition the less acidic groundwater in the low lying compared to acidic conditions towards the hills and the good inverse correlation between no3 and ph table 3 respectively gives an indication of wastewater contaminated groundwater in the discharge area and the possible dominance of nitrate content determining ph values 5 conclusions to assess the vulnerability of wells to pollution nutrients from onsite sanitation we conducted chemical pollution risk analysis to identify pollutant sources that may leach effluent containing chemical anions into the aquifer system in the neighbourhood of hand dug wells through pump test exercise we assessed the possibility of connections between two vulnerable wells and their surroundings and the minimum well volumes required to be removed to obtain representative aquifer water samples in addition spatio temporal sampling and physico chemical water quality analysis of samples from wells lying on two transects from the hills to groundwater discharge area in the dodowa township was conducted to assess the existence in trends and or transport of chemical contaminants between possible groundwater input areas on the hills and the discharge areas based on results we conclude that majority 93 of the wells are at risk of pollution from the identified sources of nutrient anion i e sullage drains waste water from bathrooms pit latrines septic tanks and refuse rubbish dumps accurate and representative aquifer samples from large diameter 1 m wells in the shallow aquifer of the dodowa area may be possible after purging at least three well volumes of water large diameter wells within the shallow aquifer of the area may be hydraulically connected to identified on site sanitation facilities e g pit latrines sullage drains septic tanks and waste dumps and may be responsible for the observed water quality in wells of the area high average concentrations of pollution indicator anions in low lying areas compared to the hills may be attributable to the possibility of lateral and advective transport of contaminants from the hills to the discharge area and long groundwater residence time in the low lying area authors contributions george lutterodt samuel ganyaglo conceived and designed the experiments wrote the paper abass

11710,field work was conducted to understand the possible influence of on site sanitation on groundwater quality estimate minimum bore well volumes of water to be purged from large wells to obtain representative aquifer samples and unravel possible trends in variability in physico chemical water quality of water samples from wells lying between the hills and discharge areas we applied a chemical pollution risk assessment of wells modified from microbial risk assessment to enable the quantification of risk to chemical pollution of wells from on site sanitation for two wells 3 2 well volumes were purged with progressive sampling and physico chemical quality of purged and recovered water physico chemical quality of samples was analyzed for wells lying between hills and discharge areas commonly identified contamination sources are sullage drains pit latrines waste dumps and septic tanks and 14 out of the 15 wells 93 studied at risk to pollution anion concentrations and ec values increased during purging and were stable and high during recovery indicating inflow of water with high ion content possibly from identified risks to chemical anion pollution stabilised physical water quality ec and ph during recovery indicate representative aquifer samples from large diameter wells in the shallow aquifer of the area may be possible after removing at least three well volumes of water apart from nitrate average concentrations of anions and ec were high in water samples from wells in the low lying area results of pump test and sampling between the hills and discharge areas we respectively conclude that the wells are hydraulically connected to contamination sources and the observed groundwater quality may due to effluents from identified contamination sources and dissolution of minerals and increased infiltration of contaminants may be responsible for high electrical conductivity and anion concentration in the low lying discharge areas of the study area

management facilities leach into shallow aquifers nyenje et al 2014a ravenscroft et al 2017 thereby impairing the quality of water from groundwater sources boreholes springs and hand dug wells from which the communities depend on as their main and or alternative sources for their drinking and domestic water needs lapworth et al 2017 grönwall 2016 it is common knowledge that the consumption of water contaminated with nutrients together with their associated microbial pathogens results in adverse health impacts saxena and den 2022 and can sometimes lead to death amongst the highly vulnerable and children landrigan et al 2018 the importance of groundwater in many poor settlements in ssa has influenced recent research to focus on the quality van de vossenberg et al 2021 and vulnerability of groundwater sources hand dug wells boreholes and springs to pollution ercumen et al 2017 misati et al 2017 in addition to quantitative understanding of the hydrogeology of aquifer systems foppen et al 2020 andries et al 2021 though recent research reports have implicated on site sanitation for the poor water quality from groundwater sources in many parts of the ssa region chaúque et al 2021 ferrante et al 2018 the conclusions of many of these works have been drawn from the association between risk to pollution values and poor groundwater quality without assessing the possible connections between pollution sources and groundwater points this possibly has contributed to the lack of good understanding of the association between sanitary inspections and results of water quality analysis kelly et al 2021 snoad et al 2017 even though the who recommends both to quantify the risk of water source contamination note that erroneous interpretation of results due to the variability in both the transport behaviour of contaminants and the geology discontinuities and geochemical heterogeneity of an aquifer can occur variability in water quality parameters are known to exist and this is more linked to characteristic properties of contaminants for example the fate and transport behaviour of nitrates as tracers differs from phosphates which undergo sorption in aquifers nyenje et al 2014a kazmierczak et al 2020 in addition the ubiquitous presence of spatial and temporal variabilities in hydrogeological and hydraulic properties of aquifers e g patton et al 2021 together with the geochemical heterogeneity in aquifer media appelo et al 2005 may also contribute to variability in water quality parameters which remain a crucial determinant of groundwater use revealing the mechanisms of groundwater contamination from identified pollution sources is therefore crucial to groundwater source protection strategies in recent works lutterodt et al 2018 2021 has asserted that an increment in the radius of influence through groundwater abstraction increases the likelihood of pollution of large diameter hand dug wells by effluents from on site sanitation four decades ago schmidt 1977 and wilson and rouse 1983 respectively acknowledged the effect of well pumping on short term variability in well water quality resulting from induced leakage and mixing of vertical and horizontal flow components when pump rates are high much work has been done on pollution risk assessment of hand dug wells but direct measurement of water quality changes under forced induced convection to assess the direct influence of on site sanitation on well water quality is lacking in the literature this is the case in many parts of ssa where on site sanitation has been implicated for poor groundwater quality braimah et al 2021 diaw et al 2020 establishing hydraulic connection between on site sanitation and groundwater sources could confirm the correlation between risk scores and microbial and poor chemical quality as reported by mushi et al 2012 even though other workers ercumen et al 2017 misati et al 2017 reported non correlation between microbial cells and sanitary risk scores in addition knowledge of hydraulic connection between wells and their immediate surrounding can influence groundwater management strategies and landuse options to prevent pollution of groundwater sources apart from boreholes and springs large diameter hand dug wells diameter 1 m remain an important source of groundwater for many communities in both rural and urban areas in many parts of the developing world schram and wamper 2018 gomo et al 2019 braimah et al 2021 the importance of large diameter hand dug wells stems from their affordability gomo et al 2019 as they can be constructed using traditional methods mainly manual excavations through weathered unconsolidated rocks and alluvial aquifers in spite of their importance in the supply of water the hydrogeology of large diameter wells is poorly understood for example gomo et al 2019 has stated the challenges associated with the understanding of well hydraulics due to their large diameter also though there are numerous research articles in the literature on quality of water from large diameter wells but reports of volume of water needed to be purged from the wells before representative aquifer samples can be obtained are uncommon or lacking consequences include sampling water standing in the wells and not actual aquifer samples the result would be of understanding of groundwater quality and the vulnerability of hand dug wells to pollution this can lead to employing wrong groundwater source protection strategies for specific aquifers the main objective of this work is to unravel the possibility of hydraulic connection between peri urban large diameter wells and their immediate surroundings through physico chemical analyses of water samples during progressive pumping of shallow large diameter wells in a saprolite and to determine the minimum bore well volume needed to be purged to obtain representative aquifer sample from large diameter wells additionally this work involves sanitary risk inspection at locations of wells with an aim of identifying pollution sources likely to introduce chemical anion nutrients po4 so4 and no3 into the wells we also explore the possible trends in dissolved nutrient anion po4 so4 and no3 concentrations and physical quality parameter values through spatio temporal sampling and analysis of water from wells lying on transects that span between the hills where groundwater is assumed to recharge minka 2016 and discharge areas in the dodowa township of accra in order to understand transport in the shallow sub surface of the study area ghana 2 methods 2 1 the study area dodowa is a peri urban poor community and lies on the eastern fringes of the akwapim togo ranges trending from ghana into togo location and physical features have previously been described lutterodt et al 2018 foppen et al 2020 two rainfall peaks occur between may and july and between september and october with a mean annual rainfall of 900 mm year annual mean temperature in the area is 27 c kortatsi and jørgensen 2001 topographically the akwapim togo ranges lie towards the north western part of the township with elevations ranging which comprises of the togo quartzites outcrops in the north western part of the township with elevations ranging between 125 and 150 m a s l while the south and south eastern is almost flat with elevations of 55 65 m a s l the geo hydrological system of the dodowa area has been described by foppen et al 2020 the geology of the area is made up of the togo structural unit tsu which comprises of phyllites and quartzites attoh et al 1997 outcropping in the north western part of the township the dahomeyan structural unit dsu consisting of alternating bands of acid gneisses and basic gneisses forms the other major rocky type found in the dodowa area and outcrops in the eastern part of the township see fig 2 the hydrogeology of the area is controlled by groundwater occurrence in the saprolites of the tsu at shallow depths and fractures at relatively lower depths within the dsu foppen et al 2020 reports that both aquifers are semi confined with phreatic water levels of wells and boreholes within the area indicating groundwater level reduces towards the south 80 a m sl in the north to 60 a m s l south from the hills in the north with a general northwest south east trending of horizontal groundwater head gradient minka 2016 fig 2 in addition groundwater levels in the area drop during the dry season and recovers to initial levels during the wet season with fluctuations ranging between 1 and 2 m transmissivities in the two aquifers are low with values less than 6e 5 m2 s foppen et al 2020 the dodowa river drains the area and flows from the hills in the north to the low lying area in the south foppen et al 2020 has speculated the fractured quartzites as the likely source of discharge in springs in the southern part of the township the ghana statistical service reports a population of 12 075 living in the township in the 2010 population census buadee and yirenkyi 2010 the community enjoy multiple sources of water and includes supplies from the ghana water company limited self supplies from groundwater sources boreholes and wells with at least some 80 sources distributed over an area of 5 km2 according to grönwall 2016 approximately 38 and 73 use groundwater sources as main and second sources respectively well location map showing the study area is given in fig 1 2 2 risk to well contamination by pollution indicator anions sanitary risk assessment of well surroundings was conducted for all wells under the study tables 1 and 2 the objective was to quantify the risk to pollution of wells by anions from on site sanitation and from activities within the neighbourhood of wells that are likely to introduce pollution indicator anions into the aquifer system to do this we modified the british geological survey sanitary risk assessment method howard et al 2003 lutterodt et al 2018 used to assess the risk of microbial contamination of wells the modification was based on the fact that when microbes are leached into the soils from effluent of waste they are therefore transported together with the pollution indicator anions in the effluent as a plume note that the modification also involved omission of risks that may not introduce microbes without effluents into the wells for example rope bucket left at potentially contaminated point lutterodt et al 2018 diagnostic information for assessment of risk to pollution of wells that would lead to likely changes in physical parameters ec and ph and most importantly increment in the concentrations of anions i e dissolved phosphate orthophosphate sulfate and nitrates and their corresponding risk scores in brackets are as follows latrine within 10 30 m of well 1 latrine upstream of well 1 septic tank within 5 30 m of well 1 septic tank upstream of well 1 waste refuse dump within 5 30 m of well 1 waste refuse dump upstream of well 1 sullage drain wastewater from bathroom within 5 30 m from well 1 sullage drain wastewater from bathroom upstream of well 1 drainage causing stagnant water within 2 m of well 1 these are summed up to give a final risk score total risk scores 8 are considered very high risk scores ranging between 5 and 8 high scores 3 4 and 0 2 are respectively considered as intermediate and low the modification was necessary due to the presence of more than one identified source s of pollution in the neighbourhood of the wells in the study area lutterodt et al 2018 for e g the method as used previously lutterodt et al 2021 howard et al 2003 cannot quantify the risk to pollution in situations where more than one identified pollution source e g 2 pit latrines are mapped within neighbourhood of wells therefore the risk posed by the presence of for example more than one pit latrine in the neighbourhood of a groundwater source is not captured by the method in such a scenario 2 3 well discharge and recovery with sampling and analysis of water quality parameters to assess the possible influence of on site sanitation on wells within the area two wells zo 3 and zo 1 were selected for forced convection experiments depth and diameter of the wells were 5 6 m and 1 18 m for zo 1 and 5 2 m and 1 14 m for zo 3 and depth of column of water standing in the wells prior to pumping were respectively 3 88 m and 4 04 m for zo 1 and zo 3 this gives well volume wv of 4 24 m3 for zo 1 and 4 67 m3 for zo 3 water from the wells were discharged at constant at rate 58 l min and allowed to recover after at least two wvs have been discharged to do this a one horse power pump pedrollo italy was connected to a 5 kw generator ryobi china to supply the needed energy to purge the wells fig 3 the pump is initially connected to a 2 inch diameter water hose of length 50 m and the hose together with the pump lowered into a well under study and pump set at 0 5 m from the bottom of the well the pump is set to the maximum discharge rate and water discharge from the well q measured by sampling water in a bucket of a known volume 20 l over a measured period of time t and q computed from an average of 3 tests initial samples for water quality were taken by pumping with mini pump and tubes and some batteries thus 200 ml sample was taken directly into 250 ml clean plastic containers at regular time intervals 15 min water samples were taken for the analysis of physical parameters ph ec and temperature and chemical parameters nitrate phosphate and sulfate temperature and ec were determined using a conductivity meter cond340i wtw gmbh weilheim germany calibrated at 25 c and ph was determined using a ph meter ph340i wtw gmbh weilheim germany no3 so4 and po4 were determined on site via hach dr spectrophotometer immediately after each sample taken to do this 200 ml of sampled water was filtered through 0 45 μm lead acetate paper into a 250 ml sterile sampling bottles 25 ml of filtered samples are transferred into a cell followed by addition of a reagent from pemachm reagents and vigorously shaken for a minute and allowed to react for 5 min then the prepared sample was placed into the cell holder to determine the nitrate concentration after a blank filtered sample has been used to calibrate the hach dr reagents used for respective chemical analyses are one nitraver 5 nitrate reagent powder pillow phosver 3 phosphate powder pillow reagent sulfver 5 2 4 spatio temporal sampling and analysis of water quality parameters to understand the possible existence of trends in anion pollutant content in shallow groundwater between recharge and discharge areas the physical ec ph and temperature and chemical no3 so4 po4 were measured weekly over a period of 8 weeks in samples of water from wells located on two selected transects t1 9 wells and t2 6 wells trending nw se and ne sw respectively fig 1 and at varying distances from the recharge area at the foot of the mountain foppen et al 2020 physical parameters were measured in situ measurement of chemical and physical parameters followed same procedure as was done for well discharge and recovery water quality measurements above to avoid sampling stagnant water wells were sampled late morning to afternoon when large volumes of water have been abstracted from the wells nlend et al 2021 lutterodt et al 2021 2 5 statistical analyses the degree of association between average values of physico chemical parameters measured in water samples from wells on the transects and with scores of risk to anion contamination of the wells were determined with the parametric correlation coefficient r using ibm spss statistics version 25 ibm corp armonk ny usa 2019 r values 0 9 or 0 9 were considered strong analyses were considered good for 0 7 r 0 9 or 0 7 r 0 9 and non correlation for r 0 6 or r 0 6 correlation analysis were considered to be statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 sanitary risk scores correlation between risk scores and water quality parameters results of sanitary risk inspection conducted at the wells are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively for wells on transect 1 t1 and transect 2 t2 commonly identified contamination sources on both transects are sullage drains pit latrines septic tanks and refuse rubbish dump seven of the wells four on t1 and three 3 on t2 are at high risk risk score 5 8 of contamination and represents 46 7 five wells 33 3 are at intermediate risk risk score 3 4 3 on t1 and 2 on t2 and three wells 20 two on t1 and a single well on t2 are at low risk 0 2 risk score to contamination tables 1 and 2 and overall 14 out of 15 93 wells at risk to contamination from the identified risk sources the table also give the distances of the wells from the foot of the mountains where recharge takes place foppen et al 2020 and water is considered to be comparatively cleaner than samples from wells downstream range of distances of wells from recharge to discharge are 0 41 1 26 m and 1 1 2 47 m respectively for t1 and t2 depths of wells range between 3 6 to 8 9 m and 4 1 5 7 m respectively for t1 and t2 well diameter for both transects is between 1 0 and 1 6 m for all wells under study 3 2 measured water quality parameters during pumping and recovery 3 2 1 physical quality in well zo 1 electrical conductivity ec values increased after pumping 0 6 wv 2 5 m3 fig 4 a measured values was unstable and increased between 544 μs cm to 823 μs cm with an average of 699 5 μs cm during pumping well volume purged was 3 2 ec of samples increased during recovery ranging between 779 μs cm and 943 6 μs cm with an average of 893 6 μs cm values were more stable beyond cumulative recovery of 2 41 wv for well zo 3 the ec increased with cumulative volume purged from the well fig 4b values ranged from 950 μs cm to 1 6 ms cm and stabilised after purging 3 1 wv high and stable ec values of water samples were measured during recovery maximum and minimum values measured were respectively 1 49 ms cm and 1 65 ms cm with an average of 1 58 ms cm from the observed trends in the two wells we can conclude that ec values increased with increasing wv purged becoming more stable during recovery in addition stable ec values for large diameter wells may be obtained after purging for at least 3 wv measured ph values of water samples during pumping and recovery respectively ranged between 6 23 and 7 09 average 6 66 and 6 02 and 6 83 6 43 for zo 1 values were unstable from start of pumping to a cumulative of 1 73 wv fig 4c further pumping resulted in a trend of increasing ph with values ranging between 6 53 and 6 83 measured ph of water samples during recovery indicated slightly acidic water entering the well fig 4c compared with values measured during purging ph stabilised after recovery of 3 2 wv for well zo 3 ph reduced more acidic with cumulative purged volume fig 4d maximum and minimum ph values recorded were respectively 7 21 and 6 51 with an average of value of 6 75 recovered water samples showed more stable ph conditions ranging between 6 58 and 6 51 with an average of 6 54 from the results we conclude that water within the aquifer in the neighbourhood of the two wells are acidic and groundwater standing in the wells prior to pumping may not represent the actual ph conditions of the aquifer typical of groundwater environments measured temperatures for the two wells did not vary much for water samples during well purging and recovery fig 4e and f values ranged from 27 c to 29 2 c mean 28 3 c and 28 3 c 29 2 c mean 28 9 c respectively for zo 1 and zo 3 during pumping values during recovery ranged between 28 c and 29 5 c average 28 c for zo 1 and 28 3 c 29 2 c average 28 9 c based on results from ec and ph measurement of well water samples during purging and recovery we conclude that the physical properties of well water samples stabilises after purging for at least 3 well volumes 3 2 2 chemical quality nitrate content in water samples with corresponding volume of water purged and recovered for well zo 1 are shown in fig 4a initial no3 content prior to pumping was 20 7 mg l and increased with pumping to 70 4 mg l after purging 0 63 wv water from the well values ranged from 3 1 mg l to 70 4 mg l mean 34 8 mg l and from 17 2 mg l to 68 6 mg l mean 48 1 mg l respectively for pumping and recovery fig 5 a show a high and more stable no3 content in recovered water compared to purged water for well zo 3 measured no3 values remained fairly uniform with cumulative volume pumped from the start to 2 11 wv fig 5b no3 values then increased with increased volume purged no3 content in water samples during purging ranged between 22 3 mg l to 89 7 mg l computed mean nitrate content was 53 13 mg l slightly above the whos recommended limit of 50 mg l for drinking water nitrate content in water samples reduced with increasing volumes of water recovered values ranged between 28 4 mg l to 88 9 mg l with an average of 50 4 mg l the observed trends in nitrate content in both wells i e stable values above 50 mg l for zo 1 during recovery and average values above 50 mg l for both purging and recovering for zo 3 we conclude that there may be sources in the neighbourhood of the wells that are supplying no3 to the wells so4 values in water samples from zo 1 during purging ranged between 5 mg l to 65 mg l with an average of 35 50 mg l graph display non uniform sulfate content in purged water during recovery so4 content was more stable after an initial minimum value of 17 mg l values ranged to 50 mg l the graph fig 5c shows a more stable concentrations of so4 in water recovered with increase cumulative volume recovered for zo 3 so4 concentrations measured during pumping ranged between 67 mg l to 133 mg l mean 94 1 mg l study rise from an initial value of 74 mg l rising to 133 mg l after pumping 2 41 wv a general reduction in so4 concentration was observed as pumping increased beyond 2 41 wv so4 content in recovered samples varied between 46 mg l and 128 mg l mean 85 mg l phosphate values measured for wells zo 1 and zo 3 for purged samples respectively ranged from 2 83 mg l to 17 2 mg l average 8 6 mg l and 3 53 mg l to 18 6 mg l average 11 6 mg l po4 content in water samples during recovery varied between 2 83 mg l and 29 4 mg l with an average of 12 41 mg l for well zo 1 whilst for zo 3 po4 content was between 4 5 and 18 9 mg l with an average of 10 81 mg l for both wells po4 content in purged and recovered water did not show any trend fig 5e and f 3 2 3 pollution indicator parameters along transects average concentrations of nutrients phosphate nitrate and sulfate or pollution indicator parameters and average values of physical parameters measured over a period of 8 weeks in water samples of wells located at distances from the recharge area are respectively shown in figs 6 and 7 so4 content in wells along t1 ranged between 8 4 mg l to 67 4 mg l with an average of 26 5 mg l an increasing trend of so4 content in the wells is observed from the recharge area to the low lying area on t1 on t2 average values of so4 in well water samples varied between 36 6 mg l to 105 3 mg l the mean of the averages calculated over 8 weeks was 56 7 mg l a seemingly increasing average so4 concentration with distance from the recharge area is observed fig 6 with high average values in samples from wells in t2 than wells on t1 measured no3 content in hand dug wells along t1 varied between 49 3 mg l to 149 8 mg l with an average of 97 6 mg l with the exception a single well nitrate content in all wells were above the 50 mg l recommended limit in drinking water by the who for t2 average nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples ranged between 17 mg l to 33 mg l with an average of 27 8 mg l phosphate content in water samples from wells on t1 ranged between 2 6 mg l to 8 1 mg l with an average of 4 9 mg l on t2 values ranged between 5 8 mg l to 28 6 mg l with a mean of 10 8 mg l mean po4 content is comparatively higher in discharge area this is even though average values are within drinking water standards it can be concluded that groundwater in the discharge area has high ion content compared to those closer to foothills of the mountain 3 2 4 physical water quality parameters along transects no trend in measured temperature values along the transects values ranged from 28 8 c to 30 5 c along t1 with an average of 29 5 c similar observation of non trending values of temperatures was observed on t2 measured temperature values ranged from 29 1 to 30 c with a mean of 29 7 c values of ph measured along t1 ranged between 5 75 and 6 05 with an average of 5 91 for t2 mean ph values obtained from measurements varied from 6 3 to 6 9 with an average of 6 5 results indicate a general acidic conditions in groundwater of the area with a comparatively more acidic conditions in water samples from wells closer to the recharge area in addition ph of water from all wells on t1 are outside the 6 5 to 8 5 recommended range in groundwater by the who fig 4 b show an overall less acidic groundwater on t2 where water levels are closer to the surface and towards discharge areas lutterodt et al 2018 ph values show low variation and ranged between 6 3 and 6 9 with an average of 6 5 electrical conductivity ec values measured along t1 varied between 293 6 μs cm to 531 9 μs cm average ec was 293 8 μs cm average ec values measured in water from wells on t2 ranged between 0 94 ms cm to 3 25 ms cm with a mean of 1 4 ms cm from the results we conclude that typical of groundwater temperatures there was no distinct variation in measured temperatures in the area and ph of shallow groundwater in the low lying discharge area is less acidic compared to ph of water samples in wells closer to the recharge area also an overall high ec values in wells located within or close to the hills than those in the low lying area fig 7c 3 2 5 corrlation between parameters with the exception of ec and ph that showed a strong correlation r 0 9 p 0 00 and the inverse good relations between no3 and ph r 0 8 p 0 00 and between no3 and ec r 0 6 p 0 02 correlation analysis results amongst the parameters and also with risk to contamination results indicate non correlation between average values of the parameters with r values 0 6 table 3 4 discussions from results obtained during well purging and recovery for ec and anions no3 po4 and so4 it was concluded that values measured was influenced by on site sanitation within the neighbourhood of the two wells the observation is attributable to location of all wells in the built area within dodowa foppen et al 2020 where on site sanitation facilities are common the results indicate the possibility of hydraulic connection between the wells and point sources of pollution located within their immediate surroundings observation of increasing ec values during purging together with high and stable ec values measured in recovered water is an indication of inflow of water with increasing ion concentration into the two wells note that the ec itself represents total dissolved solids in water high ec may therefore be due to a combination of natural dissolution of minerals in groundwater and anthropogenic sources as observed in an earlier work foppen et al 2020 the observed rapid changes in well water quality during pumping has recently been reported chatterjee and chowdhury 2020 the pump and recovery test involved purging large volumes of groundwater from the wells thereby lowering the water level and inducing rapid flow from the immediate surroundings of the well the result of increased concentrations of chemical water quality parameters and ec is an indication of hydraulic connection between the wells and their immediate surroundings where contamination sources waste dumps and pit latrines are located similarly chen et al 2021 reports of increased vulnerability of groundwater under intensive groundwater abstraction groundwater levels in the tsu aquifer are known to be shallow foppen et al 2020 and increases the vulnerability of the resource to pollution by on site sanitation lutterodt et al 2018 it is difficult to understand the observed unstable concentration of the anions during pumping especially concentrations of so4 and no3 in water samples we speculate the possibility of unstable redox conditions associated with water standing in wells and within the immediate groundwater surrounding the well note that we earlier on revealed the semi confined nature of the aquifer foppen et al 2020 indicating the possible presence of spatio temporal variability in aerobic and anaerobic conditions within the neighbourhood of wells and might have led to various biogeochemical processes leading to transformations of the anions in water within the neighbourhood of the wells prior to pumping this observation is supported by the non stable ph values measured in both wells after purging between 1 and 1 5 wvs see fig 4c and d reflecting standing well water and water under atmospheric influence more stable values recorded beyond pumping three wvs and during recovery for both wells are representative of groundwater from the aquifer entering wells we therefore conclude that accurate and representative aquifer samples from large diameter wells in the dodowa area may be possible after purging at least three well volumes of water the observed non variability in groundwater temperatures amongst the wells is a common feature in research when sampling is conducted over the same time regime within a single well field as we have done the differences observed in temperature can be attributed to sampling time of the day samples taken after mid day usually recorded temperatures of 1 2 c higher than the norm strangely temperatures of recovered groundwater during well purging exercise appear to be stable fig 4e and f generally we conclude that dilution of the anions both in recovered and purged water might have occurred this assertion is supported by expectations of high average no3 content in samples due to 1 the high and intermediate risks of contamination of the two wells under study and 2 the tracer characteristic behaviour property of nitrates in groundwater environments note that possible nitrate sources located at distances less than 30 m from the wells tables 1 and 2 and therefore denitrification process might not have taken place within the duration of the pump test we therefore attribute the observation to the possible occurrence of mixing dilution which might have occurred through contributions of water from different groundwater flow paths those intersecting effluents leaching from pollution sources and contributions from pollution free water in addition the stable no3 values of above 50 mg l recorded during pump test exercise for both wells reflect the tracer characteristic property of nitrates in groundwater environment and indicate and confirms the presence of pollution sources nearby also the extended pumping of the wells might have created induced leakage allowing rapid flow of contaminated water from near surface of the shallow aquifer of the tsu where these on site sanitation facilities are located this assertion has previously been observed by wilson and rouse 1983 due to differences in characteristic properties and behaviour in groundwater environments of the chemical parameters under study mechanisms that led to the observations made during well purging and recovery would differ for each parameter this assertion is reflected in the largely non correlation between water quality parameters table 3 even though pollution risk assessment of wells reveals the presence of known sources of the anions under study tables 1 and 2 typically po4 content of groundwater is known to be low due to their limited transport in groundwater environments nyenje et al 2014b note that previous work in the area foppen et al 2020 revealed the presence clay minerals from the saprolite of the phyllites and quartzites of the tsu known to influence the attenuation of phosphate the observed high average po4 content in between 2 6 and 3 6 wvs of recovered water can be attributed to the possible agitation within the aquifer system in the neighbourhood of the wells during well purging rapid changes in hydrodynamic conditions velocity and porosity due to purging might have influenced the possible release of previously adsorbed po4 back into groundwater sources of so4 in groundwater are known to be either natural through the dissolution of minerals such as gypsum and atmospheric deposition or anthropogenic through the release of domestic and or industrial wastewater torres martínez et al 2020 sharma and kumar 2020 wilson and rouse 1983 in our case the so4 content in groundwater during well test exercise and those measured on transects are well below the 250 mg l recommended by the who and also lower than values reported in the literature gejl et al 2019 comparable to values obtained at depths ranging between 2 1 and 8 4 m porowski et al 2019 and can be attributed to the infiltration of wastewater and effluents leaching from pit latrines and faulty septic tanks identified results indicate high ion content in groundwater of the low lying areas compared to recharge areas on the hills this is reflected in the high average concentration of chemical parameters and ec with the exception of no3 which was low on t2 fig 6 overall results are comparable to results by bala et al 2022 who observed high contaminant concentrations in groundwater flow direction results generally comparable to reports of increasing concentration of so4 ions dissolved in groundwater with decreasing hydraulic gradient by gejl et al 2019 also an example of the observed variability in dissolved po4 in groundwater has previously been reported by meinikmann et al 2015 though much of the groundwater quality observed in the area is attributable to anthropogenic influence additional factors may be contributing to the observed high average values on t2 compared to t1 t2 falls within the low lying area of the township that experiences seasonal flooding due to run off from the hills with stormwater remaining stagnant in the area over long periods of time this increases the possibility of infiltration of dissolved solids in ponded water also the long residence time of groundwater in the area is known to influence dissolution of minerals nlend et al 2021 in the case of high ec values low nitrate content on t2 is difficult to explain as risk to contamination results table 2 indicate the presence of nitrate contamination sources in the vicinity of the wells with the exception of a single well with zero risk we can only speculate the ever present possibility of mixing of polluted water with clean groundwater lutterodt et al 2021 and most importantly biogeochemical transformation denitrification of nitrate during the long residence time of both ponded stormwater and during transport of groundwater to the low lying area this assertion is supported by the findings of nyenje et al 2014a and harris et al 2022 who attributed low nitrate content in shallow groundwater samples to denitrification the speculation of contaminated water mixing with clean water biogeochemical processes and sorption of the contaminants might be responsible for the general non correlation between risk to pollution values and anion concentrations table 3 in addition the less acidic groundwater in the low lying compared to acidic conditions towards the hills and the good inverse correlation between no3 and ph table 3 respectively gives an indication of wastewater contaminated groundwater in the discharge area and the possible dominance of nitrate content determining ph values 5 conclusions to assess the vulnerability of wells to pollution nutrients from onsite sanitation we conducted chemical pollution risk analysis to identify pollutant sources that may leach effluent containing chemical anions into the aquifer system in the neighbourhood of hand dug wells through pump test exercise we assessed the possibility of connections between two vulnerable wells and their surroundings and the minimum well volumes required to be removed to obtain representative aquifer water samples in addition spatio temporal sampling and physico chemical water quality analysis of samples from wells lying on two transects from the hills to groundwater discharge area in the dodowa township was conducted to assess the existence in trends and or transport of chemical contaminants between possible groundwater input areas on the hills and the discharge areas based on results we conclude that majority 93 of the wells are at risk of pollution from the identified sources of nutrient anion i e sullage drains waste water from bathrooms pit latrines septic tanks and refuse rubbish dumps accurate and representative aquifer samples from large diameter 1 m wells in the shallow aquifer of the dodowa area may be possible after purging at least three well volumes of water large diameter wells within the shallow aquifer of the area may be hydraulically connected to identified on site sanitation facilities e g pit latrines sullage drains septic tanks and waste dumps and may be responsible for the observed water quality in wells of the area high average concentrations of pollution indicator anions in low lying areas compared to the hills may be attributable to the possibility of lateral and advective transport of contaminants from the hills to the discharge area and long groundwater residence time in the low lying area authors contributions george lutterodt samuel ganyaglo conceived and designed the experiments wrote the paper abass

11711,identifying sources of potentially toxic elements pte in groundwater in los humeros geothermal power plant puebla mexico a site with more than 20 years of electricity generation history through geothermal resources is a great challenge especially when human activities are taking place within the geothermal power plant through the analysis and differentiation of three types of water domestic natural and hydrothermal this study aimed to track potentially toxic elements in surface and groundwaters analyzed from statistical standpoints to understand their potential transportation processes and determine their natural or anthropogenic origin as a result the hydrothermal waters were the most enriched as 23 112 μg l 1 cu 737 μg l 1 s 571 mg l 1 sb 117 μg l 1 and se 47 8 μg l 1 and therefore found to be the major influence of potentially toxic elements in the water chemistry of the region in addition the domestic waters were found to be transitional having moderate concentrations as 44 2 μg l 1 cd 4 14 μg l 1 cr 10 5 μg l 1 na 71 4 mg l 1 k 15 2 mg l 1 and v 36 4 μg l 1 finally the natural waters had the lowest concentrations of most elements except for na cd 4 04 μg l 1 na 76 5 mg l 1 cr 2 29 μg l 1 k 12 mg l 1 and v 30 2 μg l 1 furthermore the sampling in two seasons and two years suggest that dynamic processes are taking place in the site since no clear correlation was found between seasonal data the main transport processes for the pte might be the water rock interaction tectonic and structural geology and the influence on the direct and indirect rainwater infiltration into the caldera graphical abstract image 1 keywords domestic natural hydrothermal statistics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally in our current times maintaining the quality of superficial and groundwater is a great challenge the constant increase in the concentration of potentially toxic chemical elements pte in water bodies due to natural and or anthropogenic causes has created limitations in addition overexploitation to satisfy the growing water demand followed by the decrease in annual recharge in some parts of the world makes the problem even more challenging and unsustainable the hydrochemistry within a region is determined by natural processes such as atmospheric depositions precipitations evapotranspiration water rock soil interactions and anthropogenic activities singh 2015 sinha et al 2014 hydrochemistry is usually associated with variations in precipitation surface runoff trench and stream discharge vadose zone leaching groundwater filtration and the interception and capacity of rain discharge álvarez cabria et al 2016 olson and hawkins 2012 pejman et al 2009 vega et al 1998 the natural hydrothermal alteration also changes water chemistry through the mineralization of host rocks by increasing the temperature pressure and chemistry of fluids interacting with the rock martínez serrano 2002 pirajno 2009 therefore it is imperative to evaluate and determine the chemical composition and characteristics of superficial and groundwater quality as these can all vary according to several factors zare garizi et al 2011 in several geothermal areas worldwide high concentrations of certain potentially toxic chemical elements have been identified especially in geothermal fluids which are controlled by their balance with minerals that are part of the rocks in the deep aquifer known as a geothermal reservoir arnórsson et al 2006 this is where the importance of the rock water interactions comes from furthermore while geothermal fluids and minerals behave differently depending on their origin and characteristics some secondary minerals can be dissolved and release potentially toxic elements under certain conditions liou et al 1985 sengupta et al 2014 making them more difficult to trace and differentiate from their source it is well known that ph is one of the most important parameters that controls the concentration and chemical form of inorganic and organic dissolved elements and compounds i e soils enriched with organic matter can have ph values as low as 4 whereas waters in contact with shale bedrock or iron sulfide minerals can have a lower ph in contrast reactions between carbonate strata and groundwater typically have ph values of 8 5 temperature and dissolved gases affect the ph in groundwater e g the ph of neutral water is 7 at 25 c and 7 48 at 0 c hem 1989 the application of multivariate statistic techniques has shown its usefulness in interpreting the complex data matrixes to evaluate seasonal water quality and processes that affect the geochemistry of groundwater the advantage of using these techniques is the reduction of complex data sets to significant factors without any loss of information this reveals hidden relationships between variables and as a consequence offers a better understanding of water quality and possible sources affecting the system singh et al 2004 this study aims to track potentially toxic chemical elements in surface and groundwaters of natural geothermal originated and domestic types in the geothermal power plant of los humeros puebla mexico these numbers are deduced from statistical standpoints to understand the potential transportation processes of these chemicals and if they are of natural or anthropogenic nature 1 1 study area the study area corresponds to the geothermal power plant of los humeros found 280 km east of mexico city on the eastern sector of the trans mexican volcanic belt in the state of puebla it is found in the valley portion of the libres oriental basin which is part of the volcanic complex inside the surrounding area of los humeros caldera fig 1 the first deep well was drilled in 1982 and the commercial operations of the geothermal power plant began in 1990 when the 5 mw unit was installed arellano et al 2003 fifty wells as deep as 2800 m have been drilled within this field from which 25 wells are in production 17 are closed and 4 are injection wells another 4 are being evaluated and 8 are still in the evaluation process carrasco núñez et al 2017 gonzález partida et al 2001 lópez romero 2006 before the power plant was installed the inhabitants that lived there discussed the matter with the developer federal commission of electricity and agreed to support the progress only if they could stay on their land therefore the power plant has been developed around the inhabitant s settlements these settlements are made up mainly by three communities el valle los humeros and maxtaloya 1 2 geology los humeros caldera is located in a region with important geological provinces beginning with the teziutlán massif the sierra madre oriental smo and the trans mexican volcanic belt fig 2 its geology has been described by various authors arellano et al 2003 carrasco nuñez et al 2017 ferrari et al 2012 norini et al 2019 in summary this zone is characterized by a thick sequence of miocene andesites dacites and basaltic flows from the cuyoaco and alseseca andesite unit yáñez garcía and garcía durán 1982 and pliocene to pleistocene basaltic to andesitic lavas belonging to the teziutlán andesitic unit the miocene lavas are approximately 900 m thick and the teziutlán andesitic lavas are up to 1500 m thick lópez hernández 1995 both units are classified as andesitic and basaltic volcanic basement and form the currently exploited reservoir in the subsurface of los humeros geothermal power plant carrasco núñez et al 2018 the origin of los humeros caldera was due to several volcanic eruptions and the repeated collapse of the magmatic chamber subsequently three volcanic cycles took place from the pliocene to the holocene presenting three caldera structures los humeros los potreros and the xalapasco these formed in the different volcanic events that occurred in the site campos enríquez et al 2005 campos enriquez and arredondo fragoso 1992 cavazos and carrasco núñez 2020 the post caldera stage consists of rhyolitic and dacitic domes within the caldera center and basaltic to trachyandesitic basaltic to trachyandesitic lava flows volcaniclastic breccias and deposits with a highly variable lateral and vertical distribution carrasco nuñez et al 2017 carrasco núñez et al 2018 1 3 climate according to the climate classification system of köppen modified by garcía 1964 to represent the climatic diversity of mexico as well as the map and data of climate units from inegi national institute of statistics and geography and conagua national commission of water the study area corresponds to the following climates 1 temperate humid a climate with abundant rain in summer with a percentage greater than 5 in winter 2 template sub humid a climate with rain in summer and a percentage lower than 5 in winter 3 semi cold sub humid a climate with rain in summer and a percentage lower than 5 in winter 4 cold a climate where the temperature of the coldest month is lower than 0 c according to the latitude of the basin the type of climate should be subtropical but its orography and its perpendicular position to the dominant airflow modify it in addition the trade winds have a strong influence on its climate and the gulf of mexico represents a temperature and humidity regulator for the basin given its proximity alcocer durand et al 2004 the average temperature in the study area during the last ten years has fluctuated between 7 and 16 c with maximum rainfall of 1 mm between may and september with an annual rainfall average of 0 3 mm conagua 2020 1 4 hydrology and hydrogeology according to inegi and inecol national institute of ecology 2005 the study area is located at the northern border of the libres oriental endorheic basin northeast of the atoyac river basin belonging to the hydrologic administrative iv balsas region which corresponds to the hydrological region number 18 sharing borders north with hueyapan and teziutlan east with atempan and tlatlauquitepec south with cuyoaco and tepeyahualco and west with xiutetelco and teziutlan three hydrological regions are located at the study area hydrological region balsas hydrological region north of veracruz tuxpan nautla rh 27 and hydrological region papaloapan rh 28 the superficial hydrologic system is practically non existent because most of the basin s surface shows pyroclastic deposits of recent age that favor high infiltration in addition because the rainy season has a specific and short seasonality there are no superficial perennial runoffs in the watershed inegi 1984 there are no well defined channels inside the hydrologic network of the los humeros area instead there are marshes and ephemeral ponds in the rainy season and moderate streams that disappear in the dry season therefore water usage greatly depends on groundwater can chulim et al 2011 the aquifer is limited by the los humeros caldera to the north which has high permeability due to the pyroclastic materials that form it while to the northwest is the sierra tlaxco where there is a mountainous alignment of andesites and tuffs to the south is the sierra soltepec which is a calcareous structure strongly folded and shallow finally in the center there are extensive plains of lacustrine origin the area has strong evaporation rates so the intensive extraction of groundwater and the alteration of natural geohydrological outlets cause the water table to drop conagua 2020 2015 cedillo rodríguez 2000 presented a preliminary study of shallow water recharge within the closed basin of los humeros caldera delimited by the topography the high permeability of the soils and the large extension of the libres oriental aquifer together with the moderate rate of abatement meant that during years of extraordinary rainfall the aquifer had important recoveries that were concentrated in the lacustrine zones arredondo figueroa et al 1985 however some studies have reflected the drastic decrease in the surface water resources alcocer durand et al 2004 alcocer et al 1998 verma et al 2000 conducted a study to measure the isotopic composition of rainwater at seven regional stations to define the local meteoric water line lmwl it is likely that in the northern portion of the area faults and fractures the los humeros caldera and other structures control the flow leading to the deeper geothermal fluids to rise cigna et al 2019 the domestic wells are between 200 and 300 m deep which is abnormal for domestic wells they generally are shallower in most places huízar álvarez et al 2001 the wells have been monitored for years not showing any evidence of geothermal water mixtures gonzález partida et al 2022 portugal et al 2002 however no studies conducted on the site differentiate the geochemical fingerprint of geothermal fluids in natural waters from the local and domestic waters 2 materials and methods in order to comprehend the groundwater data a local hydrological analysis of precipitation was done at the same time the concentration of potentially toxic chemical elements as cd co cu mn ni pb u v y zn was compared with the international guidelines of drinking water quality within three different types of water domestic natural and hydrothermal in addition in a statistical analysis of physiochemical parameters major and trace elements were correlated to evaluate their mobility and stability in water the areas with more significant variability in water quality were identified in order to understand the potential transportation processes among different types of water 2 1 local hydrology and rainfall the method of inverse distance weighted idw was used together with the universal transversal mercator projection utm zone 14 ellipsoid and horizontal datum world geodetic system wgs84 with information from conabio national commission for knowledge and use of biodiversity and inegi national institute of statistics and geography to create specialized maps the methodology proposed by wang and liu 2006 was used to fill in the depressions in the calculations of runoff drainage in the basins the data from the national weather service smn was used to create the precipitation graph the smn is the organization that provides climate information nationwide in mexico through the climate monitoring network of smn and the national commission of water conagua smn can where 5420 climate stations are shown however temporal series often show incomplete data or show only less than 20 years of information therefore it was necessary to link data from different climate stations reported by the world meteorological organization wmo 2011 which has an influence on every climate station in a 5 km radius from this the collected data came from zones near the area of interest such as chignautla cuyoaco francisco i madero and maxtaloya as well as historical data from meteoblue this last one calculates and predicts meteorological data using its process based on the non hydrostatic mesoscale model nmm with a resolution of approximately 30 km from the los humeros area monthly seasonal and annual precipitation data were used 2 2 sampling and analysis the water samples were taken thrice from each site during four seasons dry 2018 and rainy 2018 dry 2020 and rainy 2019 as seen in table 1 it is important to mention that not all water sites were available for sampling during the four seasons in the case of groundwater the depth of the well was registered as for natural there are some natural springs and the rest of the waters are superficial due to natural or anthropogenic deposits in domestic waters there is a relationship between them for example d2 supplies d3 d4 supplies d1 and d5 supplies d7 the physiochemical parameters ph t ec tds and do and nutrients nitrites nitrates and ammonia were determined in the field according to the protocols proposed by the united states geological survey lehner et al 2006 usgs 2006 the samples were filtered 0 2 μm acidified 2 hno3 ultrapure and preserved until their analysis major elements ca k mg na ptotal stotal were measured using the icp oes technique in the nral natural resources analytical laboratory the renewable resources department of the university of alberta reference materials nist 1640a and sangamon 03 showed precisions between 88 103 and 91 120 and yttrium was used as an internal standard to correct the effects of the matrix samples trace elements as cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb sb se u v zn were measured using the icp ms technique in the swamp an ultraclean laboratory free of metals at the university of alberta canada reference materials sps sw2 elements in surface water and nist 1640a trace elements in natural waters showed precisions between 89 119 and 91 112 2 3 statistical analysis for the statistical analysis the experimental data were tested for significance by one way anova followed by duncan s test at 5 significance level p 0 05 using spss version 20 0 statistical analysis software since the rainfall in the zone is negligible circa 1 mm the results from both dry seasons a18 y a20 and both rainy seasons b18 y b19 were grouped hence in the cluster and correlation analyses we see them being represented as only one dry and one rainy season and for the principal component analysis all seasons were considered separate multiple correlation analysis in order to establish the degree of association between chemical elements that suggest their origin or possible sources in common or the chemical form likely to be found in the analyzed water a multiple correlation analysis was carried out by water sample type using spearman s correlation coefficients r 0 7 the fact that variables tend to increase or decrease together does not indicate that one has a direct or indirect effect on the other both may be influenced by other variables in such a way that a strong mathematical relationship arises interpretation depends mainly on the details of the investigation and one s own experience with the subject of study previous experience generally serves as a basis for comparison to determine whether a correlation coefficient is worth mentioning gauthier 2001 lettenmaier 1988 cluster analysis ca the ca is a group of multivariate techniques whose primary purpose is to group objects based on their characteristics hierarchical clustering is the most common approach it provides intuitive similarity relationships between any sample and the entire data set and is typically illustrated as a dendrogram tree diagram mckenna 2003 the purpose of applying the ca in this study was to find similarities and identify groupings of the study variables and the types of water in the site principal component analysis this analysis allows the variables to be grouped according to mutual correlations and their similarities the covariance matrix was diagonalized for this analysis and the characteristic roots eigenvalues were obtained in principle compositional analysis matrices were constructed and all values were calculated from the raw data principal component analysis pca was carried out using past326 b statistical software the transformed variables or principal components pc were obtained as weighted linear combinations of the original variables the data were fitted to a previously established component model for surface waters the use of this model can facilitate a direct comparison between d domestic waters n natural waters and h hydrothermal waters all parameters and concentrations for all water samples studied here were used for pca the pca plot produced different clusters suggesting that the samples could be classified in accordance to the origin of the water under the different environmental conditions 2 4 water quality index two water quality indexes were used the ccme wqi water quality index proposed by the canadian council of ministers of the environment and the el ccme wqi water quality index the latter suggests a consistent method to homogenize the information analysis on water quality for the administration and the public also it can be used by many water organizations in several countries by modifying it slightly khan et al 2004 lumb et al 2006 tyagi et al 2020 walker and gobas 1999 this index presents a calculating structure based on the time and space variation in the measured parameters and their comparison with the guide values for water quality it combines three variance factors scope f1 the number of parameters not meeting the quality guides frequency f2 the number of times these guides are not met and amplitude f3 the amount by which the guides are not met these three are joined to give a single value between 0 and 100 that describes water quality for these calculations the period chosen was based on the four seasons of sampling calculated separately the guidelines for drinking water taken into account are summarized in supplementary material 1 sm1 these limits are set by the world health organization who 2018 the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2018a b the mexican official norm for drinking water nom 127 ssa1 2021 ss 2022 the canadian guidelines for drinking water quality hc 2021 and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1994 a microsoft excel sheet was used as frame to the mathematical formulas to find the factors f1 f2 f3 as well as the value of the water quality index ccme wqi according to its equation 1 c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 where the divisor number 1 732 normalizes the values to a range between 0 and 100 based on the results of the index calculation water was classified as follows excellent 95 a 100 color blue water quality is protected with no virtual threats or danger condition levels are very close to natural or desired good 80 a 94 color cyan water quality is protected by some threats and a small margin of endangerment condition levels are rarely far from natural or desired favorable 60 a 79 color green water quality is usually protected but occasionally threatened or endangered condition levels are sometimes far from natural or desired regular 45 a 59 color brown water quality is frequently threatened or endangered condition levels are often far from natural or desired bad 0 a 44 color red water quality is almost always threatened or endangered condition levels are most typically far from natural or desired for the spatial distribution of elemental concentrations maps were constructed using the location allocation models in vector format with the software q gis 2 18 data were worked in a network that allows differentiation of factors that are interrelated by specific elements with the information obtained interpolations were continued through the weighted inverse distance method idw for the preparation of thematic maps 3 results local hydrology and rainfall analysis are here presented the results for water quality parameters were compared with the recommended limits established by the international organizations in addition the results from the statistical analysis are shown separately to comprehend the potential transportation and origin processes of the potentially toxic chemical elements in the site 3 1 local hydrology and rainfall the results of the local hydrology are shown in fig 3 a within the geothermal power plant there are three main streams of order 3 and only one of order 4 the rest of the surface streams are mostly of order 1 and 2 their flow direction is determined by the geomorphological variables of the area with some possible flood zones at the northeast and south of the federal electricity commission settlement there is a significant land use change such as the succession of forests to agriculture and cattle ranching the replacement of natural vegetation with pastureland has caused a change in the local hydrology of the region leading to increased evaporation of water from the soil alcocer durand et al 2004 the surface hydrological system is practically nonexistent because most of the basin s surface presents pyroclastic deposits of recent age that favor high infiltration can chulim et al 2011 therefore together with the fact that the rainy season has a very marked and brief seasonality there is no perennial surface runoff in the basin inegi 1984 therefore recharge and discharge processes are strongly controlled by vertical fractures and faults that lead to fluid movement only in the areas that are traversed by these structures and are not sealed due to mineral precipitation according to hydrological studies the geothermal reservoir is recharged by groundwater moving in a nw se direction within the permeable limestones of the sierra madre oriental and the citlaltepetl volcano from surface runoff infiltrating the subsurface in the lower parts of the mountain slopes during the rainy season cruickschank villanueva 1992 therefore recharge is assumed to be deeper than 500 m alcocer durand et al 2004 prol ledesma 1998 however the lack of permeability and the very low porosity and permeability of the overlying volcanic units inhibit recharge in the caldera complex contributing to the main reasons of non productivity of some geothermal wells jolie et al 2020 about the variability of rainfall in the study area fig 3b it is observed that it is very low with a maximum rainfall of 1 mm in the summer months june september with an average of 0 3 mm therefore for some statistical analysis the rainy and the dry seasons were evaluated together as described in the methodology 3 2 maximum permissible limits the seasonal parameters shown in above the maximum permissible limits mpl are in table 2 and graphs of these values are in supplementary material 3 sm3 hydrothermal waters h showed the highest ph values most domestic d and natural n waters are also above the mpl proposed by the who who 2018 and usepa usepa 2018a b which are between 6 5 and 8 5 the highest temperatures were found in hydrothermal waters h between 17 and 90 c and at n3 site anomalous temperatures of 74 c were measured these temperatures exceed the mpl 25 c electrical conductivity ec was higher in hydrothermal waters the mpl by usepa was exceeded at all sampling sites in at least one season except at sites d5 n5 and h5 even the h1 h2 and h3 sites exceeded the mpl proposed by the fao which is 3000 μs cm 1 making these waters a hazard for agricultural activities the elements that did not exceed the mpl of the international guidelines for drinking water were ca mg ptotal co ni pb u and zn the cd exceeds the mpl in all types of water only in the 2018 dry season in the case of cu and stotal it is observed that they only exceed the limits in the 2020 dry season and in the hydrothermal water sample h6 this indicates that their enrichment is due to geothermal activity within the area in the case of nitrites and nitrates it should be noted that nitrites are predominant in the three types of water which was not expected since this ion is usually only found for a short period of time under natural conditions keskin 2010 nitrates only exceeded the mpl in two hydrothermal sites h2 and h3 even though these elements are typically associated with agricultural processes or are present in wastewater in the area pastén zapata et al 2014 however because of the detected presence of nitrite nitrates were also expected as part of the natural biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen for major elements the ions that exceeded the mpl are k and na where na exceeded the mpl in all domestic and hydrothermal waters however in natural waters seasonal variability shows that it does not always exceed the mpl indicating possible precipitation processes in the case of k all types of waters exceeded the mpl considering its enrichment as regional because it is present in all sampled waters at higher concentrations than the mpl from the potentially toxic elements analyzed arsenic was above the mpl in all hydrothermal waters in at least one sampled season in domestic water site d7 was the only one above the mpl however d5 corresponds to a well that is the supplier of d7 and it was not above the mpl of as in any season this suggests that during transportation water was enriched with as another element that exceeded the mpl was cr in domestic waters in the rainy season of 2019 at sites d3 and d7 and in the h6 hydrothermal site in the 2020 dry season iron did not exceed the mpl in domestic waters but it did in two natural water sites n2 and n3 as well as in hydrothermal waters h3 and h6 the mpl were only exceeded for mn at the d7 n2 h3 h4 and h6 sites usually these two elements together with s are associated with pyrite minerals and sometimes enriched or associated with as at particular conditions of ph and redox potential karimian et al 2018 however just looking at the concentrations this correlation is not expected all these changes might be evidence of the fast dynamic change that the site is subjected to likely due to the nature of the geothermal resource and the geothermal power plant higher concentrations than the mpl of v are present in some samples of domestic d1 d4 and d6 hydrothermal h1 and h2 and natural origin n1 waters which can be consider an indicator of a regional enrichment since it is present in all three types of water in contrast it is observed that sb and se exceed the mpl only in waters of hydrothermal origin so they are elements that can be used as tracers of this type of water in the region sulphur generally identified as of hydrothermal origin loukola ruskeeniemi 1991 was detected in concentrations higher than the mpl only at the h6 site defining this element as characteristic of this site 3 3 correlation analysis table 3 shows the correlations between chemical elements and physiochemical parameters considering a correlation of more than 0 7 this analysis provided valuable information about the possible origin of the pte and the changes caused by seasonality between the sampling periods and water types suggesting a continuous dynamic process in the chemical changes of water chemistry in the area the hydrothermal water has a particular fingerprint with the correlation of fe and mn that are related to redox reactions together with trace elements as ni co as cr pb cu se sb u and zn correlated with the major ion mg these correlations can be perceived also in natural and domestic waters red frames in table 3 however as seen before in domestic waters these elements are barely above the maximum permissible limits recommended by international organizations table 2 these elements can be considered characteristic of the natural hydrothermal activity of the site since they are present in all three types of water for hydrothermal waters it is also important to mention the high correlation between ph t na and ec similarly with the correlation in domestic waters with ec ph t that suggests that those parameters are leading the water chemistry in the case of domestic water it is observed that there is a positive correlation between the following elements and parameters s p cd p s sb s p s na ce cd mg v s se na k no3 ph likewise it occurs in natural waters cd p s s p cd s as mg and s ca but not in hydrothermal waters green frames in table 3 those elements are normally associated with the use of fertilizers enriched mainly with n s p and mg with some traces of as se na etc de oliveira souza et al 2014 glaser et al 2015 which could be associated to a mismanagement of pesticides or agrochemicals used in the site therefore these elements can be considered of anthropogenic origin there are other groups of correlated elements that are considered to be major ions or nutrients for living organisms blue frames in table 3 and those are mg k ca na and no3 these elements are correlated in all the water types indicating the possibility of mineral dissolution and or the mixture between recently infiltrated waters and old waters finally a correlation between u se na k and s in domestic waters as well as u na in natural waters in both seasons that is not seen in hydrothermal waters suggests another kind of chemical processes different from the natural hydrothermal activity of the site although these elements have been previously reported as enriched in volcanic areas tomašek et al 2022 similarly we see the correlation of vanadium between v na t u in domestic waters and v ca na u dry season v na u rainy season in natural waters that in hydrothermal waters is correlated with na sb dry season and t k rainy season therefore it would be worthwhile to study these elements in detail to understand their behavior in the site based on this it is also recommended to study the chemistry of co in the hydrothermal system that it is correlated with most of the elements in all three kind of waters 3 4 water quality index fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the water quality indices in each sampling season two dry and two rainy showing the region s dynamics when presenting temporal changes in its quality although as expected waters of geothermal origin are not suitable for human use and consumption which is why they remain of poor quality in most seasons except for h3 in the 2018 rainy season which went from poor to regular in the case of domestic and natural waters their quality changes from good to feasible even to regular in the 2018 rainy season in addition only in the 2018 dry season is the domestic water well d3 identified as poor quality which goes from good to regular in the other seasons this index points out that the hydrothermal waters may have some influence on the domestic water quality of the sampled wells and a stronger influence on the natural waters quality governed mainly by the hydrothermal nature of the region however the domestic water site d1 stands out because despite being surrounded by geothermal wells it maintains a favorable quality in three of the four seasons analyzed suggesting that it comes from recently infiltrated water that is stored in a shallow aquifer 3 5 cluster analysis the cluster analysis shows groups of similarities between the control factors the primary and secondary factorial loads characterize the variation of the data set in both the dry and rainy seasons fig 4 these factors had load scores greater than 0 5 from clustering found in the dry season site h6 is the one that has the most significant influence on the water chemistry from the rest of the waters in the area clustering geothermal waters in the second and third levels later to natural n3 and domestic d3 the other sublevels clustered the remaining domestic and natural waters for the rainy season a similarity and dominance of hydrothermal waters h4 and h5 was observed over the clustering of hydrothermal waters h1 and h2 together with natural water n3 and domestic water d1 successively they clustered between natural and domestic waters the clustering of the natural water site n3 with the waters of geothermal origin h is probably because this site is close to a geothermal well and presented an anomalous temperature of around 74 c 3 6 principal component analysis knowing the water quality status of the entire watershed is a complicated process so determining the factors influencing water quality is of great relevance to this work to study the influence of each water quality parameter and reduce the data set eigenvalues were calculated by the principal component analysis pca and the results are shown in fig 5 the analysis defined three groups that contributed to the correlations between analyzed parameters group 1 showed a strong negative correlation with the principal component 1 pc1 distinguished by the grouping of most of the domestic and natural waters from all seasons only h2 rainy season 2019 and h3 rainy season 2018 were associated with these waters group 2 showed a negative correlation with pc2 of four hydrothermal waters h2b h1b h5b and h6c this group of waters is not related with other kind of waters in the region as shown in the cluster analysis h6c and h5b resulted to be the most influential sites in the water chemistry of the zone which is in agreement with this grouping group 3 showed a strong positive correlation with pc1 characterized by six hydrothermal waters from the central zone of los humeros geothermal power plant in addition the waters with negative correlation with pc1 were one hydrothermal water h3 and two domestic waters d1 that is located in the central zone as the hydrothermal waters and d3 that is in the southeast in the maxtaloya community in this group the natural water n3 presented an anomalous temperature of 74 c and it is located in the central zone as well this analysis proposes significant differences in the composition of the analyzed physicochemical parameters of water with a major influence in hydrothermal water chemistry in the central zone of the geothermal power plant 4 discussion in the case of the geothermal reservoir in los humeros and based on geochemical and production data that allowed obtaining pressure and temperature profiles for the unperturbed geothermal fluids two geothermal reservoirs have been proposed one upper reservoir composed of dominant liquid with hydrostatic pressure profile and another lower reservoir composed of dominant steam with steam static pressure profile arellano et al 2003 barragán et al 1991 cedillo rodríguez 2000 proposed that a low permeability vitreous tuff layer acts as an aquitard separating both reservoirs preventing them from mixing with the waters of the shallow aquifer however the recharge of the water tables present in los humeros basins allows groundwater to flow into deeper strata through secondary permeability faults and fractures therefore hydraulic changes may have occurred in the hydraulic fractures due to the exploitation of the most superficial geothermal reservoir causing the recharge of aquifer water by regional meteoric water and magmatic water forming an extensive aquifer mantle as suggested by baysal and gunduz 2016 and goodsell et al 2017 these waters belong to the periods of orogenic modification and have taken the chemical composition of the low solubility volcanic rocks with which they interact can chulim et al 2011 therefore according to the previously mentioned the groundwater recharge and discharge zones can be located at different elevations and lithological reliefs the discharge zones occur in the topographically lower sector while the discharge is always attested such movement is supported by the chemical evolution of natural water flowing streams rivers so groundwater s chemical composition evolves from recharge to discharge tóth 1999 the analyses of maximum permissible limits spearman s correlation and water quality index have shown the presence of potentially toxic elements from geothermal origin in domestic and natural waters in domestic waters only cd might be from geothermal origin that is above the mpl but just 1 14 μg l 1 above the limit of 3 μg l 1 recommended by the who 2018 although cd was mainly correlated with mg s and p that are elements associated with fertilizers de oliveira souza et al 2014 therefore its geothermal origin is questionable the ph is probably one of the most important variables that influence the interaction of the behavior of chemical elements in the environment such as the hardness of water mainly carbonates and organic compounds hem 1989 based on the ph values 96 of water sampled in the rainy season displays values between 6 0 and 8 5 whereas 86 of samples dry season exhibited values from 5 89 to 8 9 these values show that some sites are more acidic 5 6 5 than those that are neutral to alkaline the concentrations of major elements over the mpl only found in hydrothermal waters were stotal cu sb and se these is in agreement to what it has been reported before in hydrothermal areas bundschuh et al 2020 maity et al 2017 ormachea muñoz et al 2015 for as it was mainly hydrothermal except for a domestic d7 that was identified to be of anthropogenic origin since it is present in the piped water and not in the well water the major element over the mpl in all types of water was k the elements found in the thermal and surface waters showed that the alkaline spring waters of the hydrothermal zone show higher amounts of as fe mn sb se and v compared to natural spring waters from the same sites during the rainy season numerous arsenic compounds are soluble in water and have been found in other water bodies of the world nimick et al 1998 especially in the form of as3 and as5 and organic complexes nriagu et al 2007 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however the high temperatures of leaching from the rock explain the high as concentrations in many hydrothermal fluids maity et al 2017 tapia et al 2022 in groundwater from los humeros it could be mainly associated with the ascending fluids of deep hydrothermal system the same condition has been previously proposed by angelone et al 2009 who found evidence of the mixing between deep groundwater and water recharged by infiltration into the volcanic aquifer indicating that hydrothermal zones and shallow underlying faults in the aquifer represent lower drinking water quality same phenomena has been recently reported by another geothermal reservoir in india shukla et al 2022 the presence of toxic elements such as as and sb in surface and groundwater is worrisome koch et al 1999 in los humeros geothermal area most of the hydrothermal sampled sites had as concentrations significantly higher than 10 μg l 1 guideline established by the world health organization who 2018 and sb concentrations exceeding the usepa limit of 6 μg l 1 usepa 2018a b the only site destined for drinking water exceeding the as concentration limit was the domestic water in the house d7 from the well s manager d5 in el valle where the water might be transported with materials such as asbestos enriching the drinking water with as in the case of sb none of the drinking water sources presented this element in higher concentrations than the mentioned guidelines this can be attributed to the mobility of the as that has been reported to be higher than de sb in hydrothermal fluids tapia et al 2022a the correlation of na ca2 and mg2 indicates the dissolution of minerals from the evaporite which are indicators of dry events salinity and evaporation in addition to caco3 as a primary or secondary phase and it can easily explain the high conductivities previous works have demonstrated the presence of minerals such as stibilite mordenite na smectite and calcite in the lithological zone i maximum 1010 m depth gonzález partida et al 2022 this can explain the strong correlations between these elements in the domestic waters and suggest infiltration in deeper strata since those elements were also correlated in hydrothermal waters and only calcite is still present in the geothermal reservoir lithological zone iii max 2600 m depth in the mg hco3 group mg replaced ca highlighting the role of the mg bearing phases during the water rock interaction in accordance with previous studies carried out in rock areas bompoti et al 2015 ormachea muñoz et al 2016 this could explain the correlation of mg with several other elements in the three water types it was unexpected to find correlations between elements that are mostly related with agrochemicals since the region has not a heavy agricultural activity nevertheless this impact in water chemistry was also identified in natural waters and absent in hydrothermal waters reaffirming the result that it is of anthropogenic effect this phenomena can be attributed to the periods of prolonged droughts and the possible acidification of the scarce rainfall of the site promoting with first flushes that soil salts dissolve rapidly and are carried to surface waters kennedy and malcolm 1977 walling and foster 1975 that later on infiltrate in the shallow aquifer in areas not influenced by hydrothermal activity the hierarchical cluster analysis grouped 22 samples into four clusters for the dry season based on similarities in the physicochemical characteristics of the water site h6 was the most influential site recalling this site h6 was the only one that exceeded the mpl for s and cu then this analysis grouped 27 samples into five clusters for the rainy season and the hydrothermal waters h4 and h5 were the most influential in the site these analyses suggest an influence of the hydrothermal waters in the rest of the sampled waters this result is in total agreement with the principal component analysis water quality index and spearman s correlation analysis finally there is a concept named medical geology proposed by bundschuh et al 2017 that considers the exposure to geogenic contaminants that could negatively impact the environment and human health their methodology could be a good choice to apply in this site since there are interdisciplinary information that could be integrated to improve the monitoring as well as know the bioavailability and bioaccesibility of the potentially toxic elements and their impact in the environment and human health following their biogeochemical cycle 5 conclusions this research demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical methods as an efficient screening tool for the analysis of complex sets of water chemistry data establishing key factors and mechanisms to determine water quality the analysis of correlation coefficients between different variables separated by types of water is crucial and opens new boundaries of experience thus reducing the level of ambiguity in data interpretation the analysis of maximum detection limits was the only statistical method that allowed us to identify the anthropogenic as presence in the pumped water of el valle the fingerprint of the hydrothermal fluids is governed by the presence of as cu s sb and se elements such as cd na k and v were identified as regionally enriched in all type of waters possibly due to the geological nature of the site the water quality index wqi values reveal that the water quality is excellent in some of the sampled areas however these results should also consider microbiological and organic analysis in order to fulfill the national guideline for drinking water this result is limited to the inorganic chemistry and the data here analyzed although no direct influence from the geothermal activity was identified in the water quality of the domestic or natural waters some correlations show the influence of hydrothermal water chemistry in those waters as well as the possibility of fast changes in water chemistry unrelated to the rainfall the correlation between potentially toxic elements of agrochemical origin was identified as a controlling factor in the water chemistry of the domestic and natural waters indicating an anthropogenic impact in addition to the natural impact of hydrothermalism the results of the multivariate statistical analysis of the hydrochemical data discriminate different types of water and geochemical processes related to physiography and geology mainly influenced by the geothermal fluids from the deep reservoir all results suggest that the main origin of the potentially toxic elements is natural due to that parental rock interaction and tectonic structures play an important role in the chemical composition of the groundwater in los humeros basins together with the influence on the direct and indirect infiltration of rainwater into the caldera consequently in the highland areas the interaction between water and rock is restricted by geological structures so much of the surface water that is shortly stored in that area infiltrates through fault zones and joints due to these hydraulic connections the water discharge flow is directed to the deepest parts that reach the shallow water recharge zone within the endorheic los humeros basin therefore a regional recharge is possible but the geology of the zone which is constituted by granitic rocks and limestone will be hampered by the arrangement the results obtained from the different samples gathered during both seasons show that most of the groundwater is directly related to the local recharge of the libres oriental basin and to rainfall from the vicinities however it was observed that part of the groundwater is probably mixed with fluids from the geothermal reservoir in the study area these hydrochemical changes can be associated with geochemical reactions involving ion exchange throughout the flow direction allowing a strong rock water interaction the observations made in this study reveal that water quality is strongly influenced by the regional characteristics and the natural hydrothermal activity of the zone however no permanent negative effect on the domestic water quality has been detected nevertheless

11711,identifying sources of potentially toxic elements pte in groundwater in los humeros geothermal power plant puebla mexico a site with more than 20 years of electricity generation history through geothermal resources is a great challenge especially when human activities are taking place within the geothermal power plant through the analysis and differentiation of three types of water domestic natural and hydrothermal this study aimed to track potentially toxic elements in surface and groundwaters analyzed from statistical standpoints to understand their potential transportation processes and determine their natural or anthropogenic origin as a result the hydrothermal waters were the most enriched as 23 112 μg l 1 cu 737 μg l 1 s 571 mg l 1 sb 117 μg l 1 and se 47 8 μg l 1 and therefore found to be the major influence of potentially toxic elements in the water chemistry of the region in addition the domestic waters were found to be transitional having moderate concentrations as 44 2 μg l 1 cd 4 14 μg l 1 cr 10 5 μg l 1 na 71 4 mg l 1 k 15 2 mg l 1 and v 36 4 μg l 1 finally the natural waters had the lowest concentrations of most elements except for na cd 4 04 μg l 1 na 76 5 mg l 1 cr 2 29 μg l 1 k 12 mg l 1 and v 30 2 μg l 1 furthermore the sampling in two seasons and two years suggest that dynamic processes are taking place in the site since no clear correlation was found between seasonal data the main transport processes for the pte might be the water rock interaction tectonic and structural geology and the influence on the direct and indirect rainwater infiltration into the caldera graphical abstract image 1 keywords domestic natural hydrothermal statistics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally in our current times maintaining the quality of superficial and groundwater is a great challenge the constant increase in the concentration of potentially toxic chemical elements pte in water bodies due to natural and or anthropogenic causes has created limitations in addition overexploitation to satisfy the growing water demand followed by the decrease in annual recharge in some parts of the world makes the problem even more challenging and unsustainable the hydrochemistry within a region is determined by natural processes such as atmospheric depositions precipitations evapotranspiration water rock soil interactions and anthropogenic activities singh 2015 sinha et al 2014 hydrochemistry is usually associated with variations in precipitation surface runoff trench and stream discharge vadose zone leaching groundwater filtration and the interception and capacity of rain discharge álvarez cabria et al 2016 olson and hawkins 2012 pejman et al 2009 vega et al 1998 the natural hydrothermal alteration also changes water chemistry through the mineralization of host rocks by increasing the temperature pressure and chemistry of fluids interacting with the rock martínez serrano 2002 pirajno 2009 therefore it is imperative to evaluate and determine the chemical composition and characteristics of superficial and groundwater quality as these can all vary according to several factors zare garizi et al 2011 in several geothermal areas worldwide high concentrations of certain potentially toxic chemical elements have been identified especially in geothermal fluids which are controlled by their balance with minerals that are part of the rocks in the deep aquifer known as a geothermal reservoir arnórsson et al 2006 this is where the importance of the rock water interactions comes from furthermore while geothermal fluids and minerals behave differently depending on their origin and characteristics some secondary minerals can be dissolved and release potentially toxic elements under certain conditions liou et al 1985 sengupta et al 2014 making them more difficult to trace and differentiate from their source it is well known that ph is one of the most important parameters that controls the concentration and chemical form of inorganic and organic dissolved elements and compounds i e soils enriched with organic matter can have ph values as low as 4 whereas waters in contact with shale bedrock or iron sulfide minerals can have a lower ph in contrast reactions between carbonate strata and groundwater typically have ph values of 8 5 temperature and dissolved gases affect the ph in groundwater e g the ph of neutral water is 7 at 25 c and 7 48 at 0 c hem 1989 the application of multivariate statistic techniques has shown its usefulness in interpreting the complex data matrixes to evaluate seasonal water quality and processes that affect the geochemistry of groundwater the advantage of using these techniques is the reduction of complex data sets to significant factors without any loss of information this reveals hidden relationships between variables and as a consequence offers a better understanding of water quality and possible sources affecting the system singh et al 2004 this study aims to track potentially toxic chemical elements in surface and groundwaters of natural geothermal originated and domestic types in the geothermal power plant of los humeros puebla mexico these numbers are deduced from statistical standpoints to understand the potential transportation processes of these chemicals and if they are of natural or anthropogenic nature 1 1 study area the study area corresponds to the geothermal power plant of los humeros found 280 km east of mexico city on the eastern sector of the trans mexican volcanic belt in the state of puebla it is found in the valley portion of the libres oriental basin which is part of the volcanic complex inside the surrounding area of los humeros caldera fig 1 the first deep well was drilled in 1982 and the commercial operations of the geothermal power plant began in 1990 when the 5 mw unit was installed arellano et al 2003 fifty wells as deep as 2800 m have been drilled within this field from which 25 wells are in production 17 are closed and 4 are injection wells another 4 are being evaluated and 8 are still in the evaluation process carrasco núñez et al 2017 gonzález partida et al 2001 lópez romero 2006 before the power plant was installed the inhabitants that lived there discussed the matter with the developer federal commission of electricity and agreed to support the progress only if they could stay on their land therefore the power plant has been developed around the inhabitant s settlements these settlements are made up mainly by three communities el valle los humeros and maxtaloya 1 2 geology los humeros caldera is located in a region with important geological provinces beginning with the teziutlán massif the sierra madre oriental smo and the trans mexican volcanic belt fig 2 its geology has been described by various authors arellano et al 2003 carrasco nuñez et al 2017 ferrari et al 2012 norini et al 2019 in summary this zone is characterized by a thick sequence of miocene andesites dacites and basaltic flows from the cuyoaco and alseseca andesite unit yáñez garcía and garcía durán 1982 and pliocene to pleistocene basaltic to andesitic lavas belonging to the teziutlán andesitic unit the miocene lavas are approximately 900 m thick and the teziutlán andesitic lavas are up to 1500 m thick lópez hernández 1995 both units are classified as andesitic and basaltic volcanic basement and form the currently exploited reservoir in the subsurface of los humeros geothermal power plant carrasco núñez et al 2018 the origin of los humeros caldera was due to several volcanic eruptions and the repeated collapse of the magmatic chamber subsequently three volcanic cycles took place from the pliocene to the holocene presenting three caldera structures los humeros los potreros and the xalapasco these formed in the different volcanic events that occurred in the site campos enríquez et al 2005 campos enriquez and arredondo fragoso 1992 cavazos and carrasco núñez 2020 the post caldera stage consists of rhyolitic and dacitic domes within the caldera center and basaltic to trachyandesitic basaltic to trachyandesitic lava flows volcaniclastic breccias and deposits with a highly variable lateral and vertical distribution carrasco nuñez et al 2017 carrasco núñez et al 2018 1 3 climate according to the climate classification system of köppen modified by garcía 1964 to represent the climatic diversity of mexico as well as the map and data of climate units from inegi national institute of statistics and geography and conagua national commission of water the study area corresponds to the following climates 1 temperate humid a climate with abundant rain in summer with a percentage greater than 5 in winter 2 template sub humid a climate with rain in summer and a percentage lower than 5 in winter 3 semi cold sub humid a climate with rain in summer and a percentage lower than 5 in winter 4 cold a climate where the temperature of the coldest month is lower than 0 c according to the latitude of the basin the type of climate should be subtropical but its orography and its perpendicular position to the dominant airflow modify it in addition the trade winds have a strong influence on its climate and the gulf of mexico represents a temperature and humidity regulator for the basin given its proximity alcocer durand et al 2004 the average temperature in the study area during the last ten years has fluctuated between 7 and 16 c with maximum rainfall of 1 mm between may and september with an annual rainfall average of 0 3 mm conagua 2020 1 4 hydrology and hydrogeology according to inegi and inecol national institute of ecology 2005 the study area is located at the northern border of the libres oriental endorheic basin northeast of the atoyac river basin belonging to the hydrologic administrative iv balsas region which corresponds to the hydrological region number 18 sharing borders north with hueyapan and teziutlan east with atempan and tlatlauquitepec south with cuyoaco and tepeyahualco and west with xiutetelco and teziutlan three hydrological regions are located at the study area hydrological region balsas hydrological region north of veracruz tuxpan nautla rh 27 and hydrological region papaloapan rh 28 the superficial hydrologic system is practically non existent because most of the basin s surface shows pyroclastic deposits of recent age that favor high infiltration in addition because the rainy season has a specific and short seasonality there are no superficial perennial runoffs in the watershed inegi 1984 there are no well defined channels inside the hydrologic network of the los humeros area instead there are marshes and ephemeral ponds in the rainy season and moderate streams that disappear in the dry season therefore water usage greatly depends on groundwater can chulim et al 2011 the aquifer is limited by the los humeros caldera to the north which has high permeability due to the pyroclastic materials that form it while to the northwest is the sierra tlaxco where there is a mountainous alignment of andesites and tuffs to the south is the sierra soltepec which is a calcareous structure strongly folded and shallow finally in the center there are extensive plains of lacustrine origin the area has strong evaporation rates so the intensive extraction of groundwater and the alteration of natural geohydrological outlets cause the water table to drop conagua 2020 2015 cedillo rodríguez 2000 presented a preliminary study of shallow water recharge within the closed basin of los humeros caldera delimited by the topography the high permeability of the soils and the large extension of the libres oriental aquifer together with the moderate rate of abatement meant that during years of extraordinary rainfall the aquifer had important recoveries that were concentrated in the lacustrine zones arredondo figueroa et al 1985 however some studies have reflected the drastic decrease in the surface water resources alcocer durand et al 2004 alcocer et al 1998 verma et al 2000 conducted a study to measure the isotopic composition of rainwater at seven regional stations to define the local meteoric water line lmwl it is likely that in the northern portion of the area faults and fractures the los humeros caldera and other structures control the flow leading to the deeper geothermal fluids to rise cigna et al 2019 the domestic wells are between 200 and 300 m deep which is abnormal for domestic wells they generally are shallower in most places huízar álvarez et al 2001 the wells have been monitored for years not showing any evidence of geothermal water mixtures gonzález partida et al 2022 portugal et al 2002 however no studies conducted on the site differentiate the geochemical fingerprint of geothermal fluids in natural waters from the local and domestic waters 2 materials and methods in order to comprehend the groundwater data a local hydrological analysis of precipitation was done at the same time the concentration of potentially toxic chemical elements as cd co cu mn ni pb u v y zn was compared with the international guidelines of drinking water quality within three different types of water domestic natural and hydrothermal in addition in a statistical analysis of physiochemical parameters major and trace elements were correlated to evaluate their mobility and stability in water the areas with more significant variability in water quality were identified in order to understand the potential transportation processes among different types of water 2 1 local hydrology and rainfall the method of inverse distance weighted idw was used together with the universal transversal mercator projection utm zone 14 ellipsoid and horizontal datum world geodetic system wgs84 with information from conabio national commission for knowledge and use of biodiversity and inegi national institute of statistics and geography to create specialized maps the methodology proposed by wang and liu 2006 was used to fill in the depressions in the calculations of runoff drainage in the basins the data from the national weather service smn was used to create the precipitation graph the smn is the organization that provides climate information nationwide in mexico through the climate monitoring network of smn and the national commission of water conagua smn can where 5420 climate stations are shown however temporal series often show incomplete data or show only less than 20 years of information therefore it was necessary to link data from different climate stations reported by the world meteorological organization wmo 2011 which has an influence on every climate station in a 5 km radius from this the collected data came from zones near the area of interest such as chignautla cuyoaco francisco i madero and maxtaloya as well as historical data from meteoblue this last one calculates and predicts meteorological data using its process based on the non hydrostatic mesoscale model nmm with a resolution of approximately 30 km from the los humeros area monthly seasonal and annual precipitation data were used 2 2 sampling and analysis the water samples were taken thrice from each site during four seasons dry 2018 and rainy 2018 dry 2020 and rainy 2019 as seen in table 1 it is important to mention that not all water sites were available for sampling during the four seasons in the case of groundwater the depth of the well was registered as for natural there are some natural springs and the rest of the waters are superficial due to natural or anthropogenic deposits in domestic waters there is a relationship between them for example d2 supplies d3 d4 supplies d1 and d5 supplies d7 the physiochemical parameters ph t ec tds and do and nutrients nitrites nitrates and ammonia were determined in the field according to the protocols proposed by the united states geological survey lehner et al 2006 usgs 2006 the samples were filtered 0 2 μm acidified 2 hno3 ultrapure and preserved until their analysis major elements ca k mg na ptotal stotal were measured using the icp oes technique in the nral natural resources analytical laboratory the renewable resources department of the university of alberta reference materials nist 1640a and sangamon 03 showed precisions between 88 103 and 91 120 and yttrium was used as an internal standard to correct the effects of the matrix samples trace elements as cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb sb se u v zn were measured using the icp ms technique in the swamp an ultraclean laboratory free of metals at the university of alberta canada reference materials sps sw2 elements in surface water and nist 1640a trace elements in natural waters showed precisions between 89 119 and 91 112 2 3 statistical analysis for the statistical analysis the experimental data were tested for significance by one way anova followed by duncan s test at 5 significance level p 0 05 using spss version 20 0 statistical analysis software since the rainfall in the zone is negligible circa 1 mm the results from both dry seasons a18 y a20 and both rainy seasons b18 y b19 were grouped hence in the cluster and correlation analyses we see them being represented as only one dry and one rainy season and for the principal component analysis all seasons were considered separate multiple correlation analysis in order to establish the degree of association between chemical elements that suggest their origin or possible sources in common or the chemical form likely to be found in the analyzed water a multiple correlation analysis was carried out by water sample type using spearman s correlation coefficients r 0 7 the fact that variables tend to increase or decrease together does not indicate that one has a direct or indirect effect on the other both may be influenced by other variables in such a way that a strong mathematical relationship arises interpretation depends mainly on the details of the investigation and one s own experience with the subject of study previous experience generally serves as a basis for comparison to determine whether a correlation coefficient is worth mentioning gauthier 2001 lettenmaier 1988 cluster analysis ca the ca is a group of multivariate techniques whose primary purpose is to group objects based on their characteristics hierarchical clustering is the most common approach it provides intuitive similarity relationships between any sample and the entire data set and is typically illustrated as a dendrogram tree diagram mckenna 2003 the purpose of applying the ca in this study was to find similarities and identify groupings of the study variables and the types of water in the site principal component analysis this analysis allows the variables to be grouped according to mutual correlations and their similarities the covariance matrix was diagonalized for this analysis and the characteristic roots eigenvalues were obtained in principle compositional analysis matrices were constructed and all values were calculated from the raw data principal component analysis pca was carried out using past326 b statistical software the transformed variables or principal components pc were obtained as weighted linear combinations of the original variables the data were fitted to a previously established component model for surface waters the use of this model can facilitate a direct comparison between d domestic waters n natural waters and h hydrothermal waters all parameters and concentrations for all water samples studied here were used for pca the pca plot produced different clusters suggesting that the samples could be classified in accordance to the origin of the water under the different environmental conditions 2 4 water quality index two water quality indexes were used the ccme wqi water quality index proposed by the canadian council of ministers of the environment and the el ccme wqi water quality index the latter suggests a consistent method to homogenize the information analysis on water quality for the administration and the public also it can be used by many water organizations in several countries by modifying it slightly khan et al 2004 lumb et al 2006 tyagi et al 2020 walker and gobas 1999 this index presents a calculating structure based on the time and space variation in the measured parameters and their comparison with the guide values for water quality it combines three variance factors scope f1 the number of parameters not meeting the quality guides frequency f2 the number of times these guides are not met and amplitude f3 the amount by which the guides are not met these three are joined to give a single value between 0 and 100 that describes water quality for these calculations the period chosen was based on the four seasons of sampling calculated separately the guidelines for drinking water taken into account are summarized in supplementary material 1 sm1 these limits are set by the world health organization who 2018 the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2018a b the mexican official norm for drinking water nom 127 ssa1 2021 ss 2022 the canadian guidelines for drinking water quality hc 2021 and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1994 a microsoft excel sheet was used as frame to the mathematical formulas to find the factors f1 f2 f3 as well as the value of the water quality index ccme wqi according to its equation 1 c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 where the divisor number 1 732 normalizes the values to a range between 0 and 100 based on the results of the index calculation water was classified as follows excellent 95 a 100 color blue water quality is protected with no virtual threats or danger condition levels are very close to natural or desired good 80 a 94 color cyan water quality is protected by some threats and a small margin of

quality is almost always threatened or endangered condition levels are most typically far from natural or desired for the spatial distribution of elemental concentrations maps were constructed using the location allocation models in vector format with the software q gis 2 18 data were worked in a network that allows differentiation of factors that are interrelated by specific elements with the information obtained interpolations were continued through the weighted inverse distance method idw for the preparation of thematic maps 3 results local hydrology and rainfall analysis are here presented the results for water quality parameters were compared with the recommended limits established by the international organizations in addition the results from the statistical analysis are shown separately to comprehend the potential transportation and origin processes of the potentially toxic chemical elements in the site 3 1 local hydrology and rainfall the results of the local hydrology are shown in fig 3 a within the geothermal power plant there are three main streams of order 3 and only one of order 4 the rest of the surface streams are mostly of order 1 and 2 their flow direction is determined by the geomorphological variables of the area with some possible flood zones at the northeast and south of the federal electricity commission settlement there is a significant land use change such as the succession of forests to agriculture and cattle ranching the replacement of natural vegetation with pastureland has caused a change in the local hydrology of the region leading to increased evaporation of water from the soil alcocer durand et al 2004 the surface hydrological system is practically nonexistent because most of the basin s surface presents pyroclastic deposits of recent age that favor high infiltration can chulim et al 2011 therefore together with the fact that the rainy season has a very marked and brief seasonality there is no perennial surface runoff in the basin inegi 1984 therefore recharge and discharge processes are strongly controlled by vertical fractures and faults that lead to fluid movement only in the areas that are traversed by these structures and are not sealed due to mineral precipitation according to hydrological studies the geothermal reservoir is recharged by groundwater moving in a nw se direction within the permeable limestones of the sierra madre oriental and the citlaltepetl volcano from surface runoff infiltrating the subsurface in the lower parts of the mountain slopes during the rainy season cruickschank villanueva 1992 therefore recharge is assumed to be deeper than 500 m alcocer durand et al 2004 prol ledesma 1998 however the lack of permeability and the very low porosity and permeability of the overlying volcanic units inhibit recharge in the caldera complex contributing to the main reasons of non productivity of some geothermal wells jolie et al 2020 about the variability of rainfall in the study area fig 3b it is observed that it is very low with a maximum rainfall of 1 mm in the summer months june september with an average of 0 3 mm therefore for some statistical analysis the rainy and the dry seasons were evaluated together as described in the methodology 3 2 maximum permissible limits the seasonal parameters shown in above the maximum permissible limits mpl are in table 2 and graphs of these values are in supplementary material 3 sm3 hydrothermal waters h showed the highest ph values most domestic d and natural n waters are also above the mpl proposed by the who who 2018 and usepa usepa 2018a b which are between 6 5 and 8 5 the highest temperatures were found in hydrothermal waters h between 17 and 90 c and at n3 site anomalous temperatures of 74 c were measured these temperatures exceed the mpl 25 c electrical conductivity ec was higher in hydrothermal waters the mpl by usepa was exceeded at all sampling sites in at least one season except at sites d5 n5 and h5 even the h1 h2 and h3 sites exceeded the mpl proposed by the fao which is 3000 μs cm 1 making these waters a hazard for agricultural activities the elements that did not exceed the mpl of the international guidelines for drinking water were ca mg ptotal co ni pb u and zn the cd exceeds the mpl in all types of water only in the 2018 dry season in the case of cu and stotal it is observed that they only exceed the limits in the 2020 dry season and in the hydrothermal water sample h6 this indicates that their enrichment is due to geothermal activity within the area in the case of nitrites and nitrates it should be noted that nitrites are predominant in the three types of water which was not expected since this ion is usually only found for a short period of time under natural conditions keskin 2010 nitrates only exceeded the mpl in two hydrothermal sites h2 and h3 even though these elements are typically associated with agricultural processes or are present in wastewater in the area pastén zapata et al 2014 however because of the detected presence of nitrite nitrates were also expected as part of the natural biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen for major elements the ions that exceeded the mpl are k and na where na exceeded the mpl in all domestic and hydrothermal waters however in natural waters seasonal variability shows that it does not always exceed the mpl indicating possible precipitation processes in the case of k all types of waters exceeded the mpl considering its enrichment as regional because it is present in all sampled waters at higher concentrations than the mpl from the potentially toxic elements analyzed arsenic was above the mpl in all hydrothermal waters in at least one sampled season in domestic water site d7 was the only one above the mpl however d5 corresponds to a well that is the supplier of d7 and it was not above the mpl of as in any season this suggests that during transportation water was enriched with as another element that exceeded the mpl was cr in domestic waters in the rainy season of 2019 at sites d3 and d7 and in the h6 hydrothermal site in the 2020 dry season iron did not exceed the mpl in domestic waters but it did in two natural water sites n2 and n3 as well as in hydrothermal waters h3 and h6 the mpl were only exceeded for mn at the d7 n2 h3 h4 and h6 sites usually these two elements together with s are associated with pyrite minerals and sometimes enriched or associated with as at particular conditions of ph and redox potential karimian et al 2018 however just looking at the concentrations this correlation is not expected all these changes might be evidence of the fast dynamic change that the site is subjected to likely due to the nature of the geothermal resource and the geothermal power plant higher concentrations than the mpl of v are present in some samples of domestic d1 d4 and d6 hydrothermal h1 and h2 and natural origin n1 waters which can be consider an indicator of a regional enrichment since it is present in all three types of water in contrast it is observed that sb and se exceed the mpl only in waters of hydrothermal origin so they are elements that can be used as tracers of this type of water in the region sulphur generally identified as of hydrothermal origin loukola ruskeeniemi 1991 was detected in concentrations higher than the mpl only at the h6 site defining this element as characteristic of this site 3 3 correlation analysis table 3 shows the correlations between chemical elements and physiochemical parameters considering a correlation of more than 0 7 this analysis provided valuable information about the possible origin of the pte and the changes caused by seasonality between the sampling periods and water types suggesting a continuous dynamic process in the chemical changes of water chemistry in the area the hydrothermal water has a particular fingerprint with the correlation of fe and mn that are related to redox reactions together with trace elements as ni co as cr pb cu se sb u and zn correlated with the major ion mg these correlations can be perceived also in natural and domestic waters red frames in table 3 however as seen before in domestic waters these elements are barely above the maximum permissible limits recommended by international organizations table 2 these elements can be considered characteristic of the natural hydrothermal activity of the site since they are present in all three types of water for hydrothermal waters it is also important to mention the high correlation between ph t na and ec similarly with the correlation in domestic waters with ec ph t that suggests that those parameters are leading the water chemistry in the case of domestic water it is observed that there is a positive correlation between the following elements and parameters s p cd p s sb s p s na ce cd mg v s se na k no3 ph likewise it occurs in natural waters cd p s s p cd s as mg and s ca but not in hydrothermal waters green frames in table 3 those elements are normally associated with the use of fertilizers enriched mainly with n s p and mg with some traces of as se na etc de oliveira souza et al 2014 glaser et al 2015 which could be associated to a mismanagement of pesticides or agrochemicals used in the site therefore these elements can be considered of anthropogenic origin there are other groups of correlated elements that are considered to be major ions or nutrients for living organisms blue frames in table 3 and those are mg k ca na and no3 these elements are correlated in all the water types indicating the possibility of mineral dissolution and or the mixture between recently infiltrated waters and old waters finally a correlation between u se na k and s in domestic waters as well as u na in natural waters in both seasons that is not seen in hydrothermal waters suggests another kind of chemical processes different from the natural hydrothermal activity of the site although these elements have been previously reported as enriched in volcanic areas tomašek et al 2022 similarly we see the correlation of vanadium between v na t u in domestic waters and v ca na u dry season v na u rainy season in natural waters that in hydrothermal waters is correlated with na sb dry season and t k rainy season therefore it would be worthwhile to study these elements in detail to understand their behavior in the site based on this it is also recommended to study the chemistry of co in the hydrothermal system that it is correlated with most of the elements in all three kind of waters 3 4 water quality index fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the water quality indices in each sampling season two dry and two rainy showing the region s dynamics when presenting temporal changes in its quality although as expected waters of geothermal origin are not suitable for human use and consumption which is why they remain of poor quality in most seasons except for h3 in the 2018 rainy season which went from poor to regular in the case of domestic and natural waters their quality changes from good to feasible even to regular in the 2018 rainy season in addition only in the 2018 dry season is the domestic water well d3 identified as poor quality which goes from good to regular in the other seasons this index points out that the hydrothermal waters may have some influence on the domestic water quality of the sampled wells and a stronger influence on the natural waters quality governed mainly by the hydrothermal nature of the region however the domestic water site d1 stands out because despite being surrounded by geothermal wells it maintains a favorable quality in three of the four seasons analyzed suggesting that it comes from recently infiltrated water that is stored in a shallow aquifer 3 5 cluster analysis the cluster analysis shows groups of similarities between the control factors the primary and secondary factorial loads characterize the variation of the data set in both the dry and rainy seasons fig 4 these factors had load scores greater than 0 5 from clustering found in the dry season site h6 is the one that has the most significant influence on the water chemistry from the rest of the waters in the area clustering geothermal waters in the second and third levels later to natural n3 and domestic d3 the other sublevels clustered the remaining domestic and natural waters for the rainy season a similarity and dominance of hydrothermal waters h4 and h5 was observed over the clustering of hydrothermal waters h1 and h2 together with natural water n3 and domestic water d1 successively they clustered between natural and domestic waters the clustering of the natural water site n3 with the waters of geothermal origin h is probably because this site is close to a geothermal well and presented an anomalous temperature of around 74 c 3 6 principal component analysis knowing the water quality status of the entire watershed is a complicated process so determining the factors influencing water quality is of great relevance to this work to study the influence of each water quality parameter and reduce the data set eigenvalues were calculated by the principal component analysis pca and the results are shown in fig 5 the analysis defined three groups that contributed to the correlations between analyzed parameters group 1 showed a strong negative correlation with the principal component 1 pc1 distinguished by the grouping of most of the domestic and natural waters from all seasons only h2 rainy season 2019 and h3 rainy season 2018 were associated with these waters group 2 showed a negative correlation with pc2 of four hydrothermal waters h2b h1b h5b and h6c this group of waters is not related with other kind of waters in the region as shown in the cluster analysis h6c and h5b resulted to be the most influential sites in the water chemistry of the zone which is in agreement with this grouping group 3 showed a strong positive correlation with pc1 characterized by six hydrothermal waters from the central zone of los humeros geothermal power plant in addition the waters with negative correlation with pc1 were one hydrothermal water h3 and two domestic waters d1 that is located in the central zone as the hydrothermal waters and d3 that is in the southeast in the maxtaloya community in this group the natural water n3 presented an anomalous temperature of 74 c and it is located in the central zone as well this analysis proposes significant differences in the composition of the analyzed physicochemical parameters of water with a major influence in hydrothermal water chemistry in the central zone of the geothermal power plant 4 discussion in the case of the geothermal reservoir in los humeros and based on geochemical and production data that allowed obtaining pressure and temperature profiles for the unperturbed geothermal fluids two geothermal reservoirs have been proposed one upper reservoir composed of dominant liquid with hydrostatic pressure profile and another lower reservoir composed of dominant steam with steam static pressure profile arellano et al 2003 barragán et al 1991 cedillo rodríguez 2000 proposed that a low permeability vitreous tuff layer acts as an aquitard separating both reservoirs preventing them from mixing with the waters of the shallow aquifer however the recharge of the water tables present in los humeros basins allows groundwater to flow into deeper strata through secondary permeability faults and fractures therefore hydraulic changes may have occurred in the hydraulic fractures due to the exploitation of the most superficial geothermal reservoir causing the recharge of aquifer water by regional meteoric water and magmatic water forming an extensive aquifer mantle as suggested by baysal and gunduz 2016 and goodsell et al 2017 these waters belong to the periods of orogenic modification and have taken the chemical composition of the low solubility volcanic rocks with which they interact can chulim et al 2011 therefore according to the previously mentioned the groundwater recharge and discharge zones can be located at different elevations and lithological reliefs the discharge zones occur in the topographically lower sector while the discharge is always attested such movement is supported by the chemical evolution of natural water flowing streams rivers so groundwater s chemical composition evolves from recharge to discharge tóth 1999 the analyses of maximum permissible limits spearman s correlation and water quality index have shown the presence of potentially toxic elements from geothermal origin in domestic and natural waters in domestic waters only cd might be from geothermal origin that is above the mpl but just 1 14 μg l 1 above the limit of 3 μg l 1 recommended by the who 2018 although cd was mainly correlated with mg s and p that are elements associated with fertilizers de oliveira souza et al 2014 therefore its geothermal origin is questionable the ph is probably one of the most important variables that influence the interaction of the behavior of chemical elements in the environment such as the hardness of water mainly carbonates and organic compounds hem 1989 based on the ph values 96 of water sampled in the rainy season displays values between 6 0 and 8 5 whereas 86 of samples dry season exhibited values from 5 89 to 8 9 these values show that some sites are more acidic 5 6 5 than those that are neutral to alkaline the concentrations of major elements over the mpl only found in hydrothermal waters were stotal cu sb and se these is in agreement to what it has been reported before in hydrothermal areas bundschuh et al 2020 maity et al 2017 ormachea muñoz et al 2015 for as it was mainly hydrothermal except for a domestic d7 that was identified to be of anthropogenic origin since it is present in the piped water and not in the well water the major element over the mpl in all types of water was k the elements found in the thermal and surface waters showed that the alkaline spring waters of the hydrothermal zone show higher amounts of as fe mn sb se and v compared to natural spring waters from the same sites during the rainy season numerous arsenic compounds are soluble in water and have been found in other water bodies of the world nimick et al 1998 especially in the form of as3 and as5 and organic complexes nriagu et al 2007 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however the high temperatures of leaching from the rock explain the high as concentrations in many hydrothermal fluids maity et al 2017 tapia et al 2022 in groundwater from los humeros it could be mainly associated with the ascending fluids of deep hydrothermal system the same condition has been previously proposed by angelone et al 2009 who found evidence of the mixing between deep groundwater and water recharged by infiltration into the volcanic aquifer indicating that hydrothermal zones and shallow underlying faults in the aquifer represent lower drinking water quality same phenomena has been recently reported by another geothermal reservoir in india shukla et al 2022 the presence of toxic elements such as as and sb in surface and groundwater is worrisome koch et al 1999 in los humeros geothermal area most of the hydrothermal sampled sites had as concentrations significantly higher than 10 μg l 1 guideline established by the world health organization who 2018 and sb concentrations exceeding the usepa limit of 6 μg l 1 usepa 2018a b the only site destined for drinking water exceeding the as concentration limit was the domestic water in the house d7 from the well s manager d5 in el valle where the water might be transported with materials such as asbestos enriching the drinking water with as in the case of sb none of the drinking water sources presented this element in higher concentrations than the mentioned guidelines this can be attributed to the mobility of the as that has been reported to be higher than de sb in hydrothermal fluids tapia et al 2022a the correlation of na ca2 and mg2 indicates the dissolution of minerals from the evaporite which are indicators of dry events salinity and evaporation in addition to caco3 as a primary or secondary phase and it can easily explain the high conductivities previous works have demonstrated the presence of minerals such as stibilite mordenite na smectite and calcite in the lithological zone i maximum 1010 m depth gonzález partida et al 2022 this can explain the strong correlations between these elements in the domestic waters and suggest infiltration in deeper strata since those elements were also correlated in hydrothermal waters and only calcite is still present in the geothermal reservoir lithological zone iii max 2600 m depth in the mg hco3 group mg replaced ca highlighting the role of the mg bearing phases during the water rock interaction in accordance with previous studies carried out in rock areas bompoti et al 2015 ormachea muñoz et al 2016 this could explain the correlation of mg with several other elements in the three water types it was unexpected to find correlations between elements that are mostly related with agrochemicals since the region has not a heavy agricultural activity nevertheless this impact in water chemistry was also identified in natural waters and absent in hydrothermal waters reaffirming the result that it is of anthropogenic effect this phenomena can be attributed to the periods of prolonged droughts and the possible acidification of the scarce rainfall of the site promoting with first flushes that soil salts dissolve rapidly and are carried to surface waters kennedy and malcolm 1977 walling and foster 1975 that later on infiltrate in the shallow aquifer in areas not influenced by hydrothermal activity the hierarchical cluster analysis grouped 22 samples into four clusters for the dry season based on similarities in the physicochemical characteristics of the water site h6 was the most influential site recalling this site h6 was the only one that exceeded the mpl for s and cu then this analysis grouped 27 samples into five clusters for the rainy season and the hydrothermal waters h4 and h5 were the most influential in the site these analyses suggest an influence of the hydrothermal waters in the rest of the sampled waters this result is in total agreement with the principal component analysis water quality index and spearman s correlation analysis finally there is a concept named medical geology proposed by bundschuh et al 2017 that considers the exposure to geogenic contaminants that could negatively impact the environment and human health their methodology could be a good choice to apply in this site since there are interdisciplinary information that could be integrated to improve the monitoring as well as know the bioavailability and bioaccesibility of the potentially toxic elements and their impact in the environment and human health following their biogeochemical cycle 5 conclusions this research demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical methods as an efficient screening tool for the analysis of complex sets of water chemistry data establishing key factors and mechanisms to determine water quality the analysis of correlation coefficients between different variables separated by types of water is crucial and opens new boundaries of experience thus reducing the level of ambiguity in data interpretation the analysis of maximum detection limits was the only statistical method that allowed us to identify the anthropogenic as presence in the pumped water of el valle the fingerprint of the hydrothermal fluids is governed by the presence of as cu s sb and se elements such as cd na k and v were identified as regionally enriched in all type of waters possibly due to the geological nature of the site the water quality index wqi values reveal that the water quality is excellent in some of the sampled areas however these results should also consider microbiological and organic analysis in order to fulfill the national guideline for drinking water this result is limited to the inorganic chemistry and the data here analyzed although no direct influence from the geothermal activity was identified in the water quality of the domestic or natural waters some correlations show the influence of hydrothermal water chemistry in those waters as well as the possibility of fast changes in water chemistry unrelated to the rainfall the correlation between potentially toxic elements of agrochemical origin was identified as a controlling factor in the water chemistry of the domestic and natural waters indicating an anthropogenic impact in addition to the natural impact of hydrothermalism the results of the multivariate statistical analysis of the hydrochemical data discriminate different types of water and geochemical processes related to physiography and geology mainly influenced by the geothermal fluids from the deep reservoir all results suggest that the main origin of the potentially toxic elements is natural due to that parental rock interaction and tectonic structures play an important role in the chemical composition of the groundwater in los humeros basins together with the influence on the direct and indirect infiltration of rainwater into the caldera consequently in the highland areas the interaction between water and rock is restricted by geological structures so much of the surface water that is shortly stored in that area infiltrates through fault zones and joints due to these hydraulic connections the water discharge flow is directed to the deepest parts that reach the shallow water recharge zone within the endorheic los humeros basin therefore a regional recharge is possible but the geology of the zone which is constituted by granitic rocks and limestone will be hampered by the arrangement the results obtained from the different samples gathered during both seasons show that most of the groundwater is directly related to the local recharge of the libres oriental basin and to rainfall from the vicinities however it was observed that part of the groundwater is probably mixed with fluids from the geothermal reservoir in the study area these hydrochemical changes can be associated with geochemical reactions involving ion exchange throughout the flow direction allowing a strong rock water interaction the observations made in this study reveal that water quality is strongly influenced by the regional characteristics and the natural hydrothermal activity of the zone however no permanent negative effect on the domestic water quality has been detected nevertheless

11712,one of the most critical challenges affecting emerging nations is the inaccessibility to potable water particularly in regions where people compete for domestic water with irrigation heavy industry and sewage disposal therefore in order to efficiently explore for this resource it is necessary to establish an efficient dependable and lasting method or methods of identifying zones of groundwater occurrence and distribution with high precision the groundwater potential zones gwpz in the edo north region of nigeria were mapped using integrative techniques for sustainability in this study the objectives were accomplished by developing six separate theme layers that determine groundwater potential namely geomorphology g slope s drainage density dd lineament density ld landuse landcover lu lc and geology ge thematic maps were weighted normalised and compared pair wise using saaty s analytical hierarchical process ahp model before being integrated and queried in the arcgis environment to categorise groundwater zones hence the groundwater potentiality map created in a gis environment classified recharge capacities into four zones very low 561 km2 17 low 1989 9 km2 60 3 moderate 627 km2 19 and high 122 1 km2 3 7 the gis model and rs findings suggest that the eastern and northern sections of the study area have moderate to high recharge and storage potential these findings for water resource development are in areas with considerable groundwater potential graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge potentiality spatial thematic maps surface geological features data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water man and the environment are inseparable partners however this relationship has faced enormous challenges as a result of increased water demands caused by population growth urbanisation and agricultural expansion notably in the edo north region of edo state the most widely available resource on the earth is water it occupies more than 70 of the planet s surface e g ozegin et al 2007 surface water a significant source of human water consumption has been contaminated in many regions of the world e g ozegin et al 2007 this has necessitated research on groundwater sources globally groundwater is an important water source for industrial residential and agricultural uses elbeih 2015 reported that salt water mostly in oceans accounts for approximately 97 2 of global water resources with just 2 8 availability as fresh water surface water accounts for approximately 2 2 of the total 2 8 and 0 6 of groundwater the challenge is not only locating groundwater as is commonly assumed but also finding water at such a depth in such amounts and of such quality that it may be effectively exploited the united nations designated guaranteeing water security as one goal 6 of the seventeen sustainable development goals sdgs the term security is defined as a function of availability access to services safety and quality and management gain et al 2016 according to ozegin et al 2007 each person uses roughly 100 l of water per day in different households however many people around the world do not have reliable access to safe drinking water to meet their basic needs detoni and dondoni 2008 unicef who 2019 the eradication of water scarcity has been the focus of major research rezaei et al 2013 vörösmarty et al 2013 the research addresses governance systems and frameworks for sustainable groundwater management e g pietersen et al 2012 the presence and distribution of groundwater in the research area is particularly difficult due to different geological lithological and geomorphological characteristics as well as climate inconsistency and

the thematic maps of geomorphology g slope s drainage density dd lineament density ld landuse landcover lu lc and geology ge significantly the thematic criteria were chosen based on the regional geology of the study area as a result the purpose of this work is to fill a deficiency in the holistic investigation of groundwater potential in the edo north region of edo state nigeria it offers to project the interdependence of groundwater development impacting elements unique to the heterogeneous geological landscape the work s objective is that the selected themes will improve the application of ahp to an integrated method for groundwater investigation 1 1 study area the study area is defined by geographic coordinates of longitudes 6 00 and 6 30 e as well as latitudes 7 00 and 7 30 n in the edo north district municipality of edo state nigeria fig 1 it has a land area of around 3300 km2access to the area is by a network of roadways and well maintained footpaths the region is part of nigeria s precambrian southwestern basement complex basement rocks range from mildly migmatised to unmigmatised quartzite with some minor intrusive like quartz veins amphibolites talcose rocks metaconglomerate marble and calc silicate rocks folding stages impacting the gneiss migmatite quartzite complex as well as mildly migmatised to unmigmatised schist and metaigneous rocks have been described and are thought to be imprint of pan africa orogeny event rahaman 1976 and obaje 2009 the area has been influenced by barrovian style metamorphism with metamorphic grades ranging from green schist to amphibolites facies the migmatite gneiss complex is assumed to have formed as a result of a combination of deformative shearing and folding as well as the granitisation and migmatisation processes oluyide 1988 on the gneiss migmatite complex the slightly migmatised paraschist is a sedimentary cover the fine grained rocks are mostly migmaitic in origin rather than the granulite facies typical high grade metamorphic they are most likely of two generations the first deposited prior to the older granite s placement and the second deposited in the final phases of the older granite orogeny which is thought to have caused the basement complex s extensive amphibolites facies metamorphism odeyemi 1976 preexisting rocks are mainly granite that is cut across by quartzo feldspathic veins it can also be found in the host rock as concordant to discordant veins and swarms of augen shaped porphoroblastic of white and pink microcline oriented along preexisting foliation the quartz biotite schist has been weathered chemically over the years to form a fairly thick overburden that acts as the aquifer for the hand dug wells the rocks of the study area were affected by the pan

maps depicting the diverse influences they have on groundwater recharge were created gaber et al 2020 to evaluate the groundwater potential of the research area the thematic maps were subjected to multi criteria decision analysis mcda utilising the analytic hierarchy process ahp the ahp procedures minimise the subjectivity present in the assigning of weights based on expert judgments by applying eigen vector approaches to normalise the provided weight e g saaty 1994 ahp was used to develop the pair wise evaluation and ranking of the groundwater influence parameters each component was given a score based on how important it was to the groundwater presence the groundwater potentiality map was created by overlaying and integrating these thematic maps into a gis framework using weights to categorise the different recharge capabilities into four zones 2 1 delimitation of the groundwater potential zone via spatial analysis in order to create a definitive potential zone the overlay evaluation of the six thematic layers was performed in arcgis 10 5 1 as an accumulation of the elements shown premised upon their characteristic weight to assign weights to the evaluating parameters using their significance and compare the resultant weights on the kardi s nine point comparison scale 1 3 5 7 9 table 1 the technique of kardi 2009 was adopted in developing the pairwise comparisons of the six parameters considered in this study the pairwise comparisons are used to construct the pairwise comparison matrix it is important to add that the number of comparisons for n numbers of factors is given by 1 n u m b e r o f c o m p a r i s o n n n 1 2 where n the number of parameters being considered by applying the reciprocal values of the upper diagonal the lower triangular matrix of the comparison matrix was filled as a result equation 2 is used to fill the bottom diagonal if aij is an element of the matrix s row i and column j 2 aij 1 aij in table 2 the lower diagonal matrix is displayed the parameters were given weights which were calculated by adding the values in each column of the pairwise comparison matrix normalising the matrix by dividing each element by its column total and then calculating the average of the elements in each row of the normalised matrix table 3 2 1 1 the consistency ratio cr the ratio of the consistency index ci to the random consistency index rci is known as the consistency ratio cr typically if the value of the cr is less than or equals 0 1 the judgments are consistent allowing for the application of the

provided in equation 4 the closer the value of λ max is to the n value the more consistent the matrix becomes when the consistency measure λ max equals n the level is entirely consistent as a result when the matrix is entirely consistent ci 0 and so cr 0 if cr is less than or equal to 0 1 10 the comparison value is still considered consistent saaty 1980 if cr is greater than 0 1 the entry values are inconsistent and the pairwise comparison matrix should be regenerated where λ max 6 2142 cl 0 04284 and rci 0 5 c r 0 04284 0 5 0 085 the estimated weights indicated in tables 3 and 4 can be applied because the computed consistency ratio was calculated to be 8 5 less than 10 accordingly the results of the normalised weights were dependable and were taken into consideration for the groundwater potential mapping to obtain these findings all of the layers were converted into integral raster and their units were ranked thematic maps are scored on a scale of 1 5 based on the

results 3 1 drainage hydro drainage density the drainage map for the research area is shown in fig 3 a water bodies rivers tributaries and streams are depicted on this map the drainage density map fig 3 b is an important factor to consider when evaluating important hydrogeological parameters like infiltration and permeability owolabi et al 2020 the four categories on the drainage density scale are very low low moderate and high on the map the lengths of all rivers and streams in a drainage network are divided by the drainage basin s complete area to determine the drainage density rajaveni et al 2015 in addition to demonstrating the relationship between soil permeability and surface runoff drainage density is a quantification of channels per unit of the area takodjou et al 2018 fossi et al 2021 3 2 lineament hydro lineament density the lineaments generated from a satellite map landsat tm are illustrated in fig 4 a to demonstrate the utility of remote sensing in hydrological investigations particularly in the identification of groundwater development zones lineaments are surface expressions of subterranean fractures these lineaments are potential sites of increased porosity and permeability of the subsoil rao 2006 elimination and isolation procedures were used on the lineament map the elimination method was employed to eliminate those that were not hydro geologically significant and identify those that were high lineaments can be seen on the map in the western eastern and northern tendencies low lineaments define the southern part of the research region two minor sets of lineaments fig 4 b progress in the nnw sse and nwn ese directions whilst the major set of lineaments progresses in the ene wsw orientations the degree of fracture of the research region is defined by the number of lineaments jahvar et al 2019 one of the most important maps made from lineaments is lineament density which is employed in hard rock groundwater research for quick graphical examination of the lineament density values of the area the lineament density was estimated as determined by the number of lineaments per unit area kg 1 of the grid the distribution of lineaments among the four density classes is represented in fig 4 c very low 0 0 21 km 1 low 0 22 0 43 km 1 moderate 0 44 0 64 km 1 and high 0 65 0 85 km 1 3 3 slope map slope is an important terrain attribute that is defined by the horizontal spacing of the contours and the elevation raster and is quantified by identifying a high rate of change in value from one cell to the next e g abijith et al 2020 slope values fig 5 were calculated in degrees in both vector and raster forms in this study the slope map was assigned values of gently sloping 0 15 49 moderately sloping 15 50

mainly for agriculture and habitation as well as other pursuits both lu and lc can be regarded as significant governing parameters of watershed hydrologic that divide precipitation into infiltrating water and runoff according to schulze 2003 the appraisal of groundwater resources is greatly influenced by land use e g ajay et al 2020 vegetation outcrop built up and wetland water body are the landuse landcover lulc types of the research region as seen on the map fig 6 3 5 geomorphology map geomorphology is a collection or combination of metrics that depict topographic shape sufficiently to differentiate between topographically distinct landscapes pike 1988 delineating and mapping various landforms and drainage factors that may directly affect the availability or prevalence and flow of groundwater are part of geomorphological investigations the mapping procedures significantly aid in comprehending groundwater potential locations and their prospects for groundwater resources singhal and gupta 1999 the study area s geomorphology was classified into five categories fig 7 based on the likelihood of groundwater development 3 6 geology groundwater deposition in an area is significantly influenced by geology particularly in amount and quality the properties of the soil affect how much recharge permeates the ground surface e g ozegin et al 2007 razandi et al 2015 surface water infiltration can be slowed down or prevented by the presence of fine grained materials like clay peat or silt as well as by the organic matter content present in the soil cover the geology of the study area is unique due to the transformation in geologic formations fig 1 from the basement complex occurrence in the northern part of the study area which is interbedded by granite gneiss charnockite migmatite quartzite diorite mica schist quartz biotite schist migmatite schist porphyritic granite garnet schist metaconglomerate iron stone amphibolite schist and marble and the distinctive sedimentary formation occurring in the southern part made up of mainly sandstone and partly quartz biotite schist and porphyritic granite this could be due to weathering of the basement rocks present in the northern hilly terrain and the moderate slope downward towards the study area s southern portions 4 discussion 4 1 compendia of the findings one of the crucial attributes of hydrogeological relevance is an area s drainage density distribution which provides information on both surface and subsurface formations prasad et al 2008 the drainage system reflects both surface and subterranean properties the drainage map is oriented in two directions north south and northwest southeast fig 3a the density and kind of the drainage system have effects on runoff infiltration relief and permeability dendritic drainage implies homogeneous rocks but the trellis rectangular and parallel drainage systems reflect structural and lithological controls e g ilugbo and adebiyi 2017 the drainage density measured in the study area fig 3b ranges from 0 to 1 10 km 1 the smaller part of the area had low drainage density 1 km 1 suggesting that the river basin has permeable subsurface material under thick vegetative cover and low relief culminating in coarse drainage texture impermeable subsurface material scant vegetation and steep topography all contribute to high drainage density in contrast to the low drainage density of a coarse drainage texture fine drainage textures have a higher drainage density the drainage density reflects the extent of runoff and proportional rainwater that has entered a specific area the possibility of groundwater accumulation increases as the drainage density decreases srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 areas with a high concentration of lineaments fig 4a have a better chance of accumulating groundwater e g meixner et al 2018 major and minor sets of lineaments are visible on the rose azimuth frequency diagram fig 4b constructed from the identified lineaments and these lineaments are intimately associated with tectonic phenomena including fractures faults and joints high density or permeability zones can be found in the study area s fig 4c eastern and northern regions basement zone whereas low density or permeability zones can be found in the southern region along the sedimentary terrain e g gouet et al 2022 the presence of high lineament density suggests a strong potential for groundwater development but the overall lineament density of the studied region is low groundwater development is favoured in areas with high lineament density with the exception of the residual hill environment the map depicts the northward tendency of lineament accumulation it thus corresponds to the north s topographic diversity in which the relief is precipitous the locations of significant fracture systems are replicated by high lineament density khosroshahizadeh et al 2016 meixner et al 2018 the area with the very lowest grade 0 15 49 obtained the highest rank while the class with the highest grade 59 49 89 74 received the least weight fig 5 this suggests that the possibility of groundwater accumulation increases with topographic flatness the slope of a region affects the amount of water that seeps into the ground or the percentage rate at which it does so either favourably or negatively high slope areas have a low groundwater possibility whereas low slope areas have a significant degree of water infiltration as a result of practically level terrain accordingly the steeper slope characterises the zones with more problematic groundwater infiltration and higher rainfall runoff gouet et al 2022 the primary lulc change components are specifically related to groundwater inquiry since lulc changes have diverse effects on the occurrence of groundwater wetland water bodies are given a higher score than vegetation built up area and outcrop since they come in first to indicators of groundwater potential table 4 infiltration will be higher in forest regions and runoff will be lower whilst infiltration may decrease in urban areas built up regions would have a low water holding capacity in contrast to wetland water bodies and cultivated fields which would have a high water holding capacity owolabi et al 2020 as a result groundwater accumulation is likely in the wetland water body topography as an indication is most likely to reveal the somewhat permeable layers valley fills alluvia pediplain pediment and hills and ridges are among them with higher rankings being given to valley fills and alluvium table 4 because they permit significant infiltration and have good groundwater potential rajaveni et al 2015 the porosity and permeability of the rocks engaging with the water have a considerable impact on the distribution and conveyance of groundwater based on how well they are able to withstand environmental variables different rock formations weather to different degrees e g akinlalu et al 2017 this is plainly apparent in the severity of rock fracturing iron stone amphibolite schist sandstone and marble are the rocks with the minimum incidence of fracture in the research area whereas granite gneiss has the highest form of fracturing as shown in table 4 4 1 1 1gis integration and modeling comprehensive picture the study area s resulting groundwater recharge potentiality map is composed of four regions with varying recharge capabilities table 5 and fig 8 moderate 627 km2 19 to high 122 1 km2 3 7 recharge potentialities characterise the historic alluvial floodplain areas within or around ososo and okpe which are located northwest of the research area have a high recharge potential whereas the areas around ibilo igarra and dagbala have a moderate recharge potential very low 561 km2 17 and low 1989 9 km2 60 3 recharge potentialities characterise the plateau for the reason that each component would only have a marginal impact on water penetration it is required to use the gis technique to combine the effects of the various determinants to gain a more comprehensive picture of the potential for groundwater resources owolabi et al 2020 this is accomplished by employing the weighted overlay method to overlay all of the theme layers voogd 1983 nga gm sys 2004 the weighted overlay technique of arcgis 10 5 s spatial analytical framework was used to overlay the thematic maps to establish the groundwater potential zones within a given basin groundwater potential varies over time and space perhaps only a few metres confirming the study s results of heterogeneity the model s findings suggest that key parameters notably lineament density geomorphology and slope have a stronger influence on groundwater phenomena in the research area lineament density drainage density geomorphology slope landuse landcover and geology thematic layers are all used in the spatial analysis and modeling table 4 displays the variables and their classifications investigations have shown that the study area s overall groundwater potential was quite low a focus on promising zones with significant groundwater potential can then be made of additional field geophysical research 5 conclusion planning for sustainable groundwater resources and control involves mapping and determining the prospective zones for groundwater in a given location the current study demonstrates how geospatial based basic mcda can be used together to effectively explore the groundwater potential for sustainability in the studied area the results obtained from these techniques revealed that 60 3 representing 1989 9 km2 of the study area showed low groundwater recharge potential the southern sections of the study location have very low to moderate groundwater recharge potential whilst the eastern and northern parts have a mix of very low to high groundwater recharge potential the valley fill and alluvium regions with a minimum slope which are located in the eastern and northern parts of the study area have a high potential but the hills and ridges zones which are mostly located in the southern portion of the study area have a very low potential the valley fills and alluvium are surrounded by foundation uplifts and plateau scarp in a basin that runs northwest to southeast surface and subsurface faults have a strong correlation according to the results of remote sensing combined with geographic information systems particularly close to the highland escarpment this region is a desirable hydrogeological zone because it is clearly influenced by fault mechanisms and acts as a trap for the accumulation of porous material favorable hydrogeological locations indicated by this study can help diverse institutions and

11712,one of the most critical challenges affecting emerging nations is the inaccessibility to potable water particularly in regions where people compete for domestic water with irrigation heavy industry and sewage disposal therefore in order to efficiently explore for this resource it is necessary to establish an efficient dependable and lasting method or methods of identifying zones of groundwater occurrence and distribution with high precision the groundwater potential zones gwpz in the edo north region of nigeria were mapped using integrative techniques for sustainability in this study the objectives were accomplished by developing six separate theme layers that determine groundwater potential namely geomorphology g slope s drainage density dd lineament density ld landuse landcover lu lc and geology ge thematic maps were weighted normalised and compared pair wise using saaty s analytical hierarchical process ahp model before being integrated and queried in the arcgis environment to categorise groundwater zones hence the groundwater potentiality map created in a gis environment classified recharge capacities into four zones very low 561 km2 17 low 1989 9 km2 60 3 moderate 627 km2 19 and high 122 1 km2 3 7 the gis model and rs findings suggest that the eastern and northern sections of the study area have moderate to high recharge and storage potential these

enormous challenges as a result of increased water demands caused by population growth urbanisation and agricultural expansion notably in the edo north region of edo state the most widely available resource on the earth is water it occupies more than 70 of the planet s surface e g ozegin et al 2007 surface water a significant source of human water consumption has been contaminated in many regions of the world e g ozegin et al 2007 this has necessitated research on groundwater sources globally groundwater is an important water source for industrial residential and agricultural uses elbeih 2015 reported that salt water mostly in oceans accounts for approximately 97 2 of global water resources with just 2 8 availability as fresh water surface water accounts for approximately 2 2 of the total 2 8 and 0 6 of groundwater the challenge is not only locating groundwater as is commonly assumed but also finding water at such a depth in such amounts and of such quality that it may be

availability access to services safety and quality and management gain et al 2016 according to ozegin et al 2007 each person uses roughly 100 l of water per day in different households however many

the thematic maps of geomorphology g slope s drainage density dd lineament density ld landuse landcover lu lc and geology ge significantly the thematic criteria were chosen based on the regional geology of the study area as a result the purpose of this work is to fill a deficiency in the holistic investigation of groundwater potential in the edo north region of edo state nigeria it offers to project the interdependence of groundwater development impacting elements unique to the heterogeneous geological landscape the work s objective is that the selected themes will improve the application of ahp to an integrated method for groundwater investigation 1 1 study area the study area is defined by geographic coordinates of longitudes 6 00 and 6 30 e as well as latitudes 7 00 and 7 30 n in the edo north district municipality of edo state nigeria fig 1 it has a land area of around 3300 km2access to the area is by a network of roadways and well maintained footpaths the region is part of nigeria s precambrian southwestern basement complex basement rocks range from mildly migmatised to unmigmatised quartzite with some minor intrusive like quartz veins amphibolites talcose rocks metaconglomerate marble and calc silicate rocks folding stages impacting the gneiss migmatite quartzite complex as well as mildly migmatised to unmigmatised schist and metaigneous rocks have been described and are thought to be imprint of pan africa orogeny event rahaman 1976 and obaje 2009 the area has been influenced by barrovian style metamorphism with metamorphic grades ranging from green schist to amphibolites facies the migmatite gneiss complex is assumed to have formed as a result of a combination of deformative shearing and folding as well as the granitisation and migmatisation processes oluyide 1988 on the gneiss migmatite complex the slightly migmatised paraschist is a sedimentary cover the fine grained rocks are mostly migmaitic in origin rather than the granulite facies typical high grade metamorphic they are most likely of two generations the first deposited prior to the older granite s placement and the second deposited in the final phases of the older granite orogeny which is thought to have caused the basement complex s extensive amphibolites facies metamorphism odeyemi 1976 preexisting rocks are mainly granite that is cut across by quartzo feldspathic veins it can also be found in the host rock as concordant to discordant veins and swarms of augen shaped porphoroblastic of white and pink microcline oriented along preexisting foliation the quartz biotite schist has been weathered chemically over the years to form a fairly thick overburden that acts as the aquifer for the hand dug wells the rocks of the study area were affected by the pan

3 b is an important factor to consider when evaluating important hydrogeological parameters like infiltration and permeability owolabi et al 2020 the four categories on the drainage density scale are very low low moderate and high on the map the lengths of all rivers and streams in a drainage network are divided by the drainage basin s complete area to determine the drainage density rajaveni et al 2015 in addition to demonstrating the relationship between soil permeability and surface runoff drainage density is a quantification of channels per unit of the area takodjou et al 2018 fossi et al 2021 3 2 lineament hydro lineament density the lineaments generated from a satellite map landsat tm are illustrated in fig 4 a to demonstrate the utility of remote sensing in hydrological investigations particularly in the identification of groundwater development zones lineaments are surface expressions of subterranean fractures these lineaments are potential sites of increased porosity and permeability of the subsoil rao 2006 elimination and isolation procedures were used on the lineament map the elimination method was employed to eliminate those that were not hydro geologically significant and identify those that were high lineaments can be seen on the map in the western eastern and northern tendencies low lineaments define the southern part of the research region two minor sets of lineaments fig 4 b progress in the nnw sse and nwn ese directions whilst the major set of lineaments progresses in the ene wsw orientations the degree of fracture of the research region is defined by the number of lineaments jahvar et al 2019 one of the most important maps made from lineaments is lineament density which is employed in hard rock groundwater research for quick graphical examination of the lineament density values of the area the lineament density was estimated as determined by the number of lineaments per unit area kg 1 of the grid the distribution of lineaments among the four density classes is represented in fig 4 c very low 0 0 21 km 1 low 0 22 0 43 km 1 moderate 0 44 0 64 km 1 and high 0 65 0 85 km 1 3 3 slope map slope is an important terrain attribute that is defined by the horizontal spacing of the contours and the elevation raster and is quantified by identifying a high rate of change in value from one cell to the next e g abijith et al 2020 slope values fig 5 were calculated in degrees in both vector and raster forms in this study the slope map was assigned values of gently sloping 0 15 49 moderately sloping 15 50 30 62 moderately steep sloping 30 63 44 34 steep sloping 44 35 59 48 and very steeply sloping 59 49 89 74 3 4 landuse landcover map land cover lc describes the biophysical state of the earth s surface

mainly for agriculture and habitation as well as other pursuits both lu and lc can be regarded as significant governing parameters of watershed hydrologic that divide precipitation into infiltrating water and runoff according to schulze 2003 the appraisal of groundwater resources is greatly influenced by land use e g ajay et al 2020 vegetation outcrop built up and wetland water body are the landuse landcover lulc types of the research region as seen on the map fig 6 3 5 geomorphology map geomorphology is a collection or combination of metrics that depict topographic shape sufficiently to differentiate between topographically distinct landscapes pike 1988 delineating and mapping various landforms and drainage factors that may directly affect the availability or prevalence and flow of groundwater are part of geomorphological investigations the mapping procedures significantly aid in comprehending groundwater potential locations and their prospects for groundwater resources singhal and gupta 1999 the study area s geomorphology was classified into five categories fig 7 based on the likelihood of groundwater development 3 6 geology groundwater deposition in an area is significantly influenced by geology particularly in amount and quality the properties of the soil affect how much recharge permeates the ground surface e g ozegin et al 2007 razandi et al 2015 surface water infiltration can be slowed down or prevented by the presence of fine grained materials like clay peat or silt as well as by the organic matter content present in the soil cover the geology of the study area is unique due to the transformation in geologic formations fig 1 from the basement complex occurrence in the northern part of the study area which is interbedded by granite gneiss charnockite migmatite quartzite diorite mica schist quartz biotite schist migmatite schist porphyritic granite garnet schist metaconglomerate iron stone amphibolite schist and marble and the distinctive sedimentary formation occurring in the southern part made up of mainly sandstone and partly quartz biotite schist and porphyritic granite this could be due to weathering of the basement rocks present in the northern hilly terrain and the moderate slope downward towards the study area s southern portions 4 discussion 4 1 compendia of the findings one of the crucial attributes of hydrogeological relevance is an area s drainage density distribution which provides information on both surface and subsurface formations prasad et al 2008 the drainage system reflects both surface and subterranean properties the drainage map is oriented in two directions north south and northwest southeast fig 3a the density and kind of the drainage system have effects on runoff infiltration relief and permeability dendritic drainage implies homogeneous rocks but the trellis rectangular and parallel drainage systems reflect structural and lithological controls e g ilugbo and adebiyi 2017 the drainage density measured in the study area fig 3b ranges from 0 to 1 10 km 1 the smaller part of the area had low drainage density 1 km 1 suggesting that the river basin has permeable subsurface material under thick vegetative cover and low relief culminating in coarse drainage texture impermeable subsurface material scant vegetation and steep topography all contribute to high drainage density in contrast to the low drainage density of a coarse drainage texture fine drainage textures have a higher drainage density the drainage density reflects the extent of runoff and proportional rainwater that has entered a specific area the possibility of groundwater accumulation increases as the drainage density decreases srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 areas with a high concentration of lineaments fig 4a have a better chance of accumulating groundwater e g meixner et al 2018 major and minor sets of lineaments are visible on the rose azimuth frequency diagram fig 4b constructed from the identified lineaments and these lineaments are intimately associated with tectonic phenomena including fractures faults and joints high density or permeability zones can be found in the study area s fig 4c eastern and northern regions basement zone whereas low density or permeability zones can be found in the southern region along the sedimentary terrain e g gouet et al 2022 the presence of high lineament density suggests a strong potential for groundwater development but the overall lineament density of the studied region is low groundwater development is favoured in areas with high lineament density with the exception of the residual hill environment the map depicts the northward tendency of lineament accumulation it thus corresponds to the north s topographic diversity in which the relief is precipitous the locations of significant fracture systems are replicated by high lineament density khosroshahizadeh et al 2016 meixner et al 2018 the area with the very lowest grade 0 15 49 obtained the highest rank while the class with the highest grade 59 49 89 74 received the least weight fig 5 this suggests that the possibility of groundwater accumulation increases with topographic flatness the slope of a region affects the amount of water that seeps into the ground or the percentage rate at which it does so either favourably or negatively high slope areas have a low groundwater possibility whereas low slope areas have a significant degree of water infiltration as a result of practically level terrain accordingly the steeper slope characterises the zones with more problematic groundwater infiltration and higher rainfall runoff gouet et al 2022 the primary lulc change components are specifically related to groundwater inquiry since lulc changes have diverse effects on the occurrence of groundwater wetland water bodies are given a higher score than vegetation built up area and outcrop since they come in first to indicators of groundwater potential table 4 infiltration will be higher in forest regions and runoff will be lower whilst infiltration may decrease in urban areas built up regions would have a low water holding capacity in contrast to wetland water bodies and cultivated fields which would have a high water holding capacity owolabi et al 2020 as a result groundwater accumulation is likely in the wetland water body topography as an indication is most likely to reveal the somewhat permeable layers valley fills alluvia pediplain pediment and hills and ridges are among them with higher rankings being given to valley fills and alluvium table 4 because they permit significant infiltration and have good groundwater potential rajaveni et al 2015 the porosity and permeability of the rocks engaging with the water have a considerable impact on the distribution and conveyance of groundwater based on how well they are able to withstand environmental variables different rock formations weather to different degrees e g akinlalu et al 2017 this is plainly apparent in the severity of rock fracturing iron stone amphibolite schist sandstone and marble are the rocks with the minimum incidence of fracture in the research area whereas granite gneiss has the highest form of fracturing as shown in table 4 4 1 1 1gis integration and modeling comprehensive picture the study area s resulting groundwater recharge potentiality map is composed of four regions with varying recharge capabilities table 5 and fig 8 moderate 627 km2 19 to high 122 1 km2 3 7 recharge potentialities characterise the historic alluvial floodplain areas within or around ososo and okpe which are located northwest of the research area have a high recharge potential whereas the areas around ibilo igarra and dagbala have a moderate recharge potential very low 561 km2 17 and low 1989 9 km2 60 3 recharge potentialities characterise the plateau for the reason that each component would only have a marginal impact on water penetration it is required to use the gis technique to combine the effects of the various determinants to gain a more comprehensive picture of the potential for groundwater resources owolabi et al 2020 this is accomplished by employing the weighted overlay method to overlay all of the theme layers voogd 1983 nga gm sys 2004 the weighted overlay technique of arcgis 10 5 s spatial analytical framework was used to overlay the thematic maps to establish the groundwater potential zones within a given basin groundwater potential varies over time and space perhaps only a few metres confirming the study s results of heterogeneity the model s findings suggest that key parameters notably lineament density geomorphology and slope have a stronger influence on groundwater phenomena in the research area lineament density drainage density geomorphology slope landuse landcover and geology thematic layers are all used in the spatial analysis and modeling table 4 displays the variables and their classifications investigations have shown that the study area s overall groundwater potential was quite low a focus on promising zones with significant groundwater potential can then be made of additional field geophysical research 5 conclusion planning for sustainable groundwater resources and control involves mapping and determining the prospective zones for groundwater in a given location the current study demonstrates how geospatial based basic mcda can be used together to effectively explore the groundwater potential for sustainability in the studied area the results obtained from these techniques revealed that 60 3 representing 1989 9 km2 of the study area showed low groundwater recharge potential the southern sections of the study location have very low to moderate groundwater recharge potential whilst the eastern and northern parts have a mix of very low to high groundwater recharge potential the valley fill and alluvium regions with a minimum slope which are located in the eastern and northern parts of the study area have a high potential but the hills and ridges zones which are mostly located in the southern portion of the study area have a very low potential the valley fills and alluvium are surrounded by foundation uplifts and plateau scarp in a basin that runs northwest to southeast surface and subsurface faults have a strong correlation according to the results of remote sensing combined with geographic information systems particularly close to the highland escarpment this region is a desirable hydrogeological zone because it is clearly influenced by fault mechanisms and acts as a trap for the accumulation of porous material favorable hydrogeological locations indicated by this study can help diverse institutions and

11713,the present study of the analysis of radon in groundwater and its exhalation rates in soil was carried out in 19 selected locations in mokokchung district nagaland india the survey was carried out by employing a portable scintillation based smart rnduo monitor the radon 222rn mass exhalation rates of the soil were found to vary from 27 mbqkg 1h 1 to 40 mbqkg 1h 1 with an average of 31 0 8 mbqkg 1h 1 while the thoron 220rn surface exhalation rate of the soil was found to vary from 714 6 bqm 2h 1 to 2166 6 bqm 2h 1 with an average of 1009 9 77 1 bqm 2h 1 the radon 222rn in drinking water was found to vary from 1 48 bql 1 to 2 22 bql 1 with an average of 1 82 0 04 bql 1 and is below the world average values as set by usepa 1991 who 2004 and unscear 2008 furthermore the total effective dose range is below the who 2003 recommendation graphical abstract image 1 keywords smart rnduo monitor scintillation cell inhalation dose ingestion dose 222rn 220rn exhalation rates data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the wake of radon and thoron s threat to people in both natural and man made environments every day much public attention has focused on their speculations due to their adverse health effects unscear 2000 this may be attributed to the alterations to the ecological processes that govern terrestrial systems including soil fertility for food production surface water bodies for flood prevention and groundwater drinking water supply froehlich 2010 radon in homes is primarily produced by soil the amount of radon in soil ranges from a few kbqm 3 up to a few hundred of kbqm 3 cosma et al 2013 the decay of radium and thorium in the earth s crust produces the radon and thoron gas which are then transported to indoor environments via two different mechanisms from the soil matrix and building material in the earth s crust 222rn and 220rn gas are formed by the decay of radium and thorium respectively and they access the interior space through two different mechanisms from the soil and construction materials matrix the first step involves an emanation from the material while the second step involves an exhalation from the matrix emanation is the step where 222rn atoms move from the dense mineral grains to the pores covered with air while exhalation involves the movement of air filled pores releasing 222rn gas into the atmosphere sahoo et al 2010 if the 222rn concentrations in the soil near a house are high then there is a probability of high radon concentrations in nearby water wells moldovan et al 2014 thus it is desired that in addition to the study of radon in the soil equal emphasis may also be given to the study of radon in the water radon is present in groundwater because of the interaction it has during movement with rocks that contain primordial uranium minerals under the surface sachs et al 1981 hess et al 1978 when water is used for various purposes and becomes agitated the 222rn gas which is only very slightly water soluble finds its way into the atmosphere both inside as well as outdoors somlai et al 2007 nazaroff et al 1997 watson et al 1993 fitzgerald et al 1997 radon accounts with over approximately 50 of the natural exposure to humans in the world and between 3 and 14 of lung cancer deaths in people are attributable to radon exposure who 2009 making it the second largest cause of death for people with lung cancer after smoking during respiration the majority of the radon gas absorbed into the lungs is breathed out however a certain fraction of the radon progeny gets attached to the lung tissue and has the potential to harm dna in the lung s delicate tissues and can cause lung cancer in this regard unscear recommends a reference value of 9 nsv bqhm 3 1 for example a person living 7000 hy 1 in a concentration of 40 bqm 3 receives an effective dose of 1 msvy 1 unscear 2000 it has been reported that miners with cumulative exposures less than 30 mbqhm 3 have an excessive relative risk from radon exposure of 1 8 per megabecquerel hours per cubic meter mbqhm 3 unscear 2006 simultaneous measurements of radon in soil and water can provide valuable significant indicators predictions of the radon potential of an area cosma et al 2013 there are numerous studies on radon in water and measurements of exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn in soil that have been assessed by researchers worldwide kumar et al 2022 singla et al 2021 rani et al 2021 singh et al 2019 poojitha et al 2020 singh et al 2020 narang et al 2018 pyngrope et al 2022 almayahi et al 2014 noverques et al

pudjadi 2015 however there are no reports on radon studies in soil and water in the residential area of the mokokchung district in view of this the present study area was originally chosen due to its geological characteristics the state of nagaland in india is an area containing metamorphic igneous and sedimentary rocks predominantly shale disang category sandstone barail category volcanic sediments limestone and pelagic ao and bhowmik 2014 these types of rocks and stones are known to contain naturally occurring radioactive elements like radium uranium and thorium these naturally occurring elements can break down or decay into the radioactive gas radon depending on the amount of these materials present they may also cause small increases in radiation levels thus the present study s main goal is to perform a thorough 222rn analysis in water as well as 222rn 220rn exhalation rates in the soils of the mokokchung district of nagaland a portable radon monitor smart rnduo designed by barc bhabha atomic research centre mumbai was the device employed for the current investigation 2 study area among nagaland s 12 districts mokokchung is one bordering assam to the north tuensang district to the east wokha and zunheboto districts to the south the district stretches across 1615 km2 and is situated between 25 56 n and 27 40 n latitude and 93 53 e and 94 53 e longitude its elevation is 1325 m above sea level fig 1 the eocene s disang series and barail series are the district s most common rocks younger tipam series rocks can also be found along the assam plains tiakumla 2014 3 geology of the study area the litho tectonic units of the palaeogene neogene and quaternary deposits are found in the research area fig 2 the palaeogene is represented by the rock types disang and barail the barail group is divided into the naogaon formation baragolai formation and tikak parbat formation in the research region the valley portion s terraces and alluvium are made up of pleistocene recent sediments and reflect the quaternary the coal shale bearing units of the tikak parbat formation and baragolai formation of the barail group which extend along the strike mathur and evans 1964 ranga rao and samanta 1987 make up the hanging wall of these thrusts these units often dip toward the southeast around tuli tzudikong and longtho the quaternary sediments that are restricted to the intermontane valleys are abundantly exposed gis and remote sensing the tipam and dupi tila groups are formed from the neogene rocks in the research region the namsang formation s pebbly beds which are a part of the dupi tila group are located above the tipam group the dihing group refers to the pleistocene pebble beds that unconformably overlie the namsang beds this group is made up of thick layers of unconsolidated barail boulders cobbles and pebbles in sand silt and clay matrix surma rocks are made up of well bedded sandstone shaly sandstone mudstone and sandy shale chakradhar and gaur 1985 4 materials and method the soil samples were taken from the 19 villages of mokokchung district nagaland and exhalation rates have been calculated for radon and thoron using a smart rnduo monitor the soil samples were taken from the neighboring residence using a hoe the samples were dug and collected at a depth of 30 cm to get pure soil samples about 1 kg of soil samples was brought to the lab in zip lock bags for analysis in the process of collecting care was taken to remove unwanted particles stones rocks grass etc from the soil in general roughly 500 600g of soil are confined in a tight metallic container coupled to the smart rnduo similarly water samples from the 19 borewells were gathered for the assessment of the 222rn level in the water utilizing a container with a tubing directly linked to the faucet to prevent water from being exposed to the atmosphere the water was gathered in 60 ml leak proof glass bottles with little permeability that had already been cleaned to prevent the formation of bubbles or agitation in the water care was given when sampling into the bottle to prevent losing any 222rn owing to radioactive decay the concentration of dissolved 222rn was measured within 2 4 h after the sample time a scintillation detector based smart rnduo radon monitor was employed to evaluate the exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn from the soil a photomultiplier tube pmt and related counting electronics are used to measure the alpha scintillations produced by 222rn and its daughter products this monitor is employed to assess the radon levels in soil water and naturally occurring radioactive materials norms sapra et al 2016 the procedures for assessing the exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn are described in the following sections radon thoron exhalation rates can be sampled into smart rnduo using diffusion or flow mode of sampling 5 222rn mass exhalation rate measurement radon exhalation rate is defined as the amount of radon liberated from a material s surface area per unit of time as a result diffusion mode of sampling was used to determine the rate of mass exhalation of radon for the investigation of the soil s mass exhalation rate of 222rn about 500 600g of the dried soil sample are contained in the mass exhalation chamber a leak tight accumulation chamber connected to the rnduo monitor model number rnduo serial number 1615 a schematic view of the measurement is shown in fig 3 smart rnduo monitor is attached to a stainless steel accumulation chamber close to cylindrical and leak free for the purpose of measuring 222rn the smart rnduo monitor was programmed to operate for 24 h on a 60 min cycle the basis for the detection technique is founded on the scintillation with zns ag method for detecting alpha particles released from sampling air 222rn and their decay products a pinhole plate that serves as a 220rn discriminator pushes air into the scintillation chamber the pinhole plate s diffusion time delay prevents the short lived 220rn from passing through it the release of 222rn and its daughter products scintillations is measured with a photomultiplier tube pmt the monitor s microprocessor uses a smart algorithm to translate the values for each cycle into concentrations of 222rn since there is no interference from humidity or trace gases because the detection principle is based on direct scintillation there is no need for any extra setup in the sample path the algorithm built into the microprocessor automatically adjusts the background readings caused by radon s residual decay products providing a continuous reading of radon concentration a detailed description of the smart rnduo and the measurement method is given elsewhere sapra et al 2010 the accumulation of radon data over time can be recovered at the end of the measurements and the least square fitting can be performed using the model eq 1 sahoo et al 2007 1 c t j m m v t c o c j m where jm may be derived from the fitted slope after the data from the previous equation was least square fitted at time t c t is the concentration of 222rn bqm 3 at time t 0 c0 represents the amount of 222rn bqm 3 in the chamber volume m is the dried sample s overall mass kg v stands for effective volume which is made up of the detector volume the porous sample volume and the residual air volume in the mass exhalation chamber m3 6 220rn surface exhalation rate measurement the 220rn was measured in flow mode as illustrated in fig 4 the monitor includes an in built micropump with a flow capacity of 0 71 min 1 and is connected to the scintillation cell of the monitor and used to circulate the air in the accumulation chamber a 15 min cycle was selected for the monitor upon activation of the pump both 222rn and 220rn gases in the chamber pass through the progeny filter and into the scintillation cell as a result 222rn 220rn levels are measured in the first 5 min and have a long term background later a 5 min delay is utilized to assure that the thoron decays almost completely half life 55 6 s the final 5 min provide radon and long lived background measurement the microcontroller estimates thorium concentration by subtracting counts obtained during the first 5 min from counts measured during the last 5 min and using an appropriate calibration factor for 60 min measurements were made with a 15 min cycle interval to determine the accumulation chamber s 220rn concentration equilibrium value 220rn surface exhalation rate can be determined by using the formula as sahoo et al 2014 2 j s c e q v

ml in capacity while sampling into the bottle caution has been taken to the avoid formation of bubbles agitation in the liquid this was carried out by gently transferring the sample by putting one end of the sampling tube inside the tap or open end of the flowing water and the other end put at the bottom of the sampling bottle held in a bucket or other container as shown in fig 5 the bottles were filled completely and the volume in the bottle was replaced 4 to 5 times with the liquid sample without leaving any air volume and closed tightly to avoid any leakage the time of sampling should be noted and measurement of dissolved radon should be done within 2 4 h after the sampling a proper decay correction should be given for the delay in measurement a 5 min pumping operation was used to extract freshwater from an underground source the sampling bottle was put in a bucket of water which allowed the water to refill itself numerous times while completely exhausting the bottle s air to stop dissolved radon from escaping the bottle was tightly sealed underwater to eliminate any radon loss owing to radioactive decay on site measurements were made immediately following sample collection to determine the amount of dissolved radon in the sampling vial fig 6 depicts the setup used to conduct radon measurements a water bubbler is connected to a smart rnduo in the experimental setup aqtek system india the smart rnduo has an inbuilt zns ag coating and a 153 cm3 active volume scintillation cell sapra et al 2010 sahoo et al 2007 the instrument was routinely calibrated once a

and radionuclide content beneath the soil the gamma dose rate in the air was measured using a portable gamma survey meter model pm 1405 manufactured by polimaster ltd republic of belarus gamma dose at 1 m from the ground is not affected by airborne decay products the main cause of the gamma dose is the daughter products of radon 214pb 214bi and 210pb and thoron 212pb 212bi and 208tl that are present in the soil matrix at 1 m above the ground the outdoor gamma level was measured gamma measurements range from 0 13 μsvh 1 to 0 32 μsvh 1 as shown in table 1 smart rnduo monitor developed by barc mumbai india was employed for the determination of radon and thoron exhalation rates in soil samples and radon activity concentration in water samples 10 222rn 220rn exhalation rates table 1 contains the exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn that were determined from the soil samples used in this investigation the 222rn mass exhalation rates were shown to range from 27 mbqkg 1h 1 to 40 mbqkg 1h 1 with an average of 31 0 8 mbqkg 1h 1 it is observed that though the topography and geology conditions at each measurement site were not similar the exhalation rates did not vary significantly between them nevertheless the mass exhalation rate of 222rn was observed highest in mangmetong village and lowest in tuli as shown in fig 7 the higher level of radon mass exhalation rate might be due to appreciably enriched radium contents in this soil and underlying bedrock in the case of thoron surface exhalation rate sampling was carried out preferably by using flow mode it is observed that there is a significant variation in thoron surface exhalation rate which may be attributed to different topography and geological location of soil samples the gathered samples from various sites have different geometries and soil compositions which could have impacted the 220rn exhalation rate from the soil the 220rn surface exhalation rate ranged from 714 6 bqm 2h 1 to 2166 6 bqm 2h 1 having a mean value of 1009 9 77 1 bqm 2h 1 the surface exhalation rate of 220rn was observed highest in longkhum village as shown in fig 8 the high level of thoron might be due to appreciably large thorium contents in the soil of this region table 2 shows a comparison of the findings from the current data with those from prior data in different regions of india there could be a number of reasons for the variation of exhalation rates reported for different regions including differences in methodology as well as soil morphology lithology and geographical condition overall our findings are consistent with the reported values 11 222rn in water 222rn content in water was shown to be between 1 48 bql 1 and 2 22 bql 1 having a mean value of 1 82 0 04 bql 1 as shown in table 3 the highest 222rn concentration in the water is observed in mokokchung village as shown in fig 9 this may be because radon s escape path is constrained under subterranean water because it immediately interacts with rock that continually emits 222rn the various types of underlying bedrock found in the study area s earth s crust also influence the amount of 222rn in drinking water which includes mainly sandstone shale limestone etc additionally it has been discovered that igneous rocks tend to have greater radiation levels than sedimentary rocks like sandstone whereas certain shales and phosphate rocks have higher radioactive contents bonotto 2014 the concentration of 222rn in subterranean water samples may be related to increasing depth which lengthened the time that flowing water and the aquifer had to interact additionally larger depths of soil and rocks with higher porosities accelerate the flow of water and dissolve 222rn dissolution increasing the concentration of 222rn in subterranean water sources nevertheless the obtained values are below the usepa recommended range of 11 bql 1 1991 and much less than 100 bql 1 and 4 40 bql 1 as set by who 2004 and unscear 2008 respectively who 2004

11713,the present study of the analysis of radon in groundwater and its exhalation rates in soil was carried out in 19 selected locations in mokokchung district nagaland india the survey was carried out by employing a portable scintillation based smart rnduo monitor the radon 222rn mass exhalation rates of the soil were found to vary from 27 mbqkg 1h 1 to 40 mbqkg 1h 1 with an average of 31 0 8

data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the wake of radon and thoron s threat to people in both natural and man made environments every day much public attention has focused on their speculations due to their adverse health effects unscear 2000 this may be attributed to the alterations to the ecological processes that govern terrestrial systems including soil fertility for food production surface water bodies for flood prevention and groundwater drinking water supply froehlich 2010 radon in homes is primarily produced by soil the amount of radon in soil ranges from a few kbqm 3 up to a few hundred of kbqm 3 cosma et al 2013 the decay of radium and thorium in the earth s crust produces the radon and thoron gas which are then transported to indoor environments via two different mechanisms from the soil matrix and building material in the earth s crust 222rn and 220rn gas are formed by the decay of radium and thorium respectively and they access the interior space through two different mechanisms from the soil and construction materials matrix the first step involves an emanation from the material while the second step involves an exhalation from the matrix emanation is the step where 222rn atoms move from the dense mineral grains to the pores covered with air while exhalation involves the movement of air filled pores releasing 222rn gas into the atmosphere sahoo et al 2010 if the 222rn concentrations in the soil near a house are high then there is a probability of high radon concentrations in nearby water wells moldovan et al 2014 thus it is desired that in addition to the study of radon in the soil equal emphasis may also be given to the study of radon in the water radon is present in groundwater because of the interaction it has during movement with rocks that contain primordial uranium minerals under the surface sachs et al 1981 hess et al 1978 when water is used for various purposes and becomes agitated the 222rn gas which is only very slightly water soluble finds its way into the atmosphere both inside as well as outdoors somlai et al 2007 nazaroff et al 1997 watson et al 1993 fitzgerald et al 1997 radon accounts with over approximately 50 of the natural exposure to humans in the world and between 3 and 14 of lung cancer deaths in people are attributable to radon exposure who 2009 making it the second largest cause of death for people with lung cancer after smoking during respiration the majority of the radon gas absorbed into the lungs is breathed out however a certain fraction of the radon progeny gets attached to the lung tissue and has the potential to harm dna in the lung s delicate tissues and can cause lung cancer in this regard unscear recommends a reference value of 9 nsv bqhm 3 1 for example a person living 7000 hy 1 in a concentration of 40 bqm 3 receives an effective dose of 1 msvy 1 unscear 2000 it has been reported that miners with cumulative exposures less than 30 mbqhm 3 have an excessive relative risk from radon exposure of 1 8 per megabecquerel hours per cubic meter mbqhm 3 unscear 2006 simultaneous measurements of radon in soil and water can provide valuable significant indicators predictions of the radon potential of an area cosma et al 2013 there are numerous studies on radon in water and measurements of exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn in soil that have been assessed by researchers worldwide kumar et al 2022 singla et al 2021 rani et al 2021 singh et al 2019 poojitha et al 2020 singh et al 2020 narang et al 2018 pyngrope et al 2022 almayahi et al 2014 noverques et al

pudjadi 2015 however there are no reports on radon studies in soil and water in the residential area of the mokokchung district in view of this the present study area was originally chosen due to its geological characteristics the state of nagaland in india is an area containing metamorphic igneous and sedimentary rocks predominantly shale disang category sandstone barail category volcanic sediments limestone and pelagic ao and bhowmik 2014 these types of rocks and stones are known to contain naturally occurring radioactive elements like radium uranium and thorium these naturally occurring elements can break down or decay into the radioactive gas radon depending on the amount of these materials present they may also cause small increases in radiation levels thus the present study s main goal is to perform a thorough 222rn analysis in water as well as 222rn 220rn exhalation rates in the soils of the mokokchung district of nagaland a portable radon monitor smart rnduo designed by barc bhabha atomic research centre mumbai was the device employed for the current investigation 2 study area among nagaland s 12 districts mokokchung is one bordering assam to the north tuensang district to the east wokha and zunheboto districts to the south the district stretches across 1615 km2 and is situated between 25 56 n and 27 40 n latitude and 93 53 e and 94 53 e longitude its elevation is 1325 m above sea level fig 1 the eocene s disang series and barail series are the district s most common rocks younger tipam series rocks can also be found along the assam plains tiakumla 2014 3 geology of the study area the litho tectonic units of the palaeogene neogene and quaternary deposits are found in the research area fig 2 the palaeogene is represented by the rock types disang and barail the barail group is divided into the naogaon formation baragolai formation and tikak parbat formation in the research region the valley portion s terraces and alluvium are made up of pleistocene recent sediments and reflect the quaternary the coal shale bearing units of the tikak parbat formation and baragolai formation of the barail group which extend along the strike mathur and evans 1964 ranga rao and samanta 1987 make up the hanging wall of these thrusts these units often dip toward the southeast around tuli tzudikong and longtho the quaternary sediments that are restricted to the intermontane valleys are abundantly exposed gis and remote sensing the tipam and dupi tila groups are formed from the neogene rocks in the research region the namsang formation s pebbly beds which are a part of the dupi tila group are located above the tipam group the dihing group refers to the pleistocene pebble beds that unconformably overlie the namsang beds this group is made up of thick layers of unconsolidated barail boulders cobbles and pebbles in sand silt and clay matrix surma rocks are made up of well bedded sandstone shaly sandstone mudstone and sandy shale chakradhar and gaur 1985 4 materials and method the soil samples were taken from the 19 villages of mokokchung district nagaland and exhalation rates have been calculated for radon and thoron using a smart rnduo monitor the soil samples were taken from the neighboring residence using a hoe the samples were dug and collected at a depth of 30 cm to get pure soil samples about 1 kg of soil samples was brought to the lab in zip lock bags for analysis in the process of collecting care was taken to remove unwanted particles stones rocks grass etc from the soil in general roughly 500 600g of soil are confined in a tight metallic container coupled to the smart rnduo similarly water samples from the 19 borewells were gathered for the assessment of the 222rn level in the water utilizing a container with a tubing directly linked to the faucet to prevent water from being exposed to the atmosphere the water was gathered in 60 ml leak proof glass bottles with little permeability that had already been cleaned to prevent the formation of bubbles or agitation in the water care was given when sampling into the bottle to prevent losing any 222rn owing to radioactive decay the concentration of dissolved 222rn was measured within 2 4 h after the sample time a scintillation detector based smart rnduo radon monitor was employed to evaluate the exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn from the soil a photomultiplier tube pmt and related counting electronics are used to measure the alpha scintillations produced by 222rn and its daughter products this monitor is employed to assess the radon levels in soil water and naturally occurring radioactive materials norms sapra et al 2016 the procedures for assessing the exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn are described in the following sections radon thoron exhalation rates can be sampled into smart rnduo using diffusion or flow mode of sampling 5 222rn mass exhalation rate measurement radon exhalation rate is defined as the amount of radon liberated from a material s surface area per unit of time as a result diffusion mode of sampling was used to determine the rate of mass exhalation of radon for the investigation of the soil s mass exhalation rate of 222rn about 500 600g of the dried soil sample are contained in the mass exhalation chamber a leak tight accumulation chamber connected to the rnduo monitor model number rnduo serial number 1615 a schematic view of the measurement is shown in fig 3 smart rnduo monitor is attached to a stainless steel accumulation chamber close to cylindrical and leak free for the purpose of measuring 222rn the smart rnduo monitor was programmed to operate for 24 h on a 60 min cycle the basis for the detection technique is founded on the scintillation with zns ag method for detecting alpha particles released from sampling air 222rn and their decay products a pinhole plate that serves as a 220rn discriminator pushes air into the scintillation chamber the pinhole plate s diffusion time delay prevents the short lived 220rn from passing through it the release of 222rn and its daughter products scintillations is measured with a photomultiplier tube pmt the monitor s microprocessor uses a smart algorithm to translate the values for each cycle into concentrations of 222rn since there is no interference from humidity or trace gases because the detection principle is based on direct scintillation there is no need for any extra setup in the sample path the algorithm built into the microprocessor automatically adjusts the background readings caused by radon s residual decay products providing a continuous reading of radon concentration a detailed description of the smart rnduo and the measurement method is given elsewhere sapra et al 2010 the accumulation of radon data over time can be recovered at the end of the measurements and the least square fitting can be performed using the model eq 1 sahoo et al 2007 1 c t j m m v t c o c j m where jm may be derived from the fitted slope after the data from the previous equation was least square fitted at time t c t is the concentration of 222rn bqm 3 at time t 0 c0 represents the amount of 222rn bqm 3 in the chamber volume m is the dried sample s overall mass kg v stands for effective volume which is made up of the detector volume the porous sample volume and the residual air volume in the mass exhalation chamber m3 6 220rn surface exhalation rate measurement the 220rn was measured in flow mode as illustrated in fig 4 the monitor includes an in built micropump with a flow capacity of 0 71 min 1 and is connected to the scintillation cell of the monitor and used to circulate the air in the accumulation chamber a 15 min cycle was selected for the monitor upon activation of the pump both 222rn and 220rn gases in the chamber pass through the progeny filter and into the scintillation cell as a result 222rn 220rn levels are measured in the first 5 min and have a long term background later a 5 min delay is utilized to assure that the thoron decays almost completely half life 55 6 s the final 5 min provide radon and long lived background measurement the microcontroller estimates thorium concentration by subtracting counts obtained during the first 5 min from counts measured during the last 5 min and using an appropriate calibration factor for 60 min measurements were made with a 15 min cycle interval to determine the accumulation chamber s 220rn concentration equilibrium value 220rn surface exhalation rate can be determined by using the formula as sahoo et al 2014 2 j s c e q v

ml in capacity while sampling into the bottle caution has been taken to the avoid formation of bubbles agitation in the liquid this was carried out by gently transferring the sample by putting one end of the sampling tube inside the tap or open end of the flowing water and the other end put at the bottom of the sampling bottle held in a bucket or other container as shown in fig 5 the bottles were filled completely and the volume in the bottle was replaced 4 to 5 times with the liquid sample without leaving any air volume and closed tightly to avoid any leakage the time of sampling should be noted and measurement of dissolved radon should be done within 2 4 h after the sampling a proper decay correction should be given for the delay in measurement a 5 min pumping operation was used to extract freshwater from an underground source the sampling bottle was put in a bucket of water which allowed the water to refill itself numerous times while completely exhausting the bottle s air to stop dissolved radon from escaping the bottle was tightly sealed underwater to eliminate any radon loss owing to radioactive decay on site measurements were made immediately following sample collection to determine the amount of dissolved radon in the sampling vial fig 6 depicts the setup used to conduct radon measurements a water bubbler is connected to a smart rnduo in the experimental setup aqtek system india the smart rnduo has an inbuilt zns ag coating and a 153 cm3 active volume scintillation cell sapra et al 2010 sahoo et al 2007 the instrument was routinely calibrated once a year against a reference radon source model rn 1025 activity 110 6 kbq purchased from pylon electronics inc ottawa canada in order to confirm the accuracy of the calibration factor by using a photomultiplier tube pmt a user programmable counting interval was used to continuously count the alpha scintillations sahoo et al 2014 the following formula can be used to determine the amount of

and radionuclide content beneath the soil the gamma dose rate in the air was measured using a portable gamma survey meter model pm 1405 manufactured by polimaster ltd republic of belarus gamma dose at 1 m from the ground is not affected by airborne decay products the main cause of the gamma dose is the daughter products of radon 214pb 214bi and 210pb and thoron 212pb 212bi and 208tl that are present in the soil matrix at 1 m above the ground the outdoor gamma level was measured gamma measurements range from 0 13 μsvh 1 to 0 32 μsvh 1 as shown in table 1 smart rnduo monitor developed by barc mumbai india was employed for the determination of radon and thoron exhalation rates in soil samples and radon activity concentration in water samples 10 222rn 220rn exhalation rates table 1 contains the exhalation rates of 222rn 220rn that were determined from the soil samples used in this investigation the 222rn mass exhalation rates were shown to range from 27 mbqkg 1h 1 to 40 mbqkg 1h 1 with an average of 31 0 8 mbqkg 1h 1 it is observed that though the topography and geology conditions at each measurement site were not similar the exhalation rates did not vary significantly between them nevertheless the mass exhalation rate of 222rn was observed highest in mangmetong village and lowest in tuli as shown in fig 7 the higher level of radon mass exhalation rate might be due to appreciably enriched radium contents in this soil and underlying bedrock in the case of thoron surface exhalation rate sampling was carried out preferably by using flow mode it is observed that there is a significant variation in thoron surface exhalation rate which may be attributed to different topography and geological location of soil samples the gathered samples from various sites have different geometries and soil compositions which could have impacted the 220rn exhalation rate from the soil the 220rn surface exhalation rate ranged from 714 6 bqm 2h 1 to 2166 6 bqm 2h 1 having a mean value of 1009 9 77 1 bqm 2h 1 the surface exhalation rate of 220rn was observed highest in longkhum village as shown in fig 8 the high level of thoron might be due to appreciably large thorium contents in the soil of this region table 2 shows a comparison of the findings from the current data with those from prior data in different regions of india there could be a number of reasons for the variation of exhalation rates reported for different regions including differences in methodology as well as soil morphology lithology and geographical condition overall our findings are consistent with the reported values 11 222rn in water 222rn content in water was shown to be between 1 48 bql 1 and 2 22 bql 1 having a mean value of 1 82 0 04 bql 1 as shown in table 3 the highest 222rn concentration in the water is observed in mokokchung village as shown in fig 9 this may be because radon s escape path is constrained under subterranean water because it immediately interacts with rock that continually emits 222rn the various types of underlying bedrock found in the study area s earth s crust also influence the amount of 222rn in drinking water which includes mainly sandstone shale limestone etc additionally it has been discovered that igneous rocks tend to have greater radiation levels than sedimentary rocks like sandstone whereas certain shales and phosphate rocks have

11714,this study aims at contributing to the sustainable management of groundwater emergences located in the sindou peaks irrigated area the choice of this study area is due on the one hand to its geological context located between the sedimentary and crystalline rocks and on the other hand to its economic interest the study focused on understanding the groundwater emergences mechanism and their origin which are currently poorly known to this end geophysical investigations such as very low frequency electromagnetic vlf and self potential surveys were carried out the electromagnetic survey provided a 2d image of the subsoil conductivity and highlighted the fault zones self potential surveys confirmed the effectiveness of groundwater emergence through the fault zone shown by the electromagnetic surveys these geophysical investigations coupled with geologic hydrogeologic piezometric map and geomorphologic 3d digital elevation data have enabled the explanation of the groundwater emergence conditions furthermore the hydrochemical study is conducted by collecting and analyzing the groundwater emergences sample in dry season 2020 the physical characteristics and hydrochemical facies using the piper diagram and chebotarev evolution sequence were used to determine the origin of the groundwater the results showed three different types of springs the hillslope springs formed on the very rugged slopes of sindou peaks whose water comes from rain the overflow springs or mound form resulting from the emergence through fractured zones of kawara sindou sandstone of groundwater at the interface of the sedimentary and crystalline rocks finally the depression springs appear at the outlet of the perimeter and result from the intersection between the groundwater

compaoré 2016 sauret e 2008 have allowed an inventory and a map of all groundwater emergences areas in southwestern burkina faso these studies have indicated their disappearance and also their contribution to the flow and recharge of important rivers leraba comoé mou however these studies neither explained the mechanisms responsible for the groundwater emergences nor their origin which are

the geological context of the study area straddling the sedimentary and crystalline rocks which is suitable for groundwater emergences furthermore those groundwater emergences represent the only water resource exploited for irrigated agriculture on which depends the local economy both for its contribution to job creation and food security this study aims at contributing to the sustainable management of groundwater emergences located in the sindou peaks irrigated area to this end it will be necessary to i characterize their flow mechanisms and ii determine the origin of the groundwater 2 study area the study area which extends to 300 ha is located in the south western part of burkina faso in the cascades region it is located between latitudes 10 38 and 10 40 north and longitudes 5 09 and 5 06 30 west fig 1 the study area is administratively located between the departments of sindou and douna in the province of léraba according to ouédraogo et al 2018 the geology of the study area consists of sedimentary rocks in its northern part belonging to the vast west african precambrian basin the taoudéni basin bronner et al 1980 deynoux et al 2006 moussine pouchkine and bertrand sarfati 1997 trompette 1973 villeneuve 1990 these formations are coarse to conglomeratic sandstones with a thickness varying from 60 to 350 m lying on the metamorphic and anatectic complex of yenderé soubakaniedougou fig 1 fractures are the dominant structural features of the study area the faults preferentially affect the coarse sandstone levels and is responsible for the locally ruinous appearance of the kawara sindou sandstone gks rocks fig 2 the orientation of these fractures is sometimes variable but a family of dominant fractures particularly stands out with an nne ssw orientation compaoré 2016 ouédraogo c et al 2018 the brgm bumigeb sysmin program 1999 2003 indicates that the sedimentary rocks covering the study area are compartmentalized by two families of major regional lineaments there are lineaments oriented n s or nne sw edging the sedimentary rock fragments within the basement a second family of lineaments oriented e w to ene wsw affect the sedimentary rocks but also the basement crystalline rocks which is made up of possibly banded granulitic felsic and sometimes mafic gneisses with a tholeiitic affinity this intense fracturation of sedimentary rocks are accompanied by regular erosion of coarse and conglomeratic beds leading to the accumulation of large quantities of sand at the foot of peaks fig 2 from a hydrogeological point of view the aquifers gks in the study area are unconfined and rest in the fractured basement the gks would have a transmissivity between 2 3 10 4 m2 s and 10 10 4 m2 s and a storage coefficient between 1 10 4 and 38 1 10 4 dakouré 2003 sauret e 2008 kutangila 2019 this wide heterogeneity of transmissivity is probably due to the discontinuity of the aquifer at the contact with the permeable basement kutangila 2019 furthermore a set of springs 12 in total were mapped in the study area at the hills foot and from upstream to downstream these springs provide a cumulative flow of 65 55 m3 h in the dry season and constitute the water resource used for rice and market gardening in the off season from november to april kinglo a 2021 the study area is exploited by more than 1000 producers coming mainly from three 3 villages sindou niofila douna this area constitutes then a major interest for this south part of burkina faso 3 materiel and methods the investigations carried out in the framework of this study are essentially based on the characterization of the conditions of groundwater emergences and the determination of the origin of these waters the conditions of groundwater emergence are determined by geologic geomorphologic studies of the emergence environment and hydrochemical studies of the water flowing out archambault 1987 springer and stevens 2009 thus depending on the type of water table responsible for the flow there are various types of sources i emergence or depression spillage overflow or overtopping for unconfined aquifers ii artesian for confined aquifers iii vauclusian and diaclasian for karst aquifers archambault 1987 on the other hand based on criteria such as the force at the origin of the emergence of water the emergence orifice geomorphology the continuity or not of the water flow and the regime of variation of this flow there are respectively springs called i gravity artesian associated with volcanism ii cave waltham and fookes 2003 exposure

and structure of aquifers play an important role in the control of groundwater flow and discharge the methods commonly used are based on the one hand on digital satellite image processing techniques to extract or map linear structures that would be surface representations of tectonic accidents faults and fractures kabre p w 2012 koita m 2010 ngo a y 2010 added to that geophysical methods such as electromagnetic surveys are commonly used the vlf electromagnetic method has proven to be robust for characterizing the geology and properties of major discontinuities fractures abem 1990 adepelumi et

profiles fig 4 were made with the abem wadi consisting of three units control unit measurement unit and antenna the directions of these profiles were taken to square the area of the entire emergence intersecting them and being orthogonal to the directions of the major fractures on each electromagnetic profile direction chosen a measurement step of 5 m was taken the length of the profiles varied from 200 m to 300 m the principle of data acquisition is based on faraday s principle of electromagnetic induction the initial magnetic field b originates from military radio transmitters used for long distance transmission and whose frequency lies between 12 and 30 khz the vertical components of the induced field which depend on the structure of the subsoil through which it passes have been measured the vertical component of the field in phase with the horizontal component is called the in phase or real component eq 1 and the out of phase component is called the quadrature or imaginary component eq 2 1 i n p h a s e r e a l h z h x 2 h y 2 2 q u a d i m a g h z h x 2 h y 2 where h z h x a n d h y represent the vertical and horizontal components of the magnetic field respectively several filtering methods both analog and digital have been developed by authors for the interpretation of em vlf baker and myers 1979 chouteau et al 1996 coney 1977 fraser 1969 karous and hjelt 1983 ogilvy and lee 1991 in the case of this study the fraser 1969 filter is first applied to the data to eliminate errors and enhance the interpretability of in phase and quadrature data secondly the vlf em data were interpreted using the karous hjelt linear filter karous and hjelt 1983 ogilvy and lee 1991 the karous hjelt filter is the most widely used filter for qualitative interpretation of em vlf data this filter allows the generation of pseudo sections of apparent current density by filtering the in phase data the filter equation of karous and hjelt 1983 is given by equation eq 3 3 δ z 2 π i

points the values from h 2 to h 3 are the normalized vertical magnetic field anomalies at each of the six data points the location of the calculated current density is below the center point of the six data points 3 1 1 2 self potential self potential survey sp is a measurement technique without an external source of natural electrical potential variation existing in the subsurface hovhannissian g 2000 this method has proven to be robust for studying areas where one wants to demonstrate the link between the natural electric field variations and the electrokinetic effect resulting from the transport with the flow of groundwater of an excess of electric charges ions that exists at the pore scale ishido and mizutani 1981 revil et al 1999 robert et al 2011 consequently self potentials can be used to obtain data on groundwater fig 3 data acquisition was done using a high impedance voltmeter recording the potential difference ddp between two small electrodes fixed to the soil surface the natural electric field measurement method widely described by corwin and hoover 1979 and perrier and morat 2000 stipulates the existence of two electrode configuration techniques the base fixed and the gradient a total of three 03 ps profiles have been made fig 4 applying the fixed base configuration fig 3 according to the interpretation methods the quantitative one has been developed recently and rapidly by the following authors fournier 1989 birch 1993 patella 1997 birch 1998 sailhac and marquis 2001 revil et al 2003 darnet et al 2004 in this study the interpretation of the data was qualitative 3 1 2 geomorphological and hydrogeological approaches 3 1 2 1 geomorphological approach the usage of geomorphologic and hydrogeologic data allows the identification and understanding of drainage zones discharge zones springs and recharge zones alfaro and wallace 1994 springer and stevens 2009 thus the influence of geomorphological context in groundwater emergence has been studied this has been done by establishing a 3d digital model of the relief of the study area subsequently cross sections made in the vicinity of the springs on the 3d model have allowed a more localized appreciation of the environment geomorphology 3 1 2 2 hydrogeological approach the hydrogeological approach consisted in determining the aquifer typology and the groundwater flow directions in the study site for this purpose topographic profiles derived from the 3d digital model and piezometric map are simultaneously analyzed to highlight potential discharge zones the establishment of the piezometric map has been determined based on a measurement campaign of water table level in 10 agricultural wells with a depth ranging from 2 to 5 m 3 2 origin of spring water the determination of groundwater origin bouragba et al 2011 fakir et al 2002 and the phenomena of mixing or exchange of water between different reservoirs han et al 2010 razack and dazy 1990 sauret 2008 are based on hydrochemical characterization in this study the hydrochemical study has been done on water samples taken in the dry season this is justified by the fact that groundwater in this period is less diluted by rainwater a total of eleven 11 samples were collected ten 10 from springs and one 01 from rainfall fig 5 springs s11 and s12 were not considered as they are located near ponds where their chemical composition is strongly influenced by human activities transport and storage conditions were carried out according to standard methods for water analysis iso and others 2009 hydrogen potential ph electrical conductivity ec temperature t and dissolved solids content dsc were measured in situ with a portable kit multimeter probe of hobo brand the following methods were used to determine the concentrations of chemical elements i flame atomic absorption for ca2 mg2 na k ii back titration for so4 2 iii direct potentiometry for no2 no3 cl iv colorimetric determination of trace phosphorus made by the heteropoly blue method vi co3 2 hco3 ions determined by calculation from the ph and full alkalimetric title obtained by alkalimetric dosage with hcl values eq 4 the concentration of heavy metals fe2 cu2 mn2 pb2 zn2 ni2 cr3 cd2 al3 were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy with perkinelmer atomic absorption spectrometers certified single element standards from perkinelmer have been used for calibration the procedure of heavy metals concentration determination using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is clearly developed by elmer 1996 4 i n

chemical differentiation between the waters of the different aquifers these parameters have already been used as markers in similar studies grillot 1990 kamagate 2006 ligban et al 2009 indeed ligban et al 2009 having studied hydrogeochemical processes in the daloa square degree aquifers determined the origin of natural springs in this region grillot 1990 kamagate 2006 ligban et al 2009 in addition the chebotarev s 1955 evolution sequence has been used to appreciate the evolution stage of those groundwater emergences the appreciation of the quality of the physicochemical analysis carried out on the water samples was made by calculating the ionic balance defined as follows 5 e r a n i o n s r c a t i o n s r a n i o n s r c a t i o n s where r is the ionic concentration in méq l 4 results 4 1 characterization of the flow mechanisms of the springs 4 1 1 structural analysis by geophysical approach the results presented in fig 6 show the 2d images of the subsurface conductivity obtained from the very low frequency vlf electromagnetic surveys made in fig 4 the first representation of data fig 6 a is a set of graphs formed by the raw real part curve in phase and the raw imaginary part quadrature the curves of the raw real and imaginary parts have a shape such that the inflection point is just above the anomaly this arrangement is more accurate when the derivation or filtering system of fraser 1969 is applied thus these so called filtered curves have a positive peak real filtered curve and a negative minimum imaginary filtered curve above the anomaly conductive zone the second representation fig 6 b can be interpreted as a 2d image of the current density of the subsurface where areas with negative ratios blue color represent fresh rock and parts with positive ratios pink color represent areas of low resistivity or fractured areas therefore the vlf survey results in fig 6 show that the zones hosting the springs s1 s2 s3 s4 located at the foothills of the gks and the springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 located at the interface of the sedimentary and crystalline zones are characterized by several conductive zones fractured zones these outcropping fracture zones correspond in hydrogeology to potential groundwater flow paths as the directions of the geophysical profiles were known the fracture directions were taken perpendicular to the directions of the geophysical profiles a total of five 05 fracture directions were identified and presented in fig 7 the nw se and n1 4ne s1 4so fractures are the dominant ones in the area hosting the s1 s2 s3 s4 springs located at the foot of the gks these fractures belong to the groups of fractures that compartmentalize the kawara sindou sandstone and are responsible for its ruiniform appearance ouédraogo et al 2018 furthermore the transition zone between the sedimentary and crystalline rocks is affected by fractures with directions ne sw nne ssw wnw ese n s these fractures start in the faulted metamorphic and anatectic basement because in this zone the appearance of the kawara sindou sandstones begins with a thickness lower than the amplitude of the fractures revealed due to the rugged terrain in the spring area at the foothills of the gks the self potential survey was used to show the effectiveness of the flowing water through preferential paths fractures in the transition zone between the sedimentary and crystalline rocks in this regard fig 8 shows the evolution of the natural electric field fig 4 from the analysis of fig 8 it can be seen that the anomaly is located directly above the generating body and is noticeable on the profile by an upward in case of emergence or downward in case of infiltration shift of the profile jackson et al 2012 robert et al 2011 the 03 graphs in fig 8 confirm the vertical upward movement of groundwater to the surface for the springs located at the transition zone between sedimentary and crystalline rocks s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 4 1 2 geomorphological and hydrogeological approaches 4 1 2 1 geomorphological approach the digital elevation model of the study area fig 9 reveals that the relief of the study site is extremely rugged the observation of the topography in the vicinity of the springs located at the foot of the gks s1 s2 s3 s4 shows that all of these springs appear as a result of an abrupt 45 slope break fig 10 thus the s1 s2 s3 s4 springs would come from the rainwater infiltrating the kawara sindou sandstones through the various fractures and flows out of the surface due to the presence of the birimian basement these springs are scattered along the massive sandstone ruiniform piedmonts forming a line of springs 4 1 2 2 hydrogeological approach fig 11 shows the piezometric map of the sindou irrigated perimeter established by using water table data collected in 10 agricultural wells the depth of the wells is ranged from 2 to 5 m wells p1 and p2 were pumped at flow rates of 0 8 m3 h and 0 87 m3 h respectively and the results of those long term pumping tests were analyzed using the streltsova and boulton 1975 interpretation method it was found that the shallow aquifer has an average transmissivity of 2 4 10 4 m2 s and an average storage coefficient of s 7 4 10 4 kinglo 2021 this piezometric map represents the water levels of the unconfined shallow aquifer monitored at the end of the dry season the piezometric map shows nw se water flowing direction and two types of water flowing emerge from the interpretation a uniform flow in the northern part of the study area modified locally in the area of springs and a non uniform flow in the southern part of the perimeter characteristic of aquifers with a cylindrical water table in addition section c1 of the piezometric map fig 11 shows the spatial evolution of piezometric and topography fig 12 the groundwater hydrograph shown in fig 12 is the hyperbolic type which is characteristic of flows in the direction of increasing iso piezometric value in the area of the s12 spring the natural ground meets the static level of the unconfined surface water table this shows that the s12 spring comes from the meeting of the natural ground and the unconfined surface water table 4 2 origin of the spring water 4 2 1 physical characteristics of the water table i presents the results of the physical analysis carried out on the spring water and rainwater the analysis of table i shows that the average temperatures measured are 25 76 0 80 c 24 8 c in the springs and rain respectively these are quite similar and fall within the atmospheric temperature range of the study area 22 43 c 34 44 c lankoande et pare 2005 the ph values obtained are little dispersed and show that all of these waters are in the acidic to neutral category concerning the electrical conductivity ec values presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the s1 s2 s3 s4 springs located at the foot of the gks appear to be very poorly mineralized regarding the ec values lesser than 35 μs cm this low mineralization can also be observed in rain water 4 73 μs cm this proximity between the ec values of springs water s1 s2 s3 s4 and the rainwater would indicate a probably common origin of these waters furthermore springs s6 has high electrical conductivity fig 13 the field investigations revealed agricultural practices and use of herbicide near the emergence points of the springs these could be at the origin of the high value of the electrical conductivity of spring s6 4 2 2 the heavy metal concentration of the water table ii shows the heavy metal concentration in the water samples the analysis of table ii shows that there is the presence of fe2 cu2 mn2 and zn2 in the water samples in fact in the northern part of the study area andesite and dolerite intrusions were observed and geochemical analysis performed by past studies on the rocks showed the presence of metallic minerals au cu zn ni sn w li fe nb ta mn ouédraogo et al 2018 meanwhile the high concentration of fe2 in the water sampled from spring s4 comes also from the permanent flooding of the rice soils associated with the slightly acidic nature of the water which combined favors iron toxicity in the environment of the spring s4 4 2 3 analysis of hydrochemical facies table iii shows the concentrations of major and minor cations and anions present in the waters sampled the analysis of table iii shows that for all the waters analyzed the order of importance of the main ions can be summarized as follows magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 sodium na potassium k for the cations and bicarbonate hco3 sulfates so4 2 phosphate p04 3 nitrates no3 chlorine cl for the anions interpretation of these results using piper s triangular diagram fig 14 reveals the dominant facies of the waters correspond to a bicarbonate alkaline earth pole where magnesium is dominant the average hydrochemical facies is magnesian bicarbonate with a certain amount of calcium ca mg hco3 the hydrochemical analysis results have shown that the water from these springs has identical characteristics from the lens of hydrochemical facies to those of the aquifer formed by the gks indeed kouanda 2019 and dakouré d 2003 have shown that gks aquifers hydrochemical facies correspond to a bicarbonate alkaline earth pole additionally kouanda 2019 has shown in terms of hydrochemical facies in the gks area borehole waters springs rivers and surface reservoirs present the same type of water calcic and magnesian bicarbonate waters that result he says confirms the strong interaction between surface water and groundwater in the study area in fine the numerous perennial springs strengthen the hypothesis of a strong interaction between surface water and groundwater which explain the facies homogeneity furthermore according to chebotarev s 1955 evolution sequence water tends to evolve from recharge water bicarbonate waters to seawater chloride waters as shown below h c o 3 h c o 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 s o 4 2 c l c l s o 4 2 c l in the present study h c o 3 shows the highest values in the hydrochemical data persuasive the class of bicarbonate water indicating the initial stage of groundwater evolution which interns of freshwater quality finally although the error on the ionic balance is generally greater than 5 the results obtained are similar to those of previous studies in the area however these ionic balance values above 5 can be explained by the uncertainty linked to the evaluation of the exact volume of acid inducing the turn during the full alkalimetric title measurements from this uncertainty the errors on h c o 3 value is very important in relative value and leads to an unbalance in the ionic balance rodier 2009 5 discussion the different investigations carried out in the framework of this study have allowed the characterization of the groundwater emergences in the sindou irrigated area concerning the springs s1 s2 s3 s4 located at the foot of the gks mountains in the north the geology of the environment of these springs showed the presence of nw se fractures this direction is one of the major fracture directions affecting the gks and is responsible for their ruiniform appearance ouédraogo et al 2018 these gks rest directly on the birimian basement with visible outcrops of contact between the sandstone formations along the sindou peaks the basement constitutes a natural boundary for the infiltration of rainwater that would emerge at the surface of the gks via these fractured corridors ouédraogo et al 2018 this mechanism of groundwater emergence corresponds to that of spill sources or hillslope according to archambault 1987 the hillslope springs are found in mid slope regions with a rugged relief often indicated by a break in the slope these springs rarely isolated are spread out along the bedrock outcrop line at low points in the bedrock the hydrochemical analysis carried out on the waters of these springs gave very low electrical conductivity values close to that of the rain the chebotarev 1955 evolution sequence has shown that those waters are in the initial stage of groundwater evolution which interns of freshwater quality thus the water of springs s1 s2 s3 s4 would come from rainwater furthermore the environment of springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 located in the transition zone between the sedimentary formations are marked by fractures of ne sw nne ssw n s nw se ne sw directions revealed by the vlf electromagnetic survey and confirmed by self potential profiles these same families of fractures are faults revealed in the study area by ouédraogo et al 2018 et metelka et al 2010 these fractures affecting the s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 and s11 springs come from intrusions of the metamorphic and anatectic complex and explain the aplites and pegmatite dykes with a potassic tendency injected into the sediments and observable at the outcrop with the flow of groundwater in an nw se direction the springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 and s11 come from the gks waters which in contact with the more compact and therefore less permeable yenderé formations rise to the surface via the fracturing corridors springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 are therefore overflow springs or mound form in fine the piezometric of the surface water table of the gks compared to the topography of the study area indicate some points of exsurgence on the surface which are at the origin of springs s12 this spring is therefore a depression one since 2008 the return to the wet rainy years has been marked by positive rainfall indices in burkina faso reaching 0 80 2009 2012 and 2014 and higher than 1 or even 1 28 2008 2009 2010 and 2012 in the sahelian regions particularly in mauritania and senegal nouaceur 2020 since the springs s1 s2 s3 and s4 originate from the kawara sindou sandstone their flow rates depend on the rainfall thus the rainfall variability may affect the flow rate of the springs an increase in rainfall may tend to induce an increase in the flow rate of the spring even if in this study area an increase in the rainfall contributes to an increase in the flow rate of the springs those rainfall surpluses have caused intense flooding and runoff in the area nouaceur 2020 this climatic condition has sometimes made the area unsuitable for agriculture during the wet season letting no choice for the population to rely on the springs to practice their irrigated agriculture during the dry season added to those flood events the erosion of the ruiniform sandstone coarse and conglomerate hills of kawara sindou sandstone 60 and 350 m resting in major discordance on the birimian basement has led over these wet years to the filling of some springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 and a decrease in their flows rate kinglo 2021 ouédraogo et al 2018 6 conclusion the characterization of groundwater sources in this study is in line with the urgent need to mobilize and manage water resources efficiently to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to support and sustain irrigated activities practiced in this south part of burkina faso as a result of the field investigations the various water sources were classified into three groups sources hillslope or spill s1 s2 s3 s4 mound form or overflow s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 and depression s12 due to their emergence conditions most of these springs are sustainable however because of the pronounced erosion of the ruiniform sandstones it would be advisable to consider protective cordons for the springs to avoid their silting up and disappearance

11714,this study aims at contributing to the sustainable management of groundwater emergences located in the sindou peaks irrigated area the choice of this study area is due on the one hand to its geological context located between the sedimentary and crystalline rocks and on the other hand to its economic interest the study focused on understanding the groundwater emergences mechanism and their origin which are currently poorly known to this end geophysical investigations such as very low frequency electromagnetic vlf and self potential surveys were carried out the electromagnetic survey provided a 2d image of the subsoil conductivity and highlighted the fault zones self potential surveys confirmed the effectiveness of groundwater emergence through the fault zone shown by the electromagnetic surveys these geophysical investigations coupled with geologic hydrogeologic piezometric map and geomorphologic 3d digital elevation data have enabled the explanation of the groundwater emergence conditions furthermore the hydrochemical study is conducted by collecting and analyzing the groundwater emergences sample in dry season 2020 the physical characteristics and hydrochemical facies using the piper diagram and chebotarev evolution sequence were used to determine the origin of the groundwater the results showed three different types of springs the hillslope springs formed on the very rugged slopes of sindou peaks whose water comes from rain the overflow springs or mound form resulting from the emergence through fractured zones of kawara sindou sandstone of groundwater at the interface of the sedimentary and crystalline rocks finally the depression springs appear at the outlet of the perimeter and result from the intersection between the groundwater

introduction groundwater emergences are diffuse or localized areas of the earth where groundwater flows out to the surface castany and margat 1977 they are becoming increasingly important due to climate change threats on water resources ligban et al 2009 however despite being among the most biologically and culturally important ecosystems groundwater emergences are the ones most threatened understudied and unprotected on the planet stevens and meretsky 2008 indeed most of the work carried out on groundwater emergences was focused on their mobilization and use archambault 1987 george

basic prerequisite for the efficient management of springs or groundwater emergences in burkina faso studies carried out on groundwater emergences by authors such as kouanda 2019 dakouré d 2003 compaoré 2016 sauret e 2008 have allowed an inventory and a map of all groundwater emergences areas in southwestern burkina faso these studies have indicated their disappearance and also their contribution to the flow and recharge of important rivers leraba comoé mou however these studies neither explained the mechanisms responsible for the groundwater emergences nor their origin which are essential for their sustainable management the present work aims to characterize groundwater emergences used for irrigated agriculture in the sindou peaks irrigated area this choice is justified by the geological context of the study area straddling the sedimentary and crystalline rocks which is suitable for groundwater emergences furthermore those groundwater emergences represent the only water resource exploited for irrigated agriculture on which depends the local economy both for its contribution to job creation and food security this study aims at contributing to the sustainable management of groundwater emergences located in the sindou peaks irrigated area to this end it will be necessary to i characterize their flow mechanisms and ii determine the origin of the groundwater

09 and 5 06 30 west fig 1 the study area is administratively located between the departments of sindou and douna in the province of léraba according to ouédraogo et al 2018 the geology of the study area consists of sedimentary rocks in its northern part belonging to the vast west african precambrian basin the taoudéni basin bronner et al 1980 deynoux et al 2006 moussine pouchkine and bertrand sarfati 1997 trompette 1973 villeneuve 1990 these formations are coarse to conglomeratic sandstones with a thickness varying from 60 to 350 m lying on the metamorphic and anatectic complex of yenderé soubakaniedougou fig 1 fractures are the dominant structural features of the study area the faults preferentially affect the coarse sandstone levels and is responsible for the locally ruinous appearance of the kawara sindou sandstone gks rocks fig 2 the orientation of these fractures is sometimes variable but a family of dominant fractures particularly stands out with an nne ssw orientation compaoré 2016 ouédraogo c et al 2018 the brgm bumigeb sysmin program 1999 2003 indicates that the sedimentary rocks covering the study area are compartmentalized by two families of major regional lineaments there are lineaments oriented n s or nne sw edging the sedimentary rock fragments within the basement a second family of lineaments oriented e w to ene wsw affect the sedimentary rocks but also the basement crystalline rocks which is made up of possibly banded granulitic felsic and sometimes mafic gneisses with a tholeiitic affinity this intense fracturation of sedimentary rocks are accompanied by regular erosion of coarse and conglomeratic beds leading to the accumulation of large quantities of sand at the foot of peaks fig 2 from a hydrogeological point of view the aquifers gks in the study area are unconfined and rest in the fractured basement the gks would have a transmissivity between 2 3 10 4 m2 s and 10 10 4 m2 s and a storage coefficient between 1 10 4 and 38 1 10 4 dakouré 2003 sauret e 2008 kutangila 2019 this wide heterogeneity of transmissivity is probably due to the discontinuity of the aquifer at the contact with the permeable basement kutangila 2019 furthermore a set of springs 12 in total were mapped in the study area at the hills foot and from upstream to downstream these springs provide a cumulative flow of 65 55 m3 h in the dry season and constitute the water resource used for rice and market gardening in the off season from november to april kinglo a 2021 the study area is exploited by more than 1000 producers coming mainly from three 3 villages sindou niofila douna this area constitutes then a major interest for this south part of burkina faso 3 materiel and methods the investigations carried out in the framework of this study are essentially based on the characterization of the conditions of groundwater emergences and the determination of the origin of these waters the conditions of groundwater emergence are determined by geologic geomorphologic studies of the emergence environment and hydrochemical studies of the water flowing out archambault 1987 springer and stevens 2009 thus depending on the type of water table responsible for the flow there are various types of sources i emergence or depression spillage overflow or overtopping for unconfined aquifers ii artesian for confined aquifers iii vauclusian and diaclasian for karst aquifers archambault 1987 on the other hand based on criteria such as the force at the origin of the emergence of water the emergence orifice geomorphology the continuity or not of the water flow and the regime of variation of this flow there are respectively springs called i gravity artesian associated with volcanism ii cave waltham and fookes 2003 exposure

1969 and mineral springs the type with dominance of anions or cations 3 1 characterization of the flow mechanisms of water sources 3 1 1 geophysical approach 3 1 1 1 electromagnetic vlf the geometry and structure of aquifers play an important role in the control of groundwater flow and discharge the methods commonly used are based on the one hand on digital satellite image processing techniques to extract or map linear structures that would be surface representations of tectonic accidents faults and fractures kabre p w 2012 koita m 2010 ngo a y 2010 added to that geophysical methods such as electromagnetic surveys are commonly used the vlf electromagnetic method has proven to be robust for characterizing the geology and properties of major discontinuities fractures abem 1990 adepelumi et

cavities seepage zones hussain et al 2020 water fed fracture zones jamal and singh 2018 2018 savané i 1997 sharma and baranwal 2005 the theory and practice of the vlf method are well documented by many authors hazel et al 1988 kumar et al 2016 oluwafemi and oladunjoye 2013 omosuyi et al 2008 paterson and ronka 1971 pedersen 2002 ramesh babu et al 2007 a total of nine 09 vlf electromagnetic profiles fig 4 were made with the abem wadi consisting of three units control unit measurement unit and antenna the directions of these profiles were taken to square the area of the entire emergence intersecting them and being orthogonal to the directions of the major fractures on each electromagnetic profile direction chosen a measurement step of 5 m was taken the length of the profiles varied from 200 m to 300 m the principle of data acquisition is based on faraday s principle of electromagnetic induction the initial magnetic field b originates from military radio transmitters used for long distance transmission and whose frequency lies between 12 and 30 khz the vertical components of the induced field which depend on the structure of the subsoil through which it passes have been measured the vertical component of the field in phase with the horizontal component is called the in phase or real component eq 1 and the out of phase component is called the quadrature or imaginary component eq 2 1 i n p h a s e r e a l h z h x 2 h y 2 2 q u a d i m a g h z h x 2 h y 2 where h z h x a n d h y represent the vertical and horizontal components of the magnetic field respectively several filtering methods both analog and digital have been developed by authors for the interpretation of em vlf baker and myers 1979 chouteau et al 1996 coney 1977 fraser 1969 karous and hjelt 1983 ogilvy and lee 1991 in the case of this study the fraser 1969 filter is first applied to the data to eliminate errors and enhance the interpretability of in phase and quadrature data secondly the vlf em data were interpreted using the karous hjelt linear filter karous and hjelt 1983 ogilvy and lee 1991 the karous hjelt filter is the most widely used filter for qualitative interpretation of em vlf data this filter allows the generation of pseudo sections of apparent current density by filtering the in phase data the filter equation of karous and hjelt 1983 is given by equation eq 3 3 δ z 2 π i

points the values from h 2 to h 3 are the normalized vertical magnetic field anomalies at each of the six data points the location of the calculated current density is below the center point of the six data points 3 1 1 2 self potential self potential survey sp is a measurement technique without an external source of natural electrical potential variation existing in the subsurface hovhannissian g 2000 this method has proven to be robust for studying areas where one wants to demonstrate the link between the natural electric field variations and the electrokinetic effect resulting from the transport with the flow of groundwater of an excess of electric charges ions that exists at the pore scale ishido and mizutani 1981 revil et al 1999 robert et al 2011 consequently self potentials can be used to obtain data on groundwater fig 3 data acquisition was done using a high impedance voltmeter recording the potential difference ddp between two small electrodes fixed to the soil surface the natural electric field measurement method widely described by corwin and hoover 1979 and perrier and morat 2000 stipulates the existence of two electrode configuration techniques the base fixed and the gradient a total of three 03 ps profiles have been made fig 4 applying the fixed base configuration fig 3 according to the interpretation methods the quantitative one has been developed recently and rapidly by the following authors fournier 1989 birch 1993 patella 1997 birch 1998 sailhac and marquis 2001 revil et al 2003 darnet et al 2004 in this study the interpretation of the data was qualitative 3 1 2 geomorphological and hydrogeological approaches 3 1 2 1 geomorphological approach the usage of geomorphologic and hydrogeologic data allows the identification and understanding of drainage zones discharge zones springs and recharge zones alfaro and wallace 1994 springer and stevens 2009 thus the influence of geomorphological context in groundwater emergence has been studied this has been done by establishing a 3d digital model of the relief of the study area subsequently cross sections made in the vicinity of the springs on the 3d model have allowed a more localized appreciation of the environment geomorphology 3 1 2 2 hydrogeological approach the hydrogeological approach consisted in determining the aquifer typology and the groundwater flow directions in the study site for this purpose topographic profiles derived from the 3d digital model and piezometric map are simultaneously analyzed to highlight potential discharge zones the establishment of the piezometric map has been determined based on a measurement campaign of water table level in 10 agricultural wells with a depth ranging from 2 to 5 m 3 2 origin of spring water the determination of groundwater origin bouragba et al 2011 fakir et al 2002 and the phenomena of mixing or exchange of water between different reservoirs han et al 2010 razack and dazy 1990 sauret 2008 are based on hydrochemical characterization in this study the hydrochemical study has been done on water samples taken in the dry season this is justified by the fact that groundwater in this period is less diluted by rainwater a total of eleven 11 samples were collected ten 10 from springs and one 01 from rainfall fig 5 springs s11 and s12 were not considered as they are located near ponds where their chemical composition is strongly influenced by human activities transport and storage conditions were carried out according to standard methods for water analysis iso and others 2009 hydrogen potential ph electrical conductivity ec temperature t and dissolved solids content dsc were measured in situ with a portable kit multimeter probe of hobo brand the following methods were used to determine the concentrations of chemical elements i flame atomic absorption for ca2 mg2 na k ii back titration for so4 2 iii direct potentiometry for no2 no3 cl iv colorimetric determination of trace phosphorus made by the heteropoly blue method vi co3 2 hco3 ions determined by calculation from the ph and full alkalimetric title obtained by alkalimetric dosage with hcl values eq 4 the concentration of heavy metals fe2 cu2 mn2 pb2 zn2 ni2 cr3 cd2 al3 were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy with perkinelmer atomic absorption spectrometers certified single element standards from perkinelmer have been used for calibration the procedure of heavy metals concentration determination using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is clearly developed by elmer 1996 4 i n

chemical differentiation between the waters of the different aquifers these parameters have already been used as markers in similar studies grillot 1990 kamagate 2006 ligban et al 2009 indeed ligban et al 2009 having studied hydrogeochemical processes in the daloa square degree aquifers determined the origin of natural springs in this region grillot 1990 kamagate 2006 ligban et al 2009 in addition the chebotarev s 1955 evolution sequence has been used to appreciate the evolution stage of those groundwater emergences the appreciation of the quality of the physicochemical analysis carried out on the water samples was made by calculating the ionic balance defined as follows 5 e r a n i o n s r c a t i o n s r a n i o n s r c a t i o n s where r is the ionic concentration in méq l 4 results 4 1 characterization of the flow mechanisms of the springs 4 1 1 structural analysis by geophysical approach the results presented in fig 6 show the 2d images of the subsurface conductivity obtained from the very low frequency vlf electromagnetic surveys made in fig 4 the first representation of data fig 6 a is a set of graphs formed by the raw real part curve in phase and the raw imaginary part quadrature the curves of the raw real and imaginary parts have a shape such that the inflection point is just above the anomaly this arrangement is more accurate when the derivation or filtering system of fraser 1969 is applied thus these so called filtered curves have a positive peak real filtered curve and a negative minimum imaginary filtered curve above the anomaly conductive zone the second representation fig 6 b can be interpreted as a 2d image of the current density of the subsurface where areas with negative ratios blue color represent fresh rock and parts with positive ratios pink color represent areas of low resistivity or fractured areas therefore the vlf survey results in fig 6 show that the zones hosting the springs s1 s2 s3 s4 located at the foothills of the gks and the springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 located at the interface of the sedimentary and crystalline zones are characterized by several conductive zones fractured zones these outcropping fracture zones correspond in hydrogeology to potential groundwater flow paths as the directions of the geophysical profiles were known the fracture directions were taken perpendicular to the directions of the geophysical profiles a total of five 05 fracture directions were identified and presented in fig 7 the nw se and n1 4ne s1 4so fractures are the dominant ones in the area hosting the s1 s2 s3 s4 springs located at the foot of the gks these fractures belong to the groups of fractures that compartmentalize the kawara sindou sandstone and are responsible for its ruiniform appearance ouédraogo et al 2018 furthermore the transition zone between the sedimentary and crystalline rocks is affected by fractures with directions ne sw nne ssw wnw ese n s these fractures start in the faulted metamorphic and anatectic basement because in this zone the appearance of the kawara sindou sandstones begins with a thickness lower than the amplitude of the fractures revealed due to the rugged terrain in the spring area at the foothills of the gks the self potential survey was used to show the effectiveness of the flowing water through preferential paths fractures in the transition zone between the sedimentary and crystalline rocks in this regard fig 8 shows the evolution of the natural electric field fig 4 from the analysis of fig 8 it can be seen that the anomaly is located directly above the generating body and is noticeable on the profile by an upward in case of emergence or downward in case of infiltration shift of the profile jackson et al 2012 robert et al 2011 the 03 graphs in fig 8 confirm the vertical upward movement of groundwater to the surface for the springs located at the transition zone between sedimentary and crystalline rocks s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 4 1 2 geomorphological and hydrogeological approaches 4 1 2 1 geomorphological approach the digital elevation model of the study area fig 9 reveals that the relief of the study site is extremely rugged the observation of the topography in the vicinity of the springs located at the foot of the gks s1 s2 s3 s4 shows that all of these springs appear as a result of an abrupt 45 slope break fig 10 thus the s1 s2 s3 s4 springs would come from the rainwater infiltrating the kawara sindou sandstones through the various fractures and flows out of the surface due to the presence of the birimian basement these springs are scattered along the massive sandstone ruiniform piedmonts forming a line of springs 4 1 2 2 hydrogeological approach fig 11 shows the piezometric map of the sindou irrigated perimeter established by using water table data collected in 10 agricultural wells the depth of the wells is ranged from 2 to 5 m wells p1 and p2 were pumped at flow rates of 0 8 m3 h and 0 87 m3 h respectively and the results of those long term pumping tests were analyzed using the streltsova and boulton 1975 interpretation method it was found that the shallow aquifer has an average transmissivity of 2 4 10 4 m2 s and an average storage coefficient of s 7 4 10 4 kinglo 2021 this piezometric map represents the water levels of the unconfined shallow aquifer monitored at the end of the dry season the piezometric map shows nw se water flowing direction and two types of water flowing emerge from the interpretation a uniform flow in the northern part of the study area modified locally in the area of springs and a non uniform flow in the southern part of the perimeter characteristic of aquifers with a cylindrical water table in addition section c1 of the piezometric map fig 11 shows the spatial evolution of piezometric and topography fig 12 the groundwater hydrograph shown in fig 12 is the hyperbolic type which is characteristic of flows in the direction of increasing iso piezometric value in the area of the s12 spring the natural ground meets the static level of the unconfined surface water table this shows that the s12 spring comes from the meeting of the natural ground and the unconfined surface water table 4 2 origin of the spring water 4 2 1 physical characteristics of the water table i presents the results of the physical analysis carried out on the spring water and rainwater the analysis of table i shows that the average temperatures measured are 25 76 0 80 c 24 8 c in the springs and rain respectively these are quite similar and fall within the atmospheric temperature range of the study area 22 43 c 34 44 c lankoande et pare 2005 the ph values obtained are little dispersed and show that all of these waters are in the acidic to neutral category concerning the electrical conductivity ec values presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the s1 s2 s3 s4 springs located at the foot of the gks appear to be very poorly mineralized regarding the ec values lesser than 35 μs cm this low mineralization can also be observed in rain water 4 73 μs cm this proximity between the ec values of springs water s1 s2 s3 s4 and the rainwater would indicate a probably common origin of these waters furthermore springs s6 has high electrical conductivity fig 13 the field investigations revealed agricultural practices and use of herbicide near the emergence points of the springs these could be at the origin of the high value of the electrical conductivity of spring s6 4 2 2 the heavy metal concentration of the water table ii shows the heavy metal concentration in the water samples the analysis of table ii shows that there is the presence of fe2 cu2 mn2 and zn2 in the water samples in fact in the northern part of the study area andesite and dolerite intrusions were observed and geochemical analysis performed by past studies on the rocks showed the presence of metallic minerals au cu zn ni sn w li fe nb ta mn ouédraogo et al 2018 meanwhile the high concentration of fe2 in the water sampled from spring s4 comes also from the permanent flooding of the rice soils associated with the slightly acidic nature of the water which combined favors iron toxicity in the environment of the spring s4 4 2 3 analysis of hydrochemical facies table iii shows the concentrations of major and minor cations and anions present in the waters sampled the analysis of table iii shows that for all the waters analyzed the order of importance of the main ions can be summarized as follows magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 sodium na potassium k for the cations and bicarbonate hco3 sulfates so4 2 phosphate p04 3 nitrates no3 chlorine cl for the anions interpretation of these results using piper s triangular diagram fig 14 reveals the dominant facies of the waters correspond to a bicarbonate alkaline earth pole where magnesium is dominant the average hydrochemical facies is magnesian bicarbonate with a certain amount of calcium ca mg hco3 the hydrochemical analysis results have shown that the water from these springs has identical characteristics from the lens of hydrochemical facies to those of the aquifer formed by the gks indeed kouanda 2019 and dakouré d 2003 have shown that gks aquifers hydrochemical facies correspond to a bicarbonate alkaline earth pole additionally kouanda 2019 has shown in terms of hydrochemical facies in the gks area borehole waters springs rivers and surface reservoirs present the same type of water calcic and magnesian bicarbonate waters that result he says confirms the strong interaction between surface water and groundwater in the study area in fine the numerous perennial springs strengthen the hypothesis of a strong interaction between surface water and groundwater which explain the facies homogeneity furthermore according to chebotarev s 1955 evolution sequence water tends to evolve from recharge water bicarbonate waters to seawater chloride waters as shown below h c o 3 h c o 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 s o 4 2 c l c l s o 4 2 c l in the present study h c o 3 shows the highest values in the hydrochemical data persuasive the class of bicarbonate water indicating the initial stage of groundwater evolution which interns of freshwater quality finally although the error on the ionic balance is generally greater than 5 the results obtained are similar to those of previous studies in the area however these ionic balance values above 5 can be explained by the uncertainty linked to the evaluation of the exact volume of acid inducing the turn during the full alkalimetric title measurements from this uncertainty the errors on h c o 3 value is very important in relative value and leads to an unbalance in the ionic balance rodier 2009 5 discussion the different investigations carried out in the framework of this study have allowed the characterization of the groundwater emergences in the sindou irrigated area concerning the springs s1 s2 s3 s4 located at the foot of the gks mountains in the north the geology of the environment of these springs showed the presence of nw se fractures this direction is one of the major fracture directions affecting the gks and is responsible for their ruiniform appearance ouédraogo et al 2018 these gks rest directly on the birimian basement with visible outcrops of contact between the sandstone formations along the sindou peaks the basement constitutes a natural boundary for the infiltration of rainwater that would emerge at the surface of the gks via these fractured corridors ouédraogo et al 2018 this mechanism of groundwater emergence corresponds to that of spill sources or hillslope according to archambault 1987 the hillslope springs are found in mid slope regions with a rugged relief often indicated by a break in the slope these springs rarely isolated are spread out along the bedrock outcrop line at low points in the bedrock the hydrochemical analysis carried out on the waters of these springs gave very low electrical conductivity values close to that of the rain the chebotarev 1955 evolution sequence has shown that those waters are in the initial stage of groundwater evolution which interns of freshwater quality thus the water of springs s1 s2 s3 s4 would come from rainwater furthermore the environment of springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 located in the transition zone between the sedimentary formations are marked by fractures of ne sw nne ssw n s nw se ne sw directions revealed by the vlf electromagnetic survey and confirmed by self potential profiles these same families of fractures are faults revealed in the study area by ouédraogo et al 2018 et metelka et al 2010 these fractures affecting the s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 and s11 springs come from intrusions of the metamorphic and anatectic complex and explain the aplites and pegmatite dykes with a potassic tendency injected into the sediments and observable at the outcrop with the flow of groundwater in an nw se direction the springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 and s11 come from the gks waters which in contact with the more compact and therefore less permeable yenderé formations rise to the surface via the fracturing corridors springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 are therefore overflow springs or mound form in fine the piezometric of the surface water table of the gks compared to the topography of the study area indicate some points of exsurgence on the surface which are at the origin of springs s12 this spring is therefore a depression one since 2008 the return to the wet rainy years has been marked by positive rainfall indices in burkina faso reaching 0 80 2009 2012 and 2014 and higher than 1 or even 1 28 2008 2009 2010 and 2012 in the sahelian regions particularly in mauritania and senegal nouaceur 2020 since the springs s1 s2 s3 and s4 originate from the kawara sindou sandstone their flow rates depend on the rainfall thus the rainfall variability may affect the flow rate of the springs an increase in rainfall may tend to induce an increase in the flow rate of the spring even if in this study area an increase in the rainfall contributes to an increase in the flow rate of the springs those rainfall surpluses have caused intense flooding and runoff in the area nouaceur 2020 this climatic condition has sometimes made the area unsuitable for agriculture during the wet season letting no choice for the population to rely on the springs to practice their irrigated agriculture during the dry season added to those flood events the erosion of the ruiniform sandstone coarse and conglomerate hills of kawara sindou sandstone 60 and 350 m resting in major discordance on the birimian basement has led over these wet years to the filling of some springs s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 and a decrease in their flows rate kinglo 2021 ouédraogo et al 2018 6 conclusion the characterization of groundwater sources in this study is in line with the urgent need to mobilize and manage water resources efficiently to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to support and sustain irrigated activities practiced in this south part of burkina faso as a result of the field investigations the various water sources were classified into three groups sources hillslope or spill s1 s2 s3 s4 mound form or overflow s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 and depression s12 due to their emergence conditions most of these springs are sustainable however because of the pronounced erosion of the ruiniform sandstones it would be advisable to consider protective cordons for the springs to avoid their silting up and disappearance
