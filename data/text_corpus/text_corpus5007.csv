25035,eukaryotic microalgae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria often collectively described as algae have been proposed as a promising commercially viable feedstock for biofuels and other bioproducts open pond algal monocultures are subjected to environmental fluctuations i e temperature limiting productivity as environmental conditions vary an approach to overcome such limitation is the replacement of monocultures with customized polycultures that leverage diversity productivity relationships by exploiting complementary but uninhabited ecological niches defining ecological niche complementarity requires an understanding of how traits and trade offs interact across environmental gradients and for this reason numerical models represent valuable tools to explore the possible solution space prior to experimental design and verification we have developed a trait based dynamic energy budget model tb deb of microalgal monocultures and polycultures and simulated the growth of random and customized polycultures under environmental conditions i e temperature photoperiod similar to those in operational algal ponds across the us each of the algal species selected as a polyculture component is defined by distinct combinations of literature derived traits related to substrate uptake light utilization and temperature optima members of the polycultures were categorized into algal functional guilds that were defined based on the interaction between thermal traits and pond thermal regimes when compared to guilds defined by taxonomy we demonstrate that grouping algal guilds by functional traits can be an effective approach towards improving biomass productivity in operational algal ponds simulations show that a polyculture represents the equivalent of a wider niche monoculture leading to sustained productivity across seasons simulations also revealed that higher species diversity and higher functional diversity lead to higher system biomass in all results from this modeling study and earlier experimental studies highlight the idea that regardless of the functional group definition systematic selection of species based on knowledge of physiology ecology and the environment aiming at maximizing use of niche space through complementarity has positive impacts on system productivity keywords dynamic energy budget trait based model functional diversity species diversity algal productivity 1 introduction open pond systems of eukaryotic microalgae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria often collectively described as algae have offered the most feasible and cost effective way of scaling up biofuel production benemann 2013 mcbride and merrick 2014 however open pond monoculture operations face challenges to sustainable production due to their open nature algal ponds experience biotic contamination by grazers pathogens and non target algal strains carney et al 2014 smith and crews 2014 decreasing productivity leão et al 2012 schmidtke et al 2010 and often resulting in pond collapse forehead and o kelly 2013 letcher et al 2013 while these competitive and trophic interactions are complex certain combinations of physiological traits of various algal species may also be incompatible with efficient growth within open pond systems that experience environmental fluctuation fluctuating environmental conditions affect the consistency of productivity across operational time spans for example the growth rates of algal species are temperature dependent and vary among strains butterwick et al 2005 as a result natural temperature fluctuations can result in suboptimal growth temperatures for algal monocultures reducing otherwise achievable yields waller et al 2012 recently there have been calls for the application of ecological principles for sustained growth of outdoor algal polycultures nalley et al 2014 newby et al 2016 smith and mcbride 2014 in particular two mechanisms underpinning the positive relationships between functional diversity system stability and productivity have been discussed the sampling effect and the complementarity effect nalley et al 2014 the former describes a positive relationship between diversity and productivity due to a greater probability of a high productivity strain being part of the community doak et al 1998 hooper et al 2005 the latter describes the process whereby niche occupation is increased by species with different growth requirements and resource acquisition strategies co existing cumulatively contributing to increased system productivity functional traits are morphological physiological or phenological characteristics of an organism that are vital to its fitness in a given environment violle et al 2007 and metrics of functional trait composition díaz and cabido 2001 have replaced traditional functional group assignments as explanatory variables of biodiversity productivity relationships ebeling et al 2014 recent experiments have demonstrated the importance of functional richness over species richness in determining the productivity of the algal polycultures behl et al 2011 corcoran and boeing 2012 shurin et al 2014 2013 stockenreiter et al 2013 this has promoted a move away from assembling algal polycultures through random selection hamilton et al 2014 that can lead to productivity crashes due to niche competition and towards strategies for assembling algal communities based on trait complementarity promoting the efficient utilization of resources e g light and nutrients under fluctuating environmental conditions nalley et al 2014 mathematical models are an attractive approach to understand and predict drivers of algal productivity in biofuel production systems across a range of scales flynn 2010 flynn et al 2017 kenny and flynn 2016 2014 weyer et al 2010 xin et al 2013 such models vary significantly in complexity from those employed to predict theoretical maximum algal oil production weyer et al 2010 to those that mechanistically represent algal photosynthesis novoderezhkin and van grondelle 2010 xin et al 2013 dynamic energy budget models deb differ from the abovementioned models in that they explicitly represent intra cellular allocation of resource pools regulated by substrate stoichiometry and environmental stress kooijman 2010 2009 deb models of microalgae and phytoplankton have previously simulated nutrient uptake poggiale et al 2010 and growth dynamics lorena et al 2010 the majority of these approaches simulate monocultures and to our knowledge no current trait based modeling studies have explored the relationship between algal community diversity and productivity for biofuel production in algal open ponds and raceways interacting light and temperature regimes provide a wide range of potential ecological niches for different algae it is therefore conceivable that the emergence of an optimally diverse community may occur algal polycultures are highly amenable to trait based modeling decades of laboratory experiments have provided key data for model parameterization with traits relating to resource acquisition efficiency such as light edwards et al 2015b schwaderer et al 2011 and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus edwards et al 2013 2012 litchman et al 2009 having been compiled and analyzed in detail building on these prior analyses that provide trade off relationships between traits and allometric scaling relationships between traits and cell size we describe the development of a trait based dynamic energy budget tb deb model to explore how microalgal species diversity or functional diversity impact polyculture productivity across systems with varying environmental conditions characteristic of open ponds first we conducted benchmark simulations and compared results of the tb deb model to data from a chemostat experiment in the subsequent ensemble of simulations we projected seasonal variations in biomass productivities of designed hypothetical algal polycultures using environmental data summer and winter temperature regimes and photosynthetically active radiation par derived from operational algal ponds within the algae testbed public private partnership atp3 consortium https openei org wiki atp3 data algal polycultures were designed with the goals of exploring 1 the relevance of guild categorizations based on thermal functional traits and site thermal regime to relate trait variance and productivity 2 the importance of polyculture relative to monocultures towards maintaining productivity on seasonal timescales and 3 the effect of species and functional diversity on pond productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 dynamic energy budget model fig 1 shows the schematic of the deb model for a single microalga a more detailed account of the theoretical framework and description of the deb model have been published previously da cunha e lorena 2008 kooijman 2010 2009 lorena et al 2010 here we describe reserve dynamics and growth as represented by the model in this model microalgae assimilate carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from the environment into the respective intracellular reserves the mass balance of each of the reserves is 1 d d t m e i j e i a j e i c κ e i j e i r r m e i where mei is the reserve density of reserve mole of reserve per mole of structure mv i in this case i 1 2 3 for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the first term in the balance represents input from assimilation uptake flux the second term represents reserve outflux for maintenance and growth the third term represents fraction of the flux not used in the synthesis of biomass structure returning to the reserve see supporting information while the last term represents a dilution effect on the reserve due to structural growth e g when reserve mass remains constant while the structure increases the reserve density is in fact decreasing with the maintenance flux taking precedence over growth the specific growth flux from each reserve is 2 j e i g j e i c j e i m where jeic is the second outflux term in eq 1 while jeim is the specific maintenance flux see supporting information the specific growth fluxes jeig from the reserves i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus then go into the growth synthesizing unit su fig 1 following su theory for parallel and complementary substrates kooijman 2009 these fluxes are merged following stoichiometric constraints to synthesize one mole of biomass structure as such specific growth flux for structural growth r is 3 r j e i g y e i g 1 j e i g y e i g 1 1 where yeig is the yield coefficient which is a conversion factor base on stoichiometry i e number of moles of carbon nitrogen phosphorus required to synthesize one mole of structure the mass balance for biomass structure is 4 d d t m v r h m v where r is the specific growth rate while h is the loss rate due to processes such as mortality or dilution below we describe modified model functions for algal resource acquisition 2 1 1 equilibrium chemistry approximation kinetics for uptake of resources the assimilation uptake of resources is represented by michaelis menten formulation in standard deb theory in this model the equilibrium chemistry approximation eca formulation a first order approximation to the equilibrium chemistry ec solution is utilized in general substrate uptake kinetics in any substrate consumer relationship subject to total quasi steady state assumption can be categorized as an ec problem tang and riley 2013 the use of this eca formulation is especially important when simulating multiple competitors for common substrates where the mass balance constraint of the substrate and that of the organism enzyme must be considered the eca kinetics formulation has been applied to modeling of plant microbial nutrient competition biogeochemical models zhu et al 2017 the resulting general mathematical formulation calculating the uptake rate uij i e uptake of substrate

rate b is enzyme concentration algal biomass concentration in our case s is substrate and is the half saturation or substrate affinity constant the second term within the parenthesis in the denominator represents modulation of the substrate affinity by competing substrates while the third term represents modulation of the substrate affinity by competing consumers algae in our case in the current model the eca formulation is adopted to describe the dynamics between multiple algal guilds and macronutrients from the environment i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus specifically in order to represent multiple algae competition for common substrate modulation by competing substrates can be dropped from eq 5 the resulting equation representing uptake of resource i by algae w w 1 n becomes

temperature function is similar to that described by thomas et al 2016 unimodal and negatively skewed both temperature functions follow the ratkowsky curves ratkowsky et al 1982 the characteristic curve describing thermal sensitive of biological reactions e g in reptiles fish algae bacteria is well established izem and kingsolver 2005 kingsolver 2017 licht 1967 and are described by three

described below this thermal function is applied to parameters describing rates i e maximum uptake rate specific maintenance costs and reserve turnover rate 2 1 3 model parameterization trait data allometric scaling and trade off relationships we took advantage of the wealth of literature on marine algal physiology and utilized extensive datasets of traits representing 1 photosynthetic rates edwards et al 2015b 2 nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates edwards et al 2015a and 3 temperature optima thomas et al 2016 to parameterize the forty eight algal species note these forty species overlap between edwards et al 2015a 2015b and thomas et al 2016 database in the model table s2 while not all are biofuel strains they share physiological characteristics with the breadth of biofuel strains traits impacting the uptake kinetics i e maximum uptake rate vmax and nutrient concentration at which uptake is half saturated ks of the microalgal species govern their fitness under prescribed nutrient supply regimes edwards et al 2012 demonstrated that 1 vmax for both nitrate and phosphate uptake scale allometrically and 2 vmax and ks exhibit a positive relationship indicative of a trade off between uptake rate and uptake affinity furthermore aksnes and egge 1991 assuming a spherical cell shape noted that vmax is proportional to the number of uptake sites on the cell surface i e number of uptake sites increases with cell surface area since vmax scales linearly with the cell surface 4π r2 it scales with cell volume 4 3 π r3 with an exponent of 2 3 0 67 on the other hand ks increases linearly with cell radius as such vmax should scale with ks with an exponent of 2 i e ks 2 aksnes and egge 1991 allometric values and vmax and ks values for nitrate and phosphate were derived from the edwards et al 2015a 2015b dataset table s3 these trait values were then used to 1 test for allometric scaling relationships and 2 quantify the trade off relationship between vmax and ks the output showed that vmax for both nitrate and phosphate uptake scale allometrically with exponents of 0 64 and 0 66 for vmax n and vmax p respectively fig 2 in litchman et al 2007 vmax for nitrate follows 2 3 scaling exponent i e cell volume 0 6667 as shown in aksnes and egge 1991 in edwards et al 2012 exponents are greater than 2 3 for both nitrate cell volume n n 0 68 0 98 and phosphate cell volume n n 0 81 1 1 as larger cells tend to deviate from a spherical shape and this could contribute to deviation from the theoretical value analysis also revealed vmax n ks n and vmax p ks p trade off relationships with exponents of 0 93 and 1 96 respectively fig 2 while the exponent for vmax p ks p is close to the theoretical value of 2 there is deviation for the exponent for vmax n ks n earlier study by litchman et al 2007 also showed that vmax n scaled with cell volume and stay close to exponent of 2 3 however in the same study the exponent of vmax n ks n trade off also deviate from 2 at 2 8 closer to 3 such deviation can be attributed to factors other than cell volume affect ks n as suggested by edwards et al 2012 maranon 2015 suggested that such variations uncertainties could also be due to limitations in data compiled data from cultures experiencing different growth conditions and varying measurement protocols 2 1 4 model parameterization environmental forcing simulations were conducted using environmental data from the algae testbed public private partnership atp3 consortium which consists of a network of algal biomass production facilities that provide support for research and commercialization of algal biofuels fig s1 shows temperature and par data from summer and winter of 2014 for three of the test beds used in the current simulations asu western usa climate arid to semi arid cell pacific ocean climate tropical and gt eastern usa climate humid subtropical 2 2 categorization of algal guilds based on thermal traits and site temperature the thermal function as defined in eq 7 above takes into account the topt tmin and tmax of an algal species at a given temperature in time t t eq 7 calculates f t t a value between 0 1 at each site we derived summer and winter time series of f t for each algal species from which a mean seasonal f t value was calculated for each season i e one for summer and one for winter if the mean f t values were greater than 0 25 for both summer and winter the algal species were categorized as thermal generalists if the mean seasonal f t value was greater than 0 25 for summer but less than 0 25 for winter we categorized the species as a thermal specialist able to grow in the summer temperature regime guild high temperature or the winter for low temperature guild fig s2 by taking into consideration site temperature trends in the classification of the algal species into functional guilds we note that the subsequent composition within each functional guild shows site dependent variability table s3 showed the algal guilds for each of the sites cell is notably different from either asu or gt while the algal species in asu and gt can be classified into high temperature low temperature and thermal generalist functional guilds the algal species in cell can only be classified into either low temperature or thermal generalist this is due to the small temperature difference between summer and winter temperatures in hawaii fig s1 in hawaii the maximum and minimum temperatures were 38 and 20 c and 30 and 16 c for summer and winter respectively as a result of the high degree of overlap between summer and winter temperature ranges the majority of the algal species fall into the thermal generalist guild the remaining algal species are those with extreme low growth temperature e g phaeocystis antartica and fell into the low temperature guild in comparison in arizona the maximum and minimum temperature were 45 and 21 c and 28 and 0 c for summer and winter respectively in gt the maximum and minimum temperature were 33 5 and 17 3 c and 16 1 and 0 c for summer and winter respectively in summary the forty eight algal species were distributed into the three functional groups at the three sites numbers in brackets indicates the number of algal species in the functional group i asu thermal generalist 20 low temperature 11 and high temperature 17 ii gt thermal generalist 12 low temperature 12 and high temperature 24 iii cell thermal generalist 36 low temperature 12 2 2 1 benchmark simulation first the modified algal deb model was used to simulate changes in total carbon in the algal biomass structure and reserve which were compared to measurements of particulate carbon pawlowski 2004 this experiment measured the growth of thalassiosira weissflogii under nitrogen and light limiting conditions within a chemostat simulation conditions approximated those from the original experiment t weissflogii was initially grown in batch culture under constant light i 250 μem 2 s 1 before being transferred to a chemostat under a light dark diurnal cycle on days 5 24 and constant light treatment i 100 μem 2 s 1 after day 24 input nitrate concentration was 70 μm and aqueous co2 concentration was set at 1 mm corresponding to pco2 350 μatm following lorena et al 2010 initial algal biomass was set at 0 1 mm the use of data from the pawlowski 2004 experiment allowed comparison against an earlier deb model simulation lorena et al 2010 finally in addition to the eca formulations our deb model differs from that described by lorena et al 2010 by the representation of an intracellular phosphorus pool in addition to intracellular carbon and nitrogen pools parameters related to carbon nitrogen uptake kinetics follow those from lorena et al 2010 table s1 2 2 2 algal polyculture simulations in the subsequent simulations fig 3 we projected seasonal summer and winter variations in biomass productivities of designed hypothetical algal polycultures using environmental data from asu gt and cell all simulations were conducted in chemostat mode with input dic concentration at 5 mm din concentration at 0 75 mm and dip concentration at 0 15 mm dilution rate was set at 0 3 d 1 in this first set of simulations algal polycultures were designed with the goal of exploring the relevance of guild categorizations based on thermal functional traits and site thermal regime to relate trait variance and productivity the simulated algal polycultures consisted of all the forty eight algal species hereafter known as random assembly model simulations were initialized with identical biomass and community shifts of the forty eight algal species were tracked over time through summer and winter climate regimes at each site the simulated algal biomass yields of each member in this random assembly were analyzed based on guild categorizations as defined by 1 algae taxonomy e g diatom dinoflagellate or 2 functional thermal traits i e optimal growth temperature maximum and minimum persistence temperature and pond thermal regime in the second set of simulations algal polycultures were designed to test 1 the importance of polycultures relative to monocultures towards maintaining productivity on seasonal timescales and 2 the effect of species and functional diversity on pond productivity we designed in silico algal polycultures with increasing functional and species diversity each in silico algal polyculture is inoculated with n number of algal species where n represents a species diversity of 4 8 or 10 the species were randomly chosen from one of the defined thermal guilds low temperature high temperature or thermal generalist furthermore to test the effects of complementarity additional simulations were conducted where half of the species represented the low temperature guild and half the high temperature guild fig 3 for each species richness n and functional guilds twenty five simulations were run to increase the probability that all algal species in the functional guild were chosen at least once all polyculture simulations were run across summer and winter months that we have environmental data for range between 80 102 days depending on site data availability 3 results benchmark simulations show that the model reproduces the particulate carbon sum of carbon in algal biomass and reserve trend with an overall r2 of 0 8 fig 4 the model captured the oscillatory trend during the chemostat mode when the system was subjected to a light cycle fig 4a and b regression statistics for observed vs simulated particulate carbon showed a slope of 1 06 0 1 p 0 001 indicating that the model tended to under predict total c values fig 4c in the random assembly simulations simulations were initialized with identical biomass 0 0001 m and community shifts of the forty eight algal species were tracked over time through summer and winter climate regimes at each site these simulated algal biomass yields were analyzed based on the guild s organization i e taxonomy or functional thermal traits simulations of taxonomically grouped guilds showed that the diatom chlorophytes cryptophyte phaeocystis and raphidophyte biomass increased in both the summer and winter at all sites fig 5 right columns by contrast the cyanobacterial biomass decreased at all sites within this taxonomic guild structure diatoms showed the greatest increase in biomass by 0 03 m in both seasons at all sites at cell simulated biomass increased for all guilds with the exception of cyanobacteria in the winter and summer at asu and gt the diazotroph dinoflagellate eustigmatroph and haptophyte guilds increased in biomass over the summer and decreased during winter we explored whether cell size plays a significant role in taxonomic guild classification by plotting the cell size distribution of each taxon fig s3a analyses show that diatoms and dinoflagellates have the highest cell volume and due to allometric scaling have the highest nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates while the cyanobacteria have the lowest cell volume and lowest nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates when the same simulated biomass of the forty eight algal species of the random assembly were grouped according to functional thermal traits results show that different guilds show changes in active biomass consistent with their thermal traits fig 5 left columns at all sites the biomass of thermal generalists increased by 0 014 0 04 m relative to the starting biomass 0 0012 0 0036 m varies depending on classification at each site by the end of each season i e summer and winter at asu and gt the low temperature guild shows a considerable fluctuation in biomass with a summertime reduction of 3 00 10 4 m in biomass relative to initialized conditions and 1 25 10 2 m increase in biomass during winter by contrast the low temperature guild at cell showed a 20 biomass loss during both seasons at asu and gt the high temperature guild showed 5 00 10 4 m reduction in biomass over the winter and 1 9 10 2 m increase in biomass during summer due to the temperature regime in cell i e similar summer and winter temperatures the emergent algal community could only be subdivided into two guilds i e low temperature and thermal generalist similar to taxonomic grouping we explored whether cell size plays significant role in thermal guild classification fig s3b and c and analysis showed that thermal guilds were comprised of members covering a wide range of cell sizes suggesting that cell size plays an insignificant role in the thermal guild classification in the second set of simulations growth of algal polycultures with different combinations of functional thermal and species diversities were simulated over different seasons i e summer and winter temperature regimes cumulative biomass across seasons summer winter of the polycultures consisting of species from both low temperature and high temperature guilds were compared against the biomass of respective members of the low temperature and high temperature guilds grown in monoculture under both gt and asu thermal regimes the polycultures showed higher productivities than the monocultures fig 6 a and c temperature range as bounded by tmin and tmax spanned by algal monocultures from both low temperature and high temperature guilds were compared against the temperature range spanned by algal polycultures at both sites polycultures spanned a wider temperature range than the monocultures fig 6b and d further analysis of the polyculture simulations showed that polycultures showed positive relationships between species richness and algal biomass fig 7 within polycultures consisting of members from one functional guild at the asu pond regime biomass increased with species richness with linear regressions fig 7a c slope m number of species values range from 0 00098 0 00269 within the gt pond regime biomass within polycultures consisting of either low temperature fig 7f linear regression slope 0 00160 or thermal generalist fig 7g linear regression slope 0 00116 guilds also increased with species richness in polycultures consisting of species from the high temperature guild increase in biomass with species richness is minimal fig 7e linear regression slope 0 000477 moreover this relationship was not statistically significant results for polycultures consisting of two functional groups at asu fig 7d linear regression slope 0 0026709 and gt fig 7h linear regression slope 0 0016059 showed that algal biomass tended to increase with species richness concurrent analysis of the number of extant species at the end of polyculture simulations also revealed positive relationships between extant species richness and initial species richness fig s4 we further performed two way anova tests on the results from the second set of simulations to explore the influence of species richness and functional group richness on productivity i e cumulative biomass at the end summer and winter of the polycultures at asu and gt at both sites results show that species richness and functional group richness positively influence biomass production and functional richness is a statistically significant factor variable fig 8 a asu species 4 8 10 f 14 98 p 0 000163 functional groups high temperature and high

pond monoculture operations experience fluctuating environmental conditions affecting the consistency of productivity across operational time spans towards achieving higher and reliable biomass yields in open pond systems a strategic move to the optimization of polycultures based on ecological theory has been proposed nalley et al 2014 newby et al 2016 smith and mcbride 2014 in utilizing such strategies the methods for assembling algal communities become important communities assembled randomly can lead to decreased productivity due to niche competition hamilton et al 2014 nalley et al 2014 based on diversity productivity relationships recent algal polyculture experimental studies for biofuel production have investigated how higher rates of productivity biomass could be achieved by assembly of polycultures based on taxonomy shurin et al 2014 in this study we show that higher species diversity and higher functional diversity both result in increased system productivity figs 7 and 8 in fig 7 regression line slope values for polycultures consisting of two functional groups are higher than polycultures consisting of single functional group i e low temperature or high temperature guilds suggesting increasing functional diversity confer higher positive impact on productivity than increasing species richness alone increase in biomass and number of extant species in response to increased species diversity figs 7 and s5 provide support for the hypothesis of higher diversity leads to more efficient use of resources and higher productivity the increase in productivity in response to increased species diversity can be attributed to two mechanisms sampling effect and complementarity nalley et al 2014 newby et al 2016 smith and mcbride 2014 the sampling effect would suggest that as diversity increases there is higher probability that fast growing algal strains are represented in the polyculture furthermore in polycultures with higher diversity within a thermal guild the niche space related to optimal temperature and nutrient uptake kinetics is wider than the monoculture of any singular strain i e complementarity complementarity can also explain the increase in productivity in response to increases in functional diversity despite the positive impact of species diversity within the same thermal guild on productivity when environmental temperatures fall outside of the optimal temperature niche space of any monoculture or polyculture comprised of members of the same thermal guild growth is constrained the inclusion of members from another thermal guild enhances productivity under broader temperature regimes further due to niche complementarity competitive interactions are offset reduced between the members of the two guilds as clearly shown in fig 6 polycultures including members from different thermal guilds increase functional trait space coverage leading to sustained productivity across the seasons when compared against monocultures niche complementarity however is rarely a product of individual traits for example when emergent algal communities from the random assembly simulations were grouped by taxonomy fig 5 right column traits that are related to nutrient uptake and phylogenetically conserved due to allometric scaling were also key to the relative fitness of algal species in addition to the thermal traits as reported previously edwards et al 2013 2012 litchman et al 2007 based on data trade off relationships between the parameters vmax ks were developed such vmax ks trade off relationships represent impact of nutrient availability on controlling size distribution of phytoplankton large cells while having high vmax are constrained by have high ks values thus making them poor competitors under nutrient poor conditions vmax ks trade off relationships have been utilized in earlier modeling studies such as in follows et al 2007 to reproduce biogeography of phytoplanktons in oceans other trade off processes important in structuring phytoplankton communities in natural waters are discussed in marañón 2014 in marañón 2014 the presence of trade off processes related to nutrient requirement acquisition and use confer high growth rate to cells of intermediate size 10 um diameter 103 um3 volume and offer explanation to the observed unimodal nature of size distribution of bloom forming phytoplankton species while large cells still maintain higher maximum nutrient uptake rates i e allometric scaling than smaller cells their growth rate becomes limited by slower nutrient assimilation into biomass in this work under high nutrient conditions reflective of algal pond conditions the vmax ks trade off resulted in the dominance of diatoms cell volume range from 101 105 um3 fig 5 simulated diatoms having larger initial biomass also contribute to their dominance in the first set of community polyculture simulations fig 5 it should be noted that this was not intentional the forty eight strains were each initialized with similar biomass but due to the higher representation of diatoms followed by dinoflagellates in the dataset in addition as shown in this study fig s6 and also pointed out in thomas et al 2016 diatoms have wide niche widths difference between tmax and tmin allowing them to compete effectively across a range of temperature regimes this may be representative of actual niche width or again possibly due to diatom coverage bias in the databases of edwards et al 2015a 2015b and thomas et al 2016 from which our parameters were derived in this study we show that the assembly of algal consortia based on functional traits may be a promising approach towards improving biomass productivity in operational algal ponds this direct manipulation of functional diversity has gained traction in biodiversity research in vegetation cadotte et al 2013 ebeling et al 2014 with functional type and more recently trait based metrics being considered as alternate metrics to phylogenetic diversity in studies of diversity productivity relationships cadotte et al 2009 diaz and cabido 1997 lavorel et al 1997 in this study our algal guilds were defined based on the interaction between thermal traits and pond thermal regimes driven by environmental forcing of operational algal ponds this type of functional grouping reduced complexity and encompassed nutrient competition traits that are more phylogenetically conserved i e similar range of cell volumes between each thermal guild as shown in fig s3b simulated emergent algal communities from the random assembly grouped based on thermal traits and under distinct pond thermal regimes clearly showed the impacts of summer and winter temperature regimes on the productivities of low temperature and high temperature guilds our results suggest that functional type groupings are best applied to cases when environmental factors forcings are unregulated by management e g outdoor ponds resulting in inefficient growth due to suboptimal niche widths that are characteristic of monoculture systems biomass optimization by designing consortia with complementary thermal traits would clearly have a greater impact on yield in locations with distinct seasonal thermal regimes in the simulations based on hawaiian environmental conditions cell in the absence of distinct thermal regimes narrower environmental niche widths selects for algal species that fall into the thermal generalist guild resulting in decreased potential of enhancing yield by maximizing niche complementarity as a result in contrast with the other sites with more distinct thermal regimes the simulated emergent algal communities at cell are similar after winter and summer thermal regimes fig s4 5 conclusion and outlook in all results from this modeling study and earlier experimental studies shurin et al 2014 highlight the idea that regardless of the functional group definition maximizing use of niche space through complementarity can confer positive impacts on system productivity we found greater positive impacts of functional diversity over species diversity on productivity and propose that the systematic selection of species should be performed based on knowledge of physiology ecology and the environment in order to maximize available niche space and enhance the productivity of open bioalgal ponds in our current work the model system is representative of well mixed chemostats the use of trait based modeling framework to elucidate patterns in bulk community responses to environmental changes follows earlier modeling works e g bouskill et al 2012 patterns of nitrification rates across environmental and substrate gradients allison 2012 patterns in litter decompositions while benchmarking against data of more algal species can improve confidence of the model for individual monocultures when it comes to productivity of algal community it is not certain that the whole is the sum of the individual parts however towards simulating community productivity in operating algal ponds additional benchmark simulations preferably across different taxonomies can point out ecological strategies employed by the different algal taxonomic groups that need to be incorporated into the current model one such mechanism is the sinking rates of algae as function of cell size in follows et al 2007 phytoplanktons are assigned sink rates based on cell size larger cells sink faster than smaller cells coupled with the presence of light gradient in algal raceways the differential sinking rates translate into differential productivities in algal cells across the depth of the water column clearly other traits such as predator prey interactions like rotifer grazing e g differential grazing pressure based on cell size and interaction between algae and bacteria or fungi are also important considerations frameworks such as the modeling approach described here could be used to explore pond productivity while considering

25035,eukaryotic microalgae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria often collectively described as algae have been proposed as a promising commercially viable feedstock for biofuels and other bioproducts open pond algal monocultures are subjected to environmental fluctuations i e temperature limiting productivity as environmental conditions vary an approach to overcome such limitation is the replacement of monocultures with customized polycultures that leverage diversity productivity relationships by exploiting complementary but uninhabited ecological niches defining ecological niche complementarity requires an understanding of how traits and trade offs interact across environmental gradients and for this reason numerical models represent valuable tools to explore the possible solution space prior to experimental design and verification we have developed a trait based dynamic energy budget model tb deb of microalgal monocultures and polycultures and simulated the growth of random and customized polycultures under environmental conditions i e temperature photoperiod similar to those in operational algal ponds across the us each of the algal species selected as a polyculture component is defined by distinct combinations of literature derived traits related to substrate uptake light utilization and temperature optima members of the polycultures were categorized into algal functional guilds that were defined based on the interaction between thermal traits and pond thermal regimes when compared to guilds defined by taxonomy we demonstrate that grouping algal guilds by functional traits can be an effective approach towards improving biomass productivity in operational algal ponds simulations show that a polyculture represents the equivalent of a wider niche monoculture leading to sustained productivity across seasons simulations also revealed that higher species diversity and higher functional diversity lead to higher system biomass in all results from this modeling study and earlier experimental studies highlight the idea that regardless of the functional group definition systematic selection of species based on knowledge of physiology ecology and the environment aiming at maximizing use of niche space through complementarity has positive impacts on system productivity keywords dynamic energy budget trait based model functional diversity species diversity algal productivity 1 introduction open pond systems of eukaryotic microalgae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria often collectively described as algae have offered the most feasible and cost effective way of scaling up biofuel production benemann 2013 mcbride and merrick 2014 however open pond monoculture operations face challenges to sustainable production due to their open nature algal ponds experience biotic contamination by grazers pathogens and non target algal strains carney et al 2014 smith and crews 2014 decreasing productivity leão et al 2012 schmidtke et al 2010 and often resulting in pond collapse forehead and o kelly 2013 letcher et al 2013 while these competitive and trophic interactions are complex certain combinations of physiological traits of various algal species may also be incompatible with efficient growth within open pond systems that experience environmental fluctuation fluctuating environmental conditions affect the consistency of productivity across operational time spans for example the growth rates of algal species are temperature dependent and vary among strains butterwick et al 2005 as a result natural temperature fluctuations can result in suboptimal growth temperatures for algal monocultures reducing otherwise achievable yields waller et al 2012 recently there have been calls for the application of ecological principles for sustained growth of outdoor algal polycultures nalley et al 2014 newby et al 2016 smith and mcbride 2014 in particular two mechanisms underpinning the positive relationships between functional diversity system stability and productivity have been discussed the sampling effect and the complementarity effect nalley et al 2014 the former describes a positive relationship between diversity and productivity due to a greater probability of a high productivity strain being part of the community doak et al 1998 hooper et al 2005 the latter describes the process whereby niche occupation is increased by species with different growth requirements and resource acquisition strategies co existing cumulatively contributing to increased system productivity functional traits are morphological physiological or phenological characteristics of an organism that are vital to its fitness in a given environment violle et al 2007 and metrics of functional trait composition díaz and cabido 2001 have replaced traditional functional group assignments as explanatory variables of biodiversity productivity relationships ebeling et al 2014 recent experiments have demonstrated the importance of functional richness over species richness in determining the productivity of the algal polycultures behl et al 2011 corcoran and boeing 2012 shurin et al 2014 2013 stockenreiter et al 2013 this has promoted a move away from assembling algal polycultures through random selection hamilton et al 2014 that can lead to productivity crashes due to niche competition and towards strategies for assembling algal communities based on trait complementarity promoting the efficient utilization of resources e g light and nutrients under fluctuating environmental conditions nalley et al 2014 mathematical models are an attractive approach to understand and predict drivers of algal productivity in biofuel production systems across a range of scales flynn 2010 flynn et al 2017 kenny and flynn 2016 2014 weyer et al 2010 xin et al 2013 such models vary significantly in complexity from those employed to predict theoretical maximum algal oil production weyer et al 2010 to those that mechanistically represent algal photosynthesis novoderezhkin and van grondelle 2010 xin et al 2013 dynamic energy budget models deb differ from the abovementioned models in that they explicitly represent intra cellular allocation of resource pools regulated by substrate stoichiometry and environmental stress kooijman 2010 2009 deb models of microalgae and phytoplankton have previously simulated nutrient uptake poggiale et al 2010 and growth dynamics lorena et al 2010 the majority of these approaches simulate monocultures and to our knowledge no current trait based modeling studies have explored the relationship between algal community diversity and productivity for biofuel production in algal open ponds and raceways interacting light and temperature regimes provide a wide range of potential ecological niches for different algae it is therefore conceivable that the emergence of an optimally diverse community may occur algal polycultures are highly amenable to trait based modeling decades of laboratory experiments have provided key data for model parameterization with traits relating to resource acquisition efficiency such as light edwards et al 2015b schwaderer et al 2011 and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus edwards et al 2013 2012 litchman et al 2009 having been compiled and analyzed in detail building on these prior analyses that provide trade off relationships between traits and allometric scaling relationships between traits and cell size we describe the development of a trait based dynamic energy budget tb deb model to explore how microalgal species diversity or functional diversity impact polyculture productivity across systems with varying environmental conditions characteristic of open ponds first we conducted benchmark simulations and compared results of the tb deb model to data from a chemostat experiment in the subsequent ensemble of simulations we projected seasonal variations in biomass productivities of designed hypothetical algal polycultures using environmental data summer and winter temperature regimes and photosynthetically active radiation par derived from operational algal ponds within the algae testbed public private partnership atp3 consortium https openei org wiki atp3 data algal polycultures were designed with the goals of exploring 1 the relevance of guild categorizations based on thermal functional traits and site thermal regime to relate trait variance and productivity 2 the importance of polyculture relative to monocultures towards maintaining productivity on seasonal timescales and 3 the effect of species and functional diversity on pond productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 dynamic energy budget model fig 1 shows the schematic of the deb model for a single microalga a more detailed account of the theoretical framework and description of the deb model have been published previously da cunha e lorena 2008 kooijman 2010 2009 lorena et al 2010 here we describe reserve dynamics and growth as represented by the model in this model microalgae assimilate carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from the environment into the respective intracellular reserves the mass balance of each of the reserves is 1 d d t m e i j e i a j e i c κ e i j e i r r m e i where mei is the reserve density of reserve mole of reserve per mole of structure mv i in this case i 1 2 3 for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the first term in the balance represents input from assimilation uptake flux the second term represents reserve outflux for maintenance and growth the third term represents fraction of the flux not used in the synthesis of biomass structure returning to the reserve see supporting information while the last term represents a dilution effect on the reserve due to structural growth e g when reserve mass remains constant while the structure increases the reserve density is in fact decreasing with the maintenance flux taking precedence over growth the specific growth flux from each reserve is 2 j e i g j e i c j e i m where jeic is the second outflux term in eq 1 while jeim is the specific maintenance flux see supporting information the specific growth fluxes jeig from the reserves i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus then go into the growth synthesizing unit su fig 1 following su theory for parallel and complementary substrates kooijman 2009 these fluxes are merged following stoichiometric constraints to synthesize one mole of biomass structure as such specific growth flux for structural growth r is 3 r j e i g y e i g 1 j e i g y e i g 1 1 where yeig is the yield coefficient which is a conversion factor base on stoichiometry i e number of moles of carbon nitrogen phosphorus required to synthesize one mole of structure the mass balance for biomass structure is 4 d d t m v r h m v where r is the specific growth rate while h is the loss rate due to processes such as mortality or dilution below we describe modified model functions for algal resource acquisition 2 1 1 equilibrium chemistry approximation kinetics for uptake of resources the assimilation uptake of resources is represented by michaelis menten formulation in standard deb theory in this model the equilibrium chemistry approximation eca formulation a first order approximation to the equilibrium chemistry ec solution is utilized in general substrate uptake kinetics in any substrate consumer relationship subject to total quasi steady state assumption can be categorized as an ec problem tang and riley 2013 the use of this eca formulation is especially important when simulating multiple competitors for common substrates where the mass balance constraint of the substrate and that of the organism enzyme must be considered the eca kinetics formulation has been applied to modeling of plant microbial nutrient competition biogeochemical models zhu et al 2017 the resulting general mathematical formulation calculating the uptake rate uij i e uptake of substrate

rate b is enzyme concentration algal biomass concentration in our case s is substrate and is the half saturation or substrate affinity constant the second term within the parenthesis in the denominator represents modulation of the substrate affinity by competing substrates while the third term represents modulation of the substrate affinity by competing consumers algae in our case in the current model the eca formulation is adopted to describe the dynamics between multiple algal guilds and macronutrients from the environment i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus specifically in order to represent multiple algae competition for common substrate modulation by competing substrates can be dropped from eq 5 the resulting equation representing uptake of resource i by algae w w 1 n becomes

temperature function is similar to that described by thomas et al 2016 unimodal and negatively skewed both temperature functions follow the ratkowsky curves ratkowsky et al 1982 the characteristic curve describing thermal sensitive of biological reactions e g in reptiles fish algae bacteria is well established izem and kingsolver 2005 kingsolver 2017 licht 1967 and are described by three

described below this thermal function is applied to parameters describing rates i e maximum uptake rate specific maintenance costs and reserve turnover rate 2 1 3 model parameterization trait data allometric scaling and trade off relationships we took advantage of the wealth of literature on marine algal physiology and utilized extensive datasets of traits representing 1 photosynthetic rates edwards et al 2015b 2 nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates edwards et al 2015a and 3 temperature optima thomas et al 2016 to parameterize the forty eight algal species note these forty species overlap between edwards et al 2015a 2015b and thomas et al 2016 database in the model table s2 while not all are biofuel strains they share physiological characteristics with the breadth of biofuel strains traits impacting the uptake kinetics i e maximum uptake rate vmax and nutrient concentration at which uptake is half saturated ks of the microalgal species govern their fitness under prescribed nutrient supply regimes edwards et al 2012 demonstrated that 1 vmax for both nitrate and phosphate uptake scale allometrically and 2 vmax and ks exhibit a positive relationship indicative of a trade off between uptake rate and uptake affinity furthermore aksnes and egge 1991 assuming a spherical cell shape noted that vmax is proportional to the number of uptake sites on the cell surface i e number of uptake sites increases with cell surface area since vmax scales linearly with the cell surface 4π r2 it scales with cell volume 4 3 π r3 with an exponent of 2 3 0 67 on the other hand ks increases linearly with cell radius as such vmax should scale with ks with an exponent of 2 i e ks 2 aksnes and egge 1991 allometric values and vmax and ks values for nitrate and phosphate were derived from the edwards et al 2015a 2015b dataset table s3 these trait values were then used to 1 test for allometric scaling relationships and 2 quantify the trade off relationship between vmax and ks the output showed that vmax for both nitrate and phosphate uptake scale allometrically with exponents of 0 64 and 0 66 for vmax n and vmax p respectively fig 2 in litchman et al 2007 vmax for nitrate follows 2 3 scaling exponent i e cell volume 0 6667 as shown in aksnes and egge 1991 in edwards et al 2012 exponents are greater than 2 3 for both nitrate cell volume n n 0 68 0 98 and phosphate cell volume n n 0 81 1 1 as larger cells tend to deviate from a spherical shape and this could contribute to deviation from the theoretical value analysis also revealed vmax n ks n and vmax p ks p trade off relationships with exponents of 0 93 and 1 96 respectively fig 2 while the exponent for vmax p ks p is close to the theoretical value of 2 there is deviation for the exponent for vmax n ks n earlier study by litchman et al 2007 also showed that vmax n scaled with cell volume and stay close to exponent of 2 3 however in the same study the exponent of vmax n ks n trade off also deviate from 2 at 2 8 closer to 3 such deviation can be attributed to factors other than cell volume affect ks n as suggested by edwards et al 2012 maranon 2015 suggested that such variations uncertainties could also be due to limitations in data compiled data from cultures experiencing different growth conditions and varying measurement protocols 2 1 4 model parameterization environmental forcing simulations were conducted using environmental data from the algae testbed public private partnership atp3 consortium which consists of a network of algal biomass production facilities that provide support for research and commercialization of algal biofuels fig s1 shows temperature and par data from summer and winter of 2014 for three of the test beds used in the current simulations asu western usa climate arid to semi arid cell pacific ocean climate tropical and gt eastern usa climate humid subtropical 2 2 categorization of algal guilds based on thermal traits and site temperature the thermal function as defined in eq 7 above takes into account the topt tmin and tmax of an algal species at a given temperature in time t t eq 7 calculates f t t a value between 0 1 at each site we derived summer and winter time series of f t for each algal species from which a mean seasonal f t value was calculated for each season i e one for summer and one for winter if the mean f t values were greater than 0 25 for both summer and winter the algal species were categorized as thermal generalists if the mean seasonal f t value was greater than 0 25 for summer but less than 0 25 for winter we categorized the species as a thermal specialist able to grow in the summer temperature regime guild high temperature or the winter for low temperature guild fig s2 by taking into consideration site temperature trends in the classification of the algal species into functional guilds we note that the subsequent composition within each functional guild shows site dependent variability table s3 showed the algal guilds for each of the sites cell is notably different from either asu or gt while the algal species in asu and gt can be classified into high temperature low temperature and thermal generalist functional guilds the algal species in cell can only be classified into either low temperature or thermal generalist this is due to the small temperature difference between summer and winter temperatures in hawaii fig s1 in hawaii the maximum and minimum temperatures were 38 and 20 c and 30 and 16 c for summer and winter respectively as a result of the high degree of overlap between summer and winter temperature ranges the majority of the algal species fall into the thermal generalist guild the remaining algal species are those with extreme low growth temperature e g phaeocystis antartica and fell into the low temperature guild in comparison in arizona the maximum and minimum temperature were 45 and 21 c and 28 and 0 c for summer and winter respectively in gt the maximum and minimum temperature were 33 5 and 17 3 c and 16 1 and 0 c for summer and winter respectively in summary the forty eight algal species were distributed into the three functional groups at the three sites numbers in brackets indicates the number of algal species in the functional group i asu thermal generalist 20 low temperature 11 and high temperature 17 ii gt thermal generalist 12 low temperature 12 and high temperature 24 iii cell thermal generalist 36 low temperature 12 2 2 1 benchmark simulation first the modified algal deb model was used to simulate changes in total carbon in the algal biomass structure and reserve which were compared to measurements of particulate carbon pawlowski 2004 this experiment measured the growth of thalassiosira weissflogii under nitrogen and light limiting conditions within a chemostat simulation conditions approximated those from the original experiment t weissflogii was initially grown in batch culture under constant light i 250 μem 2 s 1 before being transferred to a chemostat under a light dark diurnal cycle on days 5 24 and constant light treatment i 100 μem 2 s 1 after day 24 input nitrate concentration was 70 μm and aqueous co2 concentration was set at 1 mm corresponding to pco2 350 μatm following lorena et al 2010 initial algal biomass was set at 0 1 mm the use of data from the pawlowski 2004 experiment allowed comparison against an earlier deb model simulation lorena et al 2010 finally in addition to the eca formulations our deb model differs from that described by lorena et al 2010 by the representation of an intracellular phosphorus pool in addition to intracellular carbon and nitrogen pools parameters related to carbon nitrogen uptake kinetics follow those from lorena et al 2010 table s1 2 2 2 algal polyculture simulations in the subsequent simulations fig 3 we projected seasonal summer and winter variations in biomass productivities of designed hypothetical algal polycultures using environmental data from asu gt and cell all simulations were conducted in chemostat mode with input dic concentration at 5 mm din concentration at 0 75 mm and dip concentration at 0 15 mm dilution rate was set at 0 3 d 1 in this first set of simulations algal polycultures were designed with the goal of exploring the relevance of guild categorizations based on thermal functional traits and site thermal regime to relate trait variance and productivity the simulated algal polycultures consisted of all the forty eight algal species hereafter known as random assembly model simulations were initialized with identical biomass and community shifts of the forty eight algal species were tracked over time through summer and winter climate regimes at each site the simulated algal biomass yields of each member in this random assembly were analyzed based on guild categorizations as defined by 1 algae taxonomy e g diatom dinoflagellate or 2 functional thermal traits i e optimal growth temperature maximum and minimum persistence temperature and pond thermal regime in the second set of simulations algal polycultures were designed to test 1 the importance of polycultures relative to monocultures towards maintaining productivity on seasonal timescales and 2 the effect of species and functional diversity on pond productivity we designed in silico algal polycultures with increasing functional and species diversity each in silico algal polyculture is inoculated with n number of algal species where n represents a species diversity of 4 8 or 10 the species were randomly chosen from one of the defined thermal guilds low temperature high temperature or thermal generalist furthermore to test the effects of complementarity additional simulations were conducted where half of the species represented the low temperature guild and half the high temperature guild fig 3 for each species richness n and functional guilds twenty five simulations were run to increase the probability that all algal species in the functional guild were chosen at least once all polyculture simulations were run across summer and winter months that we have environmental data for range between 80 102 days depending on site data availability 3 results benchmark simulations show that the model reproduces the particulate carbon sum of carbon in algal biomass and reserve trend with an overall r2 of 0 8 fig 4 the model captured the oscillatory trend during the chemostat mode when the system was subjected to a light cycle fig 4a and b regression statistics for observed vs simulated particulate carbon showed a slope of 1 06 0 1 p 0 001 indicating that the model tended to under predict total c values fig 4c in the random assembly simulations simulations were initialized with identical biomass 0 0001 m and community shifts of the forty eight algal species were tracked over time through summer and winter climate regimes at each site these simulated algal biomass yields were analyzed based on the guild s organization i e taxonomy or functional thermal traits simulations of taxonomically grouped guilds showed that the diatom chlorophytes cryptophyte phaeocystis and raphidophyte biomass increased in both the summer and winter at all sites fig 5 right columns by contrast the cyanobacterial biomass decreased at all sites within this taxonomic guild structure diatoms showed the greatest increase in biomass by 0 03 m in both seasons at all sites at cell simulated biomass increased for all guilds with the exception of cyanobacteria in the winter and summer at asu and gt the diazotroph dinoflagellate eustigmatroph and haptophyte guilds increased in biomass over the summer and decreased during winter we explored whether cell size plays a significant role in taxonomic guild classification by plotting the cell size distribution of each taxon fig s3a analyses show that diatoms and dinoflagellates have the highest cell volume and due to allometric scaling have the highest nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates while the cyanobacteria have the lowest cell volume and lowest nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates when the same simulated biomass of the forty eight algal species of the random assembly were grouped according to functional thermal traits results show that different guilds show changes in active biomass consistent with their thermal traits fig 5 left columns at all sites the biomass of thermal generalists increased by 0 014 0 04 m relative to the starting biomass 0 0012 0 0036 m varies depending on classification at each site by the end of each season i e summer and winter at asu and gt the low temperature guild shows a considerable fluctuation in biomass with a summertime reduction of 3 00 10 4 m in biomass relative to initialized conditions and 1 25 10 2 m increase in biomass during winter by contrast the low temperature guild at cell showed a 20 biomass loss during both seasons at asu and gt the high temperature guild showed 5 00 10 4 m reduction in biomass over the winter and 1 9 10 2 m increase in biomass during summer due to the temperature regime in cell i e similar summer and winter temperatures the emergent algal community could only be subdivided into two guilds i e low temperature and thermal generalist similar to taxonomic grouping we explored whether cell size plays significant role in thermal guild classification fig s3b and c and analysis showed that thermal guilds were comprised of members covering a wide range of cell sizes suggesting that cell size plays an insignificant role in the thermal guild classification in the second set of simulations growth of algal polycultures with different combinations of functional thermal and species diversities were simulated over different seasons i e summer and winter temperature regimes cumulative biomass across seasons summer winter of the polycultures consisting of species from both low temperature and high temperature guilds were compared against the biomass of respective members of the low temperature and high temperature guilds grown in monoculture under both gt and asu thermal regimes the polycultures showed higher productivities than the monocultures fig 6 a and c temperature range as bounded by tmin and tmax spanned by algal monocultures from both low temperature and high temperature guilds were compared against the temperature range spanned by algal polycultures at both sites polycultures spanned a wider temperature range than the monocultures fig 6b and d further analysis of the polyculture simulations showed that polycultures showed positive relationships between species richness and algal biomass fig 7 within polycultures consisting of members from one functional guild at the asu pond regime biomass increased with species richness with linear regressions fig 7a c slope m number of species values range from 0 00098 0 00269 within the gt pond regime biomass within polycultures consisting of either low temperature fig 7f linear regression slope 0 00160 or thermal generalist fig 7g linear regression slope 0 00116 guilds also increased with species richness in polycultures consisting of species from the high temperature guild increase in biomass with species richness is minimal fig 7e linear regression slope 0 000477 moreover this relationship was not statistically significant results for polycultures consisting of two functional groups at asu fig 7d linear regression slope 0 0026709 and gt fig 7h linear regression slope 0 0016059 showed that algal biomass tended to increase with species richness concurrent analysis of the number of extant species at the end of polyculture simulations also revealed positive relationships between extant species richness and initial species richness fig s4 we further performed two way anova tests on the results from the second set of simulations to explore the influence of species richness and functional group richness on productivity i e cumulative biomass at the end summer and winter of the polycultures at asu and gt at both sites results show that species richness and functional group richness positively influence biomass production and functional richness is a statistically significant factor variable fig 8 a asu species 4 8 10 f 14 98 p 0 000163 functional groups high temperature and high

pond monoculture operations experience fluctuating environmental conditions affecting the consistency of productivity across operational time spans towards achieving higher and reliable biomass yields in open pond systems a strategic move to the optimization of polycultures based on ecological theory has been proposed nalley et al 2014 newby et al 2016 smith and mcbride 2014 in utilizing such strategies the methods for assembling algal communities become important communities assembled randomly can lead to decreased productivity due to niche competition hamilton et al 2014 nalley et al 2014 based on diversity productivity relationships recent algal polyculture experimental studies for biofuel production have investigated how higher rates of productivity biomass could be achieved by assembly of polycultures based on taxonomy shurin et al 2014 in this study we show that higher species diversity and higher functional diversity both result in increased system productivity figs 7 and 8 in fig 7 regression line slope values for polycultures consisting of two functional groups are higher than polycultures consisting of single functional group i e low temperature or high temperature guilds suggesting increasing functional diversity confer higher positive impact on productivity than increasing species richness alone increase in biomass and number of extant species in response to increased species diversity figs 7 and s5 provide support for the hypothesis of higher diversity leads to more efficient use of resources and higher productivity the increase in productivity in response to increased species diversity can be attributed to two mechanisms sampling effect and complementarity nalley et al 2014 newby et al 2016 smith and mcbride 2014 the sampling effect would suggest that as diversity increases there is higher probability that fast growing algal strains are represented in the polyculture furthermore in polycultures with higher diversity within a thermal guild the niche space related to optimal temperature and nutrient uptake kinetics is wider than the monoculture of any singular strain i e complementarity complementarity can also explain the increase in productivity in response to increases in functional diversity despite the positive impact of species diversity within the same thermal guild on productivity when environmental temperatures fall outside of the optimal temperature niche space of any monoculture or polyculture comprised of members of the same thermal guild growth is constrained the inclusion of members from another thermal guild enhances productivity under broader temperature regimes further due to niche complementarity competitive interactions are offset reduced between the members of the two guilds as clearly shown in fig 6 polycultures including members from different thermal guilds increase functional trait space coverage leading to sustained productivity across the seasons when compared against monocultures niche complementarity however is rarely a product of individual traits for example when emergent algal communities from the random assembly simulations were grouped by taxonomy fig 5 right column traits that are related to nutrient uptake and phylogenetically conserved due to allometric scaling were also key to the relative fitness of algal species in addition to the thermal traits as reported previously edwards et al 2013 2012 litchman et al 2007 based on data trade off relationships between the parameters vmax ks were developed such vmax ks trade off relationships represent impact of nutrient availability on controlling size distribution of phytoplankton large cells while having high vmax are constrained by have high ks values thus making them poor competitors under nutrient poor conditions vmax ks trade off relationships have been utilized in earlier modeling studies such as in follows et al 2007 to reproduce biogeography of phytoplanktons in oceans other trade off processes important in structuring phytoplankton communities in natural waters are discussed in marañón 2014 in marañón 2014 the presence of trade off processes related to nutrient requirement acquisition and use confer high growth rate to cells of intermediate size 10 um diameter 103 um3 volume and offer explanation to the observed unimodal nature of size distribution of bloom forming phytoplankton species while large cells still maintain higher maximum nutrient uptake rates i e allometric scaling than smaller cells their growth rate becomes limited by slower nutrient assimilation into biomass in this work under high nutrient conditions reflective of algal pond conditions the vmax ks trade off resulted in the dominance of diatoms cell volume range from 101 105 um3 fig 5 simulated diatoms having larger initial biomass also contribute to their dominance in the first set of community polyculture simulations fig 5 it should be noted that this was not intentional the forty eight strains were each initialized with similar biomass but due to the higher representation of diatoms followed by dinoflagellates in the dataset in addition as shown in this study fig s6 and also pointed out in thomas et al 2016 diatoms have wide niche widths difference between tmax and tmin allowing them to compete effectively across a range of temperature regimes this may be representative of actual niche width or again possibly due to diatom coverage bias in the databases of edwards et al 2015a 2015b and thomas et al 2016 from which our parameters were derived in this study we show that the assembly of algal consortia based on functional traits may be a promising approach towards improving biomass productivity in operational algal ponds this direct manipulation of functional diversity has gained traction in biodiversity research in vegetation cadotte et al 2013 ebeling et al 2014 with functional type and more recently trait based metrics being considered as alternate metrics to phylogenetic diversity in studies of diversity productivity relationships cadotte et al 2009 diaz and cabido 1997 lavorel et al 1997 in this study our algal guilds were defined based on the interaction between thermal traits and pond thermal regimes driven by environmental forcing of operational algal ponds this type of functional grouping reduced complexity and encompassed nutrient competition traits that are more phylogenetically conserved i e similar range of cell volumes between each thermal guild as shown in fig s3b simulated emergent algal communities from the random assembly grouped based on thermal traits and under distinct pond thermal regimes clearly showed the impacts of summer and winter temperature regimes on the productivities of low temperature and high temperature guilds our results suggest that functional type groupings are best applied to cases when environmental factors forcings are unregulated by management e g outdoor ponds resulting in inefficient growth due to suboptimal niche widths that are characteristic of monoculture systems biomass optimization by designing consortia with complementary thermal traits would clearly have a greater impact on yield in locations with distinct seasonal thermal regimes in the simulations based on hawaiian environmental conditions cell in the absence of distinct thermal regimes narrower environmental niche widths selects for algal species that fall into the thermal generalist guild resulting in decreased potential of enhancing yield by maximizing niche complementarity as a result in contrast with the other sites with more distinct thermal regimes the simulated emergent algal communities at cell are similar after winter and summer thermal regimes fig s4 5 conclusion and outlook in all results from this modeling study and earlier experimental studies shurin et al 2014 highlight the idea that regardless of the functional group definition maximizing use of niche space through complementarity can confer positive impacts on system productivity we found greater positive impacts of functional diversity over species diversity on productivity and propose that the systematic selection of species should be performed based on knowledge of physiology ecology and the environment in order to maximize available niche space and enhance the productivity of open bioalgal ponds in our current work the model system is representative of well mixed chemostats the use of trait based modeling framework to elucidate patterns in bulk community responses to environmental changes follows earlier modeling works e g bouskill et al 2012 patterns of nitrification rates across environmental and substrate gradients allison 2012 patterns in litter decompositions while benchmarking against data of more algal species can improve confidence of the model for individual monocultures when it comes to productivity of algal community it is not certain that the whole is the sum of the individual parts however towards simulating community productivity in operating algal ponds additional benchmark simulations preferably across different taxonomies can point out ecological strategies employed by the different algal taxonomic groups that need to be incorporated into the current model one such mechanism is the sinking rates of algae as function of cell size in follows et al 2007 phytoplanktons are assigned sink rates based on cell size larger cells sink faster than smaller cells coupled with the presence of light gradient in algal raceways the differential sinking rates translate into differential productivities in algal cells across the depth of the water column clearly other traits such as predator prey interactions like rotifer grazing e g differential grazing pressure based on cell size and interaction between algae and bacteria or fungi are also important considerations frameworks such as the modeling approach described here could be used to explore pond productivity while considering

25036,light interception in plant canopies is most commonly estimated using a simple one dimensional turbid medium model i e beer s law inherent in this class of models are assumptions that vegetation is uniformly distributed in space homogeneous and in many cases that vegetation orientation is uniformly distributed isotropic it is known that these assumptions are violated in a wide range of canopies as real canopies commonly have heterogeneity at multiple scales and almost always have highly anisotropic leaf angle distributions however it is not quantitatively known under what conditions these assumptions become problematic given the difficulty of robustly evaluating model results for a range of canopy architectures in this study assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy were evaluated under clear sky conditions for a range of virtually generated crop canopies with the aid of a detailed three dimensional leaf resolving radiation model results showed that beer s law consistently over predicted light interception for all canopy configurations for canopies where the plant spacing was comparable to the plant height beer s law performed poorly and over predicted daily intercepted sunlight by up to 115 for vegetation with a highly anisotropic leaf inclination distribution but a relatively isotropic leaf azimuth distribution the assumption of canopy isotropy i e g 0 5 resulted in relatively small errors however if leaf elevation and azimuth were both highly anisotropic the assumption of canopy isotropy could introduce significant errors depending on the orientation of the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the sun s path keywords beer s law heterogeneous canopies leaf angle distribution light interception row orientation 1 introduction solar radiation is a primary driver of most plant biophysical processes including energy transfer turbulent transport evapotranspiration photosynthesis and phenology fluxes of absorbed radiation in plant canopies have strong gradients in the vertical direction and potentially in horizontal directions in the case of heterogeneous canopies ross 1981 capturing these high gradients through direct measurement is often challenging and therefore models are frequently used to predict absorbed radiative flux distributions for practical purposes relatively simple models are frequently used to estimate light interception in plant canopies for example crop models have become important tools for studying agricultural systems jones et al 2017 yet they commonly utilize relatively simple models for light interception given the frequent lack of detailed architectural inputs the most commonly used approach for estimating light interception treats the canopy as a homogeneous medium of unresolved vegetation i e a turbid medium which allows for the use of a simple exponential model for radiation attenuation commonly know as beer s law beer lambert law or beer lambert bouguer law monsi and saeki 1953 lemeur and blad 1975 porter et al 1993 sampson and smith 1993 boote and pickering 1994 jones et al 2003 lunagaria and shekh 2006 liu et al 2015 beer s law calculates the probability of radiation interception as an exponentially increasing function of the leaf area projected in the direction of radiation propagation and the distance travelled through the canopy using this approach light interception can be calculated as 1 i i 0 1 exp gl cos θ s where i is the radiation flux intercepted over the depth of the canopy i 0 is the direct beam radiation flux on a horizontal surface at the top of the canopy l is the leaf area index m2 m 2 and θ s is the solar zenith angle g is the fraction of leaf area projected in the direction of the sun and is defined mathematically as ross 1981 2 g 1 2 π 2 π g l ω l ω s ω l d ω l where ω s is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the sun ω l is a unit vector in the direction of the leaf normal and g l ω l is the probability that a leaf normal is oriented in the direction ω l if g l is constant for all ω l i e leaves have no preferred orientation and are thus isotropic integration of eq 2 yields a value of g 0 5 ross 1981 the form of beer s law given in eq 1 functions under two main assumptions the first assumption is that leaf positions are randomly distributed both vertically and horizontally i e homogeneous in a continuous medium where leaves are relatively small the second assumption is that leaves absorb all incident radiation i e no scattering or transmission lemeur and blad 1975 larsen and kershaw 1996 which may be reasonable for photosynthetically active radiation bands where leaves absorb roughly 90 of incident radiation but is likely a poor assumption in other bands such as the near infrared where absorption is low eq 1 also requires specification of g which is most commonly set to be equal to 0 5 based on the assumption that leaves are isotropic ross 1981 johnson and thornley 1984 sitch et al 2003 esprey et al 2004 stenberg 2006 the assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy are usually violated in actual plant canopies leaf area density typically varies sharply in the vertical direction hosoi and omasa 2009 niinemets 2010 bailey and mahaffee 2017a many natural plant canopies have considerable horizontal heterogeneity such as savannas chen et al 2008 or heterogeneity due to natural or man made disturbances levick et al 2009 crop canopies also commonly have a sparse row oriented configuration that creates high heterogeneity in light interception furthermore it is rare to find canopies with isotropic leaf angle distributions as this is typically not the most efficient configuration for light interception raabe et al 2015 bailey and mahaffee 2017b despite the known limitations of beer s law in the above cases it is still frequently applied in these systems due to its simple tractable form however there is a general lack of quantitative understanding of the errors resulting from the application of these simplified models in various canopy architectures primarily because it is difficult to quantify light interception from field measurements for a range of architectures rosati et al 2001 the objective of this study is to better understand and quantify errors in modeled radiation absorption under assumptions of vegetation homogeneity or isotropy for various canopy configurations the authors hypothesis is that beer s law will perform well for relatively dense closed canopies provided that g is specified appropriately for sparse canopies it is hypothesized that assumptions of vegetation homogeneity will result in significant model errors thus necessitating a more complicated model since accurately measuring the distribution of absorbed radiation in space and time is often unfeasible using traditional experimental approaches a sophisticated 3d radiation model bailey 2018 was used along with virtually generated canopies to evaluate beer s law under different simplifying assumptions virtual canopies with varying levels of heterogeneity sparseness and leaf orientation distributions were generated to evaluate assumptions of vegetation homogeneity or isotropy in terms of absorption of direct solar radiation a considerable advantage of using virtually generated canopies is that the input parameters in eq 1 i e g and l can be calculated exactly from the virtual canopies when combined with a detailed 3d radiation model this resulted in a robust means for evaluating the performance of simplified models for a range of canopy architectures 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant geometry for simulating plant light interactions detailed 3d geometric models were used to describe the architecture of the canopy agricultural crops were chosen for the plant types because 1 many 3d models are readily available 2 they have sufficient yet regular heterogeneity that limits the degrees of freedom when generating the canopies and 3 they represent an economically important practical application of the use of beer s law the chosen crop canopies were grape almond potato and corn which were represented in the 3d model using a mesh of rectangular and triangular elements to minimize the number of elements needed to describe their complex geometries images with a transparency channel could be overlaid on these basic elements where the transparency channel is used to remove a portion of the element s surface see suffern 2007 bailey 2018 virtually generated plants were either read from a polygon file corn and potato or created using the procedural plant generator described by weber and penn 1995 grape and almond 2 2 canopy structure parameters used to quantify canopy architecture are given in table 1 the procedural model used to generate the grape and almond plants had a random component to each architectural parameter making each plant unique each corn and potato plant was identical therefore a random azimuthal rotation was applied to each plant to decrease regularity of the canopy plants were placed in a marked row structure to form a canopy two grape canopy cases were considered one with a north south row orientation grape n s and one with an east west row orientation grape e w two potato canopies were considered in which plants were arranged in either an east west row oriented pattern potato row or a uniformly spaced planting pattern potato uniform in all cases the size of the 3d scene was chosen such that further increasing the total number of plants did not have an impact on results to test the model in the case of homogeneous and isotropic vegetation a set of canopies were created with uniformly distributed leaves in space with three different leaf area index values l 1 5 which consisted of 100 000 leaves l 3 1 which consisted of 200 000 leaves and l 6 2 which consisted of 400 000 leaves the surface area of each leaf was 0 006 m2 each leaf angle was set by randomly drawing from a spherical distribution to characterize the plant geometry l and the leaf inclination angle probability density function pdf were calculated for all five generated canopies and the leaf azimuthal angle pdf was calculated for the grape n s and grape e w cases all other cases had azimuthal distributions that were close to uniform the l was calculated by summing the one sided area of all leaves in the canopy and dividing by the total canopy footprint area the leaf inclination angle and leaf azimuthal angle were calculated for each of the elements from the surface normal of the leaf and a pdf was formed by weighting each element s contribution to the pdf by its surface area then normalizing such that the pdf integrates to unity the corn model had predominantly vertically oriented leaves while the almond and potato models had leaves closer to horizontal on average fig 1 grape leaf inclination was skewed toward vertical and leaf azimuth tended to be oriented parallel with the row fig 2 which is supported by previous manual and lidar measurements bailey et al 2014 bailey and mahaffee 2017b the gap fraction was calculated from the 3d models by computing the fraction of direct sunlight not intercepted when θ s 0 table 1 gap fraction values ranged from 80 in the grape canopy cases down to 21 for the corn canopy case although both potato canopy cases had the same l their gap fractions were 22 for uniformly spaced plants and 36 for row oriented plants 2 3 one dimensional model of light interception a simple 1d model eq 1 was used to calculate hourly light interception which utilized two different assumptions of canopy structure the first approach assumed that canopy vegetation is both homogeneous and isotropic the homogeneous assumption implies that vegetation is randomly distributed in space which is already inherent in eq 1 the isotropic assumption implies that leaves have no preferred orientation or that the leaf angle pdf is spherical the second approach assumed that leaves are homogeneous but anisotropic rather than calculating the leaf angle pdf and integrating according to eq 2 the canopy level g θ s was calculated directly from the 3d models using a weighted average of the projected leaf area fraction according to 3 g θ s i 1 m a i n i v i 1 m a i where m is the total number of geometric elements in the virtual canopy n i is a unit vector normal to the surface of the ith geometric element v is a unit vector pointing towards the sun and a i is the one sided surface area of the ith geometric element g values for each hour of a diurnal cycle on julian days 153 232 and 305 are shown in fig 3 for corn g does not vary considerably with the position of the sun whereas the potato and almond cases have high diurnal variation in g as warren wilson 1960 pointed out g values intersect at a solar elevation of about 32 5 for azimuthally symmetric vegetation which corresponds to roughly 8 45 and 17 25 h on julian day 153 and 9 20 and 17 00 h on julian day 232 in fig 3 this intersection occurs for the almond corn and potato cases however because of the highly anisotropic azimuthal leaf distribution of the grape canopies they do not follow this rule in addition to eq 1 which assumes vertical homogeneity within the canopy vertical profiles of hourly absorbed radiation were also calculated by explicitly representing variation of leaf area with height and its corresponding effect on light interception the radiation flux intercepted over a horizontal layer of thickness δz at height z within the canopy was calculated according to 4 i z i 0 1 exp ga δ z cos θ s exp gl z cos θ s where l z is the leaf area index between z and the canopy top and a m2 m 3 is the one sided leaf area density of the layer the 1d model inherently assumes that leaves absorb all incoming radiation there is no theoretically consistent means of accounting for reflection and transmission using eq 1 as the derivation of beer s law requires removal of the scattering terms from the radiative transfer equation modest 2013 several ad hoc approaches have been used in previous work to account for transmission and reflection using some function of the leaf reflectivity ρ and transmissivity τ of which two are considered here the first is to multiply the incoming radiation by 1 ρ 5 i i 0 1 ρ 1 exp gl cos θ s which assumes that all reflected radiation either exits the canopy or reaches the ground without being re absorbed and that there is no transmission the second is to multiply by 1 ρ τ 6 i i 0 1 ρ τ 1 exp gl cos θ s which assumes that all reflected and transmitted radiation either exits the canopy or reaches the ground without being re absorbed 2 4 three dimensional model of light interception it was assumed that the reference or true light interception values were given by the detailed 3d model of bailey 2018 which explicitly represents radiation absorption by each element in the virtual canopy the model uses a backward ray tracing approach that ensures each canopy element adequately samples the sun and was shown to converge exponentially towards the exact answer as the number of rays was increased assuming model inputs are specified exactly the 3d model software and documentation is available though the public github repository https www github com plantsimulationlab helios inputs to the radiation model are the total hemispherical radiative flux w m 2 of the sun over an arbitrary wavelength band as well as the reflectivity and transmissivity of each element in the virtual canopy to test the assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy reflectivity and transmissivity were set to 0 which is an assumption implicit in eq 1 separate tests were then performed to examine the effect of reflection and transmission using either eq 5 or 6 for all simulations the diffuse solar radiation flux was set to 0 which is also implicit in eq 1 the number of rays that were sampled on each element was set to 1000 rays it was verified that further increasing the number of rays had a negligible impact on results a sample visualization of the 3d distribution of absorbed radiation for the virtual canopy cases is shown in fig 4 total daily light interception was calculated by linear interpolation of the hourly light interception fluxes agreement between the 3d model and simplified 1d models was quantified using the index of agreement ia willmott 1981 normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of determination r2 2 5 radiation input data the incoming radiation data used to drive the radiation absorption simulations in this study was generated following the rest 2 model of gueymard 2008 the hourly incoming

atmospheric turbidity coefficient 0 05 relative humidity 50 and julian day of the year 153 232 and 305 it is noted that the precipitable water in the rest 2 model was specified using the model of viswanadham 1981 the direction of the sun for any time of day at the virtual site was calculated following the approach outlined by iqbal 1983 in cases where scattering was included two radiative bands were considered one characteristic of efficient absorption by leaves such as the photosynthetically active band par 400 700 nm and another characteristic of high scattering such as the solar near infrared band nir 700 nm the total incoming solar flux was partitioned as 47 in the par band and 53 in the nir band in the par band ρ was set to 0 056 and τ to 0 042 while in the nir band ρ was set to 0 425 and τ to 0 334 bailey et al 2014 3 results 3 1 daily total light interception results for the daily total light interception on julian days 153 232 and 305 are listed in table 2 and shown graphically in fig 5 for the homogeneous canopy cases very close agreement was found between the 1d and 3d models regardless of l which indicated that the approach used to compare the 1d and 3d models was consistent and that leaf scale heterogeneity created by discrete leaf surfaces did not create significant errors cases with relatively high ground cover fractions and uniformly arranged plants showed good agreement between the 1d and 3d models regardless of whether the assumption of leaf isotropy was made as the canopies became more heterogeneous in space agreement between the models generally declined although potato uniform and potato row had identical leaf area indices and leaf angle distributions the regular distribution of plants within the canopy in potato uniform resulted in better agreement between the 1d and 3d models compared to potato row despite all cases having highly anisotropic leaf inclination distributions the assumption of leaf anisotropy had relatively small impact for all cases except for the grape e w case any effects of heterogeneity or anisotropy tended to decrease as the day of year became further away from the summer solstice toward the end of the year day 305 the 1d and 3d models were in fairly good agreement for all canopy cases 3 2 hourly light interception the diurnal flux of radiation intercepted by the canopy for an hourly time step on julian day 153 is shown in fig 6 with corresponding fractions of total radiation intercepted by the canopy shown in fig 7 the fraction of total radiation intercepted on julian day 253 and 305 are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively for the homogeneous canopy cases the assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy were closely satisfied and therefore the 1d model was in very good agreement with the 3d model regardless of leaf density table 3 for the crop canopy cases the 1d model consistently over estimated light interception as compared to the 3d model except for grape e w and potato row on julian day 305 for all but the grape cases eliminating the isotropic assumption resulted in little improvement of agreement between the 1d and 3d models indicating that errors arose primarily from heterogeneity in these cases for the grape n s almond and potato cases errors between the 1d and 3d models were largest near midday when sunlight could most readily reach the ground by penetrating through gaps in vegetation for grape e w the largest discrepancies occurred at early and late times of the day the effect of row orientation on diurnal interception patterns for the grape cases was dramatic as this completely changed the character of interception at different times of the year see figs 6 7 8 9 the potato cases also illustrated the pronounced effect of heterogeneity in planting pattern on diurnal interception 3 3 vertical profiles of hourly absorbed radiation fig 10 depicts vertical profiles of the absorbed radiation flux at 8 00 10 00 and 12 00 h on julian day 153 for grape n s grape e w almond and corn errors in absorbed fluxes for grape n s were relatively consistent with height where errors at a given height were most closely related to the magnitude of the absorbed flux at that height this was also roughly the case for almond except that there was the potential for some under estimation of absorption in the lower canopy when the 1d model was used which was most pronounced for larger solar zenith angles for grape e w the 1d model tended to shift the peak in the absorbed flux deeper into the canopy which was most pronounced for larger solar zenith angles in the corn canopy the vertical pattern in radiation interception differed significantly between the 1d and 3d models there were up to 50 differences between 1d and 3d fluxes at a given vertical level with irregular patterns of over or under estimation in the lower canopy there was a peak in absorption in the 3d model which was largely absent in the 1d model leading to under prediction of absorption by the 1d model in the lower canopy this is likely due to the substantial over prediction of absorption by the 1d model in the upper canopy which removes the necessary energy needed to produce a secondary peak in absorption in the lower canopy 3 4 impact of scattering total daily light interception for julian day 153 is shown in fig 11 for different assumptions regarding radiation scattering which is given by either eq 1 fig 11a no scattering eq 5 fig 11b only reflection or eq 6 fig 11c reflection and transmission it is important to note that for the homogeneous canopy cases errors in fig 11 are due only to effects of scattering as it was shown in fig 5 that agreement between the 1d and 3d models was excellent when leaves were black for the crop canopy cases errors in fig 11 are due to the combined effect of scattering and heterogeneity which makes these results somewhat difficult to interpret as evidenced by the homogeneous canopy cases the impact of scattering was minimal for the par band and thus most of the errors in the heterogeneous crop canopy cases were due to heterogeneity and not scattering in the nir band scattering caused very large errors when the standard 1d model was used with all cases over estimating absorption by more than 100 accounting for reflection using eq 5 removed much of this energy but still resulted in significant over estimation of absorbed radiation this approach creates offsetting errors in which absorption is over estimated because transmission is not accounted for but there is simultaneous under estimation due to the assumption that all reflected radiation either reaches the ground or is reflected back to the sky but the net result is over estimation accounting for both reflection and transmission using eq 6 caused net under estimation of the total absorbed flux this is because eq 6 assumes that all reflected and transmitted radiation radiation either reaches the ground or is reflected back to the sky thus overall absorption is under estimated 4 discussion 4 1 effect of leaf angle distribution anisotropy overall anisotropy in leaf inclination had a relatively small effect on errors resulting from the application of beer s law in cases when leaf azimuth was uniformly distributed almond corn and potato the grape cases which had high anisotropy in both the leaf inclination and azimuth distributions did incur significant errors due leaf anisotropy for the 1d model if leaf azimuth is uniformly distributed this effectively reduces the impact of anisotropy in leaf inclination on the projected area fraction g since a leaf with a certain elevation angle could be parallel to the sun at one azimuth and perpendicular to the sun at another an integration over all azimuths can smear out the effects of leaf inclination alone as in the virtual canopies of this study field measurements have shown that leaf inclination distributions are usually highly anisotropic niinemets 1998 2010 raabe et al 2015 bailey and mahaffee 2017b the azimuthal distribution of leaves may be strongly anisotropic within a single plant bailey and mahaffee 2017b but for relatively dense canopies the azimuthal distribution is often fairly isotropic ross 1981 in these cases the assumption of leaf isotropy is likely to result in minimal errors however sparse row oriented crops such as vineyards may have highly anisotropic azimuthal distributions bailey and mahaffee 2017b in which case it may be necessary to explicitly calculate g based on measurements these types of canopies are becoming increasingly prevalent in agricultural applications e g apples olives connor 2006 lauri 2009 due in part to the improved access to mechanical harvesters that a trellised or hedgerow canopy provides 4 2 effect of plant spacing horizontal heterogeneity plant spacing and the resulting heterogeneity had the most pronounced effect on errors resulting from the use of beer s law for the grape n s case the assumption of homogeneity resulted in an overestimation of the total daily absorbed radiation by 28 30 and 36 on julian days 153 232 and 305 respectively with larger instantaneous over estimation near midday for the grape e w case the assumption of homogeneity also resulted in overestimating the total daily absorbed radiation by 74 51 and 5 on julian days 153 232 and 305 respectively this was not simply an effect related to l as was illustrated by the two potato cases by simply rearranging the potato plants from a uniformly spaced into a row oriented configuration errors in the 1d model increased substantially it is possible that the effect of horizontal heterogeneity can vary in the vertical direction which appeared to be the case with the corn canopy this significantly altered the performance of the 1d model at any given height although the canopy was dense enough overall that the 1d model performed well when predicting whole canopy radiation absorption this could have important implications if the radiation model is coupled with other biophysical models such as a photosynthesis model the response of photosynthesis to light is nonlinear and asymptotic taiz and zeiger 2014 so although whole canopy absorption may be well represented in some cases by a 1d horizontally homogeneous model it is unclear if that will result in significant errors in total photosynthetic production given the nonlinearity of its response to light a limitation of this study is that results are only applicable under clear sky conditions however the results can provide some insight regarding diffuse sky conditions by simultaneously considering all canopy geometries and simulated sun angles under a uniformly overcast sky equal energy originates from all directions a particular combination of sun angle and leaf orientation bias was required in order to observe a pronounced effect of leaf anisotropy thus for diffuse solar conditions it is speculated that the impact of leaf anisotropy will be decreased sun angle had an important effect on the instantaneous impact of leaf heterogeneity and most commonly it was observed that low sun angles resulted in a decreased impact of heterogeneity therefore it is likely that highly diffuse conditions will reduce the impact of heterogeneity near midday because a significant fraction of incoming radiation will originate from directions nearer to the horizon estimating light interception with beer s law is based on the assumption that canopies are homogeneous this inherently means that the rate of radiation attenuation along a given path is linearly related to the flux at that location as the canopy becomes sparse there are pathways for radiation propagation that allow radiation to penetrate the entire canopy without any probability of interception which fundamentally violates the assumptions behind beer s law or a turbid medium therefore the non random leaf dispersion in canopies limits the ability of beer s law to link light interception to simple bulk measures of plant architecture it is well known that this heterogeneity or clumping of vegetation usually results in decreased radiation interception as compared with an equivalent homogeneous canopy a common means of dealing with this problem without significantly increasing model complexity is to add a clumping coefficient ω to the argument of the exponential function in beer s law nilson 1971 smith et al 1993 kucharik et al 1999 while this is a simple and practical means of reducing the amount of radiation attenuation predicted by beer s law the challenge in applying the clumping coefficient approach is that ω is a complex function of nearly every applicable variable chen et al 2008 and thus is it is difficult to mechanistically specify another approach is to use a model that explicitly resolves plant level heterogeneity e g norman and welles 1983 north 1996 bailey et al 2014 as it may not be necessary to explicitly resolve every leaf if within plant heterogeneity is small 4 3 effect of row orientation row orientation played an important role when estimating light interception from beer s law particularly when the rows were widely spaced for sparse row oriented canopies the effective path length of the sun s rays through vegetation can change dramatically with changes in sun azimuth for east west rows absorption is significantly reduced early and late in the day because the rows are close to parallel with the sun s rays whereas north south rows are perpendicular to the sun at this time as the day of year progresses further from the summer solstice the sun spends more time closer to the horizon and thus the impact of heterogeneity in an east west row orientation increased for the east west row configuration g θ s and light interception were surprisingly constant throughout much of the day which resulted in 41 and 36 less absorption on julian days 153 and 232 respectively compared to north south rows this has important practical implications for agricultural design applications in some climates it may be desirable to maximize sunlight interception whereas in others it may be desirable to mitigate effects of excess sunlight to reduce temperatures and water use 4 4 effect of light scattering despite the simplified assumptions in beer s law regarding scattering there was good agreement between predicted radiation interception using the 1d and 3d models in the par band scattering did not significantly influence light interception in this band because most of the incident radiation received by individual leaves was absorbed however in the nir band scattering introduced significant over estimation of absorption using the standard 1d model since leaves are poor absorbers in this band using an ad hoc correction to account for reflection only reduced this over estimation of absorption an additional correction to account for both reflection and transmission resulted in over correction and a net under prediction of total radiation absorption 5 conclusion the objective of this work was to evaluate common assumptions used in estimating radiation absorption in plant canopies namely assumptions of homogeneity or isotropy of vegetation our results demonstrated that for relatively dense canopies with azimuthally symmetric leaves a 1d model that assumes homogeneity and isotropy of vegetation generally produced relatively small errors as plant spacing became large the assumptions of homogeneity break down and model errors became large in the case of a vineyard with rows oriented in the east west direction errors in daily intercepted radiation were up to 70 due to heterogeneity alone with much larger instantaneous errors occurring during the day if leaves were highly anisotropic in the azimuthal direction there was also the potential for large errors resulting from the assumption of vegetation isotropy which had the potential to increase errors above 100 day of year had an impact on model errors which was that overall errors tended to decline with time from the summer solstice in cases of canopies where the plant spacing starts to approach the plant height it is likely necessary to use a plant resolving radiation model in order to avoid substantial over prediction of absorbed radiative fluxes additionally if vegetation is highly anisotropic in terms of both elevation and azimuthal angle distributions it is also likely necessary to explicitly calculate the projected area fraction g θ s based on measurements and the instantaneous position of the sun acknowledgements financial support of this work was provided by the american vineyard foundation grants 2016 1825 2017 1825 and the usda national institute of food

25036,light interception in plant canopies is most commonly estimated using a simple one dimensional turbid medium model i e beer s law inherent in this class of models are assumptions that vegetation is uniformly distributed in space homogeneous and in many cases that vegetation orientation is uniformly distributed isotropic it is known that these assumptions are violated in a wide range of canopies as real canopies commonly have heterogeneity at multiple scales and almost always have highly anisotropic leaf angle distributions however it is not quantitatively known under what conditions these assumptions become problematic given the difficulty of robustly evaluating model results for a range of canopy architectures in this study assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy were evaluated under clear sky conditions for a range of virtually generated crop canopies with the aid of a detailed three dimensional leaf resolving radiation model results showed that beer s law consistently over predicted light interception for all canopy configurations for canopies where the plant spacing was comparable to the plant height beer s law performed poorly and over predicted daily intercepted sunlight by up to 115 for vegetation with a highly anisotropic leaf inclination distribution but a relatively isotropic leaf azimuth distribution the assumption of canopy isotropy i e g 0 5 resulted in relatively small errors however if leaf elevation and azimuth were both highly anisotropic the assumption of canopy isotropy could introduce significant errors depending on the orientation of the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the sun s path keywords beer s law heterogeneous canopies leaf angle distribution light interception row orientation 1 introduction solar radiation is a primary driver of most plant biophysical processes including energy transfer turbulent transport evapotranspiration photosynthesis and phenology fluxes of absorbed radiation in plant canopies have strong gradients in the vertical direction and potentially in horizontal directions in the case of heterogeneous canopies ross 1981 capturing these high gradients through direct measurement is often challenging and therefore models are frequently used to predict absorbed radiative flux distributions for practical purposes relatively simple models are frequently used to estimate light interception in plant canopies for example crop models have become important tools for studying agricultural systems jones et al 2017 yet they commonly utilize relatively simple models for light interception given the frequent lack of detailed architectural inputs the most commonly used approach for estimating light interception treats the canopy as a homogeneous medium of unresolved vegetation i e a turbid medium which allows for the use of a simple exponential model for radiation attenuation commonly know as beer s law beer lambert law or beer lambert bouguer law

probability of radiation interception as an exponentially increasing function of the leaf area projected in the direction of radiation propagation and the distance travelled through the canopy using this approach light interception can be calculated as 1 i i 0 1 exp gl cos θ s where i is the radiation flux intercepted over the depth of the canopy i 0 is the direct beam radiation flux on a horizontal surface at the top of the canopy l is the leaf area index m2 m 2 and θ s is the solar zenith angle g is the fraction of leaf area projected in the direction of the sun and is defined mathematically as ross 1981 2 g 1 2 π 2 π g l ω l ω s ω l d ω l where ω s is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the sun ω l is a unit vector in the direction of the leaf normal and g l ω l is the probability that a leaf normal is oriented in the direction ω l if g l is constant for all ω l i e leaves have no preferred orientation and are thus isotropic integration of eq 2 yields a value of g 0 5 ross 1981 the form of beer s law given in eq 1 functions under two main assumptions the first assumption is that leaf positions are randomly distributed both vertically and horizontally i e homogeneous in a continuous medium where leaves are relatively small the second assumption is that leaves absorb all incident radiation i e no scattering or transmission lemeur and blad 1975 larsen and kershaw 1996 which may be reasonable for photosynthetically active radiation bands where leaves absorb roughly 90 of incident radiation but is likely a poor assumption in other bands such as the near infrared where absorption is low eq 1 also requires specification of g which is most commonly set to be equal to 0 5 based on the assumption that leaves are isotropic ross 1981 johnson and thornley 1984 sitch et al 2003 esprey et al 2004 stenberg 2006 the assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy are usually violated in actual plant canopies leaf area density typically varies sharply in the vertical direction hosoi and omasa 2009 niinemets 2010 bailey and mahaffee 2017a many natural plant canopies have considerable horizontal heterogeneity such as savannas chen et al 2008 or heterogeneity due to natural or man made disturbances levick et al 2009 crop canopies also commonly have a sparse row oriented configuration that creates high heterogeneity in light interception furthermore it is rare to find canopies with isotropic leaf angle distributions as this is typically not the most efficient configuration for light interception raabe et al 2015 bailey and mahaffee 2017b despite the known limitations of beer s law in the above cases it is still frequently applied in these systems due to its simple tractable form however there is a general lack of quantitative understanding of the errors resulting from the application of these simplified models in various canopy architectures primarily because it is difficult to quantify light interception from field measurements for a range of architectures rosati et al 2001 the objective of this study is to better understand and quantify errors in modeled radiation absorption under assumptions of vegetation homogeneity or isotropy for various canopy configurations the authors hypothesis is that beer s law will perform well for relatively dense closed canopies provided that g is specified appropriately for sparse canopies it is hypothesized that assumptions of vegetation homogeneity will result in significant model errors thus necessitating a more complicated model since accurately measuring the distribution of absorbed radiation in space and time is often unfeasible using traditional experimental approaches a sophisticated 3d radiation model bailey 2018 was used along with virtually generated canopies to evaluate beer s law under different simplifying assumptions virtual canopies with varying levels of heterogeneity sparseness and leaf orientation distributions were generated to evaluate assumptions of vegetation homogeneity or isotropy in terms of absorption of direct solar radiation a considerable advantage of using virtually generated canopies is that the input parameters in eq 1 i e g and l can be calculated exactly from the virtual canopies when combined with a detailed 3d radiation model this resulted in a robust means for evaluating the performance of simplified models for a range of canopy architectures 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant geometry for simulating plant light interactions detailed 3d geometric models were used to describe the architecture of the canopy agricultural crops were chosen for the plant types because 1 many 3d models are readily available 2 they have sufficient yet regular heterogeneity that limits the degrees of freedom when generating the canopies and 3 they represent an economically important practical application of the use of beer s law the chosen crop canopies were grape almond potato and corn which were represented in the 3d model using a mesh of rectangular and triangular elements to minimize the number of elements needed to describe their complex geometries images with a transparency channel could be overlaid on these basic elements where the transparency channel is used to remove a portion of the element s surface see suffern 2007 bailey 2018 virtually generated plants were either read from a polygon file corn and potato or created using the procedural plant generator described by weber and penn 1995 grape and almond 2 2 canopy structure parameters used to quantify canopy architecture are given in table 1 the procedural model used to generate the grape and almond plants had a random component to each architectural parameter making each plant unique each corn and potato plant was identical therefore a random azimuthal rotation was applied to each plant to decrease regularity of the canopy plants were placed in a marked row structure to form a canopy two grape canopy cases were considered one with a north south row orientation grape n s and one with an east west row orientation grape e w two potato canopies were considered in which plants were arranged in either an east west row oriented pattern potato row or a uniformly spaced planting pattern potato uniform in all cases the size of the 3d scene was chosen such that further increasing the total number of plants did not have an impact on results to test the model in the case of homogeneous and isotropic vegetation a set of canopies were created with uniformly distributed leaves in space with three different leaf area index values l 1 5 which consisted of 100 000 leaves l 3 1 which consisted of 200 000 leaves and l 6 2 which consisted of 400 000 leaves the surface area of each leaf was 0 006 m2 each leaf angle was set by randomly drawing from a spherical distribution to characterize the plant geometry l and the leaf inclination angle probability density function pdf were calculated for all five generated canopies and the leaf azimuthal angle pdf was calculated for the grape n s and grape e w cases all other cases had azimuthal distributions that were close to uniform the l was calculated by summing the one sided area of all leaves in the canopy and dividing by the total canopy footprint area the leaf inclination angle and leaf azimuthal angle were calculated for each of the elements from the surface normal of the leaf and a pdf was formed by weighting each element s contribution to the pdf by its surface area then normalizing such that the pdf integrates to unity the corn model had predominantly vertically oriented leaves while the almond and potato models had leaves closer to horizontal on average fig 1 grape leaf inclination was skewed toward vertical and leaf azimuth tended to be oriented parallel with the row fig 2 which is supported by previous manual and lidar measurements bailey et al 2014 bailey and mahaffee 2017b the gap fraction was calculated from the 3d models by computing the fraction of direct sunlight not intercepted when θ s 0 table 1 gap fraction values ranged from 80 in the grape canopy cases down to 21 for the corn canopy case although both potato canopy cases had the same l their gap fractions were 22 for uniformly spaced plants and 36 for row oriented plants 2 3 one dimensional model of light interception a simple 1d model eq 1 was used to calculate hourly light interception which utilized two different assumptions of canopy structure the first approach assumed that canopy vegetation is both homogeneous and isotropic the homogeneous assumption implies that vegetation is randomly distributed in space which is already inherent in eq 1 the isotropic assumption implies that leaves have no preferred orientation or that the leaf angle pdf is spherical the second approach assumed that leaves are homogeneous but anisotropic rather than calculating the leaf angle pdf and integrating according to eq 2 the canopy level g θ s was calculated directly from the 3d models using a weighted average of the projected leaf area fraction according to 3 g θ s i 1 m a i n i v i 1 m a i where m is the total number of geometric elements in the virtual canopy n i is a unit vector normal to the surface of the ith geometric element v is a unit vector pointing towards the sun and a i is the one sided surface area of the ith geometric element g values for each hour of a diurnal cycle on julian days 153 232 and 305 are shown in fig 3 for corn g does not vary considerably with the position of the sun whereas the potato and almond cases have high diurnal variation in g as warren wilson 1960 pointed out g values intersect at a solar elevation of about 32 5 for azimuthally symmetric vegetation which corresponds to roughly 8 45 and 17 25 h on julian day 153 and 9 20 and 17 00 h on julian day 232 in fig 3 this intersection occurs for the almond corn and potato cases however because of the highly anisotropic azimuthal leaf distribution of the grape canopies they do not follow this rule in addition to eq 1 which assumes vertical homogeneity within the canopy vertical profiles of hourly absorbed radiation were also calculated by explicitly representing variation of leaf area with height and its corresponding effect on light interception the radiation flux intercepted over a horizontal layer of thickness δz at height z within the canopy was calculated according to 4 i z i 0 1 exp ga δ z cos θ s exp gl z cos θ s where l z is the leaf area index between z and the canopy top and a m2 m 3 is the one sided leaf area density of the layer the 1d model inherently assumes that leaves absorb all incoming radiation there is no theoretically consistent means of accounting for reflection and transmission using eq 1 as the derivation of beer s law requires removal of the scattering terms from the radiative transfer equation modest 2013 several ad hoc approaches have been used in previous work to account for transmission and reflection using some function of the leaf reflectivity ρ and transmissivity τ of which two are considered here the first is to multiply the incoming radiation by 1 ρ 5 i i 0 1 ρ 1 exp gl cos θ s which assumes that all reflected radiation either exits the canopy or reaches the ground without being re absorbed and that there is no transmission the second is to multiply by 1 ρ τ 6 i i 0 1 ρ τ 1 exp gl cos θ s which assumes that all reflected and transmitted radiation either exits the canopy or reaches the ground without being re absorbed 2 4 three dimensional model of light interception it was assumed that the reference or true light interception values were given by the detailed 3d model of bailey 2018 which explicitly represents radiation absorption by each element in the virtual canopy the model uses a backward ray tracing approach that ensures each canopy element adequately samples the sun and was shown to converge exponentially towards the exact answer as the number of rays was increased assuming model inputs are specified exactly the 3d model software and documentation is available though the public github repository https www github com plantsimulationlab helios inputs to the radiation model are the total hemispherical radiative flux w m 2 of the sun over an arbitrary wavelength band as well as the reflectivity and transmissivity of each element in the virtual canopy to test the assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy reflectivity and transmissivity were set to 0 which is an assumption implicit in eq 1 separate tests were then performed to examine the effect of reflection and transmission using either eq 5 or 6 for all simulations the diffuse solar radiation flux was set to 0 which is also implicit in eq 1 the number of rays that were sampled on each element was set to 1000 rays it was verified that further increasing the number of rays had a negligible impact on results a sample visualization of the 3d distribution of absorbed radiation for the virtual canopy cases is shown in fig 4 total daily light interception was calculated by linear interpolation of the hourly light interception fluxes agreement between the 3d model and simplified 1d models was quantified using the index of agreement ia willmott 1981 normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of determination r2 2 5 radiation input data the incoming radiation data used to drive the radiation absorption simulations in this study was generated following the rest 2 model of gueymard 2008 the hourly incoming radiation was calculated based on the assumed virtual site longitude 121 7405 w latitude 38 5449 n offset from utc 7 h atmospheric pressure 101 325 pa air temperature near ground level 25 c atmospheric turbidity coefficient 0 05 relative humidity 50 and julian day of the year 153 232 and 305 it is noted that the precipitable water in the rest 2 model was specified using the model of viswanadham 1981 the direction of the sun for any time of day at the virtual site was calculated following the approach outlined by iqbal 1983 in cases where scattering was included two radiative bands were considered one characteristic of efficient absorption by leaves such as the photosynthetically active band par 400 700 nm and another characteristic of high scattering such as the solar near infrared band nir 700 nm the total incoming solar flux was partitioned as 47 in the par band and 53 in the nir band in the par band ρ was set to 0 056 and τ to 0 042 while in the nir band ρ was set to 0 425 and τ to 0 334 bailey et al 2014 3 results 3 1 daily total light interception results for the daily total light interception on julian days 153 232 and 305 are listed in table 2 and shown graphically in fig 5 for the homogeneous canopy cases very close agreement was found between the 1d and 3d models regardless of l which indicated that the approach used to compare the 1d and 3d models was consistent and that leaf scale heterogeneity created by discrete leaf surfaces did not create significant errors cases with relatively high ground cover fractions and uniformly arranged plants showed good agreement between the 1d and 3d models regardless of whether the assumption of leaf isotropy was made as the canopies became more heterogeneous in space agreement between the models generally declined although potato uniform and potato row had identical leaf area indices and leaf angle distributions the regular distribution of plants within the canopy in potato uniform resulted in better agreement between the 1d and 3d models compared to potato row despite all cases having highly anisotropic leaf inclination distributions the assumption of leaf anisotropy had relatively small impact for all cases except for the grape e w case any effects of heterogeneity or anisotropy tended to decrease as the day of year became further away from the summer solstice toward the end of the year day 305 the 1d and 3d models were in fairly good agreement for all canopy cases 3 2 hourly light interception the diurnal flux of radiation intercepted by the canopy for an hourly time step on julian day 153 is shown in fig 6 with corresponding fractions of total radiation intercepted by the canopy shown in fig 7 the fraction of total radiation intercepted on julian day 253 and 305 are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively for the homogeneous canopy cases the assumptions of vegetation homogeneity and isotropy were closely satisfied and therefore the 1d model was in very good agreement with the 3d model regardless of leaf density table 3 for the crop canopy cases the 1d model consistently over estimated light interception as compared to the 3d model except for grape e w and potato row on julian day 305 for all but the grape cases eliminating the isotropic assumption resulted in little improvement of agreement between the 1d and 3d models indicating that errors arose primarily from heterogeneity in these cases for the grape n s almond and potato cases errors between the 1d and 3d models were largest near midday when sunlight could most readily reach the ground by penetrating through gaps in vegetation for grape e w the largest discrepancies occurred at early and late times of the day the effect of row orientation on diurnal interception patterns for the grape cases was dramatic as this completely changed the character of interception at different times of the year see figs 6 7 8 9 the potato cases also illustrated the pronounced effect of heterogeneity in planting pattern on diurnal interception 3 3 vertical profiles of hourly absorbed radiation fig 10 depicts vertical profiles of the absorbed radiation flux at 8 00 10 00 and 12 00 h on julian day 153 for grape n s grape e w almond and corn errors in absorbed fluxes for grape n s were relatively consistent with height where errors at a given height were most closely related to the magnitude of the absorbed flux at that height this was also roughly the case for almond except that there was the potential for some under estimation of absorption in the lower canopy when the 1d model was used which was most pronounced for larger solar zenith angles for grape e w the 1d model tended to shift the peak in the absorbed flux deeper into the canopy which was most pronounced for larger solar zenith angles in the corn canopy the vertical pattern in radiation interception differed significantly between the 1d and 3d models there were up to 50 differences between 1d and 3d fluxes at a given vertical level with irregular patterns of over or under estimation in the lower canopy there was a peak in absorption in the 3d model which was largely absent in the 1d model leading to under prediction of absorption by the 1d model in the lower canopy this is likely due to the substantial over prediction of absorption by the 1d model in the upper canopy which removes the necessary energy needed to produce a secondary peak in absorption in the lower canopy 3 4 impact of scattering total daily light interception for julian day 153 is shown in fig 11 for different assumptions regarding radiation scattering which is given by either eq 1 fig 11a no scattering eq 5 fig 11b only reflection or eq 6 fig 11c reflection and transmission it is important to note that for the homogeneous canopy cases errors in fig 11 are due only to effects of scattering as it was shown in fig 5 that agreement between the 1d and 3d models was excellent when leaves were black for the crop canopy cases errors in fig 11 are due to the combined effect of scattering and heterogeneity which makes these results somewhat difficult to interpret as evidenced by the homogeneous canopy cases the impact of scattering was minimal for the par band and thus most of the errors in the heterogeneous crop canopy cases were due to heterogeneity and not scattering in the nir band scattering caused very large errors when the standard 1d model was used with all cases over estimating absorption by more than 100 accounting for reflection using eq 5 removed much of this energy but still resulted in significant over estimation of absorbed radiation this approach creates offsetting errors in which absorption is over estimated because transmission is not accounted for but there is simultaneous under estimation due to the assumption that all reflected radiation either reaches the ground or is reflected back to the sky but the net result is over estimation accounting for both reflection and transmission using eq 6 caused net under estimation of the total absorbed flux this is because eq 6 assumes that all reflected and transmitted radiation radiation either reaches the ground or is reflected back to the sky thus overall absorption is under estimated 4 discussion 4 1 effect of leaf angle distribution anisotropy overall anisotropy in leaf inclination had a relatively small effect on errors resulting from the application of beer s law in cases when leaf azimuth was uniformly distributed almond corn and potato the grape cases which had high anisotropy in both the leaf inclination and azimuth distributions did incur significant errors due leaf anisotropy for the 1d model if leaf azimuth is uniformly distributed this effectively reduces the impact of anisotropy in leaf inclination on the projected area fraction g since a leaf with a certain elevation angle could be parallel to the sun at one azimuth and perpendicular to the sun at another an integration over all azimuths can smear out the effects of leaf inclination alone as in the virtual canopies of this study field measurements have shown that leaf inclination distributions are usually highly anisotropic niinemets 1998 2010 raabe et al 2015 bailey and mahaffee 2017b the azimuthal distribution of leaves may be strongly anisotropic within a single plant bailey and mahaffee 2017b but for relatively dense canopies the azimuthal distribution is often fairly isotropic ross 1981 in these cases the assumption of leaf isotropy is likely to result in minimal errors however sparse row oriented crops such as vineyards may have highly anisotropic azimuthal distributions bailey and mahaffee 2017b in which case it may be necessary to explicitly calculate g based on measurements these types of canopies are becoming increasingly prevalent in agricultural applications e g apples olives connor 2006 lauri 2009 due in part to the improved access to mechanical harvesters that a trellised or hedgerow canopy provides 4 2 effect of plant spacing horizontal heterogeneity plant spacing and the resulting heterogeneity had the most pronounced effect on errors resulting from the use of beer s law for the grape n s case the assumption of homogeneity resulted in an overestimation of the total daily absorbed radiation by 28 30 and 36 on julian days 153 232 and 305 respectively with larger instantaneous over estimation near midday for the grape e w case the assumption of homogeneity also resulted in overestimating the total daily absorbed radiation by 74 51 and 5 on julian days 153 232 and 305 respectively this was not simply an effect related to l as was illustrated by the two potato cases by simply rearranging the potato plants from a uniformly spaced into a row oriented configuration errors in the 1d model increased substantially it is possible that the effect of horizontal heterogeneity can vary in the vertical direction which appeared to be the case with the corn canopy this significantly altered the performance of the 1d model at any given height although the canopy was dense enough overall that the 1d model performed well when predicting whole canopy radiation absorption this could have important implications if the radiation model is coupled with other biophysical models such as a photosynthesis model the response of photosynthesis to light is nonlinear and asymptotic taiz and zeiger 2014 so although whole canopy absorption may be well represented in some cases by a 1d horizontally homogeneous model it is unclear if that will result in significant errors in total photosynthetic production given the nonlinearity of its response to light a limitation of this study is that results are only applicable under clear sky conditions however the results can provide some insight regarding diffuse sky conditions by simultaneously considering all canopy geometries and simulated sun angles under a uniformly overcast sky equal energy originates from all directions a particular combination of sun angle and leaf orientation bias was required in order to observe a pronounced effect of leaf anisotropy thus for diffuse solar conditions it is speculated that the impact of leaf anisotropy will be decreased sun angle had an important effect on the instantaneous impact of leaf heterogeneity and most commonly it was observed that low sun angles resulted in a decreased impact of heterogeneity therefore it is likely that highly diffuse conditions will reduce the impact of heterogeneity near midday because a significant fraction of incoming radiation will originate from directions nearer to the horizon estimating light interception with beer s law is based on the assumption that canopies are homogeneous this inherently means that the rate of radiation attenuation along a given path is linearly related to the flux at that location as the canopy becomes sparse there are pathways for radiation propagation that allow radiation to penetrate the entire canopy without any probability of interception which fundamentally violates the assumptions behind beer s law or a turbid medium therefore the non random leaf dispersion in canopies limits the ability of beer s law to link light interception to simple bulk measures of plant architecture it is well known that this heterogeneity or clumping of vegetation usually results in decreased radiation interception as compared with an equivalent homogeneous canopy a common means of dealing with this problem without significantly increasing model complexity is to add a clumping coefficient ω to the argument of the exponential function in beer s law nilson 1971 smith et al 1993 kucharik et al 1999 while this is a simple and practical means of reducing the amount of radiation attenuation predicted by beer s law the challenge in applying the clumping coefficient approach is that ω is a complex function of nearly every applicable variable chen et al 2008 and thus is it is difficult to mechanistically specify another approach is to use a model that explicitly resolves plant level heterogeneity e g norman and welles 1983 north 1996 bailey et al 2014 as it may not be necessary to explicitly resolve every leaf if within plant heterogeneity is small 4 3 effect of row orientation row orientation played an important role when estimating light interception from beer s law particularly when the rows were widely spaced for sparse row oriented canopies the effective path length of the sun s rays through vegetation can change dramatically with changes in sun azimuth for east west rows absorption is significantly reduced early and late in the day because the rows are close to parallel with the sun s rays whereas north south rows are perpendicular to the sun at this time as the day of year progresses further from the summer solstice the sun spends more time closer to the horizon and thus the impact of heterogeneity in an east west row orientation increased for the east west row configuration g θ s and light interception were surprisingly constant throughout much of the day which resulted in 41 and 36 less absorption on julian days 153 and 232 respectively compared to north south rows this has important practical implications for agricultural design applications in some climates it may be desirable to maximize sunlight interception whereas in others it may be desirable to mitigate effects of excess sunlight to reduce temperatures and water use 4 4 effect of light scattering despite the simplified assumptions in beer s law regarding scattering there was good agreement between predicted radiation interception using the 1d and 3d models in the par band scattering did not significantly influence light interception in this band because most of the incident radiation received by individual leaves was absorbed however in the nir band scattering introduced significant over estimation of absorption using the standard 1d model since leaves are poor absorbers in this band using an ad hoc correction to account for reflection only reduced this over estimation of absorption an additional correction to account for both reflection and transmission resulted in over correction and a net under prediction of total radiation absorption 5 conclusion the objective of this work was to evaluate common assumptions used in estimating radiation absorption in plant canopies namely assumptions of homogeneity or isotropy of vegetation our results demonstrated that for relatively dense canopies with azimuthally symmetric leaves a 1d model that assumes homogeneity and isotropy of vegetation generally produced relatively small errors as plant spacing became large the assumptions of homogeneity break down and model errors became large in the case of a vineyard with rows oriented in the east west direction errors in daily intercepted radiation were up to 70 due to heterogeneity alone with much larger instantaneous errors occurring during the day if leaves were highly anisotropic in the azimuthal direction there was also the potential for large errors resulting from the assumption of vegetation isotropy which had the potential to increase errors above 100 day of year had an impact on model errors which was that overall errors tended to decline with time from the summer solstice in cases of canopies where the plant spacing starts to approach the plant height it is likely necessary to use a plant resolving radiation model in order to avoid substantial over prediction of absorbed radiative fluxes additionally if vegetation is highly anisotropic in terms of both elevation and azimuthal angle distributions it is also likely necessary to explicitly calculate the projected area fraction g θ s based on measurements and the instantaneous position of the sun acknowledgements financial support of this work was provided by the american vineyard foundation grants 2016 1825 2017 1825 and the usda national institute of food

25037,the topeka shiner a small cyprinid fish is a seminal example of an endangered aquatic species in the midwestern usa populations and their associated critical habitats may experience potential direct and or indirect effects from anthropogenic activity however potential impacts on fish populations from alterations in the food web are difficult to predict because they are based on complex dynamics of food web interactions in order to simulate topeka shiner population dynamics under different food web scenarios a hybrid modeling approach was developed by linking an aquatic food web

aquatic species community in a small headwater pool in iowa representative of key habitat for the topeka shiner within its geographical range in the ts ibm life history growth and diet are represented and based on data available from the literature for the topeka shiner and or surrogate species the two models are linked by the transfer of daily biomasses of topeka shiner diet items we simulated the effects of alterations of the food web on the topeka shiner populations by systematically reducing the available prey base biomass reductions in different food groups had varying impacts on the simulated topeka shiner populations and were dependent on the species preference for detritus consumption simulations also included predation and identified predator densities to which topeka shiner

management and species recovery plans keywords individual based model aquatic systems model topeka shiner endangered species act food web 1 introduction in the past two centuries the landscape of the midwestern usa has changed significantly due to numerous factors including increased demand for agricultural production once dominated by prairie grasslands the landscape today is characterized primarily by row crop agriculture and urbanization consequently many waterbodies have been altered by groundwater withdrawal impoundments and channelization which has had enduring effects on aquatic habitats u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 the topeka shiner notropis topeka is a seminal example of a fish species that has been affected by these changes and as a consequence federal authorities have listed it as endangered under the us endangered species act esa tabor 1998 under the esa populations of threatened and endangered species and their habitats should be protected to

remnant populations remain across its former range fig 1 therefore waterbodies where populations are found are crucial to the species viability and these populations and corresponding habitats are potentially vulnerable to disturbance stressors that may affect topeka shiner habitats include sedimentation pesticide and nutrient containing agricultural runoff decreased stream flow homeostatic

waterbodies where populations of this endangered fish can be found gessner and tlili 2016 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 however potential food web mediated impacts on fish populations are difficult to predict because they are based on complex spatial temporal patterns of food web interactions the food web context can be important in assessing the population viability of endangered species for example the dependence of a species on different food sources can strongly influence whether and what changes in the food web could affect populations over extended time periods topeka shiners feed on a variety of items including zooplankton aquatic insect larvae plant matter and detritus dahle 2001 hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 detritus was found in topeka shiner guts in all studies but whether detritus is consumed by the fish intentionally or ingested along with bottom dwelling prey remains unclear hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 the ability of fish species to subsist on a diet consisting mostly of detritus can impact the population s ability to survive times with low availability of other food herwig and zimmer 2007 a hybrid model that combines a species specific population model of the topeka shiner with a food web ecosystem modeling approach provides one avenue for investigating the relevance of these observations on the projected viability of topeka shiner populations in the current paper we introduce a hybrid modeling approach developed to assess hypothesized direct population level and indirect food web mediated impacts of potential stressors on the population abundance and viability of topeka shiner the hybrid model consists of an individual based model of topeka shiner that is linked to an aquatic food web model the individual based population model ts ibm incorporates characteristics of the life history diet and growth of the topeka shiners reported in the literature temporal patterns in individual ontogeny result in varying population structure and feeding requirements across a simulated year stressors or disturbances may differentially affect the life stages or life stage specific diet potentially leading to different long term outcomes on the population level de lange et al 2010 gergs et al 2013 the aquatic food web providing the diet for the simulated topeka shiner populations in the hybrid model is represented by casmts an adaptation of the comprehensive aquatic systems model casm bartell et al 2013 2018 nair et al 2015 the casmts was adapted to allow the linkage to the newly developed

temperature pool size water depths and water flow as well as carbon phosphorus and nitrate inputs to the system were developed from previous applications of the casm bartell et al 2013 and data relevant to midwestern headwater pools our hybrid modeling approach links the casmts to the ts ibm via transfers of daily biomasses of the topeka shiner diet groups food availability determined by casmts impacts the bioenergetics and consequently the growth of individual topeka shiners in the individual based model in the current paper we describe the hybrid model approach which was implemented using two versions of model linkage 1 daily biomass values produced by casmts as yearly input to the ts ibm and 2 daily exchange of biomass values in a feedback loop between the two models we compare the topeka shiner population dynamics simulated with the hybrid model versions to the dynamics simulated as biomass compartment in casmts stand alone the purpose of the model comparison is to demonstrate suitability of the hybrid model to represent detailed population dynamics of the focal species and ultimately to serve as a tool for species specific risk assessments that can address direct and indirect effects on endangered species populations to gain better understanding of the sensitivities of the hybrid model to potential food web mediated effects on topeka shiner populations we then assess the impacts of hypothetical food reductions and the interaction with assumptions about topeka shiner food preferences finally we investigate the impacts of predation by largemouth bass

direct and indirect effects of pesticides on modeled population dynamics of the topeka shiner within a food web ecosystem context the casmts generates daily outputs of the biomass of adult topeka shiners and the biomass of populations of associated fish aquatic plants and invertebrates e g bartell et al 2018 2013 nair et al 2015 the model provides an operational framework to examine the potential direct and indirect i e food web ecological effects of environmental stressors a detailed description of the casmts is provided as material appendix a to this more general overview appendix a for the casmts is organized according to trace schmolke et al 2010 grimm et al 2014 and odd protocols grimm et al 2006 2010 2 2 1 model physical site description casmts was adapted and calibrated to represent a hypothetical headwater stream pool characteristic of central iowa a demonstrated area of topeka shiner habitat bakevich et al 2013 headwater habitats in iowa have not been well described therefore the physical dimensions of the modeled headwater pool were derived in part from the characterization of lower order iowa streams for example fischer et al 2010 described the habitat attributes of 247 macrohabitats within 41 stream reaches in central iowa across stream fish assemblages not including topeka shiner mean reach widths were 6 m with an average depth of 0 5 m the study of 84 wadable 3rd order streams in central iowa found an average width of 10 8 m and depth of 0 38 m sindt et al 2012 heitke et al 2006 measured 37 iowa streams ranging from 2nd to 6th order and found an average reach width of 17 3 m with a corresponding average depth of 0 49 m sixty seven in stream habitats of known topeka shiner distributions in iowa had a mean width of 6 37 m and corresponding mean depth of 0 42 m bakevich et al 2013 the iowa habitat descriptions compare with in stream habitat metrics reported for 34 in stream topeka shiner habitats located in kansas e g gerken and paukert 2013 mean pool length was 70 5 m with corresponding mean width of 12 9 m and mean depth of 1 5 m similarly schrank et al 2001 reported mean pool length of 80 9 m mean width of 14 2 m and mean depth of 0 5 m for 26 locations in kansas inhabited by topeka shiner based on the general and topeka shiner habitat descriptions provided for iowa and further informed by the kansas studies the physical dimensions of the topeka shiner model defined a headwater pool with a length of 75 m width of 15 m and average depth of approximately 1 5 m 2 2 2 environmental input data the casmts simulates the daily growth dynamics of the modeled state variables in relation to a dynamic physical chemical environment the modeled environmental inputs include surface irradiance water temperature water depth current velocity and wind velocity modeled water quality factors include dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip dissolved silica dissolved and particulate organic carbon doc poc and suspended inorganic solids a generalized iowa headwater stream habitat was derived for the casmts by defining daily values of these environmental attributes table 1 2 2 3 aquatic plants the casmts includes multiple populations of phytoplankton periphyton attached algae and submerged aquatic vascular plants representative of an iowa headwater pool biomass production for primary producer populations is governed by a bioenergetics based equation that describes changes in plant biomass carbon as a function of photosynthesis minus losses to catabolic processes e g photorespiration respiration non grazing or natural mortality and grazing in the casmts photosynthesis is a nonlinear function of light temperature and nutrient nitrogen phosphorous silica availability suspended inorganic sediments contribute to light attenuation and influence production of phytoplankton periphyton and macrophytes growth is additionally modified by habitat factors including accumulated degree days water depth and current velocity daily biomass represented in carbon equivalent per pool area g c m2 for each modeled aquatic plant population bi is computed by the casmts the community structure of aquatic plants included in the casmts and their associated parameter values were based on previous model development and application to midwestern lower order streams nair et al 2015 bartell et al 2013 appendix a describes the casmts modeling of aquatic plants in detail 2 2 4 aquatic consumers the community composition of zooplankton benthic invertebrates and fishes included in the casmts was similarly informed by previous midwestern stream modeling nair et al 2015 bartell et al 2013 and descriptions of fish assemblages associated with topeka shiner e g bakevich et al 2013 stark et al 2002 biomass production for consumer populations modeled in the casmts is a function of consumption ingestion and assimilation of food or prey minus losses to respiration excretion natural mortality and predation these processes are nonlinear functions of temperature respiration and food availability consumption predation modeled consumer populations are distinguished by population specific rates of feeding respiration excretion prey preferences prey assimilation and temperatures for maximum feeding and respiration the daily values of biomass g c m2 for each modeled population bi of zooplankton aquatic insects benthic invertebrates and fish are determined by bioenergetics based differential equations bartell et al 2013 2 2 5 parameter estimation the casmts baseline or reference simulation requires initial i e doy 1 january 1 biomass values and parameters that define the overall growth dynamics of each modeled population initial biomass values were developed based on reported biomass e g dodds et al 2000 values and calibration of the model all guilds in casmts except fish are set to the initial biomass values at the beginning of each simulated year for density dependent fish populations all fish guilds in casmts except largemouth bass an equilibrium initial biomass was determined as the biomass reached on the last day of simulation year 5 under baseline conditions bioenergetics parameters were based on previous applications of the model e g bartell et al 2013 further informed by species specific data for taxa included in the casmts food web see appendix a for a detailed description rates of maximum consumption cmax g g d for the fish populations were estimated using the wisconsin fish bioenergetics model hanson et al 1997 according to cmax ca wcb where ca intercept of the allometric mass function cb slope of the allometric mass function w dry mass of individual bioenergetics parameters have not been developed for the topeka shiner the basic bioenergetics values defined for topeka shiner in the casmts and used to estimate population growth were based on fathead minnow pimephales promelas rafinesque 1820 duffy 1998 deslauriers et al 2017 and supported by a documented association of topeka shiners with fathead minnows bakevich et al 2013 density dependent growth rates were incorporated for all the modeled fish populations except largemouth bass in the casmts paukert and willis 2004 post et al 1998 values of an optimal and a maximum population biomass were estimated by trial and error to produce fish population growth dynamics consistent with reported values for midwestern topeka shiner habitats e g bakevich et al 2013 dodds et al 2000 kerns and bonneau 2002 for topeka shiner the density dependent growth specified in the casmts stand alone constrained the population production to a maximum carrying capacity of 0 35 g c m2 for the headwater pool as derived from kerns and bonneau 2002 2 2 6 food web interactions the model describes the grazing and predator prey interactions among the modeled populations by specifying values for prey preference wij assimilation efficiency aij and handling efficiency hij for each defined trophic interaction prey preference represents the feeding habits of each species in the food web the assimilation efficiency is a measure of the energy content of the food that can be metabolized the handling efficiency represents the time or energy expense by the consumer to catch and ingest the prey in casmts the simplifying assumption was applied that handling efficiency does not differ dependent on food item i e hij was set to 1 for all food web interactions parameter values were developed from the literature for the casmts consumer populations the detailed values for all the casmts trophic interactions are provided in appendix a for casmts stand alone simulations including topeka shiner populations as guild in the food web the values for topeka shiner prey preference and assimilation rate were identical to the values used by the ts ibm table 2 2 3 description of ts ibm we provide a detailed description of the individual based population model for the topeka shiner ts ibm in the supplementary material appendix b the documentation follows the transparent and comprehensive ecological model documentation trace schmolke et al 2010 grimm et al 2014 the trace document includes the detailed model description according to the overview design and details protocol odd grimm et al 2006 2010 in the following sections we provide a summary of the model description the ts ibm was implemented in netlogo 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 and the model code and input files are made available on github https github com waterborne env topeka shiner model in the ts ibm topeka shiners are represented individually fish start the life cycle as eggs and transition to larvae neither eggs nor larvae consume food in the ts ibm but larvae were assumed to use energy from their reserves both life stages have a fixed duration 5 days each campbell et al 2016 once fish reach juvenile stage they start consuming food from the food web the biomasses in the food web are provided as input files to ts ibm with daily values for each diet group table 2 the input file corresponds to a yearly output file generated by the casmts the diet composition of the juvenile topeka shiners was assumed to differ from those of subadults and adults the transition from juveniles to subadults and from subadults to adults occurs when a fish reaches a threshold length 15 and 30 mm sl respectively sex ratio was assumed to be 50 50 and sex is assigned upon creation of individual fish in the model adult females spawn once per spawning season and the clutch size is a function of female size fish can die due to background mortality starvation or predation fish reaching an age of 3 years old die after the end of the spawning season the ts ibm includes negative density dependence affecting egg and larval survival by applying a ricker function to egg and larval survival rates dependent on the sum of biomasses of subadult and adult topeka shiners in the population morris and doak 2002 predation on topeka shiners can occur if largemouth bass are present in the food web subadult and adult topeka shiners are removed from the population dependent on the consumption rate of largemouth bass the diet preferences of topeka shiners derive from gut content studies dahle 2001 hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 diet items described in these studies were aligned with guilds simulated in casmts and diet preference values were derived from the reported proportion by volume of these items in topeka shiner gut contents fig 2 shows diet compositions aligned with casmts guilds derived from topeka shiner gut contents further detail on topeka shiner diet representation in the model is provided in appendix b sections 1 4 6 and 2 6 only adult topeka shiners were included in the studies of gut content and these data were used to define the diet of subadult and adult topeka shiners in the ts ibm as well as the casmts when applied stand alone including the simulation of topeka shiner populations many fish species show a shift in their diet during their ontogeny often relying on zooplankton in early life stages and shifting to larger prey as their body size increases werner and gilliam 1984 graeb et al 2006 nunn et al 2007 tabor et al 2007 linzmaier et al 2018 because no data on diet of juvenile topeka shiners were available we assumed that juvenile topeka shiners consume smaller food items than the adult fish included in the gut content studies in the model we applied a hypothetical juvenile diet of zooplankton composed of cladocera copepoda rotifera and microzooplankton and detritus a hypothetical preference value of 0 25 was applied across juvenile diet guilds assimilation rates the proportions of energy in ingested prey that were actually absorbed were derived from literature for fish in general and applied irrespective of life stage preferences and assimilation rates were applied in the functional response to food type in the ts ibm the energy that can be gained from food items by topeka shiners in the bioenergetics model is dependent on the energy density of the food groups the guilds consumed by subadult and adult topeka shiners the preference for each diet guild the assimilation rates and energy densities are listed in table 2 each simulated fish starting with the larval stage grows or loses weight in each time step according to the wisconsin fish bioenergetics model hanson et al 1997 deslauriers et al 2017 in the bioenergetics model consumption and respiration rates depend on water temperature waste losses due to egestion and excretion are modeled as a fraction of the consumption rate food consumption is functionally linked to the food availability in the waterbody applying a functional response assumes that rather than all diet biomass being readily available for consumption by all topeka shiners in the model until it is completely depleted decreasing densities of food items i e biomasses in the water body result in reduced encounter rates with food items and accordingly reduced consumption rates the functional response was implemented as a holling type ii function for each diet guild bartell et al 2013 the food availability biomass available for consumption by topeka shiners was modeled as a function of the size of the fish the smaller a simulated fish the smaller the range of daily foraging or search area the modeled search area scales with the ¾ power of the fish standard length accolla et al 2015 this assumption progressively limits feeding with declining food density because decreasing biomass per volume is available to a fish in the model the hybrid model was achieved by using daily biomasses of all guilds in casmts as an input to the ts ibm transferring daily biomasses from the casmts to the ts ibm as a yearly input file makes it possible to systematically alter biomass values in food guilds generated by casmts to run different systematic scenarios of food reduction see simulations in contrast the linkage of the two models on a daily basis see 2 4 model linking explicitly represents the consumption by topeka shiners in the ts ibm by affecting biomasses of its food guilds in casmts but does not allow for the systematic manipulation of food availabilities the ts ibm was calibrated to match reported topeka shiner sizes at different ages appendix b section 5 1 this was achieved by calibrating the relationship between fish weight and maximum consumption rate in addition the density dependence of egg and larval survival rates were calibrated to achieve approximate population stability over multiple simulated years see appendix b section 5 1 2 we included density dependence in the model to account for potential competition within topeka shiner populations for resources other than food density dependence of the early life stages was chosen because the survival rates of eggs and larvae could not be parameterized from literature data in addition topeka shiners were reported to consume fish eggs potentially including eggs from conspecific clutches 2 4 model linking in fig 3 a conceptual representation depicts the linking between the casmts food web model with the species specific ts ibm to achieve the hybrid model the hybrid model can be applied in two distinct ways via input files or via computational linking first the casmts provides daily topeka shiner diet group biomass values as yearly input for use by the ts ibm a baseline simulation using the casmts without topeka shiner provides the daily time series of food guild biomass values input to the ts ibm the biomass outputs from topeka shiner diet guilds in the food web produced by the casmts are used as input to ts ibm where the topeka shiner population dynamics are simulated based on the food availability using casmts biomass outputs from simulations without topeka shiners assumes that the impact of the consumption rates of the simulated topeka shiners in the ts ibm do not have a significant impact on the food web in addition this version of the hybrid model allows for the manipulation of the casmts input to the ts ibm and for simulations over multiple years by repeating yearly casmts outputs as inputs to ts ibm second the ts ibm and casmts were computationally linked on a daily basis in this version of the hybrid model biomass values were exchanged in a feedback loop between the two models accordingly potential impacts of topeka shiner on the food web were represented rather than assumed to be absent as in the hybrid model with yearly inputs in the hybrid model with daily linkage the ts ibm was conducted for a single daily time step including consumption by topeka shiners the topeka shiner biomass and the biomass values of the diet guilds after consumption by topeka shiners were transferred to casmts the biomass values transferred from the ts ibm were used as initial biomass values of the daily time step in casmts in turn all the casmts equations were integrated over the same model day and the effects of topeka shiner on food web dynamics were directly computed however topeka shiner biomasses were not altered in casmts in the hybrid model linked on daily basis but only determined the biomass available for simulating food web dynamics the resulting changes in topeka shiner diet guilds simulated by the casmts were then returned to the ts ibm for the next time step computations biomass values of diet guilds and the biomass of topeka shiner eaten by largemouth bass if included in the simulations were transferred back to the ts ibm this reciprocal transfer of biomass values was repeated for the duration of the simulation 365 days 2 5 simulations 2 5 1 model comparison baseline we compared the outputs of the casmts stand alone with those of the two versions of the hybrid model with this comparison we assessed the difference between representing a topeka shiner population as an aggregated biomass unit as in casmts to an individual based representation as in ts ibm in casmts stand alone simulations the topeka shiner population was represented as a unit of adult biomass in the modeled aquatic food web the biomass of the fish population changed according to bioenergetics equations that are influenced by water temperature and food availability in casmts stand alone density dependence limits the overall consumption by the whole population of topeka shiner more detailed dynamics occurring on the individual level are not represented in casmts in the ts ibm individual fish are simulated to grow and transition through life stages based on their size accordingly not all life stages are present at all times of the year food limitation affects fish individually and may lead to reduced reproductive output or death of fish rather than reducing a unit of overall biomass all individuals are affected dependent on their life stage and biomass which may result in different population level outcomes between the casmts stand alone model and the hybrid model for simulations with casmts and the hybrid model we used the same starting conditions the casmts stand alone version without topeka shiner was run for 5 years to reach equilibrium biomasses in density dependent fish populations the biomass values of all guilds in casmts other than fish were reset to the initial biomass on the first day of every simulated year the biomass output from the last day of year 5 was used as starting condition of fish biomass values for all simulations with the hybrid model and casmts stand alone simulations referred to as year 1 simulations were conducted assuming no predation on topeka shiners no largemouth bass present in the food web for simulations with the hybrid model 20 repetitions were conducted to characterize the effects of stochastic processes defined in the ts ibm on modeled results 2 5 2 model comparison food availability we assessed the sensitivity of the topeka shiner population in the hybrid model to hypothetical removals of food groups from the food web diet items were grouped according to table 3 food groups were removed by setting the biomass of the included guilds to zero in the casmts generated biomass input file across the simulated year these manipulated input files were used with the hybrid model yearly inputs from casmts to ts ibm for comparison the effects of food availability on the simulated biomass of topeka shiner were similarly examined using the stand alone version of the casmts in these simulations topeka shiner food biomass values were simulated as part of the internal food web dynamics it is not possible to simply adjust guild biomass values in the casmts as done in the hybrid model by manipulating the biomasses in the casmts generated input file to the ts ibm to examine the sensitivity of modeled topeka shiner populations in casmts stand alone to food availability diet preference values to food groups listed in table 3 were set to zero switching topeka shiner consumption of specified food guilds off in casmts stand alone is analogous to 0 of the food guilds available for consumption by topeka shiner the initial biomass of topeka shiner 0 282 g c m2 used in the casmts stand alone simulations was identical to that used in the hybrid model approach 2 5 3 interactions of food availability and detritus preference to evaluate effects of hypothetical food reductions over time and to identify the importance of different diet groups for topeka shiner populations casmts biomass values used in the ts ibm were systematically altered these simulations were conducted with the hybrid model approach using yearly casmts biomass outputs as inputs to the ts ibm no reciprocal transfer of biomass values between the models biomass outputs from casmts year 1 were used as control settings the hypothetical changes in the food web were applied for 15 years in the ts ibm simulations i e the same yearly casmts biomass input file was repeated 15 times the importance of food groups results from the interaction between food availability and diet preferences of simulated fish different food groups were reduced to 50 25 12 5 6 25 and 0 from the baseline biomass values generated by casmts across the whole year table 3 for all scenarios 20 repetitions were conducted with the ts ibm no predation on topeka shiner was simulated in these scenarios to further assess the interaction between food availability and diet preferences we additionally altered the preference for detritus consumption by topeka shiners the baseline preference for detritus 0 17 was derived from gut content studies fig 2 however it is uncertain whether detritus is ingested intentionally by the topeka shiners or consumed accidentally along with benthic organisms hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 through applying different preferences for detritus 0 0 05 0 1 0 17 we assessed the importance of other diet groups for topeka shiner under different detritus consumption rates for the simulations with altered detritus preferences in the ts ibm the parameters α c m a x and β c m a x were recalibrated to achieve fish sizes at given ages as reported in the literature dahle 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 calibrating cmax rather than the preference values for other food groups allowed the direct comparison between model versions and reduced the calibration effort to two parameters rather than nine 2 5 4 predation piscivorous fish predominantly largemouth bass introduced in topeka shiner habitats are discussed as potentially threatening the population viability of this listed species kerns and bonneau 2002 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 with the casmts we simulated the aquatic food web dynamics with and without the presence of largemouth bass in these simulations topeka shiner populations were included as guilds in the food web as well the biomass removed from the topeka shiner guild by largemouth bass was calculated in each daily time step and included in the yearly biomass input to the ts ibm i e simulations were conducted using the hybrid model version with yearly casmts biomass outputs as inputs to the ts ibm no reciprocal transfer of biomass values between the models in the ts ibm it was assumed that only subadult or adult topeka shiners are subject to predation by largemouth bass the biomass removed from the topeka shiner guild in casmts each day was used as a probability of individual subadult and adult fish to die in the ts ibm see appendix b section 1 4 4 initial biomass of largemouth bass was defined as the approximate equivalent of a single fish 0 171 g c m2 in the headwater pool waterbody simulated by casmts topeka shiner biomass was initialized with 0 282 g c m2 the topeka shiner biomass consumed by largemouth bass in casmts on a daily basis corresponded to less than a single subadult or adult topeka shiner accordingly individual topeka shiner fish were not removed from the ts ibm population on a daily basis to test the impacts of a different level of predation on topeka shiners in the hybrid model we increased the biomass removed by largemouth bass by factor of 2 across the simulated year simulations without largemouth bass with default predation and increased predation intensity were conducted for 15 modeled years with 20 repetitions each these simulations were also conducted under different detritus preferences of topeka shiner 2 6 sensitivity analysis the impacts of changes in select parameter values on ts ibm population level topeka shiner biomass values g c m2 were assessed for a set of model parameters see appendix b section 6 1 perturbations in key parameters of several submodels were conducted mortality and density dependence survival rates in egg and larval stages diet detritus assimilation rate functional response search area scaling factor bioenergetics factor α c m a x in the calculation of cmax and fish condition kmin parameter values were perturbed by 20 relative to their default value exceptions were the survival rates of eggs and larvae where a range of 20 was applied around the survival rates across the 10 days the simulated fish spend in egg and larval stage combined rather than the daily survival rate in addition tested assimilation rates for detritus were derived from ranges reported in the literature for fish in general the sensitivity of the casmts stand alone to uncertain parameter values was not included in this modeling study however the sensitivity of bioenergetics based population and food web models has been well described in previous analyses e g bartell et al 1986 1988 3 results 3 1 model comparison baseline seasonal pattern and magnitude of adult topeka shiner biomass produced by the stand alone casmts was compared with the two versions of the hybrid model approach the ts ibm with yearly casmts generated biomass inputs and the models reciprocally linked on a daily basis fig 4 all simulations exhibited declining topeka shiner biomass from january through april owing in large part to low water temperatures low feeding rates by topeka shiner and correspondingly seasonal low food availability an increase in topeka shiner biomass from may through november was associated with higher topeka shiner consumption rates and increased food availability the casmts stand alone showed lower ranges of seasonal biomass fluctuations and peak biomass of topeka shiner populations compared to the simulations with the hybrid model fig 4 simulation results from the two versions of the hybrid model were similar across the simulated year in the hybrid model the numbers of individuals total or per stage or age class could also be observed topeka shiner numbers peaked earlier in the year than biomass fig 5 total individual numbers peaked during the reproductive period june july maximum adult numbers were observed in september 3 2 model comparison food availability we compared the hybrid with the casmts stand alone approach using a range of food availability scenarios in the hybrid model without daily reciprocal linkage biomasses in the yearly casmts generated input file were set to zero by food group see table 3 correspondingly the preferences for the consumption of the food groups were set to zero in casmts stand alone simulations including topeka shiner as biomass guild removal of all food led to decline in topeka shiner biomass in both models fig 6 a the shiner biomass disappeared faster in the hybrid model because individuals died of starvation in casmts the biomass compartment was reduced at a slower rate across the summer and early fall months until reaching the imposed minimum guild biomass when all food was removed except detritus sediment poc populations were still present at the end of the simulated year but at reduced biomass fig 6b removal of only detritus did not impact topeka shiner biomass in casmts but resulted in biomass reduction of the population in the hybrid model fig 6c reductions in periphyton or zooplankton availabilities did not clearly impact topeka shiner populations in either model fig 6d e but topeka shiner populations were sensitive to the removal of macroinvertebrate diet guilds fig 6f 3 3 interactions of food availability and detritus preference with the hybrid model we tested the sensitivity of topeka shiner populations to different levels of food reduction over 15 years when all diet items were reduced simultaneously the biomass of simulated topeka shiner populations was reduced dramatically in comparison to controls fig 7 topeka shiner biomass dropped steeply in comparison to the scenario with 100 food availability within the first few simulated years topeka shiner biomasses after 15 years of altered food availabilities were considerably lower than without food reduction fig 7 populations went extinct within the simulated time period when food was below 25 of the controls when only a subset of diet items was reduced in biomass the impact on topeka shiner populations depended strongly on the preference of topeka shiners for detritus consumption fig 8 with the default detritus preference 0 17 reductions in detritus availability resulted in large impacts on simulated populations fig 8c and were comparable to the impacts in reductions of all other diet items combined fig 8b in contrast reductions in periphyton availability did not impact topeka shiner biomasses fig 8d reductions in zooplankton resulted in slight reductions of topeka shiner biomasses fig 8e reduction in macroinvertebrate availability resulted in impacts on topeka shiner populations comparable to those when only detritus was reduced fig 8f in additional simulations we combined food reduction scenarios with altered preferences for detritus by topeka shiners overall when the preference for detritus in topeka shiners was reduced the importance of diet items other than detritus increased fig 8 for instance reductions in periphyton biomass did not affect topeka shiner populations when baseline detritus preference was assumed however if topeka shiners were assumed to have lower or no preference for detritus consumption reductions in periphyton availability resulted in declining topeka shiner biomass fig 8d when detritus preference was 0 and periphyton was removed from the food web simulated topeka shiner populations did not persist for the 15 simulated years fig 8d similarly reductions in zooplankton availability only resulted in impacts on the topeka shiner populations if the preference for detritus consumption was reduced from baseline fig 8f note that juvenile topeka shiners were assumed to eat only zooplankton and detritus in addition to reduction in biomass of topeka shiner populations food limitation also resulted in an altered population structure fig 9 in the baseline scenario without food reduction most individuals reached maturity a year after they hatched a peak in adults 1 year old in june denoted this transition in the baseline scenario fig 9a however when no macroinvertebrates were available in the food web most subadults did not reach maturity within a year of hatching and no peak in adults 1 year old occurred in late spring or early summer fig 9b 3 4 predation simulated predation by largemouth bass with a single predatory fish in the pool led to reduced topeka shiner biomasses after 15 years fig 10 this depended on detritus preferences when detritus preference was reduced from the default value predation resulted in complete removal of the topeka shiner populations with doubled predation levels simulated topeka shiner populations were extinct before the end of the 15 year simulations independent of the detritus preference 3 5 sensitivity analysis the function linking maximum consumption rate to fish weight was identified as highly impactful to topeka shiner population biomass factor α c m a x in the calculation of cmax increasing maximum consumption rate resulted in decreasing population biomass in addition the minimum viable fish condition kmin was identified as highly influential increasing kmin to 0 748 or higher from a default value of 0 68 resulted in decreasing population biomass reduction in kmin had no clear impact on the simulated topeka shiner population small changes in egg and larval survival 20 of survival rate across both life stages did not have a major impact on population biomass nor did changes in the daily search area modeled as a function of fish length detailed results from the sensitivity analysis are described in appendix b section 6 1 4 discussion endangered species assessment requires addressing both direct and indirect effects of potential stressors here we present a hybrid modeling approach to assess indirect impacts on the endangered topeka shiner through reductions in its food base and to assess direct effects through predation this approach leveraged the strengths of an aquatic food web model and a species specific individual based population model of the endangered topeka shiner to achieve the hybrid model the daily biomasses of guilds simulated by casmts were used in ts ibm simulations to represent the topeka shiner prey base the hybrid model was achieved by two versions of linking casmts and ts ibm via input files or via computational linking on a daily basis the aquatic food web model casm represented fish populations including topeka shiner as homogeneous compartments of biomass bartell et al 2013 we compared the outputs related to topeka shiner dynamics from the casmts stand alone version to the outputs from the two versions of the hybrid model biomass dynamics across a simulated year differed in the two models with more pronounced variations of total population biomass across the year in the hybrid model food web composition was generated by casmts in both models any differences in topeka shiner population dynamics were exclusively due to the explicit representation of individual level processes and population structure in the hybrid model biomass dynamics in the two hybrid model versions did not substantially differ further confirming that explicitly representing individual level processes in the individual based approach resulted in observed differences with casmts we assessed potential indirect impacts on the endangered topeka shiner by systematically removing food groups from their diet in both models in the model the relatively high availability of detritus throughout the year resulted in high reliance by the simulated topeka shiner populations despite its comparatively low energy content with declining reliance on detritus of topeka shiners in the hybrid model reductions in other food groups became more important for the total biomass and persistence of simulated populations in the hybrid model topeka shiners swiftly disappeared when no food was available while the biomass compartment representing topeka shiners in casmts gradually diminished in both models the topeka shiner population could maintain about 75 of its initial biomass without food reduction in the scenario where only detritus was available for consumption however when detritus was removed only the hybrid model resulted in a reduction in topeka shiner population biomass detritus has been found in varying volumes in fish guts but its importance as a food source for topeka shiner has not been determined hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 the proportion of detritus consumption that can be attributed to accidental ingestion along with bottom dwelling prey is currently unknown hatch and besaw 2001 detritus has been shown to represent an important food source in other cyprinid fish species dependent on time of year or developmental stage herwig and zimmer 2007 reckendorfer et al 2001 nunn et al 2012 the hybrid modeling approach provided an opportunity to test different assumptions about the reliance of the topeka shiner on detritus and other food sources ultimately this model can be used to assess population level impacts of stressors under a range of scenarios that address the uncertainty about the biology of the species in addition to the uncertainty about detritus consumption by topeka shiners food composition observed in gut content studies varies between sampled fish sampling sites and sampling dates dahle 2001 hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 variability in gut content could be caused by the composition of the aquatic food web at the sampling site and date or individual or population feeding preferences the available data are not sufficient to inform assumptions regarding temporally explicit food web and habitat specific or individual or population specific feeding preferences however scenarios addressing a range of assumptions about diet preferences beyond detritus can be tested predation by piscivorous fish is a known stressor directly impacting topeka shiner population persistence u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 species of recreational interest such as largemouth bass were introduced into waterbodies with no prior historical presence and have had detrimental impacts on the persistence of local topeka shiner populations knight and gido 2005 campbell et al 2016 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 to assess the impacts of predation with the hybrid model we applied hypothetical levels of largemouth bass predation on topeka shiner the model results suggest that even low predator densities may cause population extirpation in a waterbody interestingly this was to a small extent buffered by the high reliance on detritus with the hybrid model for the topeka shiner population biomass and abundance as well as the structure of the population can be projected over extended time periods in addition to the mechanistic representation of the population the response of the population can be evaluated by systematically applying hypothetical and controlled changes to the food web hybrid modeling approaches specifically linking ibms to food web or ecosystem models were identified as a frontier of research in the context of riverine fish modeling jager and deangelis 2018 due to their ability to represent detailed dynamics of focal species in a more relevant ecosystem context for instance in a similar hybrid model approach a population model of daphnia spp was combined with a lake ecosystem model strauss et al 2017 in this study the temporal dynamics of the aquatic food web were important for the population level outcomes of daphnid populations when compared to simplified assumptions about food availability linking the two models resulted in more realistic dynamics of daphnid populations than when daphnids were simulated as a part of the ecosystem model the authors concluded that the hybrid model approaches increase ecological realism and decrease model uncertainty and identified them as useful tools for risk assessment nevertheless hybrid model approaches linking species specific models to ecosystem models remain rare in the literature we identified only one additional example where a hybrid model was applied to assess the potential impacts of a dominant fish species kinneret bream acanthobrama terraesanctae steinitz 1952 on a lake s food web makler pick et al 2011 we compared two versions of model linking within our study a version where food guild biomasses were transferred from the casmts to the ts ibm as a yearly input file and a version linked by feedback between the casmts and ts ibm on a daily basis potential impacts on the food web from consumption by topeka shiners was only represented in the version with daily feedbacks comparison of the two hybrid model versions suggests that the consumption by topeka shiners implemented in the ts ibm did not have an impact on the food web dynamics of populations included in the food web simulated in the casmts this was likely the consequence of topeka shiner abundances in simulated habitats population sizes were calibrated using reports of topeka shiner abundances e g bakevich et al 2013 kerns and bonneau 2002 such small population sizes did not lead topeka shiners having a substantial impact on food web biomass or composition also suggesting that topeka shiner populations were not limited by intraspecific competition for food accordingly linking the individual based population model to the aquatic food web model via yearly input files is sufficient to represent the interaction between the small populations and the food web if populations would be assumed to occur in higher abundances their impact on the food web would be expected to become more important correspondingly the reciprocal linking of models in the hybrid approach would more accurately reflect the increasing impact of the populations on the food web in that case as commonly encountered in the assessment of endangered species evaluation of model performance was constrained by available data the paucity of topeka shiner population data and corresponding food web or ecosystem data precluded setting aside available data for independent model testing augusiak et al 2014 therefore the ts ibm and the casmts should be understood as quantitative hypotheses concerning the ecology and production dynamics of topeka shiner in midwestern headwater pools the available data permitted calibration of the models to realistic magnitudes and seasonal patterns observed in topeka shiner on the individual and population level as well as biomasses in compartments included in the casmts food web the pattern of seasonal changes in fish biomass was observed in waterbodies across the us midwest region evans white et al 2003 orth and maughan 1984 schlosser 1982 small 1975 the studies assessed biomass of fish by species or as biomass of all fish in a sampled stream or riffle fish biomass peaked between late summer and late fall august november across studies accordingly the seasonal pattern of population level biomass in the simulated topeka shiner population is comparable to fish biomasses in other species and waterbodies in similar regions however the realism of the timing and magnitude of seasonal pattern cannot be verified due to lack of species specific data rather than providing quantitative predictions of topeka shiner population dynamics the model can provide a tool to explore scenarios regarding changes in habitat conditions and their potential impacts on the focal population in comparison to casmts stand alone the hybrid model approach presented here proved to be more sensitive to changes in the topeka shiner food web the sensitivity of topeka shiner populations to alterations in the food web remain unknown however a lack of sensitivity to changes in food availability as observed when simulating the populations within casmts stand alone cannot be assumed in contrast the hybrid approach represents potential impacts of changes in food web composition to a focal population making it a tool for testing food web mediated stressors to the topeka shiner populations for this purpose the hybrid model can be applied using a range of assumption about the diet preference and availability uncertainty about the species feeding ecology across habitats and seasons can be further addressed and included in estimates of potential population level risks due direct and indirect stressors mechanistic modeling approaches have been used to quantify impacts of various stressors and their combinations to population and community persistence in many contexts forbes et al 2016 forbes and galic 2016 jager and deangelis 2018 for instance aquatic food web models like the casm can be used to capture changes in food web properties due to changes in physical and chemical conditions of water bodies bartell et al 2013 however species specific life history and biological characteristics are typically not represented in detail in population models species life history characteristics and other details of a species ecology are represented in detail but changes in the biotic environment that influence individual growth and survival are often not represented explicitly multiple species specific models of fish including elaborate individual based models with complex representations of fish behavior goto et al 2014 railsback and harvey 2011 deslauriers et al 2018 typically do not have detailed representations of their food base such simplifications can limit the use of these models especially given the influence of size structure changes on long term population dynamics jager and deangelis 2018 in the hybrid model presented here both the aquatic food web and the species specific representation of topeka shiner population are combined for a more realistic representation of population dynamics in the context of the food web temporal patterns of food availability and species specific patterns of reproduction and growth are represented in the individual based population model resulting in within year population dynamics that are different from those resulting from the representation of the population as a homogeneous biomass compartment in the casmts stochastic processes were included in the individual based model which can be especially important in small populations often characteristic of endangered species lande et al 2003 for the analysis of specific impacts of stressors in a given habitat uncertainties within the ts ibm and casmts and their underlying assumptions should be considered more explicitly at the same time the hybrid model can be used to evaluate specific assumptions about the species ecology including its diet the sensitivity to changes in food availability can be explored systematically providing insight into the most relevant metrics of water body condition and food web composition in particular omnivorous fish like the topeka shiner may respond to complex shifts in food web composition because they rely on multiple trophic levels for their diet the hybrid model presented in the current paper provides a quantitative mechanistic approach to evaluate hypotheses concerning the potential impacts of direct and indirect stressors on topeka shiner populations and could be further used to inform endangered species risk assessments and recovery plans 5 software availability the executable of casmts the netlogo

25037,the topeka shiner a small cyprinid fish is a seminal example of an endangered aquatic species in the midwestern usa populations and their associated critical habitats may experience potential direct and or indirect effects from anthropogenic activity however potential impacts on fish populations from alterations in the food web are difficult to predict because they are based on complex dynamics of food web interactions in order to simulate topeka shiner population dynamics under different food web scenarios a hybrid modeling approach was developed by linking an aquatic food web model comprehensive aquatic systems model casmts with a species specific individual based population model ts ibm the casmts was parameterized and calibrated to represent the waterbody conditions and aquatic species community in a small headwater pool in iowa representative of key habitat for the topeka shiner within its geographical range in the ts ibm life history growth and diet are represented and based on data available from the literature for the topeka shiner and or surrogate species the two models are linked by the transfer of daily biomasses of topeka shiner diet items we simulated the effects of alterations of the food web on the topeka shiner populations by systematically reducing the available prey base biomass reductions in different food groups had varying impacts on the simulated topeka shiner populations and were dependent on the species preference for detritus consumption simulations also included predation and identified predator densities to which topeka shiner populations were vulnerable the hybrid model provides a platform for the assessment of potential direct and food web mediated indirect effects of stressors for the purposes of risk assessment habitat management and species recovery plans keywords individual based model aquatic systems model topeka shiner endangered species act food web 1 introduction in the past two centuries the landscape of the midwestern usa has changed significantly due to numerous factors including increased demand for agricultural production once dominated by prairie grasslands the landscape today is characterized primarily by row crop agriculture and urbanization consequently many waterbodies have been altered by groundwater withdrawal impoundments and channelization which has had enduring effects on aquatic habitats u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 the topeka shiner notropis topeka is a seminal example of a fish species that has been affected by these changes and as a consequence federal authorities have listed it as endangered under the us endangered species act esa tabor 1998 under the esa populations of threatened and endangered species and their habitats should be protected to ensure long term species survival national research council 2013 macneale et al 2014 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 the topeka shiner belongs to the minnow family cyprinidae and lives in small prairie streams oxbows and off channel pools u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 bakevich et al 2013 its historical range spanned the northwestern portion of the midwestern usa but only remnant populations remain across its former range fig 1 therefore waterbodies where populations are found are crucial to the species viability and these populations and corresponding habitats are potentially vulnerable to disturbance stressors that may affect topeka shiner habitats include sedimentation pesticide and nutrient containing agricultural runoff decreased stream flow homeostatic stress from climate change drought induced habitat fragmentation and introduction of predatory species such as the largemouth bass micropterus salmoides lacépède 1802 schrank et al 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 knight and gido 2005 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 topeka shiner populations are potentially affected by these stressors due to direct impacts on their survival or reproduction or indirectly through impacts to the aquatic food web on which the species depends accordingly it is necessary to consider both direct and indirect effects of human activity on waterbodies where populations of this endangered fish can be found gessner and tlili 2016 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 however potential food web mediated impacts on fish populations are difficult to predict because they are based on complex spatial temporal patterns of food web interactions the food web context can be important in assessing the population viability of endangered species for example the dependence of a species on different food sources can strongly influence whether and what changes in the food web could affect populations over extended time periods topeka shiners feed on a variety of items including zooplankton aquatic insect larvae plant matter and detritus dahle 2001 hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 detritus was found in topeka shiner guts in all studies but whether detritus is consumed by the fish intentionally or ingested along with bottom dwelling prey remains unclear hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 the ability of fish species to subsist on a diet consisting mostly of detritus can impact the population s ability to survive times with low availability of other food herwig and zimmer 2007 a hybrid model that combines a species specific population model of the topeka shiner with a food web ecosystem modeling approach provides one avenue for investigating the relevance of these observations on the projected viability of topeka shiner populations in the current paper we introduce a hybrid modeling approach developed to assess hypothesized direct population level and indirect food web mediated impacts of potential stressors on the population abundance and viability of topeka shiner the hybrid model consists of an individual based model of topeka shiner that is linked to an aquatic food web model the individual based population model ts ibm incorporates characteristics of the life history diet and growth of the topeka shiners reported in the literature temporal patterns in individual ontogeny result in varying population structure and feeding requirements across a simulated year stressors or disturbances may differentially affect the life stages or life stage specific diet potentially leading to different long term outcomes on the population level de lange et al 2010 gergs et al 2013 the aquatic food web providing the diet for the simulated topeka shiner populations in the hybrid model is represented by casmts an adaptation of the comprehensive aquatic systems model casm bartell et al 2013 2018 nair et al 2015 the casmts was adapted to allow the linkage to the newly developed ts ibm and calibrated to represent the species groups present in the food web of a representative head water pool in the geographical range of the topeka shiner abiotic conditions including temperature pool size water depths and water flow as well as carbon phosphorus and nitrate inputs to the system were developed from previous applications of the casm bartell et al 2013 and data relevant to midwestern headwater pools our hybrid modeling approach links the casmts to the ts ibm via transfers of daily biomasses of the topeka shiner diet groups food availability determined by casmts impacts the bioenergetics and consequently the growth of individual topeka shiners in the individual based model in the current paper we describe the hybrid model approach which was implemented using two versions of model linkage 1 daily biomass values produced by casmts as yearly input to the ts ibm and 2 daily exchange of biomass values in a feedback loop between the two models we compare the topeka shiner population dynamics simulated with the hybrid model versions to the dynamics simulated as biomass compartment in casmts stand alone the purpose of the model comparison is to demonstrate suitability of the hybrid model to represent detailed population dynamics of the focal species and ultimately to serve as a tool for species specific risk assessments that can address direct and indirect effects on endangered species populations to gain better understanding of the sensitivities of the hybrid model to potential food web mediated effects on topeka shiner populations we then assess the impacts of hypothetical food reductions and the interaction with assumptions about topeka shiner food preferences finally we investigate the impacts of predation by largemouth bass on the long term viability of topeka shiner populations using the hybrid modeling approach 2 material and methods 2 1 topeka shiner the topeka shiner notropis topeka cyprinidae is a small minnow listed as endangered under the us endangered species act since 1998 tabor 1998 fish spawn in the summer and reach maturity either at one or two years old adult fish can reach up to 70 mm standard length and life spans up to 3 years dahle 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 stark et al 2002 its diet is omnivorous including aquatic invertebrates plant matter and detritus the topeka shiner is a facultative brood parasite of sunfish lepomis spp rafinesque 1819 kerns and bonneau 2002 its current range includes parts of kansas missouri nebraska iowa minnesota and south dakota fig 1 its habitat includes pools in headwaters upper and lower midreach of stream systems off channel habitats including oxbows and temporary and permanent ponds topeka shiner habitats are characterized by no or slow water flow kerns and bonneau 2002 several factors were reported to contribute to the species decline including changes in hydrology due to intensive agriculture livestock grazing road construction urbanization and development of the waterbodies u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 the associated changes in hydrology lead to increased sedimentation and nutrient loading decreased stream flow and increased water temperature in addition diseases predation by introduced piscivorous fish interspecific competition droughts and climate change are also reported as potentially contributing to the species decline u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 2 2 casmts general description the casmts is a version of the comprehensive aquatic system model casm developed to assess the direct and indirect effects of pesticides on modeled population dynamics of the topeka shiner within a food web ecosystem context the casmts generates daily outputs of the biomass of adult topeka shiners and the biomass of populations of associated fish aquatic plants and invertebrates e g bartell et al 2018 2013 nair et al 2015 the model provides an operational framework to examine the potential direct and indirect i e food web ecological effects of environmental stressors a detailed description of the casmts is provided as material appendix a to this more general overview appendix a for the casmts is organized according to trace schmolke et al 2010 grimm et al 2014 and odd protocols grimm et al 2006 2010 2 2 1 model physical site description casmts was adapted and calibrated to represent a hypothetical headwater stream pool characteristic of central iowa a demonstrated area of topeka shiner habitat bakevich et al 2013 headwater habitats in iowa have not been well described therefore the physical dimensions of the modeled headwater pool were derived in part from the characterization of lower order iowa streams for example fischer et al 2010 described the habitat attributes of 247 macrohabitats within 41 stream reaches in central iowa across stream fish assemblages not including topeka shiner mean reach widths were 6 m with an average depth of 0 5 m the study of 84 wadable 3rd order streams in central iowa found an average width of 10 8 m and depth of 0 38 m sindt et al 2012 heitke et al 2006 measured 37 iowa streams ranging from 2nd to 6th order and found an average reach width of 17 3 m with a corresponding average depth of 0 49 m sixty seven in stream habitats of known topeka shiner distributions in iowa had a mean width of 6 37 m and corresponding mean depth of 0 42 m bakevich et al 2013 the iowa habitat descriptions compare with in stream habitat metrics reported for 34 in stream topeka shiner habitats located in kansas e g gerken and paukert 2013 mean pool length was 70 5 m with corresponding mean width of 12 9 m and mean depth of 1 5 m similarly schrank et al 2001 reported mean pool length of 80 9 m mean width of 14 2 m and mean depth of 0 5 m for 26 locations in kansas inhabited by topeka shiner based on the general and topeka shiner habitat descriptions provided for iowa and further informed by the kansas studies the physical dimensions of the topeka shiner model defined a headwater pool with a length of 75 m width of 15 m and average depth of approximately 1 5 m 2 2 2 environmental input data the casmts simulates the daily growth dynamics of the modeled state variables in relation to a dynamic physical chemical environment the modeled environmental inputs include surface irradiance water temperature water depth current velocity and wind velocity modeled water quality factors include dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip dissolved silica dissolved and particulate organic carbon doc poc and suspended inorganic solids a generalized iowa headwater stream habitat was derived for the casmts by defining daily values of these environmental attributes table 1 2 2 3 aquatic plants the casmts includes multiple populations of phytoplankton periphyton attached algae and submerged aquatic vascular plants representative of an iowa headwater pool biomass production for primary producer populations is governed by a bioenergetics based equation that describes changes in plant biomass carbon as a function of photosynthesis minus losses to catabolic processes e g photorespiration respiration non grazing or natural mortality and grazing in the casmts photosynthesis is a nonlinear function of light temperature and nutrient nitrogen phosphorous silica availability suspended inorganic sediments contribute to light attenuation and influence production of phytoplankton periphyton and macrophytes growth is additionally modified by habitat factors including accumulated degree days water depth and current velocity daily biomass represented in carbon equivalent per pool area g c m2 for each modeled aquatic plant population bi is computed by the casmts the community structure of aquatic plants included in the casmts and their associated parameter values were based on previous model development and application to midwestern lower order streams nair et al 2015 bartell et al 2013 appendix a describes the casmts modeling of aquatic plants in detail 2 2 4 aquatic consumers the community composition of zooplankton benthic invertebrates and fishes included in the casmts was similarly informed by previous midwestern stream modeling nair et al 2015 bartell et al 2013 and descriptions of fish assemblages associated with topeka shiner e g bakevich et al 2013 stark et al 2002 biomass production for consumer populations modeled in the casmts is a function of consumption ingestion and assimilation of food or prey minus losses to respiration excretion natural mortality and predation these processes are nonlinear functions of temperature respiration and food availability consumption predation modeled consumer populations are distinguished by population specific rates of feeding respiration excretion prey preferences prey assimilation and temperatures for maximum feeding and respiration the daily values of biomass g c m2 for each modeled population bi of zooplankton aquatic insects benthic invertebrates and fish are determined by bioenergetics based differential equations bartell et al 2013 2 2 5 parameter estimation the casmts baseline or reference simulation requires initial i e doy 1 january 1 biomass values and parameters that define the overall growth dynamics of each modeled population initial biomass values were developed based on reported biomass e g dodds et al 2000 values and calibration of the model all guilds in casmts except fish are set to the initial biomass values at the beginning of each simulated year for density dependent fish populations all fish guilds in casmts except largemouth bass an equilibrium initial biomass was determined as the biomass reached on the last day of simulation year 5 under baseline conditions bioenergetics parameters were based on previous applications of the model e g bartell et al 2013 further informed by species specific data for taxa included in the casmts food web see appendix a for a detailed description rates of maximum consumption cmax g g d for the fish populations were estimated using the wisconsin fish bioenergetics model hanson et al 1997 according to cmax ca wcb where ca intercept of the allometric mass function cb slope of the allometric mass function w dry mass of individual bioenergetics parameters have not been developed for the topeka shiner the basic bioenergetics values defined for topeka shiner in the casmts and used to estimate population growth were based on fathead minnow pimephales promelas rafinesque 1820 duffy 1998 deslauriers et al 2017 and supported by a documented association of topeka shiners with fathead minnows bakevich et al 2013 density dependent growth rates were incorporated for all the modeled fish populations except largemouth bass in the casmts paukert and willis 2004 post et al 1998 values of an optimal and a maximum population biomass were estimated by trial and error to produce fish population growth dynamics consistent with reported values for midwestern topeka shiner habitats e g bakevich et al 2013 dodds et al 2000 kerns and bonneau 2002 for topeka shiner the density dependent growth specified in the casmts stand alone constrained the population production to a maximum carrying capacity of 0 35 g c m2 for the headwater pool as derived from kerns and bonneau 2002 2 2 6 food web interactions the model describes the grazing and predator prey interactions among the modeled populations by specifying values for prey preference wij assimilation efficiency aij and handling efficiency hij for each defined trophic interaction prey preference represents the feeding habits of each species in the food web the assimilation efficiency is a measure of the energy content of the food that can be metabolized the handling efficiency represents the time or energy expense by the consumer to catch and ingest the prey in casmts the simplifying assumption was applied that handling efficiency does not differ dependent on food item i e hij was set to 1 for all food web interactions parameter values were developed from the literature for the casmts consumer populations the detailed values for all the casmts trophic interactions are provided in appendix a for casmts stand alone simulations including topeka shiner populations as guild in the food web the values for topeka shiner prey preference and assimilation rate were identical to the values used by the ts ibm table 2 2 3 description of ts ibm we provide a detailed description of the individual based population model for the topeka shiner ts ibm in the supplementary material appendix b the documentation follows the transparent and comprehensive ecological model documentation trace schmolke et al 2010 grimm et al 2014 the trace document includes the detailed model description according to the overview design and details protocol odd grimm et al 2006 2010 in the following sections we provide a summary of the model description the ts ibm was implemented in netlogo 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 and the model code and input files are made available on github https github com waterborne env topeka shiner model in the ts ibm topeka shiners are represented individually fish start the life cycle as eggs and transition to larvae neither eggs nor larvae consume food in the ts ibm but larvae were assumed to use energy from their reserves both life stages have a fixed duration 5 days each campbell et al 2016 once fish reach juvenile stage they start consuming food from the food web the biomasses in the food web are provided as input files to ts ibm with daily values for each diet group table 2 the input file corresponds to a yearly output file generated by the casmts the diet composition of the juvenile topeka shiners was assumed to differ from those of subadults and adults the transition from juveniles to subadults and from subadults to adults occurs when a fish reaches a threshold length 15 and 30 mm sl respectively sex ratio was assumed to be 50 50 and sex is assigned upon creation of individual fish in the model adult females spawn once per spawning season and the clutch size is a function of female size fish can die due to background mortality starvation or predation fish reaching an age of 3 years old die after the end of the spawning season the ts ibm includes negative density dependence affecting egg and larval survival by applying a ricker function to egg and larval survival rates dependent on the sum of biomasses of subadult and adult topeka shiners in the population morris and doak 2002 predation on topeka shiners can occur if largemouth bass are present in the food web subadult and adult topeka shiners are removed from the population dependent on the consumption rate of largemouth bass the diet preferences of topeka shiners derive from gut content studies dahle 2001 hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 diet items described in these studies were aligned with guilds simulated in casmts and diet preference values were derived from the reported proportion by volume of these items in topeka shiner gut contents fig 2 shows diet compositions aligned with casmts guilds derived from topeka shiner gut contents further detail on topeka shiner diet representation in the model is provided in appendix b sections 1 4 6 and 2 6 only adult topeka shiners were included in the studies of gut content and these data were used to define the diet of subadult and adult topeka shiners in the ts ibm as well as the casmts when applied stand alone including the simulation of topeka shiner populations many fish species show a shift in their diet during their ontogeny often relying on zooplankton in early life stages and shifting to larger prey as their body size increases werner and gilliam 1984 graeb et al 2006 nunn et al 2007 tabor et al 2007 linzmaier et al 2018 because no data on diet of juvenile topeka shiners were available we assumed that juvenile topeka shiners consume smaller food items than the adult fish included in the gut content studies in the model we applied a hypothetical juvenile diet of zooplankton composed of cladocera copepoda rotifera and microzooplankton and detritus a hypothetical preference value of 0 25 was applied across juvenile diet guilds assimilation rates the proportions of energy in ingested prey that were actually absorbed were derived from literature for fish in general and applied irrespective of life stage preferences and assimilation rates were applied in the functional response to food type in the ts ibm the energy that can be gained from food items by topeka shiners in the bioenergetics model is dependent on the energy density of the food groups the guilds consumed by subadult and adult topeka shiners the preference for each diet guild the assimilation rates and energy densities are listed in table 2 each simulated fish starting with the larval stage grows or loses weight in each time step according to the wisconsin fish bioenergetics model hanson et al 1997 deslauriers et al 2017 in the bioenergetics model consumption and respiration rates depend on water temperature waste losses due to egestion and excretion are modeled as a fraction of the consumption rate food consumption is functionally linked to the food availability in the waterbody applying a functional response assumes that rather than all diet biomass being readily available for consumption by all topeka shiners in the model until it is completely depleted decreasing densities of food items i e biomasses in the water body result in reduced encounter rates with food items and accordingly reduced consumption rates the functional response was implemented as a holling type ii function for each diet guild bartell et al 2013 the food availability biomass available for consumption by topeka shiners was modeled as a function of the size of the fish the smaller a simulated fish the smaller the range of daily foraging or search area the modeled search area scales with the ¾ power of the fish standard length accolla et al 2015 this assumption progressively limits feeding with declining food density because decreasing biomass per volume is available to a fish in the model the hybrid model was achieved by using daily biomasses of all guilds in casmts as an input to the ts ibm transferring daily biomasses from the casmts to the ts ibm as a yearly input file makes it possible to systematically alter biomass values in food guilds generated by casmts to run different systematic scenarios of food reduction see simulations in contrast the linkage of the two models on a daily basis see 2 4 model linking explicitly represents the consumption by topeka shiners in the ts ibm by affecting biomasses of its food guilds in casmts but does not allow for the systematic manipulation of food availabilities the ts ibm was calibrated to match reported topeka shiner sizes at different ages appendix b section 5 1 this was achieved by calibrating the relationship between fish weight and maximum consumption rate in addition the density dependence of egg and larval survival rates were calibrated to achieve approximate population stability over multiple simulated years see appendix b section 5 1 2 we included density dependence in the model to account for potential competition within topeka shiner populations for resources other than food density dependence of the early life stages was chosen because the survival rates of eggs and larvae could not be parameterized from literature data in addition topeka shiners were reported to consume fish eggs potentially including eggs from conspecific clutches 2 4 model linking in fig 3 a conceptual representation depicts the linking between the casmts food web model with the species specific ts ibm to achieve the hybrid model the hybrid model can be applied in two distinct ways via input files or via computational linking first the casmts provides daily topeka shiner diet group biomass values as yearly input for use by the ts ibm a baseline simulation using the casmts without topeka shiner provides the daily time series of food guild biomass values input to the ts ibm the biomass outputs from topeka shiner diet guilds in the food web produced by the casmts are used as input to ts ibm where the topeka shiner population dynamics are simulated based on the food availability using casmts biomass outputs from simulations without topeka shiners assumes that the impact of the consumption rates of the simulated topeka shiners in the ts ibm do not have a significant impact on the food web in addition this version of the hybrid model allows for the manipulation of the casmts input to the ts ibm and for simulations over multiple years by repeating yearly casmts outputs as inputs to ts ibm second the ts ibm and casmts were computationally linked on a daily basis in this version of the hybrid model biomass values were exchanged in a feedback loop between the two models accordingly potential impacts of topeka shiner on the food web were represented rather than assumed to be absent as in the hybrid model with yearly inputs in the hybrid model with daily linkage the ts ibm was conducted for a single daily time step including consumption by topeka shiners the topeka shiner biomass and the biomass values of the diet guilds after consumption by topeka shiners were transferred to casmts the biomass values transferred from the ts ibm were used as initial biomass values of the daily time step in casmts in turn all the casmts equations were integrated over the same model day and the effects of topeka shiner on food web dynamics were directly computed however topeka shiner biomasses were not altered in casmts in the hybrid model linked on daily basis but only determined the biomass available for simulating food web dynamics the resulting changes in topeka shiner diet guilds simulated by the casmts were then returned to the ts ibm for the next time step computations biomass values of diet guilds and the biomass of topeka shiner eaten by largemouth bass if included in the simulations were transferred back to the ts ibm this reciprocal transfer of biomass values was repeated for the duration of the simulation 365 days 2 5 simulations 2 5 1 model comparison baseline we compared the outputs of the casmts stand alone with those of the two versions of the hybrid model with this comparison we assessed the difference between representing a topeka shiner population as an aggregated biomass unit as in casmts to an individual based representation as in ts ibm in casmts stand alone simulations the topeka shiner population was represented as a unit of adult biomass in the modeled aquatic food web the biomass of the fish population changed according to bioenergetics equations that are influenced by water temperature and food availability in casmts stand alone density dependence limits the overall consumption by the whole population of topeka shiner more detailed dynamics occurring on the individual level are not represented in casmts in the ts ibm individual fish are simulated to grow and transition through life stages based on their size accordingly not all life stages are present at all times of the year food limitation affects fish individually and may lead to reduced reproductive output or death of fish rather than reducing a unit of overall biomass all individuals are affected dependent on their life stage and biomass which may result in different population level outcomes between the casmts stand alone model and the hybrid model for simulations with casmts and the hybrid model we used the same starting conditions the casmts stand alone version without topeka shiner was run for 5 years to reach equilibrium biomasses in density dependent fish populations the biomass values of all guilds in casmts other than fish were reset to the initial biomass on the first day of every simulated year the biomass output from the last day of year 5 was used as starting condition of fish biomass values for all simulations with the hybrid model and casmts stand alone simulations referred to as year 1 simulations were conducted assuming no predation on topeka shiners no largemouth bass present in the food web for simulations with the hybrid model 20 repetitions were conducted to characterize the effects of stochastic processes defined in the ts ibm on modeled results 2 5 2 model comparison food availability we assessed the sensitivity of the topeka shiner population in the hybrid model to hypothetical removals of food groups from the food web diet items were grouped according to table 3 food groups were removed by setting the biomass of the included guilds to zero in the casmts generated biomass input file across the simulated year these manipulated input files were used with the hybrid model yearly inputs from casmts to ts ibm for comparison the effects of food availability on the simulated biomass of topeka shiner were similarly examined using the stand alone version of the casmts in these simulations topeka shiner food biomass values were simulated as part of the internal food web dynamics it is not possible to simply adjust guild biomass values in the casmts as done in the hybrid model by manipulating the biomasses in the casmts generated input file to the ts ibm to examine the sensitivity of modeled topeka shiner populations in casmts stand alone to food availability diet preference values to food groups listed in table 3 were set to zero switching topeka shiner consumption of specified food guilds off in casmts stand alone is analogous to 0 of the food guilds available for consumption by topeka shiner the initial biomass of topeka shiner 0 282 g c m2 used in the casmts stand alone simulations was identical to that used in the hybrid model approach 2 5 3 interactions of food availability and detritus preference to evaluate effects of hypothetical food reductions over time and to identify the importance of different diet groups for topeka shiner populations casmts biomass values used in the ts ibm were systematically altered these simulations were conducted with the hybrid model approach using yearly casmts biomass outputs as inputs to the ts ibm no reciprocal transfer of biomass values between the models biomass outputs from casmts year 1 were used as control settings the hypothetical changes in the food web were applied for 15 years in the ts ibm simulations i e the same yearly casmts biomass input file was repeated 15 times the importance of food groups results from the interaction between food availability and diet preferences of simulated fish different food groups were reduced to 50 25 12 5 6 25 and 0 from the baseline biomass values generated by casmts across the whole year table 3 for all scenarios 20 repetitions were conducted with the ts ibm no predation on topeka shiner was simulated in these scenarios to further assess the interaction between food availability and diet preferences we additionally altered the preference for detritus consumption by topeka shiners the baseline preference for detritus 0 17 was derived from gut content studies fig 2 however it is uncertain whether detritus is ingested intentionally by the topeka shiners or consumed accidentally along with benthic organisms hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 through applying different preferences for detritus 0 0 05 0 1 0 17 we assessed the importance of other diet groups for topeka shiner under different detritus consumption rates for the simulations with altered detritus preferences in the ts ibm the parameters α c m a x and β c m a x were recalibrated to achieve fish sizes at given ages as reported in the literature dahle 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 calibrating cmax rather than the preference values for other food groups allowed the direct comparison between model versions and reduced the calibration effort to two parameters rather than nine 2 5 4 predation piscivorous fish predominantly largemouth bass introduced in topeka shiner habitats are discussed as potentially threatening the population viability of this listed species kerns and bonneau 2002 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 with the casmts we simulated the aquatic food web dynamics with and without the presence of largemouth bass in these simulations topeka shiner populations were included as guilds in the food web as well the biomass removed from the topeka shiner guild by largemouth bass was calculated in each daily time step and included in the yearly biomass input to the ts ibm i e simulations were conducted using the hybrid model version with yearly casmts biomass outputs as inputs to the ts ibm no reciprocal transfer of biomass values between the models in the ts ibm it was assumed that only subadult or adult topeka shiners are subject to predation by largemouth bass the biomass removed from the topeka shiner guild in casmts each day was used as a probability of individual subadult and adult fish to die in the ts ibm see appendix b section 1 4 4 initial biomass of largemouth bass was defined as the approximate equivalent of a single fish 0 171 g c m2 in the headwater pool waterbody simulated by casmts topeka shiner biomass was initialized with 0 282 g c m2 the topeka shiner biomass consumed by largemouth bass in casmts on a daily basis corresponded to less than a single subadult or adult topeka shiner accordingly individual topeka shiner fish were not removed from the ts ibm population on a daily basis to test the impacts of a different level of predation on topeka shiners in the hybrid model we increased the biomass removed by largemouth bass by factor of 2 across the simulated year simulations without largemouth bass with default predation and increased predation intensity were conducted for 15 modeled years with 20 repetitions each these simulations were also conducted under different detritus preferences of topeka shiner 2 6 sensitivity analysis the impacts of changes in select parameter values on ts ibm population level topeka shiner biomass values g c m2 were assessed for a set of model parameters see appendix b section 6 1 perturbations in key parameters of several submodels were conducted mortality and density dependence survival rates in egg and larval stages diet detritus assimilation rate functional response search area scaling factor bioenergetics factor α c m a x in the calculation of cmax and fish condition kmin parameter values were perturbed by 20 relative to their default value exceptions were the survival rates of eggs and larvae where a range of 20 was applied around the survival rates across the 10 days the simulated fish spend in egg and larval stage combined rather than the daily survival rate in addition tested assimilation rates for detritus were derived from ranges reported in the literature for fish in general the sensitivity of the casmts stand alone to uncertain parameter values was not included in this modeling study however the sensitivity of bioenergetics based population and food web models has been well described in previous analyses e g bartell et al 1986 1988 3 results 3 1 model comparison baseline seasonal pattern and magnitude of adult topeka shiner biomass produced by the stand alone casmts was compared with the two versions of the hybrid model approach the ts ibm with yearly casmts generated biomass inputs and the models reciprocally linked on a daily basis fig 4 all simulations exhibited declining topeka shiner biomass from january through april owing in large part to low water temperatures low feeding rates by topeka shiner and correspondingly seasonal low food availability an increase in topeka shiner biomass from may through november was associated with higher topeka shiner consumption rates and increased food availability the casmts stand alone showed lower ranges of seasonal biomass fluctuations and peak biomass of topeka shiner populations compared to the simulations with the hybrid model fig 4 simulation results from the two versions of the hybrid model were similar across the simulated year in the hybrid model the numbers of individuals total or per stage or age class could also be observed topeka shiner numbers peaked earlier in the year than biomass fig 5 total individual numbers peaked during the reproductive period june july maximum adult numbers were observed in september 3 2 model comparison food availability we compared the hybrid with the casmts stand alone approach using a range of food availability scenarios in the hybrid model without daily reciprocal linkage biomasses in the yearly casmts generated input file were set to zero by food group see table 3 correspondingly the preferences for the consumption of the food groups were set to zero in casmts stand alone simulations including topeka shiner as biomass guild removal of all food led to decline in topeka shiner biomass in both models fig 6 a the shiner biomass disappeared faster in the hybrid model because individuals died of starvation in casmts the biomass compartment was reduced at a slower rate across the summer and early fall months until reaching the imposed minimum guild biomass when all food was removed except detritus sediment poc populations were still present at the end of the simulated year but at reduced biomass fig 6b removal of only detritus did not impact topeka shiner biomass in casmts but resulted in biomass reduction of the population in the hybrid model fig 6c reductions in periphyton or zooplankton availabilities did not clearly impact topeka shiner populations in either model fig 6d e but topeka shiner populations were sensitive to the removal of macroinvertebrate diet guilds fig 6f 3 3 interactions of food availability and detritus preference with the hybrid model we tested the sensitivity of topeka shiner populations to different levels of food reduction over 15 years when all diet items were reduced simultaneously the biomass of simulated topeka shiner populations was reduced dramatically in comparison to controls fig 7 topeka shiner biomass dropped steeply in comparison to the scenario with 100 food availability within the first few simulated years topeka shiner biomasses after 15 years of altered food availabilities were considerably lower than without food reduction fig 7 populations went extinct within the simulated time period when food was below 25 of the controls when only a subset of diet items was reduced in biomass the impact on topeka shiner populations depended strongly on the preference of topeka shiners for detritus consumption fig 8 with the default detritus preference 0 17 reductions in detritus availability resulted in large impacts on simulated populations fig 8c and were comparable to the impacts in reductions of all other diet items combined fig 8b in contrast reductions in periphyton availability did not impact topeka shiner biomasses fig 8d reductions in zooplankton resulted in slight reductions of topeka shiner biomasses fig 8e reduction in macroinvertebrate availability resulted in impacts on topeka shiner populations comparable to those when only detritus was reduced fig 8f in additional simulations we combined food reduction scenarios with altered preferences for detritus by topeka shiners overall when the preference for detritus in topeka shiners was reduced the importance of diet items other than detritus increased fig 8 for instance reductions in periphyton biomass did not affect topeka shiner populations when baseline detritus preference was assumed however if topeka shiners were assumed to have lower or no preference for detritus consumption reductions in periphyton availability resulted in declining topeka shiner biomass fig 8d when detritus preference was 0 and periphyton was removed from the food web simulated topeka shiner populations did not persist for the 15 simulated years fig 8d similarly reductions in zooplankton availability only resulted in impacts on the topeka shiner populations if the preference for detritus consumption was reduced from baseline fig 8f note that juvenile topeka shiners were assumed to eat only zooplankton and detritus in addition to reduction in biomass of topeka shiner populations food limitation also resulted in an altered population structure fig 9 in the baseline scenario without food reduction most individuals reached maturity a year after they hatched a peak in adults 1 year old in june denoted this transition in the baseline scenario fig 9a however when no macroinvertebrates were available in the food web most subadults did not reach maturity within a year of hatching and no peak in adults 1 year old occurred in late spring or early summer fig 9b 3 4 predation simulated predation by largemouth bass with a single predatory fish in the pool led to reduced topeka shiner biomasses after 15 years fig 10 this depended on detritus preferences when detritus preference was reduced from the default value predation resulted in complete removal of the topeka shiner populations with doubled predation levels simulated topeka shiner populations were extinct before the end of the 15 year simulations independent of the detritus preference 3 5 sensitivity analysis the function linking maximum consumption rate to fish weight was identified as highly impactful to topeka shiner population biomass factor α c m a x in the calculation of cmax increasing maximum consumption rate resulted in decreasing population biomass in addition the minimum viable fish condition kmin was identified as highly influential increasing kmin to 0 748 or higher from a default value of 0 68 resulted in decreasing population biomass reduction in kmin had no clear impact on the simulated topeka shiner population small changes in egg and larval survival 20 of survival rate across both life stages did not have a major impact on population biomass nor did changes in the daily search area modeled as a function of fish length detailed results from the sensitivity analysis are described in appendix b section 6 1 4 discussion endangered species assessment requires addressing both direct and indirect effects of potential stressors here we present a hybrid modeling approach to assess indirect impacts on the endangered topeka shiner through reductions in its food base and to assess direct effects through predation this approach leveraged the strengths of an aquatic food web model and a species specific individual based population model of the endangered topeka shiner to achieve the hybrid model the daily biomasses of guilds simulated by casmts were used in ts ibm simulations to represent the topeka shiner prey base the hybrid model was achieved by two versions of linking casmts and ts ibm via input files or via computational linking on a daily basis the aquatic food web model casm represented fish populations including topeka shiner as homogeneous compartments of biomass bartell et al 2013 we compared the outputs related to topeka shiner dynamics from the casmts stand alone version to the outputs from the two versions of the hybrid model biomass dynamics across a simulated year differed in the two models with more pronounced variations of total population biomass across the year in the hybrid model food web composition was generated by casmts in both models any differences in topeka shiner population dynamics were exclusively due to the explicit representation of individual level processes and population structure in the hybrid model biomass dynamics in the two hybrid model versions did not substantially differ further confirming that explicitly representing individual level processes in the individual based approach resulted in observed differences with casmts we assessed potential indirect impacts on the endangered topeka shiner by systematically removing food groups from their diet in both models in the model the relatively high availability of detritus throughout the year resulted in high reliance by the simulated topeka shiner populations despite its comparatively low energy content with declining reliance on detritus of topeka shiners in the hybrid model reductions in other food groups became more important for the total biomass and persistence of simulated populations in the hybrid model topeka shiners swiftly disappeared when no food was available while the biomass compartment representing topeka shiners in casmts gradually diminished in both models the topeka shiner population could maintain about 75 of its initial biomass without food reduction in the scenario where only detritus was available for consumption however when detritus was removed only the hybrid model resulted in a reduction in topeka shiner population biomass detritus has been found in varying volumes in fish guts but its importance as a food source for topeka shiner has not been determined hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 the proportion of detritus consumption that can be attributed to accidental ingestion along with bottom dwelling prey is currently unknown hatch and besaw 2001 detritus has been shown to represent an important food source in other cyprinid fish species dependent on time of year or developmental stage herwig and zimmer 2007 reckendorfer et al 2001 nunn et al 2012 the hybrid modeling approach provided an opportunity to test different assumptions about the reliance of the topeka shiner on detritus and other food sources ultimately this model can be used to assess population level impacts of stressors under a range of scenarios that address the uncertainty about the biology of the species in addition to the uncertainty about detritus consumption by topeka shiners food composition observed in gut content studies varies between sampled fish sampling sites and sampling dates dahle 2001 hatch and besaw 2001 kerns and bonneau 2002 variability in gut content could be caused by the composition of the aquatic food web at the sampling site and date or individual or population feeding preferences the available data are not sufficient to inform assumptions regarding temporally explicit food web and habitat specific or individual or population specific feeding preferences however scenarios addressing a range of assumptions about diet preferences beyond detritus can be tested predation by piscivorous fish is a known stressor directly impacting topeka shiner population persistence u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 species of recreational interest such as largemouth bass were introduced into waterbodies with no prior historical presence and have had detrimental impacts on the persistence of local topeka shiner populations knight and gido 2005 campbell et al 2016 u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2009 2017 to assess the impacts of predation with the hybrid model we applied hypothetical levels of largemouth bass predation on topeka shiner the model results suggest that even low predator densities may cause population extirpation in a waterbody interestingly this was to a small extent buffered by the high reliance on detritus with the hybrid model for the topeka shiner population biomass and abundance as well as the structure of the population can be projected over extended time periods in addition to the mechanistic representation of the population the response of the population can be evaluated by systematically applying hypothetical and controlled changes to the food web hybrid modeling approaches specifically linking ibms to food web or ecosystem models were identified as a frontier of research in the context of riverine fish modeling jager and deangelis 2018 due to their ability to represent detailed dynamics of focal species in a more relevant ecosystem context for instance in a similar hybrid model approach a population model of daphnia spp was combined with a lake ecosystem model strauss et al 2017 in this study the temporal dynamics of the aquatic food web were important for the population level outcomes of daphnid populations when compared to simplified assumptions about food availability linking the two models resulted in more realistic dynamics of daphnid populations than when daphnids were simulated as a part of the ecosystem model the authors concluded that the hybrid model approaches increase ecological realism and decrease model uncertainty and identified them as useful tools for risk assessment nevertheless hybrid model approaches linking species specific models to ecosystem models remain rare in the literature we identified only one additional example where a hybrid model was applied to assess the potential impacts of a dominant fish species kinneret bream acanthobrama terraesanctae steinitz 1952 on a lake s food web makler pick et al 2011 we compared two versions of model linking within our study a version where food guild biomasses were transferred from the casmts to the ts ibm as a yearly input file and a version linked by feedback between the casmts and ts ibm on a daily basis potential impacts on the food web from consumption by topeka shiners was only represented in the version with daily feedbacks comparison of the two hybrid model versions suggests that the consumption by topeka shiners implemented in the ts ibm did not have an impact on the food web dynamics of populations included in the food web simulated in the casmts this was likely the consequence of topeka shiner abundances in simulated habitats population sizes were calibrated using reports of topeka shiner abundances e g bakevich et al 2013 kerns and bonneau 2002 such small population sizes did not lead topeka shiners having a substantial impact on food web biomass or composition also suggesting that topeka shiner populations were not limited by intraspecific competition for food accordingly linking the individual based population model to the aquatic food web model via yearly input files is sufficient to represent the interaction between the small populations and the food web if populations would be assumed to occur in higher abundances their impact on the food web would be expected to become more important correspondingly the reciprocal linking of models in the hybrid approach would more accurately reflect the increasing impact of the populations on the food web in that case as commonly encountered in the assessment of endangered species evaluation of model performance was constrained by available data the paucity of topeka shiner population data and corresponding food web or ecosystem data precluded setting aside available data for independent model testing augusiak et al 2014 therefore the ts ibm and the casmts should be understood as quantitative hypotheses concerning the ecology and production dynamics of topeka shiner in midwestern headwater pools the available data permitted calibration of the models to realistic magnitudes and seasonal patterns observed in topeka shiner on the individual and population level as well as biomasses in compartments included in the casmts food web the pattern of seasonal changes in fish biomass was observed in waterbodies across the us midwest region evans white et al 2003 orth and maughan 1984 schlosser 1982 small 1975 the studies assessed biomass of fish by species or as biomass of all fish in a sampled stream or riffle fish biomass peaked between late summer and late fall august november across studies accordingly the seasonal pattern of population level biomass in the simulated topeka shiner population is comparable to fish biomasses in other species and waterbodies in similar regions however the realism of the timing and magnitude of seasonal pattern cannot be verified due to lack of species specific data rather than providing quantitative predictions of topeka shiner population dynamics the model can provide a tool to explore scenarios regarding changes in habitat conditions and their potential impacts on the focal population in comparison to casmts stand alone the hybrid model approach presented here proved to be more sensitive to changes in the topeka shiner food web the sensitivity of topeka shiner populations to alterations in the food web remain unknown however a lack of sensitivity to changes in food availability as observed when simulating the populations within casmts stand alone cannot be assumed in contrast the hybrid approach represents potential impacts of changes in food web composition to a focal population making it a tool for testing food web mediated stressors to the topeka shiner populations for this purpose the hybrid model can be applied using a range of assumption about the diet preference and availability uncertainty about the species feeding ecology across habitats and seasons can be further addressed and included in estimates of potential population level risks due direct and indirect stressors mechanistic modeling approaches have been used to quantify impacts of various stressors and their combinations to population and community persistence in many contexts forbes et al 2016 forbes and galic 2016 jager and deangelis 2018 for instance aquatic food web models like the casm can be used to capture changes in food web properties due to changes in physical and chemical conditions of water bodies bartell et al 2013 however species specific life history and biological characteristics are typically not represented in detail in population models species life history characteristics and other details of a species ecology are represented in detail but changes in the biotic environment that influence individual growth and survival are often not represented explicitly multiple species specific models of fish including elaborate individual based models with complex representations of fish behavior goto et al 2014 railsback and harvey 2011 deslauriers et al 2018 typically do not have detailed representations of their food base such simplifications can limit the use of these models especially given the influence of size structure changes on long term population dynamics jager and deangelis 2018 in the hybrid model presented here both the aquatic food web and the species specific representation of topeka shiner population are combined for a more realistic representation of population dynamics in the context of the food web temporal patterns of food availability and species specific patterns of reproduction and growth are represented in the individual based population model resulting in within year population dynamics that are different from those resulting from the representation of the population as a homogeneous biomass compartment in the casmts stochastic processes were included in the individual based model which can be especially important in small populations often characteristic of endangered species lande et al 2003 for the analysis of specific impacts of stressors in a given habitat uncertainties within the ts ibm and casmts and their underlying assumptions should be considered more explicitly at the same time the hybrid model can be used to evaluate specific assumptions about the species ecology including its diet the sensitivity to changes in food availability can be explored systematically providing insight into the most relevant metrics of water body condition and food web composition in particular omnivorous fish like the topeka shiner may respond to complex shifts in food web composition because they rely on multiple trophic levels for their diet the hybrid model presented in the current paper provides a quantitative mechanistic approach to evaluate hypotheses concerning the potential impacts of direct and indirect stressors on topeka shiner populations and could be further used to inform endangered species risk assessments and recovery plans 5 software availability the executable of casmts the netlogo

25038,simulation models are often used to identify hydrologic regimes suitable for different riparian or floodplain tree species however most existing models pay little attention to forest successional processes or other disturbances that may interact with the hydrologic regime of river systems to alter forest dynamics in space and time in this study we introduce a flood disturbance module to the landis ii forest succession modelling framework to enable investigations into how inundation interacts with other disturbances and successional processes to alter floodplain forest cover and community dynamics we illustrate the functionality of the model using a case study with multiple scenarios in the upper mississippi river floodplain usa we found that model predictions of total forest cover and the abundance of specific forest community types were generally related to uncertainty in the susceptibility of different species and age classes to inundation by simulation year 100 increases or decreases in total forest cover and forest type distributions were roughly proportional to the initial differences in the susceptibility of species and age classes to inundation the largest decrease in total forest cover was associated with a scenario that included disturbance by the emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis and when using susceptibility parameters corresponding to the weakest flood tolerance in contrast changes in the composition of aboveground biomass were not sensitive to differences in susceptibility and generally showed shifts toward later successional species with higher shade tolerance and longer lifespans for all scenarios our findings suggest that flood inundation interacts with other disturbances e g insect outbreaks and forest successional processes to alter forest abundance distribution and species composition in this system our modelling framework should allow for future studies that examine such interactions in other systems and in the context of alternative hydrologic scenarios and other disturbance regimes keywords eab eastern cottonwood flooding floodplain forest landis ii silver maple simulation model willow 1 introduction patterns of forest succession are difficult to predict in floodplain and other bottomland hardwood systems given the stochastic nature of flooding and its importance in shaping different aspects of plant community dynamics e g germination recruitment competition and survival in river systems most research and modelling efforts have been based on concepts related to environmental flows and the notion that different biological communities have different hydrologic requirements poff and zimmerman 2010 within this framework empirical studies are often used to quantify the direct effect of prolonged inundation on plant survival i e flood tolerance kozlowski 1984 blom and voeseneck 1996 friedman and auble 1999 yin et al 2009 and the results are then used to parameterize simulation models that can be used to investigate the effects of alternative hydrologic regimes on local species occurrences i e habitat suitability see merritt et al 2010 for a thorough review however in floodplain and other bottomland hardwood systems it is often unclear how the direct effects of flooding on plant survival at a local scale influence forest successional dynamics across larger landscapes the variability of flooding regimes and impacts of other disturbances and successional processes add greater uncertainty to long term successional trends the models currently used for environmental flows studies may over simplify the process of forest succession and do not account for other disturbances that may interact with inundation e g windthrow insect outbreaks herbivory and fire on the other hand forest succession models have largely developed independently of ecological flows models and for use in upland environments while forest succession models often do account for complex successional processes and other disturbances see schifley et al 2017 they do not currently incorporate effects of inundation several past efforts have been made to link models that capture temporal and spatial aspects of hydrologic attributes e g depth duration frequency with other models that simulate plant community dynamics in riparian and floodplain settings e g phipps 1979 auble et al 1994 pearlstine et al 1985 yin et al 2009 benjankar et al 2011 2012 egger et al 2012 for example pearlstine et al 1985 developed forflo by linking one of the earliest gap based forest succession models foret shugart and west 1977 with plot level estimates of flood duration and height to simulate the effects of alternative flow regimes on patterns of forest succession forflo represented a major step forward for riparian and floodplain forest modelling because forest successional patterns emerged from mechanistic representations of several plant processes e g seed germination growth competition etc unfortunately the code for forflo is not currently maintained in contrast to this early mechanistic approach to modelling floodplain forest succession several phenomenological models have been developed more recently to identify hydrologic regimes suitable for riparian and floodplain plant communities see merritt et al 2010 phenomenological models focus on the direct relationship between plant performance and hydrologic attributes often represented by a species response curve rains et al 2004 or a series of successional rules benjankar et al 2011 2012 the basic assumption of these models is that different plant species have specific requirements for hydrologic conditions by assuming some degree of stationarity in the relationships between flooding and species distributions and using a time for space substitution predictions about potential alternative future successional patterns can be made see franz and bazzaz 1977 auble et al 1994 further development of this basic approach has focused on different aspects of hydrologic regimes e g timing frequency magnitude duration predictability different levels of biological organization e g individual population community and different plant responses e g growth photosynthesis biomass cover merrit et al 2010 however the basic conceptual framework has remained focused on the phenomenological relationship between inundation and plant survivorship without consideration for other disturbances or the complex and emergent successional patterns that may occur in floodplain settings hence there remains a need for a mechanistic model that links river flows and patterns of inundation with forest successional processes and other disturbances to forecast potential changes in vegetation in floodplain systems the goal of this study was to adapt a widely used forest landscape simulation model landis ii to capture important dynamics in floodplain settings landis ii is a process based spatially explicit model that represents forest generative processes e g dispersal growth and competition as well as forest degenerative processes e g senescence and disturbance related mortality at large spatial scales 1 000 ha and over long temporal scales centuries mladenoff et al 1993 mladenoff and he 1999 landis ii balances the level of detail used to represent different processes through the use of extensions that plug into the core landis ii model scheller et al 2007 the use of multiple extensions enables investigation of questions that relate to the effects of multiple processes and disturbances that may interact to impact forest succession this model architecture also makes it relatively easy to adapt it for use in a wide range of forest systems within the landis ii modelling framework we incorporated a flood disturbance extension that simulates probabilistic species and age specific mortality resulting from annual spatial patterns of surface water inundation and the tolerance of different tree species and age classes to inundation fig 1 the extension relies on output maps from a separate surface water connectivity model that integrates land surface elevation data and water surface elevation data to simulate patterns of flood inundation over a range of spatial and temporal scales see de jager et al 2018 appendix b and van appledorn et al 2019 in review for complete details the extension was integrated with the landis ii biomass succession extension scheller and mladenoff 2004 which represents the processes of establishment growth competition and senescence as they affect and are affected by the biomass of tree species cohorts fig 1 this addition to the landis ii model platform allows for investigation of the effects of alternative hydrologic regimes on forest succession and how flooding interacts with other successional processes and other disturbances in the remainder of this paper we illustrate the functionality of the extension for simulating patterns of forest succession in the upper mississippi river umr floodplain we show how this mechanistic modelling approach can be used to investigate patterns of forest loss emergent successional dynamics how inundation may interact with other disturbances e g effects of the emerald ash borer and the degree to which successional patterns are sensitive to uncertainty in flood tolerance estimation 2 methods 2 1 study area this case study was conducted along the upper mississippi river umr floodplain from hastings mn to cairo illinois a span of approximately 1311 river kilometers fig 2 forestry data were collected within the umr floodplain within three u s army corps of engineers districts st paul in the northern rock island in the central and st louis in the southern portion of the river system these districts differ in terms of climate and hydrogeomorphic conditions as well as the role navigation infrastructure plays in modifying the structure and function of the river system de jager et al 2018 in the st paul and rock island districts a series of low head dams maintain minimum water levels during low water periods typically late summer and winter resulting in permanently higher water levels than found historically however these dams are not used to regulate water levels during high flow conditions and hence the floodplain still experiences inundation where it is not protected by levees the st louis district includes four low head dams in the northern portion of the river reach but the southern portion is undammed from the st paul district in the north to the st louis district in the south there is a general increase in the amount of the floodplain protected by levees and in agricultural production however for this study we only included floodplain areas that were not protected by levees the area often referred to as the floodway we focused our modelling efforts on four forest community types found within each district based on land cover data for the year 2010 dieck et al 2014 floodplain forest lowland forest populus community and salix community the species commonly associated with the floodplain forest type included silver maple acer saccharinum l american elm ulmus americana l green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica marshall river birch betula nigra l boxelder a negundo l american sycamore platanus occidentalis l and swamp white oak quercus bicolor willd the species associated with the lowland forest community type included red oak q rubra l bur oak q macrocarpa michx swamp white oak q bicolor willd pin oak q palustris münchh common hackberry celtis occidentalis l bitternut hickory carya cordiformis wangenh k koch and shellbark hickory c laciniosa michx f g don the populus community is typically dominated by eastern cottonwood p deltoides w bartram ex marshall and the salix community may include sandbar willow s interior rowlee and or black willow s nigra marshall these four forest types within the unleveed portion of the floodplain make up 23 093 ha 32 694 ha and 39 546 ha which is 65 72 and 69 of the natural undeveloped non agricultural areas floodplain land cover found in the st paul rock island and st louis districts respectively the remaining natural floodplain land cover is in herbaceous wet meadow and marsh communities and some shrub scrub and sand mud cover which were not modelled in this study 2 2 flood disturbance to simulate flood related mortality we modified an existing landis ii extension that was designed to simulate land cover change land use plus lu thompson et al 2016 lu uses a temporal sequence of maps that depict land cover such maps are developed outside of landis ii typically using a gis lu then identifies each land cover transition between two time periods for each land cover change class the user supplies a set of rules that define the type of land cover change and how temporally persistent each type of change might be a typical rule might involve harvesting all cohorts in a given change class and preventing the establishment of new cohorts as would happen when a forested area is developed we utilized the functionality of lu that relies on user supplied maps though instead of depicting land cover the maps we used depicted how long the soil surface of the umr floodplain was estimated to be under water during the growing season april 1 september 30 of each simulated year fig 1 the maps were produced using the surface water connectivity model described in de jager et al 2018 appendix b and in van appledorn et al 2019 in review each map consisted of annual inundation classes at 10 day intervals we modified the code of lu so that instead of detecting land cover changes it directly applied a user defined rule to each inundation class at each time step i e it did not search for changes first we further modified the code of lu to implement rules probabilistically rather than deterministically the rules consisted of probabilistic mortality rates assigned to each species age cohort at 10 day inundation duration intervals to develop species age cohort mortality rates associated with each 10 day inundation duration class we used a data set collected on the umr following a large flood in 1993 yin et al 1993 the flood of 1993 offered a unique opportunity to evaluate the flood tolerance of different species because it resulted in a high degree of variability in flooding conditions depending on elevation and location along the river i e a wide inundation gradient this data set has been used previously to develop flood tolerance equations for select species in select areas of the umr yin et al 2009 however we recently used this data set to develop new logistic regression models based on the data for the entire river system see appendix d in de jager et al 2018 for details briefly these new models predict the probability of mortality for three groups of species low moderate and high flood tolerance as a function of how long the soil surface was under water during the 1993 growing season and tree size dbh each model was then rescaled to remove any mortality associated with 0 days of flooding y intercept so that only effects of flooding were being simulated in the model we used dbh age regressions to express each equation as a function of cohort age since landis ii does not track tree diameter see section 2 3 finally we used results for the mean upper and lower 95 confidence intervals of model parameters coefficients representing the effect of inundation on mortality and the effect of age on mortality to examine sensitivity to uncertainty see 2 4 scenarios and data analyses we grouped species into three flood tolerance categories based on similar species level models and or similar documented flood tolerances whitlow and harris 1979 flood tolerance group 1 included the least flood tolerant species q rubra q velutina q macrocarpa c illinoinesis wangenh k koch c cordiformis c laciniosa morus rubra l diospyros virginiana l c occidentalis and p occidentalis this group generally had the highest mortality rates across all age size classes flood durations and confidence intervals fig 3 the cohorts in this group remain vulnerable to flooding for a much longer period of time age than the more flood tolerant species especially when considering the upper 95 confidence interval of model parameters fig 3 a comparison of model parameter estimates showed that the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from the mean by an average 24 while the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from each other by an average of 41 4 flood tolerance group 2 included a saccharinum a negundo b nigra f pennsylvanica f nigra marshall u americana q bicolor q palustris and p deltoides this group had the least uncertainty in model parameters with the mean lower and upper 95 confidence intervals of model parameters similarly resulting in a strong increase in mortality rates for young cohorts as flood duration increased and a rapid decline in mortality rates at long flood durations as cohorts age fig 3 in other words species in flood tolerance category 2 can escape effects of flooding as they age much more quickly than those in tolerance category 1 a comparison of model parameter estimates showed that the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from the mean by an average 9 6 while the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from each other by an average of 18 1 for species in group 2 finally flood tolerance group 3 included the most flood tolerant species s interior s nigra forestiera acuminata michx poir and cephalanthus occidentalis l this group generally had the lowest mortality rates for all size classes flood durations and confidence intervals fig 3 however model parameter estimates for this group also had a high degree of uncertainty showing virtually no impact of flooding when using model parameters for the lower 95 confidence interval and much higher mortality rates when using model parameters for the upper 95 confidence interval fig 3 a comparison of model parameter estimates for this group showed that the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from the mean by an average 53 2 while the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from each other by an average of 150 3 2 3 landis ii model parameters and input files in landis ii trees are represented as species age cohorts which requires estimating tree ages and aggregating trees into age specific cohorts we used forest inventory data and methods that have become relatively standard in landis ii modelling to accomplish these tasks as outlined in appendix d of de jager et al 2018 forest inventory data sets were used to quantify the existing species composition and age structure of umr forests tree ages were determined from a subset of inventory plots using an increment borer and empirical relationships were developed and subsequently used to estimate the age of each tree from tree diameter measurements all trees were then grouped into 10 year age cohorts we mapped the initial distribution of each species age cohort by matching each forest inventory plot with a corresponding forest type based on the species composition of each plot then the data from each plot were randomly imputed into the cells i e pixels of the corresponding forest type in the land cover map this process was done independently for each district to ensure that species unique to a district remained within that district we used the biomass succession extension version 3 2 scheller and mladenoff 2004 which simulates the processes of establishment growth competition and senescence based on the life histories of taxa as they influence and are influenced by the biomass of cohorts at a site i e cell or pixel we developed basic life history information for each species using burns and honkala 1990 and the information contained within forest inventory data sets e g longevity shade tolerance table 1 one important modification to the information provided by burns and honkala 1990 consisted of using a maximum longevity for u americana of 80 years given our observations of the effects of dutch elm disease in this system we grouped some species when they shared similar life history characteristics and when the abundance of one or both of the species was low table 1 the biomass succession extension requires a file that specifies spatial variability in potential establishment and growth rates for each species across the landscape applications of landis ii in upland settings typically use climate and soil data to develop an ecoregions map for different soil and climate combinations the ecoregions a separate plant physiological model such as linkages pastor and post 1986 or pnett ii aber and federer 1992 is used to determine maximum potential establishment and growth rates based on a climate envelope approach xu et al 2009 however both linkages and pnett ii were developed for use in upland environments the tolerance of different species to drought is a major factor in each model and neither model accounts for effects of soil waterlogging we therefore used empirical methods to parameterize species specific establishment and growth rates and to link them to spatial variation in the landscape see below and appendix d in de jager et al 2018 for details previous research in the umr floodplain has shown that spatial patterns in tree community composition and soil texture are associated with how long the soil surface is on average under water during the growing season de jager et al 2012 to capture spatial variation in flood duration we used the surface water connectivity model fig 1 to develop maps of the 40 year average growing season inundation duration to estimate spatial variability in potential species establishment rates we intersected the location of forest inventory plots with the maps of the 40 year mean growing season flood duration and related the relative abundance of each species to the estimated 40 year average inundation duration for each forest plot the abundance of each species within 10 day inundation zones relative to their total abundance was then used to estimate potential establishment rates see appendix d in de jager et al 2018 for more details the biomass succession extension relies on four user supplied parameter estimates to simulate growth anppmax and maxbiomass which are the maximum annual net primary productivity and maximum total biomass that a species can biologically attain respectively and growthshape and mortalityshape which define the rate at which a species reaches anppmax as it ages and the rate at which biomass declines as the species approaches longevity senescence we derived maxbiomass and anppmax for each species by estimating the biomass of individual trees within the same forest inventory data set used to define initial species age cohort distributions we used regression equations developed by jenkins et al 2003 relating tree diameter to aboveground biomass we then converted per tree biomass to a unit area by estimating biomass under hypothetically fully stocked conditions using crown area estimates from larsen et al 2010 this resulted in a hypothetical species maximum biomass in g m2 maxbiomass next we estimated anppmax from maxbiomass using regression equations developed by keeling and phillips 2007 to estimate the growthshape and mortalityshape parameters and make slight adjustments to maxbiomass and anppmax we compared the plot level biomass estimates described above with estimates derived from the landis ii site utility l2 site miranda and sturtevant 2016 https sites google com site landismodel projects veg site tool l2 site is a microsoft windows based utility that implements the cohort and biomass growth and senescence equations of the biomass succession extension v3 2 for up to six species on a single site we used the maxbiomass and anppmax estimates described above as starting parameters in the site utility along with arbitrary starting parameters for growthshape and mortalityshape we then iteratively simulated the growth of a single cohort of each species and adjusted each parameter so that time age specific biomass estimates would encompass the upper bound of the empirical age biomass data see figure d6 in appendix d of de jager et al 2018 for two examples table 1 provides the estimates of all four growth parameters for each species modeled there were not sufficient data to develop spatially explicit growth parameters and so the growth parameters in table 1 apply to all ecoregions we further examined relationships between landis ii simulated biomass and empirical estimates of biomass for different tree species and communities as a way to validate model outcomes for the initial conditions see de jager et al 2018 appendix d 2 4 scenarios and data analyses we developed four model scenarios to evaluate the role flood related mortality plays in the umr floodplain in the context of successional processes and to examine the sensitivity of model results to uncertainty in the flood tolerance of species age cohorts these scenarios included a simulation without effects of flooding and simulations using flood tolerance equations corresponding to the lower 95 confidence interval lf the mean mf and the upper 95 confidence interval uf of flood tolerance models fig 3 we developed annual maps of growing season flood duration for a 40 year period 1972 2011 using the methods outlined in appendix d of de jager et al 2018 these maps were used to simulate spatial patterns in flooding for the first 40 years of model simulations then recycled for years 41 80 and the first 20 years were again recycled for years 81 100 to create a single 100 year business as usual flooding scenario this flooding regime was used for all model scenarios that included effects of flooding to isolate effects of uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters each of the above four scenarios also included the effects of the emerald ash borer eab on f pennsylvanica and f nigra however to isolate effects of eab we developed one additional scenario that included the use of mean flood tolerance parameters and no eab we simulated tree mortality due to eab using the base biological disturbance agent bda extension version 3 0 1 sturtevant et al 2004 bda simulates tree mortality following major outbreaks of insects and or disease insect outbreaks are probabilistic at the site cell scale with each site assigned a disturbance probability which is then compared to a uniform random number to determine if the site is disturbed the disturbance probability at a site in turn depends on whether an insect host is present on a site if a site is disturbed species and cohort level mortality occur according to user defined susceptibility parameters we modeled the spread of eab as though it was not dispersal limited following gustafson et al 2017 all age classes were considered as suitable hosts for eab annual susceptibility probabilities were set to 0 55 for age classes greater than 5 years which corresponds to a 7 year cumulative mortality probability 0 99 siegert et al 2014 this worst case scenario resulted in the loss of ash cohorts from the landscape within the first 10 years of model simulations but also allowed for continued establishment of new ash cohorts where there was a seed supply and where light conditions were favorable however over the longer term ash cohorts have a 99 probability of mortality by age 12 within the model virtually eliminating the seed supply for this species these settings reflect our primary objective of better understanding how umr forests may respond to eab outbreaks rather than to understand how eab outbreaks may occur we conducted separate simulations within each district because the number of species and species composition varied among them this study because landis ii is a stochastic model we ran each scenario three times and examined the results for this study we chose to report the results of a single replicate for each scenario after noting very minor differences among replicate simulations we first examined how flooding was distributed across the landscape over time to better understand the potential impacts of flooding across the river system next we examined changes in total forest area and an index of forest fragmentation perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac given concerns about the potential loss of forest cover due to eab and or impacts of flooding guyon et al 2012 then we examined the abundance and distribution of the four forest types described in section 2 1 this was done by summing the total biomass of the indicator species defined for each forest type see section 2 1 within each cell each cell was then assigned the forest type associated with the group of indicator species with the greatest total biomass both forest area fragmentation and forest type calculations were done in arcmap 10 5 finally we examined changes in species composition across space and time using a multivariate analysis non metric multidimensional scaling mds clarke 1993 of the total biomass of each species summed across each district biplots were used to visualize similarities and differences among the three districts time periods and scenarios linear correlation coefficients between the biomass of each species and the different mds axes were used to interpret the axes a cluster analysis was used to determine which districts scenarios and time periods were similar to each other p 0 05 these analyses were conducted in primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 to examine sensitivity of model outcomes to uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters we calculated the percent difference in total forest area and the area in the four forest types for simulation years 0 25 50 75 and 100 among the three scenarios that included effects of eab but which differed in flood tolerance parameters lf eab mf eab and uf eab we also examined sensitivity of the species composition analysis to uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters by extracting the multivariate year specific community dissimilarity among the pairwise comparisons of three scenarios 3 results 3 1 inundation dynamics quantification of the spatial pattern of long term inundation durations based on the flood inundation component of the full model fig 1 showed an upstream downstream transition from more area experiencing long inundation durations in the st paul district 40 days per growing season to more area experiencing intermediate inundation durations in the st louis district 10 30 days per growing season fig 2 fig 2 illustrates some of the patterns in flood inundation that emerged from the model areas with longer inundation durations in the st paul and rock island districts tended to be situated in low lying areas away from the main navigation channel fig 2 suggesting that they may correspond with elevated water levels due to the presence of locks and dams in these reaches although longer durations also occur off the main navigation channel in the st louis district the total area experiencing such durations was less than for the more up river districts the different spatial patterns in long term inundation durations help to understand differences in the temporal dynamics of inundation and associated differences in forest succession among the three districts see below year to year variability in the mean pixel value for inundation duration and the distribution of area experiencing different inundation durations were similar in each district fig 4 indicating that temporal dynamics in flooding across the river system were similarly related to regional hydro climatic conditions among the districts the st paul district had the longest annual average inundation duration on a per pixel basis in 26 out of 40 years while the rock island and st louis districts had the longest durations in only 5 and 9 years out of 40 respectively further the years in which the st louis district had the longest average pixel value were generally years with high flows in all three districts whereas the other two districts generally had the longest average pixel value during years with low to moderate flows these differences likely reflect the management of water levels in the two northern districts and the dependence of water levels in the southern district on water entering the system from the northern districts 3 2 forest area and landscape pattern over the 100 year model simulations estimates of forest loss ranged from 0 of initial forest cover in the scenario that did not include flooding eab to as much as 12 of initial forest cover in the scenarios using flood tolerance equations representing the upper 95 confidence interval weakest flood tolerance uf eab fig 5 in all three districts there was a gradual loss of forest cover in the uf eab scenario over time whereas the scenarios that used flood tolerance equations representing the mean mf and mf eab showed slower rates and smaller amounts of forest loss fig 5 further the scenarios that used flood tolerance equations representing the lower 95 confidence interval strongest flood tolerance either showed minor losses of forest cover late in the simulations st paul district or no loss of forest cover at all rock island and st louis districts these results are also reflected in similar differences among scenarios in temporal trends in forest fragmentation perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac and reveal the effects of different rates of cohort mortality associated with flood inundation for the different scenarios fig 3 eab had small additive effects on forest loss in all three districts as indicated by differences between the mf no eab and mf eab scenarios finally the st paul district tended to show the fastest rates and most overall forest loss as compared to the other two districts in addition forest cover was most fragmented in this district for initial conditions and throughout the duration of model simulations these results likely reflected a greater initial interspersion of forest cover with other land cover and vegetation types in this district as well as a greater amount of area experiencing long inundation durations fig 2 fig 6 illustrates the spatial location of forest loss after 100 years for a portion of the floodplain in the st paul district and for the uf eab worst case scenario forest loss could be observed in areas that were inundated for longer than 30 days per growing season often along backwater margins table 2 provides the proportion of forest in each flood inundation class lost after 50 and 100 years in each district and each flood duration class as much as 45 to 54 of the forest in the 60 1day duration class was lost in the uf eab scenario after 100 years compared with 20 28 of the forest lost in the same class in the mf and mf eab scenarios after 100 years 3 3 forest types initial conditions based on land cover data showed similar distributions of four forest types in the st paul and rock island districts 83 floodplain forest 4 lowland forest 7 populus community and 6 salix community fig 7 the st louis district supported less floodplain forest 70 and more lowland forest 12 and populus community 11 than the other two districts over time all scenarios showed signs of progressive successional development as early successional populus communities consistently declined and longer lived and more shade tolerant species from the lowland community type consistently increased in all districts and in all scenarios see section 2 1 for indicator species however the species in the lowland community were generally less flood tolerant than the species found in the other community types fig 3 as a result the magnitude of the increase in lowland forest cover was generally associated with differences in flood related mortality rates among the different scenarios fig 8 the increase in lowland forest was greatest for the scenarios that did not include effects of flooding eab or for those that simulated weaker impacts of flooding lf eab followed by the scenarios simulating stronger effects of flooding mf eab and uf eab interestingly the weakest increase in lowland forest cover was observed in the simulation that did not include effects of eab mf suggesting that in some areas species from the lowland forest community type may replace ash species as they are lost from the landscape further accelerating the rate of succession in contrast to the consistent declines in early successional populus communities cover by salix communities differed by scenario even showing some signs of retrogressive succession in some scenarios strong declines in salix communities were observed in all three districts for the scenario that did not include effects of inundation eab and for the scenario that simulated strong effects of inundation uf eab fig 7 in the eab scenario the loss of salix was due to transition to other longer lived and more shade tolerant communities lowland or floodplain forest while the loss of salix communities in the uf eab scenarios may have resulted from a combination of forest succession and forest loss there was a relatively high degree of uncertainty in the flood tolerance models for salix species fig 3 salix was much more sensitive to flooding in the uf eab scenarios than in the lf eab or mf and mf eab scenarios fig 7 and 8 as a result the later three scenarios showed a recovery of salix communities after initial declines in all three districts in the st louis district the decline in salix occurred after only 25 years whereas the decline in the other two districts occurred after year 50 these declines were likely the result of a loss of forest cover or transition to other types as the existing salix stands reached their relatively short longevity table 1 however between year 75 and 100 there was a strong recovery by salix in these scenarios and in some cases the increases more than compensated for the earlier declines we suggest that this was driven by the higher flood tolerance of salix in these scenarios allowing it to replace itself or to replace floodplain forest communities as they reached their longevity and were unable to regenerate in flood prone areas see fig 8 finally floodplain forest cover was the dominant forest type throughout all simulated years and in all three districts fig 7 however there were strong differences in the change in floodplain forest cover over time among scenarios and districts in the scenario without the effects of flooding eab floodplain forest cover increased in all three districts with the largest increase occurring in the st louis district where there was a higher abundance of silver maple as young cohorts in the initial forest communities data not shown the general increase in floodplain forest cover was likely the result of transition from early successional populus and salix communities toward longer lived and more shade tolerant species within the floodplain forest community however late in the simulations there was a slight decline in floodplain forest cover in all three districts suggesting late succession toward lowland forests as they increased strongly for this scenario the other scenario that showed either an increase st paul and st louis or the weakest decrease rock island was the scenario that did not include effects of eab mf further indicating that the emerald ash borer may contribute to transitions toward the lowland forest type finally floodplain forest cover either declined st paul and rock island or initially increased before declining st louis in the three scenarios representing uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters the consistency among the three scenarios is likely because there was a relatively high degree of certainty in flood tolerance model parameters for these species and therefore relatively small differences among the flood tolerance parameters in the lf mf and uf scenarios fig 3 the decline in the upper two districts occurred relatively late in the simulations as salix was increasing in the lf eab and mf eab scenarios indicating transition toward salix communities in contrast the decline in the uf eab scenario was probably due to the loss of forest cover in flood prone areas table 2 in the st louis district the increase was likely due to a higher abundance of silver maple in the forest understory during initial conditions with the late decline due to flood impacts or transition to lowland forests or salix communities lf eab 3 4 species composition the composition of aboveground biomass was different in all three districts for all time periods and all scenarios p 0 05 fig 9 these differences were primarily expressed along the vertical axis of fig 9 mds2 an axis that was positively correlated r 0 55 with the abundance of c illinoinensis c cordiformis d virginiana f acuminata q macrocarpa and q palustris all of these species were most abundant in the st louis district and least abundant in the st paul district the vertical axis of fig 9 was negatively associated r 0 51 with b nigra q bicolor and q rubra suggesting that these species were most abundant in the st paul district and least abundant in the st louis district over time the forests in the st louis district moved even higher along mds2 for all scenarios suggesting a further increase in the relative biomass of species that initially differentiated it from the other reaches the forests in the rock island district also increased along mds2 but less than for the st louis district the st paul district moved lower on mds2 for all scenarios suggesting that it also increased in the species that already differentiated it from the other districts these transitions along mds2 were supported by species specific plots in each district appendix a however the largest changes in species composition over time occurred along the horizontal axis of fig 9 mds1 an axis that was positively correlated r 0 56 with a negundo c occidentalis m rubra and u americana and negatively associated r 0 47 with the most abundant species across the umr a saccharinum p deltoides and salix species the forests of each district shifted to the right of fig 9 over time for all scenarios indicating a decline in the biomass of these abundant species within each district and each time period the composition of aboveground biomass did not differ significantly among any of the scenarios that included effects of flooding p 0 05 fig 9 however the scenario that did not include effects of flooding eab was consistently different from the other scenarios within each time period by year 50 in the rock island district by year 75 in the st louis district and by year 100 in the st paul district inspection of species specific plots indicate that the difference between the eab scenario and all others was primarily due to smaller declines in the biomass of a saccharinum in the eab scenario this result can likely be explained by the high initial abundance of this species across the umr and higher rates of a saccharinum mortality associated with the scenarios that included effects of flooding 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity to differences in flood model parameters was examined by comparing the percentage difference in flood tolerance model parameters with the percentage differences in total forest cover cover of the four forest types and community dissimilarity that emerged from the simulation model among flood tolerance scenarios over time differences in model outcomes among the three flooding scenarios generally increased over time in all three districts fig 10 the sensitivity of some forest types was often related to the degree of uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters for example model projections for the abundance of the salix community differed by as much as 61 when comparing outcomes between the lf eab and mf eab scenarios which was similar to the percent difference in flood tolerance model parameters between the same two scenarios 53 when comparing the uf eab to the lf eab scenarios model parameters differed by 150 for salix spp and 100 year abundances of the salix community type differed by as much as 93 a similar proportional effect was noted for the lowland community type however the populus community type appeared to be much more sensitive to model uncertainty than the other community types uncertainty in model parameter estimates for this species was only 9 lf eab or uf eab vs mf eab and 18 lf eab vs uf eab yet populus abundances differed by as much as 30 and 90 for these same comparisons this may suggest complex interactions with other species dependent on uncertainty in model parameters for the other species finally the floodplain forest group was generally insensitive to uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters the abundance of floodplain forest differed by as much as 2 7 lf eab vs mf eab and 3 4 lf eab vs uf eab while model parameter estimates differed by 9 and 18 for these same comparisons finally differences among scenarios in total forest cover and multivariate dissimilarity in species composition after 100 years were generally similar to the amount of uncertainty in the flood tolerance of the most abundant species group 2 4 discussion in this study we introduced a modelling framework that incorporates concepts from ecological flows models used in floodplain and riparian systems namely the impact of inundation on tree species survival and concepts from forest succession and disturbance models used in upland forest systems the integration of these two modelling approaches allows for investigation into how direct effects of inundation on plant survival interact with forest successional processes in addition other interactive effects of a variety of disturbances can be investigated using this modelling framework 4 1 forest succession in floodplains in our simulations all scenarios produced similar trajectories in species composition with some variability in the rate and magnitude of succession among scenarios hence in the modeling framework changes in species composition over time were largely governed by the life history attributes of the taxa inter and intra specific competition as represented by the landis ii biomass succession extension and the initial distribution of species and tree ages across the landscape this is important given that most current ecological flows models ignore most of these forest successional processes and instead only account for the direct response of species or guilds to inundation hodges 1997 described a general pattern of forest succession in the mississippi river atlantic and gulf coastal plains governed by the interplay between autogenic and allogenic processes autogenic processes are related to how different species and communities modify the growing environment for other species e g shading effects and thereby contribute to species replacement over time in the absence of allogenic processes i e disturbances such as flooding sedimentation or wind events autogenic process lead to a general progression from short lived and shade intolerant pioneer communities to those with longer lifespans and greater shade tolerance which is consistent with many of our findings however across topographically diverse floodplain landscapes the importance of allogenic processes flooding in particular can vary from place to place and create complex spatial patterns in successional trajectories in some locations a given community type may persist as a hydric disclimax community hodges 1997 if later successional species cannot tolerate local flooding conditions in contrast the same community may fully transition to a later successional community in a higher elevation area in our study autogenic processes appeared to strongly influence forest successional patterns because the initial distribution of species and age classes across the landscape already reflected past patterns of inundation however allogenic processes remain important as they strongly influence the potential of communities to regenerate in place or colonize new areas therefore a complete understanding of forest succession in floodplains requires examining patterns of species or community replacement within different hydrogeomorphic settings our results point to significant future declines in early successional salix and populus communities as a result of forest succession a large proportion of the populus stands in the lower portions of the umr generated on former agricultural fields following land acquisition in the 1930 s to 1950 s and it is expected that these higher elevation areas will ultimately succeed to other longer lived and more shade tolerant community types as projected by our model other populus stands and most salix stands in the umr are often situated along land water boundaries likely reflecting primary succession following events that create high light environments e g creation of cut banks or which result in the development of new land forms with fresh sediments e g point bars and islands such processes are generally considered as necessary to regenerate these communities in riparian and floodplain settings hosner and minckler 1963 kupfer and malanson 1993 johnson et al 2013a because these geomorphic processes were not simulated in our study it is possible that we over estimated the decline in these early successional communities however it is unclear how prevalent such processes are in today s regulated rivers finally in simulations where the tolerance of salix species to inundation was much greater than all other species we noted some stand replacement in low lying areas simply because such sites flooded too frequently to support any other species while salix communities dominated by s interior may perpetuate themselves for long periods of time due to vegetative reproduction there is little empirical support for self replacement of salix communities hodges 1997 suggested that low lying salix communities particularly those dominated by s nigra are likely to transition to either floodplain forests maple ash elm complex if site elevation increases over time due to sediment deposition or such communities may also transition to even more flood tolerant wet shrub communities with buttonbush and swamp privet it is possible that had we been better able to model the initial distribution and flood tolerance of buttonbush and swamp privet that such transitions would have occurred in our model instead such sites tended to regenerate to salix communities or loose forest cover altogether at the other end of the successional sequence are longer lived and more shade tolerant species in our study we observed modest increases in the proportion of the landscape occupied by lowland forests 0 05 to 0 10 or 0 10 to 0 20 depending on district while this community type included a wide range of species such increases were primarily attributable to increases in the biomass of c illinoinensis and c cordiformis species grouped c occidentalis and q bicolor depending on district the currently low abundance of these species in the umrs may reflect a variety of factors related to past land use and navigation practices including conversion of high elevation forests to agricultural areas succession to floodplain forests due to altered hydrology and a lack of fire disturbance or even forest loss due to large flood events yin et al 1993 nelson et al 1998b yin 1999 given the comparatively weaker flood tolerance of this species group modeled increases in lowland forest coverage were generally restricted to areas with shorter flood durations and with the magnitude of the increase being directly proportional to the differences in flood tolerance model parameters among scenarios the only exception to this was q bicolor which had a flood tolerance equal to that of other floodplain forest species but which had a much longer lifespan these characteristics along with a more widespread initial distribution in the st paul district underpinned the relatively strong increase in this particular species the life history characteristics of these species e g relatively greater shade tolerance and longer life span suggest future increases based on autogenic processes but whether and where they increase likely depends on future patterns of inundation and the flood tolerance of these species which both have a relatively high degree of uncertainty finally our results suggest that floodplain forest communities are likely to continue to dominate the umr landscape over the next 100 years but the species composition of those communities could change substantially the generally high flood tolerance and wide range of life history characteristics of the species included in the floodplain forest community allow it to occupy a variety of site conditions and successional states making it the most abundant community type within this system however over time the species that dominate the floodplain forest community has been shown to vary in the umrs knutsen and klaas 1998 found a doubling in the importance of a saccharinum since pre settlement conditions and a reduction in u americana probably due to dutch elm disease yet the maple ash elm complex within the umrs has persisted in the landscape we found immediate declines in f pennsylvanica resulting from the emerald ash borer and later declines in a saccharinum while other floodplain forest species e g q bicolor u americana and a negundo were increasing nevertheless the floodplain forest community remained the dominant forest type over the entire 100 year period and either maintained or increased its current abundance for at least 75 years depending on the umr forestry district 4 2 effects of flooding the addition of flood related mortality to the landis ii platform makes it possible to forecast the loss of forest cover resulting from changes in hydrologic regimes and or due to interactions with other disturbances and management actions e g insect outbreaks wind harvest forest loss began occurring after the first 50 years of relatively stable conditions and in low lying areas in most of our simulations this implies that younger cohorts that were more vulnerable to flood related mortality were not able to survive in some areas of the landscape as older cohorts reached their longevity or died due to wind events or emerald ash borer outbreaks younger cohorts were not able to recolonize and survive in those same sites this suggests that changes in the hydrologic regime of this particular river system since the establishment of the existing forests may limit forest regeneration in some places previous studies have suggested that the construction of the lock and dam system may influence forest regeneration on the umrs yin et al 2009 theiling and burant 2012 guyon and battaglia 2018 however it is also possible that increased discharge in the umr basin resulting from land use practices in the larger watershed e g tile drainage changes in the amount of precipitation and or further modification of river flows for navigation have all lead to increased water levels and more frequent flooding over the past 30 40 years we did observe some degree of variability in forest loss estimates among scenarios that were dependent on species and age specific tolerance to inundation which requires further investigation for example future efforts should seek to reduce uncertainty of the flood tolerance of common floodplain species and translate this understanding into quantitative relationships that can be mapped and modeled nevertheless quantifying the timing and location of forest loss in floodplain ecosystems is a major step forward given that these systems can be subject to large changes in hydrologic regimes and because the loss of forest cover is likely to have much stronger impacts on ecosystem structure and function than forest compositional changes swanson et al 2017 future studies that examine forest loss in response to changes in hydrologic regimes resulting from changes in land use precipitation patterns or river infrastructure should benefit from this modelling framework results of our sensitivity analysis suggest that for most species or species groups a given change in tolerance to inundation should result in a similar long term proportional change in the abundance of that group of species this finding is especially important for species that may have a high degree of uncertainty in their tolerance to inundation however we also found instances where a relatively small degree of uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters corresponded with a very large difference in model outcomes for example the range of outcomes for the abundance of the populus community did not appear to be related to the small degree of uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters for p deltoides this suggests that in some instances simulated forest successional processes may interact with uncertainty in the flood tolerance of some species and stochastic flooding events i e mortality to create complex forest dynamics as we pointed out above more quantitative research aimed at reducing uncertainty of flood tolerance models could help to also clarify how inundation interacts with forest successional processes in these systems lastly our model focuses on the role year to year variability in the total number of inundation days plays in plant survival given that previous studies in this system have shown strong relationships between inundation duration and forest species composition de jager et al 2012 2016 however there are a number of other ways in which hydrology can shape plant communities see glenz et al 2006 for a thorough review briefly trees may suffer physical damage like abrasion or become uprooted during energetically intense flows sigafoos 1964 karrenberg et al 2003 physiological stress can arise due to root zone saturation hook 1984 hook and brown 1973 blom voesenek 1996 kozlowski 1984 or overtopping of end shoots stanturf and gardiner 2000 and can interfere with growth and regenerative processes often in complex ways gee et al 2014 battaglia et al 2000 jones et al 1994 kroschel et al 2016 hosner and minckler 1963 further phenology of different species can interact with the timing and magnitude of inundation to alter germination success streng et al 1989 and mortality rates of different sizes and age classes indirect impacts of flooding include shifts in deposition of alluvium that can affect the occurrence and abundance of early successional species e g bradley and smith 1986 barnes 1997 johnson et al 2013b finally complex feedbacks can exist between plant communities and a river s flooding dynamics gurnell and petts 2006 thus while our model is a first step toward incorporating effects of inundation into forest succession models there are clearly additional ways to represent plant water relationships in these systems depending on the study system and questions of interest further development of our modelling framework could seek to incorporate some of these intricacies 4 3 effects of other disturbances and management actions inundation successional processes and other disturbances structure floodplain plant communities in our simulations we included the effects of the emerald ash borer and found that effects on forest cover were generally additive suggesting that eab could contribute to the development of new canopy gaps and the overall loss of some forest cover however in the umr floodplain ash species are generally intermixed with other species and the amount of forest loss attributable to eab was relatively small in model simulations openings created by the loss of individual trees in areas where ash species occur sporadically will likely be filled either by canopy expansion of non ash species or the establishment of new cohorts of more shade tolerant species in newly established gaps as shown by the increase in lowland forest communities in this model there are many other disturbances and stressors that impact how floodplain forests change over time and whether canopy gaps regenerate to forest cover for example invasion by exotic herbaceous species can create persistent canopy gaps in the umr floodplain following windthrow or other gap forming events thomsen et al 2012 guyon et al 2012 de jager et al 2013 we did not simulate competition between woody species and herbaceous species as there is currently no way to do so within the landis ii framework perhaps it can be assumed that the areas where forest loss occurred within our simulations largely due to extended periods of inundation would be passively colonized by herbaceous species some of which are invasive e g phalaris arundinacea l humulus japonicus siebold zucc but there may be other areas within the umr where such species could actively prevent the establishment of woody species delaying canopy gap closure and further increasing estimates of forest loss especially following eab outbreaks future modelling efforts could focus on developing methods to simulate competition between woody and herbaceous species to better understand and predict landscape level effects of invasive species other factors such as herbivory wind fire and forest management e g timber harvest also impact floodplain forests and have extensions within the landis ii platform making it possible to investigate how they might interact with inundation to alter forest cover and community composition within this modelling framework 4 4 conclusions traditional ecological flows models have focused on the direct relationship between riparian and floodplain plant performance and hydrologic attributes without paying much attention to successional processes or other disturbances we suggest that such approaches are useful in systems where large changes in hydrologic regimes have occurred or are expected to occur where the taxa present or formerly present are highly sensitive to changes in flow regimes and or where the taxa are relatively short lived or in systems with very few species these conditions ought to correspond with relatively immediate and strong direct impacts of inundation on species occurrences however some floodplain systems are characterized by long lived taxa which have either tolerated past changes in hydrologic conditions or have yet to experience dramatic hydrologic regime changes in these environments the processes regulating internal stand dynamics e g seed dispersal the effect of shade on germination and competitive interactions among species and other disturbances known to influence forest succession via tree mortality e g wind throw fire insect outbreaks and herbivory may be equally important as the direct effects of flooding our modelling approach allows for investigation of such processes in the context of flood related mortality perhaps most importantly the modelling framework introduced here provides an opportunity to better understand and quantify patterns of forest loss or community change in response to the combined effects of

25038,simulation models are often used to identify hydrologic regimes suitable for different riparian or floodplain tree species however most existing models pay little attention to forest successional processes or other disturbances that may interact with the hydrologic regime of river systems to alter forest dynamics in space and time in this study we introduce a flood disturbance module to the landis ii forest succession modelling framework to enable investigations into how inundation interacts with other disturbances and successional processes to alter floodplain forest cover and community dynamics we illustrate the functionality of the model using a case study with multiple scenarios in the upper mississippi river floodplain usa we found that model predictions of total forest cover and the abundance of specific forest community types were generally related to uncertainty in the susceptibility of different species and age classes to inundation by simulation year 100 increases or decreases in total forest cover and forest type distributions were roughly proportional to the initial differences in the susceptibility of species and age classes to inundation the largest decrease in total forest cover was associated with a scenario that included disturbance by the emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis and when using susceptibility parameters corresponding to the weakest flood tolerance in contrast changes in the composition of aboveground biomass were not sensitive to differences in susceptibility and generally showed shifts toward later successional species with higher shade tolerance and longer lifespans for all scenarios our findings suggest that flood inundation interacts with other disturbances e g insect outbreaks and forest successional processes to alter forest abundance distribution and species composition in this system our modelling framework should allow for future studies that examine such interactions in other systems and in the context of alternative hydrologic scenarios and other disturbance regimes keywords eab eastern cottonwood flooding floodplain forest landis ii silver maple simulation model willow 1 introduction patterns of forest succession are difficult to predict in floodplain and other bottomland hardwood systems given the stochastic nature of flooding and its importance in shaping different aspects of plant community dynamics e g germination recruitment competition and survival in river systems most research and modelling efforts have been based on concepts related to environmental flows and the notion that different biological communities have different hydrologic requirements poff and zimmerman 2010 within this framework empirical studies are often used to quantify the direct effect of prolonged inundation on plant survival i e flood tolerance kozlowski 1984 blom and voeseneck 1996 friedman and auble 1999 yin et al 2009 and the results are then used to parameterize simulation models that can be used to investigate the effects of alternative hydrologic regimes on local species occurrences i e habitat suitability see merritt et al 2010 for a thorough review however in floodplain and other bottomland hardwood systems it is often unclear how the direct effects of flooding on plant survival at a local scale influence forest successional dynamics across larger landscapes the variability of flooding regimes and impacts of other disturbances and successional processes add greater uncertainty to long term successional trends the models currently used for environmental flows studies may over simplify the process of forest succession and do not account for other disturbances that may interact with inundation e g windthrow insect outbreaks herbivory and fire on the other hand forest succession models have largely developed independently of ecological flows models and for use in upland environments while forest succession models often do account for complex successional processes and other disturbances see schifley et al 2017 they do not currently incorporate effects of inundation several past efforts have been made to link models that capture temporal and spatial aspects of hydrologic attributes e g depth duration frequency with other models that simulate plant community dynamics in riparian and floodplain settings e g phipps 1979 auble et al 1994 pearlstine et al 1985 yin et al 2009 benjankar et al 2011 2012 egger et al 2012 for example pearlstine et al 1985 developed forflo by linking one of the earliest gap based forest succession models foret shugart and west 1977 with plot level estimates of flood duration and height to simulate the effects of alternative flow regimes on patterns of forest succession forflo represented a major step forward for riparian and floodplain forest modelling because forest successional patterns emerged from mechanistic representations of several plant processes e g seed germination growth competition etc unfortunately the code for forflo is not currently maintained in contrast to this early mechanistic approach to modelling floodplain forest succession several phenomenological models have been developed more recently to identify hydrologic regimes suitable for riparian and floodplain plant communities see merritt et al 2010 phenomenological models focus on the direct relationship between plant performance and hydrologic attributes often represented by a species response curve rains et al 2004 or a series of successional rules benjankar et al 2011 2012 the basic assumption of these models is that different plant species have specific requirements for hydrologic conditions by assuming some degree of stationarity in the relationships between flooding and species distributions and using a time for space substitution predictions about potential alternative future successional patterns can be made see franz and bazzaz 1977 auble et al 1994 further development of this basic approach has focused on different aspects of hydrologic regimes e g timing frequency magnitude duration predictability different levels of biological organization e g individual population community and different plant responses e g growth photosynthesis biomass cover merrit et al 2010 however the basic conceptual framework has remained focused on the phenomenological relationship between inundation and plant survivorship without consideration for other disturbances or the complex and emergent successional patterns that may occur in floodplain settings hence there remains a need for a mechanistic model that links river flows and patterns of inundation with forest successional processes and other disturbances to forecast potential changes in vegetation in floodplain systems the goal of this study was to adapt a widely used forest landscape simulation model landis ii to capture important dynamics in floodplain settings landis ii is a process based spatially explicit model that represents forest generative processes e g dispersal growth and competition as well as forest degenerative processes e g senescence and disturbance related mortality at large spatial scales 1 000 ha and over long temporal scales centuries mladenoff et al 1993 mladenoff and he 1999 landis ii balances the level of detail used to represent different processes through the use of extensions that plug into the core landis ii model scheller et al 2007 the use of multiple extensions enables investigation of questions that relate to the effects of multiple processes and disturbances that may interact to impact forest succession this model architecture also makes it relatively easy to adapt it for use in a wide range of forest systems within the landis ii modelling framework we incorporated a flood disturbance extension that simulates probabilistic species and age specific mortality resulting from annual spatial patterns of surface water inundation and the tolerance of different tree species and age classes to inundation fig 1 the extension relies on output maps from a separate surface water connectivity model that integrates land surface elevation data and water surface elevation data to simulate patterns of flood inundation over a range of spatial and temporal scales see de jager et al 2018 appendix b and van appledorn et al 2019 in review for complete details the extension was integrated with the landis ii biomass succession extension scheller and mladenoff 2004 which represents the processes of establishment growth competition and senescence as they affect and are affected by the biomass of tree species cohorts fig 1 this addition to the landis ii model platform allows for investigation of the effects of alternative hydrologic regimes on forest succession and how flooding interacts with other successional processes and other disturbances in the remainder of this paper we illustrate the functionality of the extension for simulating patterns of forest succession in the upper mississippi river umr floodplain we show how this mechanistic modelling approach can be used to investigate patterns of forest loss emergent successional dynamics how inundation may interact with other disturbances e g effects of the emerald ash borer and the degree to which successional patterns are sensitive to uncertainty in flood tolerance estimation 2 methods 2 1 study area this case study was conducted along the upper mississippi river umr floodplain from hastings mn to cairo illinois a span of approximately 1311 river kilometers fig 2 forestry data were collected within the umr floodplain within three u s army corps of engineers districts st paul in the northern rock island in the central and st louis in the southern portion of the river system these districts differ in terms of climate and hydrogeomorphic conditions as well as the role navigation infrastructure plays in modifying the structure and function of the river system de jager et al 2018 in the st paul and rock island districts a series of low head dams maintain minimum water levels during low water periods typically late summer and winter resulting in permanently higher water levels than found historically however these dams are not used to regulate water levels during high flow conditions and hence the floodplain still experiences inundation where it is not protected by levees the st louis district includes four low head dams in the northern portion of the river reach but the southern portion is undammed from the st paul district in the north to the st louis district in the south there is a general increase in the amount of the floodplain protected by levees and in agricultural production however for this study we only included floodplain areas that were not protected by levees the area often referred to as the floodway we focused our modelling efforts on four forest community types found within each district based on land cover data for the year 2010 dieck et al 2014 floodplain forest lowland forest populus community and salix community the species commonly associated with the floodplain forest type included silver maple acer saccharinum l american elm ulmus americana l green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica marshall river birch betula nigra l boxelder a negundo l american sycamore platanus occidentalis l and swamp white oak quercus bicolor willd the species associated with the lowland forest community type included red oak q rubra l bur oak q macrocarpa michx swamp white oak q bicolor willd pin oak q palustris münchh common hackberry celtis occidentalis l bitternut hickory carya cordiformis wangenh k koch and shellbark hickory c laciniosa michx f g don the populus community is typically dominated by eastern cottonwood p deltoides w bartram ex marshall and the salix community may include sandbar willow s interior rowlee and or black willow s nigra marshall these four forest types within the unleveed portion of the floodplain make up 23 093 ha 32 694 ha and 39 546 ha which is 65 72 and 69 of the natural undeveloped non agricultural areas floodplain land cover found in the st paul rock island and st louis districts respectively the remaining natural floodplain land cover is in herbaceous wet meadow and marsh communities and some shrub scrub and sand mud cover which were not modelled in this study 2 2 flood disturbance to simulate flood related mortality we modified an existing landis ii extension that was designed to simulate land cover change land use plus lu thompson et al 2016 lu uses a temporal sequence of maps that depict land cover such maps are developed outside of landis ii typically using a gis lu then identifies each land cover transition between two time periods for each land cover change class the user supplies a set of rules that define the type of land cover change and how temporally persistent each type of change might be a typical rule might involve harvesting all cohorts in a given change class and preventing the establishment of new cohorts as would happen when a forested area is developed we utilized the functionality of lu that relies on user supplied maps though instead of depicting land cover the maps we used depicted how long the soil surface of the umr floodplain was estimated to be under water during the growing season april 1 september 30 of each simulated year fig 1 the maps were produced using the surface water connectivity model described in de jager et al 2018 appendix b and in van appledorn et al 2019 in review each map consisted of annual inundation classes at 10 day intervals we modified the code of lu so that instead of detecting land cover changes it directly applied a user defined rule to each inundation class at each time step i e it did not search for changes first we further modified the code of lu to implement rules probabilistically rather than deterministically the rules consisted of probabilistic mortality rates assigned to each species age cohort at 10 day inundation duration intervals to develop species age cohort mortality rates associated with each 10 day inundation duration class we used a data set collected on the umr following a large flood in 1993 yin et al 1993 the flood of 1993 offered a unique opportunity to evaluate the flood tolerance of different species because it resulted in a high degree of variability in flooding conditions depending on elevation and location along the river i e a wide inundation gradient this data set has been used previously to develop flood tolerance equations for select species in select areas of the umr yin et al 2009 however we recently used this data set to develop new logistic regression models based on the data for the entire river system see appendix d in de jager et al 2018 for details briefly these new models predict the probability of mortality for three groups of species low moderate and high flood tolerance as a function of how long the soil surface was under water during the 1993 growing season and tree size dbh each model was then rescaled to remove any mortality associated with 0 days of flooding y intercept so that only effects of flooding were being simulated in the model we used dbh age regressions to express each equation as a function of cohort age since landis ii does not track tree diameter see section 2 3 finally we used results for the mean upper and lower 95 confidence intervals of model parameters coefficients representing the effect of inundation on mortality and the effect of age on mortality to examine sensitivity to uncertainty see 2 4 scenarios and data analyses we grouped species into three flood tolerance categories based on similar species level models and or similar documented flood tolerances whitlow and harris 1979 flood tolerance group 1 included the least flood tolerant species q rubra q velutina q macrocarpa c illinoinesis wangenh k koch c cordiformis c laciniosa morus rubra l diospyros virginiana l c occidentalis and p occidentalis this group generally had the highest mortality rates across all age size classes flood durations and confidence intervals fig 3 the cohorts in this group remain vulnerable to flooding for a much longer period of time age than the more flood tolerant species especially when considering the upper 95 confidence interval of model parameters fig 3 a comparison of model parameter estimates showed that the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from the mean by an average 24 while the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from each other by an average of 41 4 flood tolerance group 2 included a saccharinum a negundo b nigra f pennsylvanica f nigra marshall u americana q bicolor q palustris and p deltoides this group had the least uncertainty in model parameters with the mean lower and upper 95 confidence intervals of model parameters similarly resulting in a strong increase in mortality rates for young cohorts as flood duration increased and a rapid decline in mortality rates at long flood durations as cohorts age fig 3 in other words species in flood tolerance category 2 can escape effects of flooding as they age much more quickly than those in tolerance category 1 a comparison of model parameter estimates showed that the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from the mean by an average 9 6 while the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from each other by an average of 18 1 for species in group 2 finally flood tolerance group 3 included the most flood tolerant species s interior s nigra forestiera acuminata michx poir and cephalanthus occidentalis l this group generally had the lowest mortality rates for all size classes flood durations and confidence intervals fig 3 however model parameter estimates for this group also had a high degree of uncertainty showing virtually no impact of flooding when using model parameters for the lower 95 confidence interval and much higher mortality rates when using model parameters for the upper 95 confidence interval fig 3 a comparison of model parameter estimates for this group showed that the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from the mean by an average 53 2 while the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals differed from each other by an average of 150 3 2 3 landis ii model parameters and input files in landis ii trees are represented as species age cohorts which requires estimating tree ages and aggregating trees into age specific cohorts we used forest inventory data and methods that have become relatively standard in landis ii modelling to accomplish these tasks as outlined in appendix d of de jager et al 2018 forest inventory data sets were used to quantify the existing species composition and age structure of umr forests tree ages were determined from a subset of inventory plots using an increment borer and empirical relationships were developed and subsequently used to estimate the age of each tree from tree diameter measurements all trees were then grouped into 10 year age cohorts we mapped the initial distribution of each species age cohort by matching each forest inventory plot with a corresponding forest type based on the species composition of each plot then the data from each plot were randomly imputed into the cells i e pixels of the corresponding forest type in the land cover map this process was done independently for each district to ensure that species unique to a district remained within that district we used the biomass succession extension version 3 2 scheller and mladenoff 2004 which simulates the processes of establishment growth competition and senescence based on the life histories of taxa as they influence and are influenced by the biomass of cohorts at a site i e cell or pixel we developed basic life history information for each species using burns and honkala 1990 and the information contained within forest inventory data sets e g longevity shade tolerance table 1 one important modification to the information provided by burns and honkala 1990 consisted of using a maximum longevity for u americana of 80 years given our observations of the effects of dutch elm disease in this system we grouped some species when they shared similar life history characteristics and when the abundance of one or both of the species was low table 1 the biomass succession extension requires a file that specifies spatial variability in potential establishment and growth rates for each species across the landscape applications of landis ii in upland settings typically use climate and soil data to develop an ecoregions map for different soil and climate combinations the ecoregions a separate plant physiological model such as linkages pastor and post 1986 or pnett ii aber and federer 1992 is used to determine maximum potential establishment and growth rates based on a climate envelope approach xu et al 2009 however both linkages and pnett ii were developed for use in upland environments the tolerance of different species to drought is a major factor in each model and neither model accounts for effects of soil waterlogging we therefore used empirical methods to parameterize species specific establishment and growth rates and to link them to spatial variation in the landscape see below and appendix d in de jager et al 2018 for details previous research in the umr floodplain has shown that spatial patterns in tree community composition and soil texture are associated with how long the soil surface is on average under water during the growing season de jager et al 2012 to capture spatial variation in flood duration we used the surface water connectivity model fig 1 to develop maps of the 40 year average growing season inundation duration to estimate spatial variability in potential species establishment rates we intersected the location of forest inventory plots with the maps of the 40 year mean growing season flood duration and related the relative abundance of each species to the estimated 40 year average inundation duration for each forest plot the abundance of each species within 10 day inundation zones relative to their total abundance was then used to estimate potential establishment rates see appendix d in de jager et al 2018 for more details the biomass succession extension relies on four user supplied parameter estimates to simulate growth anppmax and maxbiomass which are the maximum annual net primary productivity and maximum total biomass that a species can biologically attain respectively and growthshape and mortalityshape which define the rate at which a species reaches anppmax as it ages and the rate at which biomass declines as the species approaches longevity senescence we derived maxbiomass and anppmax for each species by estimating the biomass of individual trees within the same forest inventory data set used to define initial species age cohort distributions we used regression equations developed by jenkins et al 2003 relating tree diameter to aboveground biomass we then converted per tree biomass to a unit area by estimating biomass under hypothetically fully stocked conditions using crown area estimates from larsen et al 2010 this resulted in a hypothetical species maximum biomass in g m2 maxbiomass next we estimated anppmax from maxbiomass using regression equations developed by keeling and phillips 2007 to estimate the growthshape and mortalityshape parameters and make slight adjustments to maxbiomass and anppmax we compared the plot level biomass estimates described above with estimates derived from the landis ii site utility l2 site miranda and sturtevant 2016 https sites google com site landismodel projects veg site tool l2 site is a microsoft windows based utility that implements the cohort and biomass growth and senescence equations of the biomass succession extension v3 2 for up to six species on a single site we used the maxbiomass and anppmax estimates described above as starting parameters in the site utility along with arbitrary starting parameters for growthshape and mortalityshape we then iteratively simulated the growth of a single cohort of each species and adjusted each parameter so that time age specific biomass estimates would encompass the upper bound of the empirical age biomass data see figure d6 in appendix d of de jager et al 2018 for two examples table 1 provides the estimates of all four growth parameters for each species modeled there were not sufficient data to develop spatially explicit growth parameters and so the growth parameters in table 1 apply to all ecoregions we further examined relationships between landis ii simulated biomass and empirical estimates of biomass for different tree species and communities as a way to validate model outcomes for the initial conditions see de jager et al 2018 appendix d 2 4 scenarios and data analyses we developed four model scenarios to evaluate the role flood related mortality plays in the umr floodplain in the context of successional processes and to examine the sensitivity of model results to uncertainty in the flood tolerance of species age cohorts these scenarios included a simulation without effects of flooding and simulations using flood tolerance equations corresponding to the lower 95 confidence interval lf the mean mf and the upper 95 confidence interval uf of flood tolerance models fig 3 we developed annual maps of growing season flood duration for a 40 year period 1972 2011 using the methods outlined in appendix d of de jager et al 2018 these maps were used to simulate spatial patterns in flooding for the first 40 years of model simulations then recycled for years 41 80 and the first 20 years were again recycled for years 81 100 to create a single 100 year business as usual flooding scenario this flooding regime was used for all model scenarios that included effects of flooding to isolate effects of uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters each of the above four scenarios also included the effects of the emerald ash borer eab on f pennsylvanica and f nigra however to isolate effects of eab we developed one additional scenario that included the use of mean flood tolerance parameters and no eab we simulated tree mortality due to eab using the base biological disturbance agent bda extension version 3 0 1 sturtevant et al 2004 bda simulates tree mortality following major outbreaks of insects and or disease insect outbreaks are probabilistic at the site cell scale with each site assigned a disturbance probability which is then compared to a uniform random number to determine if the site is disturbed the disturbance probability at a site in turn depends on whether an insect host is present on a site if a site is disturbed species and cohort level mortality occur according to user defined susceptibility parameters we modeled the spread of eab as though it was not dispersal limited following gustafson et al 2017 all age classes were considered as suitable hosts for eab annual susceptibility probabilities were set to 0 55 for age classes greater than 5 years which corresponds to a 7 year cumulative mortality probability 0 99 siegert et al 2014 this worst case scenario resulted in the loss of ash cohorts from the landscape within the first 10 years of model simulations but also allowed for continued establishment of new ash cohorts where there was a seed supply and where light conditions were favorable however over the longer term ash cohorts have a 99 probability of mortality by age 12 within the model virtually eliminating the seed supply for this species these settings reflect our primary objective of better understanding how umr forests may respond to eab outbreaks rather than to understand how eab outbreaks may occur we conducted separate simulations within each district because the number of species and species composition varied among them this study because landis ii is a stochastic model we ran each scenario three times and examined the results for this study we chose to report the results of a single replicate for each scenario after noting very minor differences among replicate simulations we first examined how flooding was distributed across the landscape over time to better understand the potential impacts of flooding across the river system next we examined changes in total forest area and an index of forest fragmentation perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac given concerns about the potential loss of forest cover due to eab and or impacts of flooding guyon et al 2012 then we examined the abundance and distribution of the four forest types described in section 2 1 this was done by summing the total biomass of the indicator species defined for each forest type see section 2 1 within each cell each cell was then assigned the forest type associated with the group of indicator species with the greatest total biomass both forest area fragmentation and forest type calculations were done in arcmap 10 5 finally we examined changes in species composition across space and time using a multivariate analysis non metric multidimensional scaling mds clarke 1993 of the total biomass of each species summed across each district biplots were used to visualize similarities and differences among the three districts time periods and scenarios linear correlation coefficients between the biomass of each species and the different mds axes were used to interpret the axes a cluster analysis was used to determine which districts scenarios and time periods were similar to each other p 0 05 these analyses were conducted in primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 to examine sensitivity of model outcomes to uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters we calculated the percent difference in total forest area and the area in the four forest types for simulation years 0 25 50 75 and 100 among the three scenarios that included effects of eab but which differed in flood tolerance parameters lf eab mf eab and uf eab we also examined sensitivity of the species composition analysis to uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters by extracting the multivariate year specific community dissimilarity among the pairwise comparisons of three scenarios 3 results 3 1 inundation dynamics quantification of the spatial pattern of long term inundation durations based on the flood inundation component of the full model fig 1 showed an upstream downstream transition from more area experiencing long inundation durations in the st paul district 40 days per growing season to more area experiencing intermediate inundation durations in the st louis district 10 30 days per growing season fig 2 fig 2 illustrates some of the patterns in flood inundation that emerged from the model areas with longer inundation durations in the st paul and rock island districts tended to be situated in low lying areas away from the main navigation channel fig 2 suggesting that they may correspond with elevated water levels due to the presence of locks and dams in these reaches although longer durations also occur off the main navigation channel in the st louis district the total area experiencing such durations was less than for the more up river districts the different spatial patterns in long term inundation durations help to understand differences in the temporal dynamics of inundation and associated differences in forest succession among the three districts see below year to year variability in the mean pixel value for inundation duration and the distribution of area experiencing different inundation durations were similar in each district fig 4 indicating that temporal dynamics in flooding across the river system were similarly related to regional hydro climatic conditions among the districts the st paul district had the longest annual average inundation duration on a per pixel basis in 26 out of 40 years while the rock island and st louis districts had the longest durations in only 5 and 9 years out of 40 respectively further the years in which the st louis district had the longest average pixel value were generally years with high flows in all three districts whereas the other two districts generally had the longest average pixel value during years with low to moderate flows these differences likely reflect the management of water levels in the two northern districts and the dependence of water levels in the southern district on water entering the system from the northern districts 3 2 forest area and landscape pattern over the 100 year model simulations estimates of forest loss ranged from 0 of initial forest cover in the scenario that did not include flooding eab to as much as 12 of initial forest cover in the scenarios using flood tolerance equations representing the upper 95 confidence interval weakest flood tolerance uf eab fig 5 in all three districts there was a gradual loss of forest cover in the uf eab scenario over time whereas the scenarios that used flood tolerance equations representing the mean mf and mf eab showed slower rates and smaller amounts of forest loss fig 5 further the scenarios that used flood tolerance equations representing the lower 95 confidence interval strongest flood tolerance either showed minor losses of forest cover late in the simulations st paul district or no loss of forest cover at all rock island and st louis districts these results are also reflected in similar differences among scenarios in temporal trends in forest fragmentation perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac and reveal the effects of different rates of cohort mortality associated with flood inundation for the different scenarios fig 3 eab had small additive effects on forest loss in all three districts as indicated by differences between the mf no eab and mf eab scenarios finally the st paul district tended to show the fastest rates and most overall forest loss as compared to the other two districts in addition forest cover was most fragmented in this district for initial conditions and throughout the duration of model simulations these results likely reflected a greater initial interspersion of forest cover with other land cover and vegetation types in this district as well as a greater amount of area experiencing long inundation durations fig 2 fig 6 illustrates the spatial location of forest loss after 100 years for a portion of the floodplain in the st paul district and for the uf eab worst case scenario forest loss could be observed in areas that were inundated for longer than 30 days per growing season often along backwater margins table 2 provides the proportion of forest in each flood inundation class lost after 50 and 100 years in each district and each flood duration class as much as 45 to 54 of the forest in the 60 1day duration class was lost in the uf eab scenario after 100 years compared with 20 28 of the forest lost in the same class in the mf and mf eab scenarios after 100 years 3 3 forest types initial conditions based on land cover data showed similar distributions of four forest types in the st paul and rock island districts 83 floodplain forest 4 lowland forest 7 populus community and 6 salix community fig 7 the st louis district supported less floodplain forest 70 and more lowland forest 12 and populus community 11 than the other two districts over time all scenarios showed signs of progressive successional development as early successional populus communities consistently declined and longer lived and more shade tolerant species from the lowland community type consistently increased in all districts and in all scenarios see section 2 1 for indicator species however the species in the lowland community were generally less flood tolerant than the species found in the other community types fig 3 as a result the magnitude of the increase in lowland forest cover was generally associated with differences in flood related mortality rates among the different scenarios fig 8 the increase in lowland forest was greatest for the scenarios that did not include effects of flooding eab or for those that simulated weaker impacts of flooding lf eab followed by the scenarios simulating stronger effects of flooding mf eab and uf eab interestingly the weakest increase in lowland forest cover was observed in the simulation that did not include effects of eab mf suggesting that in some areas species from the lowland forest community type may replace ash species as they are lost from the landscape further accelerating the rate of succession in contrast to the consistent declines in early successional populus communities cover by salix communities differed by scenario even showing some signs of retrogressive succession in some scenarios strong declines in salix communities were observed in all three districts for the scenario that did not include effects of inundation eab and for the scenario that simulated strong effects of inundation uf eab fig 7 in the eab scenario the loss of salix was due to transition to other longer lived and more shade tolerant communities lowland or floodplain forest while the loss of salix communities in the uf eab scenarios may have resulted from a combination of forest succession and forest loss there was a relatively high degree of uncertainty in the flood tolerance models for salix species fig 3 salix was much more sensitive to flooding in the uf eab scenarios than in the lf eab or mf and mf eab scenarios fig 7 and 8 as a result the later three scenarios showed a recovery of salix communities after initial declines in all three districts in the st louis district the decline in salix occurred after only 25 years whereas the decline in the other two districts occurred after year 50 these declines were likely the result of a loss of forest cover or transition to other types as the existing salix stands reached their relatively short longevity table 1 however between year 75 and 100 there was a strong recovery by salix in these scenarios and in some cases the increases more than compensated for the earlier declines we suggest that this was driven by the higher flood tolerance of salix in these scenarios allowing it to replace itself or to replace floodplain forest communities as they reached their longevity and were unable to regenerate in flood prone areas see fig 8 finally floodplain forest cover was the dominant forest type throughout all simulated years and in all three districts fig 7 however there were strong differences in the change in floodplain forest cover over time among scenarios and districts in the scenario without the effects of flooding eab floodplain forest cover increased in all three districts with the largest increase occurring in the st louis district where there was a higher abundance of silver maple as young cohorts in the initial forest communities data not shown the general increase in floodplain forest cover was likely the result of transition from early successional populus and salix communities toward longer lived and more shade tolerant species within the floodplain forest community however late in the simulations there was a slight decline in floodplain forest cover in all three districts suggesting late succession toward lowland forests as they increased strongly for this scenario the other scenario that showed either an increase st paul and st louis or the weakest decrease rock island was the scenario that did not include effects of eab mf further indicating that the emerald ash borer may contribute to transitions toward the lowland forest type finally floodplain forest cover either declined st paul and rock island or initially increased before declining st louis in the three scenarios representing uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters the consistency among the three scenarios is likely because there was a relatively high degree of certainty in flood tolerance model parameters for these species and therefore relatively small differences among the flood tolerance parameters in the lf mf and uf scenarios fig 3 the decline in the upper two districts occurred relatively late in the simulations as salix was increasing in the lf eab and mf eab scenarios indicating transition toward salix communities in contrast the decline in the uf eab scenario was probably due to the loss of forest cover in flood prone areas table 2 in the st louis district the increase was likely due to a higher abundance of silver maple in the forest understory during initial conditions with the late decline due to flood impacts or transition to lowland forests or salix communities lf eab 3 4 species composition the composition of aboveground biomass was different in all three districts for all time periods and all scenarios p 0 05 fig 9 these differences were primarily expressed along the vertical axis of fig 9 mds2 an axis that was positively correlated r 0 55 with the abundance of c illinoinensis c cordiformis d virginiana f acuminata q macrocarpa and q palustris all of these species were most abundant in the st louis district and least abundant in the st paul district the vertical axis of fig 9 was negatively associated r 0 51 with b nigra q bicolor and q rubra suggesting that these species were most abundant in the st paul district and least abundant in the st louis district over time the forests in the st louis district moved even higher along mds2 for all scenarios suggesting a further increase in the relative biomass of species that initially differentiated it from the other reaches the forests in the rock island district also increased along mds2 but less than for the st louis district the st paul district moved lower on mds2 for all scenarios suggesting that it also increased in the species that already differentiated it from the other districts these transitions along mds2 were supported by species specific plots in each district appendix a however the largest changes in species composition over time occurred along the horizontal axis of fig 9 mds1 an axis that was positively correlated r 0 56 with a negundo c occidentalis m rubra and u americana and negatively associated r 0 47 with the most abundant species across the umr a saccharinum p deltoides and salix species the forests of each district shifted to the right of fig 9 over time for all scenarios indicating a decline in the biomass of these abundant species within each district and each time period the composition of aboveground biomass did not differ significantly among any of the scenarios that included effects of flooding p 0 05 fig 9 however the scenario that did not include effects of flooding eab was consistently different from the other scenarios within each time period by year 50 in the rock island district by year 75 in the st louis district and by year 100 in the st paul district inspection of species specific plots indicate that the difference between the eab scenario and all others was primarily due to smaller declines in the biomass of a saccharinum in the eab scenario this result can likely be explained by the high initial abundance of this species across the umr and higher rates of a saccharinum mortality associated with the scenarios that included effects of flooding 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity to differences in flood model parameters was examined by comparing the percentage difference in flood tolerance model parameters with the percentage differences in total forest cover cover of the four forest types and community dissimilarity that emerged from the simulation model among flood tolerance scenarios over time differences in model outcomes among the three flooding scenarios generally increased over time in all three districts fig 10 the sensitivity of some forest types was often related to the degree of uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters for example model projections for the abundance of the salix community differed by as much as 61 when comparing outcomes between the lf eab and mf eab scenarios which was similar to the percent difference in flood tolerance model parameters between the same two scenarios 53 when comparing the uf eab to the lf eab scenarios model parameters differed by 150 for salix spp and 100 year abundances of the salix community type differed by as much as 93 a similar proportional effect was noted for the lowland community type however the populus community type appeared to be much more sensitive to model uncertainty than the other community types uncertainty in model parameter estimates for this species was only 9 lf eab or uf eab vs mf eab and 18 lf eab vs uf eab yet populus abundances differed by as much as 30 and 90 for these same comparisons this may suggest complex interactions with other species dependent on uncertainty in model parameters for the other species finally the floodplain forest group was generally insensitive to uncertainty in flood tolerance model parameters the abundance of floodplain forest differed by as much as 2 7 lf eab vs mf eab and 3 4 lf eab vs uf eab while model parameter estimates differed by 9 and 18 for these same comparisons finally differences among scenarios in total forest cover and multivariate dissimilarity in species composition after 100 years were generally similar to the amount of uncertainty in the flood tolerance of the most abundant species group 2 4 discussion in this study we introduced a modelling framework that incorporates concepts from ecological flows models used in floodplain and riparian systems namely the impact of inundation on tree species survival and concepts from forest succession and disturbance models used in upland forest systems the integration of these two modelling approaches allows for investigation into how direct effects of inundation on plant survival interact with forest successional processes in addition other interactive effects of a variety of disturbances can be investigated using this modelling framework 4 1 forest succession in floodplains in our simulations all scenarios produced similar trajectories in species composition with some variability in the rate and magnitude of succession among scenarios hence in the modeling framework changes in species composition over time were largely governed by the life history attributes of the taxa inter and intra specific competition as represented by the landis ii biomass succession extension and the initial distribution of species and tree ages across the landscape this is important given that most current ecological flows models ignore most of these forest successional processes and instead only account for the direct response of species or guilds to inundation hodges 1997 described a general pattern of forest succession in the mississippi river atlantic and gulf coastal plains governed by the interplay between autogenic and allogenic processes autogenic processes are related to how different species and communities modify the growing environment for other species e g shading effects and thereby contribute to species replacement over time in the absence of allogenic processes i e disturbances such as flooding sedimentation or wind events autogenic process lead to a general progression from short lived and shade intolerant pioneer communities to those with longer lifespans and greater shade tolerance which is consistent with many of our findings however across topographically diverse floodplain landscapes the importance of allogenic processes flooding in particular can vary from place to place and create complex spatial patterns in successional trajectories in some locations a given community type may persist as a hydric disclimax community hodges 1997 if later successional species cannot tolerate local flooding conditions in contrast the same community may fully transition to a later successional community in a higher elevation area in our study autogenic processes appeared to strongly influence forest successional patterns because the initial distribution of species and age classes across the landscape already reflected past patterns of inundation however allogenic processes remain important as they strongly influence the potential of communities to regenerate in place or colonize new areas therefore a complete understanding of forest succession in floodplains requires examining patterns of species or community replacement within different hydrogeomorphic settings our results point to significant future declines in early successional salix and populus communities as a result of forest succession a large proportion of the populus stands in the lower portions of the umr generated on former agricultural fields following land acquisition in the 1930 s to 1950 s and it is expected that these higher elevation areas will ultimately succeed to other longer lived and more shade tolerant community types as projected by our model other populus stands and most salix stands in the umr are often situated along land water boundaries likely reflecting primary succession following events that create high light environments e g creation of cut banks or which result in the development of new land forms with fresh sediments e g point bars and islands such processes are generally considered as necessary to regenerate these communities in riparian and floodplain settings hosner and minckler 1963 kupfer and malanson 1993 johnson et al 2013a because these geomorphic processes were not simulated in our study it is possible that we over estimated the decline in these early successional communities however it is unclear how prevalent such processes are in today s regulated rivers finally in simulations where the tolerance of salix species to inundation was much greater than all other species we noted some stand replacement in low lying areas simply because such sites flooded too frequently to support any other species while salix communities dominated by s interior may perpetuate themselves for long periods of time due to vegetative reproduction there is little empirical support for self replacement of salix communities hodges 1997 suggested that low lying salix communities particularly those dominated by s nigra are likely to transition to either floodplain forests maple ash elm complex if site elevation increases over time due to sediment deposition or such communities may also transition to even more flood tolerant wet shrub communities with buttonbush and swamp privet it is possible that had we been better able to model the initial distribution and flood tolerance of buttonbush and swamp privet that such transitions would have occurred in our model instead such sites tended to regenerate to salix communities or loose forest cover altogether at the other end of the successional sequence are longer lived and more shade tolerant species in our study we observed modest increases in the proportion of the landscape occupied by lowland forests 0 05 to 0 10 or 0 10 to 0 20 depending on district while this community type included a wide range of species such increases were primarily attributable to increases in the biomass of c illinoinensis and c cordiformis species grouped c occidentalis and q bicolor depending on district the currently low abundance of these species in the umrs may reflect a variety of factors related to past land use and navigation practices including conversion of high elevation forests to agricultural areas succession to floodplain forests due to altered hydrology and a lack of fire disturbance or even forest loss due to large flood events yin et al 1993 nelson et al 1998b yin 1999 given the comparatively weaker flood tolerance of this species group modeled increases in lowland forest coverage were generally restricted to areas with shorter flood durations and with the magnitude of the increase being directly proportional to the differences in flood tolerance model parameters among scenarios the only exception to this was q bicolor which had a flood tolerance equal to that of other floodplain forest species but which had a much longer lifespan these characteristics along with a more widespread initial distribution in the st paul district underpinned the relatively strong increase in this particular species the life history characteristics of these species e g relatively greater shade tolerance and longer life span suggest future increases based on autogenic processes but whether and where they increase likely depends on future patterns of inundation and the flood tolerance of these species which both have a relatively high degree of uncertainty finally our results suggest that floodplain forest communities are likely to continue to dominate the umr landscape over the next 100 years but the species composition of those communities could change substantially the generally high flood tolerance and wide range of life history characteristics of the species included in the floodplain forest community allow it to occupy a variety of site conditions and successional states making it the most abundant community type within this system however over time the species that dominate the floodplain forest community has been shown to vary in the umrs knutsen and klaas 1998 found a doubling in the importance of a saccharinum since pre settlement conditions and a reduction in u americana probably due to dutch elm disease yet the maple ash elm complex within the umrs has persisted in the landscape we found immediate declines in f pennsylvanica resulting from the emerald ash borer and later declines in a saccharinum while other floodplain forest species e g q bicolor u americana and a negundo were increasing nevertheless the floodplain forest community remained the dominant forest type over the entire 100 year period and either maintained or increased its current abundance for at least 75 years depending on the umr forestry district 4 2 effects of flooding the addition of flood related mortality to the landis ii platform makes it possible to forecast the loss of forest cover resulting from changes in hydrologic regimes and or due to interactions with other disturbances and management actions e g insect outbreaks wind harvest forest loss began occurring after the first 50 years of relatively stable conditions and in low lying areas in most of our simulations this implies that younger cohorts that were more vulnerable to flood related mortality were not able to survive in some areas of the landscape as older cohorts reached their longevity or died due to wind events or emerald ash borer outbreaks younger cohorts were not able to recolonize and survive in those same sites this suggests that changes in the hydrologic regime of this particular river system since the establishment of the existing forests may limit forest regeneration in some places previous studies have suggested that the construction of the lock and dam system may influence forest regeneration on the umrs yin et al 2009 theiling and burant 2012 guyon and battaglia 2018 however it is also possible that increased discharge in the umr basin resulting from land use practices in the larger watershed e g tile drainage changes in the amount of precipitation and or further modification of river flows for navigation have all lead to increased water levels and more frequent flooding over the past 30 40 years we did observe some degree of variability in forest loss estimates among scenarios that were dependent on species and age specific tolerance to inundation which requires further investigation for example future efforts should seek to reduce uncertainty of the flood tolerance of common floodplain species and translate this understanding into quantitative relationships that can be mapped and modeled nevertheless quantifying the timing and location of forest loss in floodplain ecosystems is a major step forward given that these systems can be subject to large changes in hydrologic regimes and because the loss of forest cover is likely to have much stronger impacts on ecosystem structure and function than forest compositional changes swanson et al 2017 future studies that examine forest loss in response to changes in hydrologic regimes resulting from changes in land use precipitation patterns or river infrastructure should benefit from this modelling framework results of our sensitivity analysis suggest that for most species or species groups a given change in tolerance to inundation should result in a similar long term proportional change in the abundance of that group of species this finding is especially important for species that may have a high degree of uncertainty in their tolerance to inundation however we also found instances where a relatively small degree of uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters corresponded with a very large difference in model outcomes for example the range of outcomes for the abundance of the populus community did not appear to be related to the small degree of uncertainty in flood tolerance parameters for p deltoides this suggests that in some instances simulated forest successional processes may interact with uncertainty in the flood tolerance of some species and stochastic flooding events i e mortality to create complex forest dynamics as we pointed out above more quantitative research aimed at reducing uncertainty of flood tolerance models could help to also clarify how inundation interacts with forest successional processes in these systems lastly our model focuses on the role year to year variability in the total number of inundation days plays in plant survival given that previous studies in this system have shown strong relationships between inundation duration and forest species composition de jager et al 2012 2016 however there are a number of other ways in which hydrology can shape plant communities see glenz et al 2006 for a thorough review briefly trees may suffer physical damage like abrasion or become uprooted during energetically intense flows sigafoos 1964 karrenberg et al 2003 physiological stress can arise due to root zone saturation hook 1984 hook and brown 1973 blom voesenek 1996 kozlowski 1984 or overtopping of end shoots stanturf and gardiner 2000 and can interfere with growth and regenerative processes often in complex ways gee et al 2014 battaglia et al 2000 jones et al 1994 kroschel et al 2016 hosner and minckler 1963 further phenology of different species can interact with the timing and magnitude of inundation to alter germination success streng et al 1989 and mortality rates of different sizes and age classes indirect impacts of flooding include shifts in deposition of alluvium that can affect the occurrence and abundance of early successional species e g bradley and smith 1986 barnes 1997 johnson et al 2013b finally complex feedbacks can exist between plant communities and a river s flooding dynamics gurnell and petts 2006 thus while our model is a first step toward incorporating effects of inundation into forest succession models there are clearly additional ways to represent plant water relationships in these systems depending on the study system and questions of interest further development of our modelling framework could seek to incorporate some of these intricacies 4 3 effects of other disturbances and management actions inundation successional processes and other disturbances structure floodplain plant communities in our simulations we included the effects of the emerald ash borer and found that effects on forest cover were generally additive suggesting that eab could contribute to the development of new canopy gaps and the overall loss of some forest cover however in the umr floodplain ash species are generally intermixed with other species and the amount of forest loss attributable to eab was relatively small in model simulations openings created by the loss of individual trees in areas where ash species occur sporadically will likely be filled either by canopy expansion of non ash species or the establishment of new cohorts of more shade tolerant species in newly established gaps as shown by the increase in lowland forest communities in this model there are many other disturbances and stressors that impact how floodplain forests change over time and whether canopy gaps regenerate to forest cover for example invasion by exotic herbaceous species can create persistent canopy gaps in the umr floodplain following windthrow or other gap forming events thomsen et al 2012 guyon et al 2012 de jager et al 2013 we did not simulate competition between woody species and herbaceous species as there is currently no way to do so within the landis ii framework perhaps it can be assumed that the areas where forest loss occurred within our simulations largely due to extended periods of inundation would be passively colonized by herbaceous species some of which are invasive e g phalaris arundinacea l humulus japonicus siebold zucc but there may be other areas within the umr where such species could actively prevent the establishment of woody species delaying canopy gap closure and further increasing estimates of forest loss especially following eab outbreaks future modelling efforts could focus on developing methods to simulate competition between woody and herbaceous species to better understand and predict landscape level effects of invasive species other factors such as herbivory wind fire and forest management e g timber harvest also impact floodplain forests and have extensions within the landis ii platform making it possible to investigate how they might interact with inundation to alter forest cover and community composition within this modelling framework 4 4 conclusions traditional ecological flows models have focused on the direct relationship between riparian and floodplain plant performance and hydrologic attributes without paying much attention to successional processes or other disturbances we suggest that such approaches are useful in systems where large changes in hydrologic regimes have occurred or are expected to occur where the taxa present or formerly present are highly sensitive to changes in flow regimes and or where the taxa are relatively short lived or in systems with very few species these conditions ought to correspond with relatively immediate and strong direct impacts of inundation on species occurrences however some floodplain systems are characterized by long lived taxa which have either tolerated past changes in hydrologic conditions or have yet to experience dramatic hydrologic regime changes in these environments the processes regulating internal stand dynamics e g seed dispersal the effect of shade on germination and competitive interactions among species and other disturbances known to influence forest succession via tree mortality e g wind throw fire insect outbreaks and herbivory may be equally important as the direct effects of flooding our modelling approach allows for investigation of such processes in the context of flood related mortality perhaps most importantly the modelling framework introduced here provides an opportunity to better understand and quantify patterns of forest loss or community change in response to the combined effects of

25039,niche based species distribution models sdms have become an essential tool in conservation and restoration planning given the current threats to freshwater biodiversity it is of fundamental importance to address scale effects on the performance of niche based sdms of freshwater species distributions the scale effects are addressed here in the context of hierarchical catchment ordering considered as counterpart to coarsening grain size by increasing grid cell size we combine fish occurrence data from the danube river basin the hierarchical catchment ordering and multiple environmental factors representing topographic climatic and anthropogenic effects to model fish occurrence probability across multiple scales we focus on 1st to 5th order catchments the spatial scale hierarchical catchment order only marginally influences the mean performance of sdms however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale key predictors and their relative importance are

hierarchical catchment ordering provides a valuable framework to address scale effects on niche based sdms of freshwater species distributions allan et al 1997 and was thus considered as counterpart to coarsening grain size by increasing grid cell size which is commonly used in modelling distributions of virtual or terrestrial species specifically the hierarchical structure of catchments is considered to be one of the key challenges in the application of sdms in freshwater ecosystems domisch et al 2015 given that sdms are central to both fundamental and applied research in biogeography araújo and guisan 2006 in particular conservation and restoration planning the need for an improved understanding of the effects of grain size on the overall performance of freshwater species sdms becomes apparent studies of freshwater species distributions using multiple spatial scales are rare and generally limited to the comparison of the relative importance of reach and sub catchment related environmental factors for the variation in species local composition e g hopkins and burr 2009 esselman and allan 2010 using exploratory data analysis techniques however domisch et al 2013

assessment for sdms that lacked fine grain survey data 2 3 hierarchical catchment orders the analyses and modelling were conducted for five different catchment orders watershed order wso1 to wso5 fig a 1 based on the strahler order of the river reaches from the ccm2 pan european catchments database ccm version 2 1 de jager and vogt 2010 the 1st order catchments wso1 were defined according to the drainage areas of the individual river reaches while higher order catchments wso2 wso5 result from groupings of the lower order catchments in a hierarchical way the wso1 to wso5 nomenclature originated from the ccm2 pan european catchments database and was kept here for consistency catchment order increase was reflected in an increasing catchment size with an average ranging from 12 km2 for the wso1 to 2148 km2 for the wso5 for each wso environmental factors were calculated by averaging gridded data across the corresponding catchment areas fig a 1 2 4 fish data species occurrence data for the danube river basin were provided by biofresh www freshwaterplatform eu schinegger et al 2016 for 1364 sites fig a 1 fisheries data were sampled by either single pass or double pass electrofishing between 1985 and 2002 to ensure an accurate estimate of the species distributions only species with a minimum of 50 occurrences at the largest analysed scale the wso5 were included into the analysis cf coudon and gégout 2007 eight fish species were included in the study and ecological characterization followed kottelat and freyhof 2007 the bleak alburnus alburnus is a small cyprinid and prefers open waters of lakes and medium to large rivers the stone loach barbatula barbatula is usually found in medium sized rivers with gravel to stone bottom barbus barbus is a fish of the cyprinid family preferably inhabiting faster flowing summer warm medium to large sized rivers gudgeons of the genus gobio here represented by gobio obtusirostris are riverine cyprinids too which tolerate in contrast to barbels lower flow velocities and finer spawning substrates the bullhead cottus gobio inhabits cold clear and fast flowing water of small streams to medium sized rivers the roach rutilus rutilus is a small fish of the cyprinid family mainly found in nutrient rich large to medium sized lowland rivers and backwaters the trout salmo trutta is a species of salmonid fish preferring cold well oxygenated streams in the mountainous areas the chub squalius cephalus is a fish of the cyprinid family found in slow flowing lowland rivers very small mountain streams and in large streams of barbel zone for each of the five wsos fish occurrence data were aggregated to presence absence information hereafter called catchment scale mapping the final number of catchments of each particular order and their spatial arrangement was thus directly constrained by fish data availability with the wso increase the number of catchments under consideration decreased from 1363 for the wso1 to 126 for the wso5 with a corresponding increase in species prevalence table 2 we note here that because of the dendritic structure of river networks catchment scale mapping is more appropriate for freshwater species than the point to grid mapping used for mapping terrestrial species occurrences see fagan 2002 in addition given that catchments serve as units for freshwater management and conservation commonly referred to as the catchment based approach caba see defra 2013 catchment scale mapping of freshwater species occurrences ensures compatibility between the management and the analysis scales lévêque et al 2008 markovic et al 2017 2 5 data analysis and modelling univariate strength of the environmental predictor variables was quantified using the weight of evidence woe and information value iv concepts as implemented in the r r development core team 2018 library information larsen 2016 while woe describes the relationship between a predictor variable x environmental predictors listed in table 1 and a binary dependent variable y here species occurrence in a particular catchment information value measures the strength of the y x relationship specifically if b i i 1 k denote k discrete bins for the predictor x then the strength of the predictor in describing y can be quantified as i p x b i y 1 p x b i y 0 w o e i cf larsen 2016 as such information value is suitable for the initial predictor selection i e for comparing the predictive power of the environmental factors the information value was used to reduce the parameter number used in the modelling and thus avoid possible overfitting specifically among several strongly correlated parameters with pairwise correlations above 0 75 the parameter with the largest information values was used in the modelling species distribution modelling was performed using generalized additive models gam r library gam hastie 2005 gam is a non parametric extension of generalized linear methods and is widely used for modelling current and future distribution patterns of fish species previous investigations using various sdms have shown that gam glm generalized linear models and regression tree based sdms have similar validation performance the first two kinds of models had also similar calibration performance while regression tree based sdms tended to overfit during the calibration phase markovic et al 2012 the improved performance of consensus or ensemble methods in providing more accurate and robust projections of species distribution have been already demonstrated marmion et al 2009 buisson et al 2010 lauzeral et al 2013 however the main objective of this study was determining the effect and importance of variation in spatial scale rather than the performance of different sdms moreover gams are very flexible models and in contrast to the majority of sdms have well performance at high collinearity dormann et al 2013 therefore we focussed only on gam based sdms but acknowledge the importance of using multiple sdms when the study goal is predicting future species distribution patterns see markovic et al 2012 meller et al 2014 species occurrence probabilities resulting from gam application were transformed to presence absence information using the thresholds which maximize both sensitivity the true positive rate and the specificity the true negative rate we applied random splitting of the fish data ten times into calibration 70 and validation 30 i e each of the ten models was calibrated using a different 70 data sample and validated using the remaining 30 the repetitive modelling procedure allowed for quantifying the uncertainty of the estimates agreement between the observed and modelled species distribution patterns was quantified by sensitivity and specificity while the performance of the calibrated models was estimated using the area under the receiver operator curve auc and the true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 the use of the different statistical measures here sensitivity specificity auc and tss was necessary to ensure that sensitivities of the individual measures to prevalence and scale see lobo et al 2008 were not misleading an auc of 0 5 and a tss of 0 indicate that a model has no discriminatory power while an auc or tss of 1 indicate that presences and absences are perfectly discriminated the search for a parsimonious model involved analyses of the model improvement based on the akaike information criterion aic through simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection to quantify the relative predictor importance the variance partitioning method by lindeman et al 1980 implemented within the r library relaimpo grömping 2006 was used the advantage of the variance partitioning method by lindeman et al 1980 is that it considers sequential sums of squares over all predictor permutations and thus considers the inter correlation effects among the individual predictors with high predictor relative importance not necessarily implying causation 3 results 3 1 information value and correlations the mean catchment elevation altitude manifested the highest univariate strength in describing distributions of the studied fish species across the studied spatial scales table a 1 and fig a 2f specifically for wso1 wso2 and wso5 altitude had by far the highest information value iv and at wso4 the second highest at wso3 eight predictors including altitude had almost equally high iv consequently altitude had to be retained as the predictor at all scales while predictors with either marginal iv length pseason grassland and pastures or extremely high correlations 0 99 to 0 93 with altitude slope gradient anntmean anntmax taprsep tmaiaug and wetttmean were omitted from the analyses for parsimony reasons table a 1 and fig a 2 it is noteworthy that the pairwise correlation between altitude and several variables describing temperature anntmean anntmax taprsep tmaiaug and wetttmean increased with scale the remaining temperature variables trange mean iv 0 52 and tseason mean iv 1 21 table a 1 however were included in order to account for direct temperature effects and not solely indirect given by the often used temperature surrogate altitude whereby correlations between altitude and trange as well as tseason were still high for catchment scales above wso2 0 90 to 0 74 e g fig a 3 we note that gams are very flexible models and still have well performance at high collinearity for wso1 and wso2 however pairwise correlations of these variables with altitude were below 0 75 0 74 to 0 54 mean information values of further climatic variables i e pmaiaug paprsep and annpmean were close to each other 1 30 1 42 table a 1 high pairwise correlations among the three precipitation parameters and a lower correlation for wso1 wso5 between annpmean and each of the already chosen variables especially altitude led to the exclusion of paprsep and pmaiaug a low mean information value led also to the exclusion of the last precipitation variable pseason 0 43 table a 1 among the anthropogenic variables the area under row crops rowcrops emerged as the most valuable in describing distributions of the studied fish species the high correlation between rowcrops and the second most valuable anthropogenic variable agriculture 0 78 0 95 e g fig a 3 has led to the omission of agriculture while the remaining anthropogenic variables builtup forest and population were included in the final variable set because of low pairwise correlations among the included variables and high information values within the anthropogenic category the variables grassland and pastures were excluded due to low information values table a 1 the final variable set consequently consisted of the topographic variable altitude the climatic variables trange tseason and annpmean and the anthropogenic variables rowcrops forest builtup and population fig 1 and table a 2 3 2 model performance using the selected eight predictor variables table a 2 we pursued two distinct model fitting approaches across all catchment scales and species modelling species distributions with gam by a keeping the predictor number n 8 constant across the scales and b using simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection in order to obtain a parsimonious model when keeping all predictors across all scales the overall validation performance was highly accurate with a mean auc of 0 88 and a mean tss of 0 63 across all catchment scales and species table a 3 similar results held for the models with simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection where a mean validation auc of 0 88 and a mean validation tss of 0 62 table 3 were obtained the highest performance values for both model fitting approaches were observed for s trutta at wso4 auc 0 98 table 3 and table a 3 overall when coarsening the grain size i e increasing catchment order both a slight model degradation and a slight model improvement was observed figs a 4 and a 5 in addition the increasing catchment order was accompanied by an uncertainty increase manifested by an increase in the standard deviation of the validation sensitivity specificity auc and tss figs 2 and a 6 3 3 predictor importance per species and catchment order predictor importance patterns varied across species and catchment orders figs 3 and 4 table a 4 a 5 fig a 7 a 14 high variation throughout species is shown in fig 3 by high standard deviations for all variables for both model fitting approaches and all species highest predictor importance was distributed among the variables altitude 20 1 37 tseason 13 5 22 5 annpmean 14 1 27 5 and rowcrops 4 3 25 3 fig 3 in general lowest predictor importance was present for trange forest builtup and population however trange was shown to have an increasing overall mean importance with increasing catchment order 5 1 13 4 and forest an overall nearly constant importance across all scales at around 10 both inferred from the first model fitting approach which kept the predictor number constant using simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection implied a mean predictor importance below 9 for the four least important variables across all scales fig 3 trends in the predictor importance for the four most important variables across the five catchment orders varied depending on whether the predictors were kept constant across scales or automatically selected the first approach identified a downward trend of the importance for altitude with increasing scale whereas the second approach delineated an increasing importance with increasing scale trends of predictor importance along the studied scales inferred from both approaches were similar for tseason which could be described by an upward trend whereas the importance for wso4 and wso5 deduced from the second approach was higher both model fitting approaches assigned high importance to annpmean from wso1 to wso4 and lower importance at wso5 the second approach however showed greater variation for annpmean the predictor importance of rowcrops for both approaches revealed highest explanation power at local scales and lower importance at wso4 and wso5 fig 3 overall at least one variable of the three considered categories topographic climatic anthropogenic respectively was identified as important in describing fish species distributions on the single species level most important variables consisted in general of a subset of the overall identified four most important variables altitude tseason annpmean rowcrops fig 4 tables a 4 and a 5 fig a 7 a 14 few exceptions were for example b barbus or g obtusirostris where higher predictor importance with increasing scale of trange for the first model fitting approach was observable figs a 9 and a 11 moreover some of the four most important predictors were only selected at certain catchment orders as such tseason as explanatory variable for the distribution of b barbus had a predictor importance above 10 only for wso4 and wso5 whereas for wso2 and wso3 the variable was not selected as predictor fig 4a and table a 5 however altitude was dominating the predictor importance pattern of b barbus from wso1 to wso5 and the distribution of b barbus at the local levels wso1 to wso3 was strongly influenced by rowcrops fig 4a and table a 5 this pattern was also identified by the first modelling approach fig a 9a and table a 4 in addition the anthropogenic variable population here generally identified as variable with low importance had an importance of 26 8 at wso4 for models with automatic predictor selection such occasional high importance of variables with generally low importance could also be observed for other considered species for g obtusirostris altitude tseason annpmean and rowcrops emerged as the key factors figs 4b and a 11 and tables s4 and s5 similarly for s trutta altitude tseason annpmean and rowcrops were most often selected as predictors across all scales figs 4c and a 13 and tables s4 and s5 4 discussion the majority of models of fish distribution patterns across the studied spatial scales were highly accurate for both used model fitting approaches the negligible effect of the catchment order on the mean performance of freshwater sdms is in line with the results of guisan et al 2007 who have shown that coarsening study grain size through grid cell size increase does not have substantial effects on the performance of terrestrial sdms however our study additionally shows that the variance of the validation performance measures increases with increasing scale the high accuracy of the sdms across all studied catchment orders confirms the overall appropriateness of the considered environmental factors and is also a reflection of the predictive ability of the applied statistical methodology i e gam as such we note that adding new parameters to our models would rather result in an overfitting than in a meaningful improvement in the model accuracy when looking at the predictive ability of each individual environmental factor the topographic variable altitude the climatic variables tseason and annpmean and the anthropogenic variable rowcrops tend to be the most important predictors irrespective whether or not an automatic predictor selection was used altitude which can be seen as a surrogate for temperature and climatic factors are well known to influence fish species distributions e g kuemmerlen et al 2014 the identification of rowcrops as important predictor aligns with previous studies stressing the importance of surrounding landscape on the in stream ecosystem structure and function fausch et al 2002 linke et al 2008 the link between the area covered by rowcrops and fish distribution patterns was argued by strayer et al 2003 as high nitrate flux leading to a high level of aquatic plant cover which in turn leads to low fish species richness similarly intensely used crop lands with its bare soils free of weeds suffer from surface erosion and thus provide a continuous source of fine sediments leading to clogging and siltation of coarse substrates followed by the decline of gravel spawning riverine fish species soulsby et al 2001 lapointe et al 2004 greig et al 2005 jensen et al 2009 overall our results especially the differences in predictor importance trends across scales of the two approaches and the corresponding variable selection suggest species dependent selection of factors describing species distributions paired with appropriate monitoring of effects and management of mitigation activities tailored to ensure species long term persistence the relative importance of the factors used to describe species distribution patterns is known to vary across spatial scales jackson et al 2001 blackburn and gaston 2002 tudesque et al 2014 at the same time the relative importance of the spatial scale and the environmental factors used in species distribution modelling is largely determined by a combination of species range and species prevalence hopkins and burr 2009 our results indicate that for b barbus the relative importance of anthropogenic pressure manifested by rowcrops population and builtup is similar to or higher than the importance of the considered three climatic factors b barbus is known to be especially sensitive to damming river regulation and fine sediment input indicating that the results of the sdms well align with the ecological classification of this species kottelat and freyhof 2007 also b barbus seems more susceptible to the effects of land use on water quality and spawning habitat than s trutta which has similar environmental requirements however this seeming relation simply results from higher cumulative anthropogenic pressure at the lower elevated river reaches preferably colonised by barbel this is further confirmed by the finding that the influence of rowcrops at local scales better describes the distribution of gudgeons of the genus gobio which prefer cold and clean water our finding of the dominant role of climatic variables in shaping distribution patterns of the fish species studied for all catchment orders contradicts the suggestions that climate related factors may be good predictors of species distributions only at the macro scale e g pearson and dawson 2003 however for robust conclusions to be made further integrated climate impact modelling would be needed although it contributes significantly to the understanding of freshwater fish patterns at various scales our modelling framework has a number of limitations one limiting aspect of our study framework lies in the fact that the selected set of catchment orders and the predictor dataset used do not account for the effects of spatial arrangements of local habitats and spatial autocorrelation effects as well as habitat peculiarities with respect to species requirements at different life stages specifically proximal environment experienced by a species is not necessarily reflected in the geographic scales used to calculate the environmental factors as such the probability of species occurrence resulting from the calibrated models provides the information on the potential habitat suitability of catchments at different hierarchical levels this suitability does not consider the accessibility of habitats required for particular life stages or temporal resource availability and adequateness another weakness is the use of multi decadal averages of climatic factors in the model calibration process climate information for the last 30 50 years may not adequately reflect species environmental tolerance ranges moreover the tolerance limits are rarely rigidly fixed as they might depend on lifetime experience the developmental stage of individuals within species and the combined effect of various abiotic and biotic factors consequently in order to account for temporal and spatial aspects of species distribution patterns researchers will need to disentangle species information according to life stages the life strategy and temporal mismatch of predictors to response as well as environmental information according to temporal variability scales of the physical processes governing individual environmental properties time space and hierarchical level are the fundamental axes of scale and since many physical and ecological phenomena are related in space versus time wu and li 2006 temporal information should be accounted for in models of species distributions see also soranno et al 2014 5 conclusion coarsening study grain size through catchment order increase are shown to be of minor influence on the mean performance of freshwater fish sdms however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale we highlight the importance of using anthropogenic effects as population and land cover related predictors when addressing species sensitive to pollution such as b barbus specifically our results indicate that the model complexity and the importance assigned to environmental drivers of fish distributions are both catchment order dependent and species dependent the latter emphasises importance of compatibility between the scale of factor importance and species conservation management scale with the current threat to freshwater biodiversity and lack of information on which to base freshwater conservation strategies in many regions of the world in particular less developed countries our results have useful implications for predicting distributions of species and conservation planning in areas where fine grain survey data on species occurrence are unavailable in particular our results indicate that the use of broader scale species and environmental data i e up to wso5 catchment scale data does not significantly affect the performance of sdms we remind here that the ecological scales of relevance of species and environmental variables should be matched hurlbert and jetz 2007 although the increased availability of high resolution environmental data is tempting towards studying species distributions at finer resolutions than the species survey data to avoid misleading conservation assessments in addition in view of the extreme global pressure of climate change on freshwater ecosystems and the importance of the climatic factors on distribution patterns of the studied freshwater fish species even at the smallest studied scale reach scale our findings underline the necessity of efforts to continuously re assess the potential effects of climate change on suitability of catchments for freshwater fish species given the high vulnerability of freshwater ecosystems paired with limited dispersal ability of strictly aquatic species such as fish addressing environmental effects across multiple spatial and temporal scales is central to effective species conservation and timely identification of potentially detrimental

25039,niche based species distribution models sdms have become an essential tool in conservation and restoration planning given the current threats to freshwater biodiversity it is of fundamental importance to address scale effects on the performance of niche based sdms of freshwater species distributions the scale effects are addressed here in the context of hierarchical catchment ordering considered as counterpart to coarsening grain size by increasing grid cell size we combine fish occurrence data from the danube river basin the hierarchical catchment ordering and multiple environmental factors representing topographic climatic and anthropogenic effects to model fish occurrence probability across multiple scales we focus on 1st to 5th order catchments the spatial scale hierarchical catchment order only marginally influences the mean performance of sdms however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale key predictors and their relative importance are scale and species dependent our findings have useful implications for choosing proper species dependent spatial scales for river rehabilitation measures and for conservation planning in areas where fine grain species data are unavailable keywords catchment order conservation planning danube generalized additive models species distribution modelling 1 introduction niche based species distribution models sdms play a central role in studying species habitat preferences conservation and restoration planning at global regional and local scales e g franklin 2009 multitudes of different algorithms now exist and new methods and algorithms are developed continuously e g efron and hastie 2016 methodological aspects of sdms have been thoroughly studied from many perspectives demonstrating reasons for differing performances see elith and graham 2009 including the sampling patterns presence absence or presence only data brotons et al 2004 choice of single algorithm vs consensus methods marmion et al 2009 the length of studied future time periods and used predictors morán ordóñez et al 2016 collinearity dormann et al 2013 prevalence lawson et al 2014 and the choice of grain size resolution of environmental layers guisan et al 2007 while the superior performance of consensus sdm methods has been repeatedly demonstrated increasing the reliability of the projections and reducing the model uncertainties e g thuiller 2004 marmion et al 2009 grenouillet et al 2011 the influence of spatial scales on predictive power was less frequently studied a study by guisan et al 2007 has shown that a 10 fold increase of the grid cell size does not have a substantial effect on the performance of sdms describing distributions of bird plant and vertebrate species similarly lauzeral et al 2013 have shown a minor decrease in the performance of sdms for five virtual species with coarsening grain size from 30 30 to 32 32 comparable studies that use multiple grain size resolutions and sdms for freshwater species do not exist however a study by domisch et al 2013 has shown that the choice of stream network or landscape as study area does not affect the performance of sdms of stream biota hierarchical catchment ordering provides a valuable framework to address scale effects on niche based sdms of freshwater species distributions allan et al 1997 and was thus considered as counterpart to coarsening grain size by increasing grid cell size which is commonly used in modelling distributions of virtual or terrestrial species specifically the hierarchical structure of catchments is considered to be one of the key challenges in the application of sdms in freshwater ecosystems domisch et al 2015 given that sdms are central to both fundamental and applied research in biogeography araújo and guisan 2006 in particular conservation and restoration planning the need for an improved understanding of the effects of grain size on the overall performance of freshwater species sdms becomes apparent studies of freshwater species distributions using multiple spatial scales are rare and generally limited to the comparison of the relative importance of reach and sub catchment related environmental factors for the variation in species local composition e g hopkins and burr 2009 esselman and allan 2010 using exploratory data analysis techniques however domisch et al 2013 studied the effects of the extent of the modelled area stream network vs landscape and the choice of predictors on sdms of stream macroinvertebrates as the lack of data constrains freshwater conservation strategies in many regions of the world in particular less developed countries catchment scale data hold great promise where fine grain survey data on freshwater species occurrence or environmental factors are unavailable our study aims to accommodate the need for clarity on the predictive performance of freshwater sdms based on catchment scale data i e for sdms lacking fine grain survey data given the current threats to freshwater biodiversity including high anthropogenic stress levels habitat fragmentation climate change woodward et al 2010 markovic et al 2017 and the tremendous efforts for improvements knowler et al 2004 bernhardt et al 2005 it is of fundamental importance to understand what environmental factors at what spatial scales grain size are suitable predictors of which freshwater species distributions the grain size change is based on the most widely used hierarchical catchment ordering the strahler system strahler 1964 strahler order reflects the hierarchical level of each reach in the whole river network with 1st order assigned to all reaches with no tributaries 2nd order to the confluences of two first order reaches and so on we focus on the reach scale here the catchment area of the river reach where an occurrence of the freshwater fish was observed and the corresponding 2nd to 5th order catchments following the catchment

danube river basin the aims of the present study are 1 to test whether there is a decrease in the performance of sdms with coarsening grain size i e catchment order and 2 to quantify what environmental factors at what catchment orders are important predictors of which fish species distributions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the danube is europe s second largest river basin 801 463 km2 and is shared among more than 80 million people from 19 countries it extends from central europe through the balkans and drains to the black sea fig a 1 the danube river delta is one of the world s largest wetlands rich in rare fauna and flora and inscribed on unesco s world heritage list in 1991 due to its large spatial extent and diverse relief the danube river basin also shows great differences in climate the summed annual precipitation ranges from more than 2300 mm in the high mountains to less than 400 mm in the delta region while the mean annual discharge reaches 6460 m3s 1 at the danube delta in romania icpdr 2009 the danube river basin hosts over 2000 plant species 40 mammals species and approximately 100 fish species and is subject to increasing pressure including pollution from agriculture industry and municipalities icpdr 2009 2 2 environmental data choice of environmental factors was based on recent studies of fish species distributions buisson et al 2008 lassalle et al 2010 markovic et al 2012 isaak et al 2017 to provide information on the performance of freshwater sdms at multiple scales and in particular for the potential applications where fine resolution survey data are not available all environmental data were gathered from publicly available databases a total of 22 environmental variables emerged representing topographic climatic and anthropogenic effects on ecosystems table 1 topographic data were extracted from the ccm2 pan european catchments database ccm version 2 1 de jager and vogt 2010 climatic data were extracted from the worldclim 30 arc second approx 1 km 1 km gridded information hijmans et al 2007 as a measure of anthropogenic pressure we used land cover information extracted from the corine land cover database eea 2011 and the number of inhabitants per area population based on the global rural urban mapping project grump version1 available at http sedac ciesin columbia edu gpw accessed on 10 11 2018 although different aspects of the hydrologic regime such as flow magnitude frequency timing and variability may impair ecological success of particular life stages of freshwater species domisch et al 2015 markovic et al 2017 the availability of the discharge data is restricted even in the developed countries the hydrologic predictors were not used as the aim of the study was to undertake performance assessment for sdms that lacked fine grain survey data 2 3 hierarchical catchment orders the analyses and modelling were conducted for five different catchment orders watershed order wso1 to wso5 fig a 1 based on the strahler order of the river reaches from the ccm2 pan european catchments database ccm version 2 1 de jager and vogt 2010 the 1st order catchments wso1 were defined according to the drainage areas of the individual river reaches while higher order catchments wso2 wso5 result from groupings of the lower order catchments in a hierarchical way the wso1 to wso5 nomenclature originated from the ccm2 pan european catchments database and was kept here for consistency catchment order increase was reflected in an increasing catchment size with an average ranging from 12 km2 for the wso1 to 2148 km2 for the wso5 for each wso environmental factors were calculated by averaging gridded data across the corresponding catchment areas fig a 1 2 4 fish data species occurrence data for the danube river basin were provided by biofresh www freshwaterplatform eu schinegger et al 2016 for 1364 sites fig a 1 fisheries data were sampled by either single pass or double pass electrofishing between 1985 and 2002 to ensure an accurate estimate of the species distributions only species with a minimum of 50 occurrences at the largest analysed scale the wso5 were included into the analysis cf coudon and gégout 2007 eight fish species were included in the study and ecological characterization followed kottelat and freyhof 2007 the bleak alburnus alburnus is a small cyprinid and prefers open waters of lakes and medium to large rivers the stone loach barbatula barbatula is usually found in medium sized rivers with gravel to stone bottom barbus barbus is a fish of the cyprinid family preferably inhabiting faster flowing summer warm medium to large sized rivers gudgeons of the genus gobio here represented by gobio obtusirostris are riverine cyprinids too which tolerate in contrast to barbels lower flow velocities and finer spawning substrates the bullhead cottus gobio inhabits cold clear and fast flowing water of small streams to medium sized rivers the roach rutilus rutilus is a small fish of the cyprinid family mainly found in nutrient rich large to medium sized lowland rivers and backwaters the trout salmo trutta is a species of salmonid fish preferring cold well oxygenated streams in the mountainous areas the chub squalius cephalus is a fish of the cyprinid family found in slow flowing lowland rivers very small mountain streams and in large streams of barbel zone for each of the five wsos fish occurrence data were aggregated to presence absence information hereafter called catchment scale mapping the final number of catchments of each particular order and their spatial arrangement was thus directly constrained by fish data availability with the wso increase the number of catchments under consideration decreased from 1363 for the wso1 to 126 for the wso5 with a corresponding increase in species prevalence table 2 we note here that because of the dendritic structure of river networks catchment scale mapping is more appropriate for freshwater species than the point to grid mapping used for mapping terrestrial species occurrences see fagan 2002 in addition given that catchments serve as units for freshwater management and conservation commonly referred to as the catchment based approach caba see defra 2013 catchment scale mapping of freshwater species occurrences ensures compatibility between the management and the analysis scales lévêque et al 2008 markovic et al 2017 2 5 data analysis and modelling univariate strength of the environmental predictor variables was quantified using the weight of evidence woe and information value iv concepts as implemented in the r r development core team 2018 library information larsen 2016 while woe describes the relationship between a predictor variable x environmental predictors listed in table 1 and a binary dependent variable y here species occurrence in a particular catchment information value measures the strength of the y x relationship specifically if b i i 1 k denote k discrete bins for the predictor x then the strength of the predictor in describing y can be quantified as i p x b i y 1 p x b i y 0 w o e i cf larsen 2016 as such information value is suitable for the initial predictor selection i e for comparing the predictive power of the environmental factors the information value was used to reduce the parameter number used in the modelling and thus avoid possible overfitting specifically among several strongly correlated parameters with pairwise correlations above 0 75 the parameter with the largest information values was used in the modelling species distribution modelling was performed using generalized additive models gam r library gam hastie 2005 gam is a non parametric extension of generalized linear methods and is widely used for modelling current and future distribution patterns of fish species previous investigations using various sdms have shown that gam glm generalized linear models and regression tree based sdms have similar validation performance the first two kinds of models had also similar calibration performance while regression tree based sdms tended to overfit during the calibration phase markovic et al 2012 the improved performance of consensus or ensemble methods in providing more accurate and robust projections of species distribution have been already demonstrated marmion et al 2009 buisson et al 2010 lauzeral et al 2013 however the main objective of this study was determining the effect and importance of variation in spatial scale rather than the performance of different sdms moreover gams are very flexible models and in contrast to the majority of sdms have well performance at high collinearity dormann et al 2013 therefore we focussed only on gam based sdms but acknowledge the importance of using multiple sdms when the study goal is predicting future species distribution patterns see markovic et al 2012 meller et al 2014 species occurrence probabilities resulting from gam application were transformed to presence absence information using the thresholds which maximize both sensitivity the true positive rate and the specificity the true negative rate we applied random splitting of the fish data ten times into calibration 70 and validation 30 i e each of the ten models was calibrated using a different 70 data sample and validated using the remaining 30 the repetitive modelling procedure allowed for quantifying the uncertainty of the estimates agreement between the observed and modelled species distribution patterns was quantified by sensitivity and specificity while the performance of the calibrated models was estimated using the area under the receiver operator curve auc and the true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 the use of the different statistical measures here sensitivity specificity auc and tss was necessary to ensure that sensitivities of the individual measures to prevalence and scale see lobo et al 2008 were not misleading an auc of 0 5 and a tss of 0 indicate that a model has no discriminatory power while an auc or tss of 1 indicate that presences and absences are perfectly discriminated the search for a parsimonious model involved analyses of the model improvement based on the akaike information criterion aic through simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection to quantify the relative predictor importance the variance partitioning method by lindeman et al 1980 implemented within the r library relaimpo grömping 2006 was used the advantage of the variance partitioning method by lindeman et al 1980 is that it considers sequential sums of squares over all predictor permutations and thus considers the inter correlation effects among the individual predictors with high predictor relative importance not necessarily implying causation 3 results 3 1 information value and correlations the mean catchment elevation altitude manifested the highest univariate strength in describing distributions of the studied fish species across the studied spatial scales table a 1 and fig a 2f specifically for wso1 wso2 and wso5 altitude had by far the highest information value iv and at wso4 the second highest at wso3 eight predictors including altitude had almost equally high iv consequently altitude had to be retained as the predictor at all scales while predictors with either marginal iv length pseason grassland and pastures or extremely high correlations 0 99 to 0 93 with altitude slope gradient anntmean anntmax taprsep tmaiaug and wetttmean were omitted from the analyses for parsimony reasons table a 1 and fig a 2 it is noteworthy that the pairwise correlation between altitude and several variables describing temperature anntmean anntmax taprsep tmaiaug and wetttmean increased with scale the remaining temperature variables trange mean iv 0 52 and tseason mean iv 1 21 table a 1 however were included in order to account for direct temperature effects and not solely indirect given by the often used temperature surrogate altitude whereby correlations between altitude and trange as well as tseason were still high for catchment scales above wso2 0 90 to 0 74 e g fig a 3 we note that gams are very flexible models and still have well performance at high collinearity for wso1 and wso2 however pairwise correlations of these variables with altitude were below 0 75 0 74 to 0 54 mean information values of further climatic variables i e pmaiaug paprsep and annpmean were close to each other 1 30 1 42 table a 1 high pairwise correlations among the three precipitation parameters and a lower correlation for wso1 wso5 between annpmean and each of the already chosen variables especially altitude led to the exclusion of paprsep and pmaiaug a low mean information value led also to the exclusion of the last precipitation variable pseason 0 43 table a 1 among the anthropogenic variables the area under row crops rowcrops emerged as the most valuable in describing distributions of the studied fish species the high correlation between rowcrops and the second most valuable anthropogenic variable agriculture 0 78 0 95 e g fig a 3 has led to the omission of agriculture while the remaining anthropogenic variables builtup forest and population were included in the final variable set because of low pairwise correlations among the included variables and high information values within the anthropogenic category the variables grassland and pastures were excluded due to low information values table a 1 the final variable set consequently consisted of the topographic variable altitude the climatic variables trange tseason and annpmean and the anthropogenic variables rowcrops forest builtup and population fig 1 and table a 2 3 2 model performance using the selected eight predictor variables table a 2 we pursued two distinct model fitting approaches across all catchment scales and species modelling species distributions with gam by a keeping the predictor number n 8 constant across the scales and b using simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection in order to obtain a parsimonious model when keeping all predictors across all scales the overall validation performance was highly accurate with a mean auc of 0 88 and a mean tss of 0 63 across all catchment scales and species table a 3 similar results held for the models with simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection where a mean validation auc of 0 88 and a mean validation tss of 0 62 table 3 were obtained the highest performance values for both model fitting approaches were observed for s trutta at wso4 auc 0 98 table 3 and table a 3 overall when coarsening the grain size i e increasing catchment order both a slight model degradation and a slight model improvement was observed figs a 4 and a 5 in addition the increasing catchment order was accompanied by an uncertainty increase manifested by an increase in the standard deviation of the validation sensitivity specificity auc and tss figs 2 and a 6 3 3 predictor importance per species and catchment order predictor importance patterns varied across species and catchment orders figs 3 and 4 table a 4 a 5 fig a 7 a 14 high variation throughout species is shown in fig 3 by high standard deviations for all variables for both model fitting approaches and all species highest predictor importance was distributed among the variables altitude 20 1 37 tseason 13 5 22 5 annpmean 14 1 27 5 and rowcrops 4 3 25 3 fig 3 in general lowest predictor importance was present for trange forest builtup and population however trange was shown to have an increasing overall mean importance with increasing catchment order 5 1 13 4 and forest an overall nearly constant importance across all scales at around 10 both inferred from the first model fitting approach which kept the predictor number constant using simultaneous forward and backward predictor selection implied a mean predictor importance below 9 for the four least important variables across all scales fig 3 trends in the predictor importance for the four most important variables across the five catchment orders varied depending on whether the predictors were kept constant across scales or automatically selected the first approach identified a downward trend of the importance for altitude with increasing scale whereas the second approach delineated an increasing importance with increasing scale trends of predictor importance along the studied scales inferred from both approaches were similar for tseason which could be described by an upward trend whereas the importance for wso4 and wso5 deduced from the second approach was higher both model fitting approaches assigned high importance to annpmean from wso1 to wso4 and lower importance at wso5 the second approach however showed greater variation for annpmean the predictor importance of rowcrops for both approaches revealed highest explanation power at local scales and lower importance at wso4 and wso5 fig 3 overall at least one variable of the three considered categories topographic climatic anthropogenic respectively was identified as important in describing fish species distributions on the single species level most important variables consisted in general of a subset of the overall identified four most important variables altitude tseason annpmean rowcrops fig 4 tables a 4 and a 5 fig a 7 a 14 few exceptions were for example b barbus or g obtusirostris where higher predictor importance with increasing scale of trange for the first model fitting approach was observable figs a 9 and a 11 moreover some of the four most important predictors were only selected at certain catchment orders as such tseason as explanatory variable for the distribution of b barbus had a predictor importance above 10 only for wso4 and wso5 whereas for wso2 and wso3 the variable was not selected as predictor fig 4a and table a 5 however altitude was dominating the predictor importance pattern of b barbus from wso1 to wso5 and the distribution of b barbus at the local levels wso1 to wso3 was strongly influenced by rowcrops fig 4a and table a 5 this pattern was also identified by the first modelling approach fig a 9a and table a 4 in addition the anthropogenic variable population here generally identified as variable with low importance had an importance of 26 8 at wso4 for models with automatic predictor selection such occasional high importance of variables with generally low importance could also be observed for other considered species for g obtusirostris altitude tseason annpmean and rowcrops emerged as the key factors figs 4b and a 11 and tables s4 and s5 similarly for s trutta altitude tseason annpmean and rowcrops were most often selected as predictors across all scales figs 4c and a 13 and tables s4 and s5 4 discussion the majority of models of fish distribution patterns across the studied spatial scales were highly accurate for both used model fitting approaches the negligible effect of the catchment order on the mean performance of freshwater sdms is in line with the results of guisan et al 2007 who have shown that coarsening study grain size through grid cell size increase does not have substantial effects on the performance of terrestrial sdms however our study additionally shows that the variance of the validation performance measures increases with increasing scale the high accuracy of the sdms across all studied catchment orders confirms the overall appropriateness of the considered environmental factors and is also a reflection of the predictive ability of the applied statistical methodology i e gam as such we note that adding new parameters to our models would rather result in an overfitting than in a meaningful improvement in the model accuracy when looking at the predictive ability of each individual environmental factor the topographic variable altitude the climatic variables tseason and annpmean and the anthropogenic variable rowcrops tend to be the most important predictors irrespective whether or not an automatic predictor selection was used altitude which can be seen as a surrogate for temperature and climatic factors are well known to influence fish species distributions e g kuemmerlen et al 2014 the identification of rowcrops as important predictor aligns with previous studies stressing the importance of surrounding landscape on the in stream ecosystem structure and function fausch et al 2002 linke et al 2008 the link between the area covered by rowcrops and fish distribution patterns was argued by strayer et al 2003 as high nitrate flux leading to a high level of aquatic plant cover which in turn leads to low fish species richness similarly intensely used crop lands with its bare soils free of weeds suffer from surface erosion and thus provide a continuous source of fine sediments leading to clogging and siltation of coarse substrates followed by the decline of gravel spawning riverine fish species soulsby et al 2001 lapointe et al 2004 greig et al 2005 jensen et al 2009 overall our results especially the differences in predictor importance trends across scales of the two approaches and the corresponding variable selection suggest species dependent selection of factors describing species distributions paired with appropriate monitoring of effects and management of mitigation activities tailored to ensure species long term persistence the relative importance of the factors used to describe species distribution patterns is known to vary across spatial scales jackson et al 2001 blackburn and gaston 2002 tudesque et al 2014 at the same time the relative importance of the spatial scale and the environmental factors used in species distribution modelling is largely determined by a combination of species range and species prevalence hopkins and burr 2009 our results indicate that for b barbus the relative importance of anthropogenic pressure manifested by rowcrops population and builtup is similar to or higher than the importance of the considered three climatic factors b barbus is known to be especially sensitive to damming river regulation and fine sediment input indicating that the results of the sdms well align with the ecological classification of this species kottelat and freyhof 2007 also b barbus seems more susceptible to the effects of land use on water quality and spawning habitat than s trutta which has similar environmental requirements however this seeming relation simply results from higher cumulative anthropogenic pressure at the lower elevated river reaches preferably colonised by barbel this is further confirmed by the finding that the influence of rowcrops at local scales better describes the distribution of gudgeons of the genus gobio which prefer cold and clean water our finding of the dominant role of climatic variables in shaping distribution patterns of the fish species studied for all catchment orders contradicts the suggestions that climate related factors may be good predictors of species distributions only at the macro scale e g pearson and dawson 2003 however for robust conclusions to be made further integrated climate impact modelling would be needed although it contributes significantly to the understanding of freshwater fish patterns at various scales our modelling framework has a number of limitations one limiting aspect of our study framework lies in the fact that the selected set of catchment orders and the predictor dataset used do not account for the effects of spatial arrangements of local habitats and spatial autocorrelation effects as well as habitat peculiarities with respect to species requirements at different life stages specifically proximal environment experienced by a species is not necessarily reflected in the geographic scales used to calculate the environmental factors as such the probability of species occurrence resulting from the calibrated models provides the information on the potential habitat suitability of catchments at different hierarchical levels this suitability does not consider the accessibility of habitats required for particular life stages or temporal resource availability and adequateness another weakness is the use of multi decadal averages of climatic factors in the model calibration process climate information for the last 30 50 years may not adequately reflect species environmental tolerance ranges moreover the tolerance limits are rarely rigidly fixed as they might depend on lifetime experience the developmental stage of individuals within species and the combined effect of various abiotic and biotic factors consequently in order to account for temporal and spatial aspects of species distribution patterns researchers will need to disentangle species information according to life stages the life strategy and temporal mismatch of predictors to response as well as environmental information according to temporal variability scales of the physical processes governing individual environmental properties time space and hierarchical level are the fundamental axes of scale and since many physical and ecological phenomena are related in space versus time wu and li 2006 temporal information should be accounted for in models of species distributions see also soranno et al 2014 5 conclusion coarsening study grain size through catchment order increase are shown to be of minor influence on the mean performance of freshwater fish sdms however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale we highlight the importance of using anthropogenic effects as population and land cover related predictors when addressing species sensitive to pollution such as b barbus specifically our results indicate that the model complexity and the importance assigned to environmental drivers of fish distributions are both catchment order dependent and species dependent the latter emphasises importance of compatibility between the scale of factor importance and species conservation management scale with the current threat to freshwater biodiversity and lack of information on which to base freshwater conservation strategies in many regions of the world in particular less developed countries our results have useful implications for predicting distributions of species and conservation planning in areas where fine grain survey data on species occurrence are unavailable in particular our results indicate that the use of broader scale species and environmental data i e up to wso5 catchment scale data does not significantly affect the performance of sdms we remind here that the ecological scales of relevance of species and environmental variables should be matched hurlbert and jetz 2007 although the increased availability of high resolution environmental data is tempting towards studying species distributions at finer resolutions than the species survey data to avoid misleading conservation assessments in addition in view of the extreme global pressure of climate change on freshwater ecosystems and the importance of the climatic factors on distribution patterns of the studied freshwater fish species even at the smallest studied scale reach scale our findings underline the necessity of efforts to continuously re assess the potential effects of climate change on suitability of catchments for freshwater fish species given the high vulnerability of freshwater ecosystems paired with limited dispersal ability of strictly aquatic species such as fish addressing environmental effects across multiple spatial and temporal scales is central to effective species conservation and timely identification of potentially detrimental
