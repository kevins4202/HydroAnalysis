4435,river regulation is challenging when there is diverse upstream and downstream interest leading to regional and international conflict however quantifying the upstream downstream flow regime changes and their causes are given less consideration in the river basin in this study we presented three new ratios for downstream upstream low flow contribution dul downstream upstream high flow contribution ratio duh and meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd for an integrated assessment of flow regime alteration across the river basin to test the methods we compared flow regime alteration upstream and downstream in the ceyhan basin in central turkey which was significantly modified by agriculture between 1984 and 2018 the irrigated area increased 2 8 fold rainfed farming decreased by 67 6 our analysis revealed a clear change in the contribution of low and high flow seasons to annual flow in the last station of the river at misis after 1984 but no considerable change in upstream tributaries in the last decade 2005 2014 and the second half 1995 2014 of the study the frequency of hydrological droughts increased while meteorological droughts followed a stationary pattern evaluation of the impact of anthropogenic activities on river regime by comparing flow regime characteristics after 1984 with those from 1975 to 1984 as post and pre impact periods revealed low to incipient impact upstream hanköy karaahmet and kadirli river headwaters severe impact below the aslantaş dam in the basin center and moderate impact at the last station on the ceyhan river the new metrics provide supplementary information on the flow regime alteration in the basin and can be introduced as a novel quantitative measure to recognize the driving factor of droughts keywords

and euphrates torabi haghighi et al 2020b and indus akhter 2015 has altered the lowland flow and led to significant impacts on ecosystems navigation fisheries and agriculture alterations in attributes of the flow regime including magnitude frequency duration and timing bejarano et al 2017 can be amplified by superimposing stressors such as climate change dam construction and land use land cover change qi et al 2020 such changes in the flow regime can occur on an hourly to annual scale ashraf et al 2018 dam construction and land use change mainly influences the flow regime in the lower parts of the river while climate change can impact the flow regime in the entire basins thus flow regime alteration may not occur uniformly throughout the whole basin but the impacts inevitably increase from upstream to downstream ashraf and hanif ur rehman 2019 fazel et al 2017 munia et al 2018 piliouras and kim 2019 understanding the spatial impacts on upstream to downstream flow regimes is crucial for addressing many water resources management problems e g sediment load fish migration and water allocation developing the indices and approaches to quantify the impact of climate variability dam and hydropower construction and land use change to address the flow regime alteration from upstream to downstream can help decision makers and water resources planners to make informed decisions for the future this study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the upstream downstream flow regime alteration in a river basin the questions addressed by this paper include 1 to what extent can we quantify the impact of climate variability and anthropogenic activity on flow regime characteristics from upstream to downstream in a river basin 2 how can the changes in extreme flow characteristics be quantified from upstream to downstream 3 is there any association between hydrological and meteorological droughts from upstream to downstream to reply to these questions we developed three new ratios i downstream upstream low flow contribution ratio dul ii downstream upstream high flow contribution ratio duh and iii meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd combining these new ratios will lead to an integrated flow regime analysis across the basin these approaches were tested using the ceyhan river basin case in turkey the results obtained were compared with the river impact ri method torabi haghighi et al 2014 many previous studies have examined the impact of dam construction on the mediterranean climate system altın et al 2020 ludwig et al 2009 sadaoui et al 2018 schneider et al 2013 however there is a lack of knowledge on the impacts of dam construction combined with land use change on headwaters central reaches and downstream parts of the ceyhan river which flows to the eastern mediterranean sea altın et al 2020 isola et al 2017 in the semi arid or sub humid mediterranean climate zone hydrological processes vary widely in time and space due to high variabilities in precipitation regime the influence of topography and the spatial distribution of soil types and land use moussa et al 2007 thus statistical impact assessment is more convenient cost effective and time efficient in these regions the ceyhan delta is severely affected by flow regime alteration resulting from dam construction with the southern part of the delta being particularly affected ataol 2016 the largest dam above the delta the aslantaş dam has an important effect in preventing sediment arrival in the delta before construction of this dam in 1984 the annual sediment load in the ceyhan river was 5 5 million tons producing an important coastal ecosystem at the mouth of the river with nested coastal dunes lagoons swamps and marshes flanking the river outlet aksu et al 1992 isola et al 2017 in this study we assessed flow regime alteration upstream and downstream in the ceyhan basin using 40 years of flow and precipitation data 1975 2014 from five gauging stations on the ceyhan river we divided the data into four decades for analysis of temporal changes based on dam construction history in the basin we applied trend analysis to precipitation and river discharge data to distinguish between climate based and anthropogenic causes of change in stream flow during the 40 year study period 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and history of river regulation the ceyhan river basin 20 670 km2 in central turkey falls within the eastern mediterranean climate region fig 1 a the basin borders the seyhan river basin in the west northwest the asi basin in the south and the euphrates basin in the east northeast annual flow in the ceyhan river is around 7 18 km3 representing 4 of total river flow in turkey agrin 1999 the river is 509 km long and runs from the nurhak mountainsin the easterntaurus mountainrange to the north 2000 2500 m above sea level masl and flows southwest to the mediterranean sea near the city of adana the numerous streams and reservoirs of ceyhan river have allowed for rapid development of the local economy industries in the region have expanded rapidly in recent years especially the textile metallurgy food and chemical industries resulting in intensive use of water resources the average population density in the region is 70 inhabitants per square kilometer and 54 of the population lives in urban areas tanrıverdi et al 2010 agriculture in the basin is affected by drought as are other sectors such as urban water supply tourism energy production transportation and the environment gumus and algin 2017 ceyhan river regulation fig 1c and table 1 started in 1971 with construction of the mehmetli dam on the kesiksu river a western tributary of the ceyhan followed by dams on two other tributaries of the in eastern parts of the basin in 1972 aksu river kartalkaya dam point 10 on fig 1b and western kilgen river kozan dam point 13 on fig 1b fig 1 the main regulation practices 83 of total reservoir capacity of the ceyhan basin was carried out in the period 1984 2002 with construction of six major dams on the main corridor of the ceyhan and göksun rivers aslantaş 1984 menzelet 1989 sir 1991 berke 1999 kılavuzlu 2001 adatepe 2002 the process of river regulation was continued with dam construction on the basin s headwaters ayvalı 2005 kandil 2013 sarıgüzel 2013 to evaluate flow regime alteration from headwater to the mouth of the ceyhan river we used data from five selected gauging stations table 2 and fig 1b hanköy and karaahmet stations on highland tributaries söğütlü and göksun kadirli station on a lowland tributary sonboz and aslantaş and misis stations on the main corridor of the ceyhan river in the center and outlet of the basin respectively to assess the impact of regulation on a temporal scale the 40 years of available flow and precipitation data was divided into four 10 year sub periods 1975 1984 p1 1985 1994 p2 1995 2004 p3 and 2005 2014 p4 and two 20 year sub periods 1975 1994 h1 and 1995 2014 h2 the first of these 1975 1984 was considered the pre impact period as less than 8 of total reservoir capacity was constructed in this period table 1 and fig 1c the low and high flow durations in different periods vary from upstream to downstream figs s1 s4 in supplementary material sm for example for the whole period 1975 2014 for the downstream at misis fig s4 in sm december may has higher contribution high flow duration in annual flow while in the upstream at hanköy and karaahmet figs s1 and s2 in sm it is from january to june 2 2 methodology to evaluate upstream downstream flow regime alteration in the basin flow regime characteristics were analyzed at available stations from headwaters to the mouth of the ceyhan river in the mediterranean sea two possible causes of flow regime alteration natural phenomena and anthropogenic activities were assessed based on precipitation trend analysis land use change analysis and the history of river modification the full analysis of the basin comprised five steps i precipitation and flow trend analysis ii determination of upstream downstream alterations in the contribution of high and low flow seasons to annual flow iii determination of the incidence of upstream downstream meteorological and hydrological droughts in the ceyhan basin iv river regime impact analysis v land use land cover change analysis 2 2 1 precipitation and flow trend analysis to analyze the temporal hydro climatological status of the ceyhan basin trends and variations in mean annual and monthly precipitation and discharge were calculated trends in these parameters were evaluated using the mann kendall m k gilbert 1987 kendall 1975 mann 1945 based on the correlation between ranks of elements of a time series e g x xk k 1 2 n and is defined as 1 s i j s g n x j x i where 2 s g n x j x i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 x i x j the significance of trends can be tested by comparing the standardized variable z with the standardized normal variate at the desired significance level α 3 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 4 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 if abs z 1 96 the time series has a significant trend at a 95 significance level α 0 05 the positive or negative sign of the trend is revealed by the sign of β sen s slope 5 β m e d i a n x j x i j i w h e n i j 2 2 2 upstream downstream alterations in the contribution of high and low flow seasons to annual flow to determine the contribution of high and low flow seasons to annual flow we developed a matlab matlab 2019 code to extract the mean low and high flow for different durations as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 months for each year at all stations then for each period we calculated the percentage contributions of low flow and high flow seasons to annual flow based on the calculated percentages we developed the following two ratios to evaluate downstream upstream du changes in the contribution of low l and high h flow season to annual flow 6 dul clf do i clf up i 7 duh chf do i chf up i where dul is the ratio of contribution of low flow duration in downstream to upstream areas duh is the ratio of contribution of high flow duration in downstream to upstream areas clfdoi and clfupi are the contribution of low flow duration to annual flow downstream and upstream respectively and chfdoi and chfupi are the contribution of high flow to annual flow downstream and upstream respectively the ratios were calculated for different consecutive durations of low flow and high flow ranging from i 1 to 6 months for instance for i 3 we looked for the three consecutive months making the maximum and minimum contribution chf and clf to annual flow in each sub period or the whole period defining the wet and dry durations does not follow an explicit rule and was not specified for the study area therefore we examined different durations 1 6 months to cover all possible wet and dry spells to further understand flow regime alteration it is worth mentioning the duh and dul can be calculated for any pair of points in the basin that i have a flow record in the same period and ii have one of the points placed below another one this study considered the first available gauge in headwater karaahmet hanköy kardiliri of the ceyhan basin as upstream gauges and the last station misis in the basin as downstream ones we can develop a duh or dul spatial map across the basin if several gauges are upstream to downstream the gauge from the middle of the basin can be considered a downstream station for headwater tributaries or considered the upstream station for the lower station 2 2 3 upstream downstream meteorological and hydrological droughts in the ceyhan basin as precipitation is the main driver of river runoff if the frequency of hydrological droughts varies in line with meteorological droughts in different periods it can be concluded that the basin is less affected by human intervention torabi haghighi et al 2020b therefore the ratio between the number of years with hydrological and meteorological drought in upstream and downstream was used as an indicator for assessing upstream downstream change 8 m h d no md no hd where mhd is meteorological hydrological drought ratio and nomd and nohd are the number of meteorological and hydrological drought events in each period to calculate nomd and nohd we considered the number of negative phases of standardized precipitation index spi and streamflow drought index sdi developed by mckee et al 1993 and nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 respectively spi and sdi are derived from precipitation and discharge respectively and for both a negative value is considered to indicate meteorological and hydrological drought both indices are well known and have been applied in many cases in different climates globally diani et al 2019 torabi haghighi et al 2020d hsin fu yeh and chang 2019 details of the calculations for spi are available in mckee et al 1993 and for sdi in nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 although the two methods propose different drought categories from mild to extreme here we have only considered the number of drought years when the values of spi and sdi are below zero mckee et al 1993 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 2 2 4 flow regime impact ri the impact on river flow can be seen as changes in river flow magnitude timing and intra annual flow variability such changes were quantified here by developing the impact factors mif magnitude impact factor tif timing impact factor and vif variation impact factor torabi haghighi et al 2014 see fig s5 in sm for the concepts behind these factors dams can change one or more of these factors depending on their purposes combined river impact factor ri considers all these three major impacts as 9 ri m i f t i f v i f the value of ri varies between 1 natural river flow and 0 completely changed river flow the ri index range is defined by five different impact classes where a value of 0 8 1 0 represents a low impact less than20 alteration in flow regime characteristics 0 6 0 8 an incipient impact 0 4 0 6 a moderate impact 0 2 0 4 a severe impact and 0 0 0 2 a drastic impact greater than80 alteration in river flow regime based on the terms in eq 9 a graphical chart can be produced to visualize river flow impact fig s1 magnitude impact factor is calculated as 10 m i f a f p o s t a f p r e where afpre and afpost are mean annual flow in the pre impact and post impact period respectively for a specific gauging station variation impact factor quantifies the variation in the hydrograph as 11 vif 50 0 5 i rr 100 12 i rr r r i pre rri pos rri pre 100 where rripre and rripos are the river regime index rri in the pre change and post change periods respectively torabi haghighi and kløve 2013 details of rri calculation can be found in torabi haghighi and kløve 2013 timing impact factor takes into account shifts in the maximum minimum and 50 of the discharge cumulative density function torabi haghighi et al 2014 13 tif 50 0 247 t f 100 14 tf dt max dt min dt median 3 where dtmax dtmin and dtmedian are the time shifts in monthly maximum discharge monthly minimum discharge and cdf50 timing value respectively 2 2 5 land use change analysis in addition to river regulation land use change can be introduced as another driver of flow regime characteristics indeed it is the leading cause of flow regime change in the regions that are not directly influenced by dams e g upstream of dams therefore to address this reason for flow regime alteration the land use change has been analyzed for this purpose to understand the history of river modification fig 1c in the basin land use maps for two milestones 1985 the start of significant river regulation and 2018 were produced landsat multispectral images were obtained from the usgs dataset to prepare land use maps these consisted of landsat 5 thematic mapper images tm path row 175 035 for 07 06 1985 and landsat 8 operational land image oli path row 175 035 for 28 06 2018 landsat multispectral images encompass seven bands with spatial resolution 30 m for bands 1 5 and band 7 and 120 m for thermal band 6 quick atmospheric correction quac in envi 5 3 was applied for the atmospheric correction of landsat images a necessary step in accurately extracting quantitative information in image pre processing el khoury et al 2015 the fusion supervised classification maximum likelihood algorithm approach and decision tree method were employed to process and classify the landsat images in envi 5 3 pullanikkatil et al 2016 torabi haghighi et al 2018a 3 results 3 1 annual and monthly flow and precipitation trends annual flow analysis for the four gauging stations distributed across the ceyhan basin showed a significant negative trend p 0 05 in the flow regime fig 2 in contrast precipitation at the upstream stations hanköy karaahmet kadirli and the whole basin did not significantly change over the 40 year study period fig 2 no significant change in precipitation and the negative trend in annual flow indicate that the role of anthropogenic activities is greater than natural phenomena on river flow fig 2 a negative and positive tendency not a statistically significant trend in monthly precipitation was observed in 56 and 39 of months respectively at all stations figs s10 s13 in sm three upstream stations karaahmet kadirli and hanköy showed declining flow in all months and had a negative trend from april or may to september or october figs s10 s11 and s12 in sm this period almost matches the low flow duration figs 3ul1 6 s1 s2 s14 and s15 in sm from late spring to early autumn which complies with the high irrigation demand season in contrast at the downstream gauging station misis river flow showed a significant negative and positive trend in high january june and low july september flow duration fig 4dh 4dl s4 and s13 in sm it indicates a decline in flow for the most recognized high flow durations e g in april april may march may february march january march and december march which have 13 0 26 1 37 8 48 6 58 7 and 66 9 contribution to annual flow respectively fig 4 dh1 dh6 conversely the contribution of most low flow durations august august october august november have a positive trend with less than 4 3 9 and 14 contribution to annual flow fig 4 dl1 dl6 this again indicates a more substantial influence of anthropogenic activities i e dam construction and agricultural activities in the downstream part of the basin on the flow regime storing water in high flow season january to june resulting in a negative trend in downstream and releasing it in the low season for irrigation is a usual function of storage dams e g the aslantaş and menzelet dams on the main channel of the ceyhan river 3 2 upstream downstream alteration in high and low flow seasons here we have provided the results for hanköy stations upstream and misis station downstream the contribution analysis for two other headwater stations including kadirli and karaahmet are presented in figs s14 and s15 in sm in headwaters for the ceyhan basin i e hanköy station the contribution of low flow to annual flow was lower than at the outlet of the basin misis station while the contribution of high flow to annual flow was higher fig 3 and table 3 the ratio between the contribution of low flow in downstream and upstream dul for a 1 to 6 month duration was 4 1 3 98 3 44 3 22 2 53 and 2 17 respectively while for high flow duh it was 0 45 0 5 0 56 0 65 0 73 and 0 79 respectively the contribution of a 1 6 month duration of low flow in the highlands of the ceyhan basin upstream of hanköy station was 1 2 2 4 6 2 10 3 and 15 3 of annual flow respectively while in the lower basin misis station it was 4 2 8 7 13 9 19 6 25 8 and 33 1 respectively fig 3 and table 3 note that the contribution analysis for the two other headwater stations kadirli and karaahmet produced similar results as those found for the hanköy station see figs s14 and s15 in sm the impact of river regulation was evident in the contribution of upstream downstream low and high flow duration to annual flow a significant change in dul and duh was observed after the construction of the aslantaş dam in the main corridor of the ceyhan river in 1984 in the period 1975 1984 pre impact period dul varied between 1 37 and 1 64 while it increased to 2 12 5 26 in the period 1985 2015 post impact period table 3 and s17 in sm this means that before regulation the contribution of low flow downstream in annual flow was closer to that upstream while after river regulation it was greater particularly for the 1 4 month low flow seasons table 3 and s17 in sm on a monthly scale the 1 68 contribution of low flow to annual flow downstream misis station before 1984 increased to 5 for 1984 2015 fig 4dl1 this change and impact of regulation on low flow contribution was also seen for other durations with an increase from 3 9 6 6 9 8 13 54 and 20 44 to 10 27 16 29 22 91 29 9 and 37 27 for the 2 3 4 5 and 6 month duration respectively fig 4 dl2 dl6 and table 3 likewise a clear change in the contribution of high flow to annual flow due to river modification was seen downstream at misis station the contribution of high flow to annual flow at misis station changed from 19 85 35 06 49 81 61 17 71 9 and 79 56 before 1984 to 11 92 23 14 33 81 44 36 54 26 and 62 73 after 1984 for the 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 month durations respectively fig 4 dh1 dh6 and table 3 this reflects the function of dams in holding water in high flow season and releasing it during the irrigation season 3 3 upstream downstream meteorological and hydrological droughts over the ceyhan basin the temporal variation of meteorological and hydrological droughts indicates that in 57 and 68 of the study period the spi and sdi had the same direction positive or negative respectively fig s16 in sm in the whole period 1976 2015 the percentage of meteorological and hydrological drought years respectively was 55 and 50 at misis downstream 45 and 45 at kadirli 47 5 and 42 0 at karaahmet and 50 and 42 5 at hanköy in the headwater area thus the percentage of hydrological drought years increased from upstream to downstream areas fig 5 in recent years after 1995 the number of hydrological droughts has increased while the meteorological droughts occurred sporadically fig 5 and fig s16 in sm the mhd ratio for all four stations for the whole period 1976 2015 is close to 1 0 wp fig 5e while it decreased between sub periods fig 5e h1 and h2 p1 p4 from p1 1976 1985 to p4 2006 2015 mhd changed from 6 to 0 28 at hanköy headwaters and from 2 5 to 0 75 at misis river mouth fig 5e this variation was also visible in the second half 1976 1995 h1 compared with the first 1996 2015 h2 from 1 85 to 0 72 at hanköy 1 28 to 0 9 at karaahmet 1 28 to 0 75 at kadirli and 1 22 to 0 64 at misis fig 5e 3 4 spatial and temporal changes in flow regime characteristics based on the change in monthly flow at the different stations and different sub periods fig 6 a river impact index ri was calculated for different gauges including karaahmet hanköy kardiliri aslantaş and misis across the ceyhan basin fig 7 among the four stations the lowest impact was observed at hanköy 1995 2004 fig 6b2 and the highest severe impact fig 7 at aslantaş station after 1995 fig 7 fig 6d2 and 6d3 for more details of mif vif and tif see table s1 in sm due to the influence of aslantaş dam constructed in 1984 with a capacity of 1 15 km3 the ri value in the middle of the basin was 0 41 for the period 1985 1994 in comparison with the pre impact period 1976 1985 and thus the impact was classified as moderate fig 7 with continued regulation of the ceyhan river through the construction of the menzelet dam 1989 1 95 km3 and sir dam 1991 1 12 km3 ri in the mid basin decreased to 0 29 and 0 31 respectively thus the impact status changed to severe for the sub periods 1995 2000 and 2000 2005 fig 7 in different sub periods the results showed low to incipient impact in headwaters hanköy and karaahmet stations and the lowland tributary kadirli station fig 7 at the last station misis ri varied between 0 43 and 0 57 indicating a moderate impact in lower part of the basin fig 7 among the three indices of river flow regime evaluated vif showed the greatest degree of alteration throughout the region table s1 in sm in central and downstream stretches of the river vif decreased dramatically by 50 80 and played a major role in the declining ri index table s1 in sm in contrast the vif decrease was smaller 0 20 at the headwater stations hanköy karaahmet kadirli which were not fully affected by water regulation and withdrawals due to irrigation networks stations on tributaries karaahmet kadirli showed incipient impact due to water regulation as neither mif nor vif declined significantly at those points 3 5 land use change changes in land use and irrigated area in the ceyhan basin in the study period were assessed by comparing the irrigated area in 1985 and 2018 based on image processing from the landsat data four main land use land cover types were identified in the ceyhan river basin irrigated area dry farming rainfed area water bodies and other area land use land cover maps and changes in irrigated area and dry farming area in the basin between 1985 and 2018 are shown in fig 8 the main land use changes in the study period were an increase in irrigated agricultural area in the catchment 76 and a decrease in dry farming area 67 6 in 1985 irrigated and dry farming land each occupied around 56 000 ha over the next 33 years to 2018 irrigated land area increased to 156 000 ha and dry farming area decreased to 18 600 ha the density of irrigated land increased both upstream and downstream which would influence water exploitation across the ceyhan basin 4 discussion there are two major reasons for flow regime alteration natural and anthropogenic haghighi et al 2020d torabi haghighi et al 2020c in pristine basins with low or no anthropogenic interference changes in flow regime are caused solely by natural phenomena and should be distributed uniformly over the basin in basins with heavy water resource use and increasing water consumption over time changes in flow regimes are likely to be dominated by anthropogenic causess as a rule when moving from headwaters towards the lower part of a basin the influence of anthropogenic impacts will be cumulative and consequently the total impact on the flow regime will be higher extreme flows affect several hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes regulation of high flows dampening of floods is important as it reflects the capacity of river basins to retain store water especially during wet seasons rodríguez et al 2018 usually any abrupt change in flow regime e g at the misis station due to reservoir impounding is easily recognisable conversely gradual change e g in the hanköy station due to land use change or overexploitation of gw is challenging to detect in the present study the river flow regimes in upstream and downstream areas of a river basin were compared to help quantify and distinguish between natural and anthropogenic impacts on river flow we have measured the upstream downstream flow regime change by applying three novel ratios dul duh and mhd to the best of our knowledge these indices are the first approaches for integrating the upstream downstream flow regime alteration in the river basin the dul and duh ratios allowed the quantification of the change in extreme flow in the basin in the natural condition minor anthropogenic versus dominant climatic drivers the distribution of low or high flow is uniform across the basin and the magnitude of dul and duh is close to 1 or the difference between these two ratios is minimum table 3 period 1975 1984 this condition indicates that any temporal difference between dul and duh is due to climate change or possible human intervention is uniformly distributed across the basin furthermore any change in these two ratios or an increase in the difference between them can quantify the impact of damming or other human intervention in the river basin for example as human intervention occurs some parts of the high flow will be stored in the reservoir decreasing the duh table 3 and released during low flow duration increase in the dul table 3 to fulfill demands e g irrigation the suggested indices can reveal the overall change across the basin from upstream to downstream beyond the cause of change as seen these two indices can be introduced as the degree of departure from pre impact conditions and helpful in comparing a change over time even if there was an existing intervention furthermore for the basins with unreliable or insufficient flow data from the pre intervention period the range around 1 can be recommended for the baseline value of dul and duh during the pre impact period trend analysis is widely used for the assessment of flow regime alteration e g martínez fernández et al 2013 hammond and fleming 2021 however it did not reveal any differences between upstream and downstream flow regime characteristics two proposed new indices dul and duh can be considered as a supplementary approach for integrated flow regime alteration across the basin as shown annual and monthly trend analysis for the ceyhan basin revealed a significant negative trend in flow regime in all parts of the basin but no significant change in precipitation fig 2 analysis of the contribution of low and high flow seasons to annual flow in order to compare upstream downstream flow regime change revealed no marked change in their relative contributions in upstream areas but a clear shift in their contributions in downstream areas before and after 1984 table 3 and fig 3 before 1984 when intensive regulation of the ceyhan river through dams and hydropower began the difference between high flow and low flow contributions in upstream and downstream areas was lower than in the post impact period 1985 2015 the duh and dul ratio for different decades in the study period quantified the different changes between upstream and downstream areas of the basin in the pre impact 1975 1984 and post impact periods the meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd is another index developed in this study that can help address how the cause of flow regime change is anthropogenic or due to climate variability in addition to standardized precipitation index spi as a well known measure for analyzing the meteorological droughts e g irannezhad et al 2015 zaki et al 2020 the streamflow drought index sdi is a robust tool for examining changes in flow magnitude at different points in a river basin nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 kim et al 2021 if the variation in sdi follows that of standardized precipitation index spi precipitation is the leading influencer of flow regime characteristics conflicting patterns of variation in spi and sdi indicate a stronger influence of anthropogenic activities than climate on river flow magnitude torabi haghighi et al 2020c zaki et al 2020 to quantify this we developed the mhd ratio which compares the number of drought events negative phases of spi and sdi decreasing the ratio from more than 1 to below 1 in two consecutive periods in the ceyhan basin e g h1 and h2 in fig 4e can demonstrate the impact of dam construction fig 1 c and irrigation development fig 7 in the ceyhan basin after 1984 therefore the mhd can be introduced as a quantitative measure to recognize the driving factor of droughts the land use map for the ceyhan basin fig 7 confirmed that during the study period a significant land use change occurred in the hanköy basin while the irrigation in this area has not been supported by major dams see fig 1 and fig 5 the lowest value of the mhd ratio was observed at hanköy station in the last decade of the study period reflecting the intensive land use change in this area the combined influence of land use and climate change is considered highly important in altering natural flow regimes especially in streams and rivers in southern europe liuzzo et al 2015 sellami et al 2016 agriculture may be responsible for almost 95 of annual water use in a basin panagopoulos et al 2014 with intensive water abstraction governing the pattern of hydrological variability stefanidis et al 2016 it must be pointed that the analysis of annual flow volume alone is insufficient to characterize human intervention on rivers because many ecosystem services e g physical habitat and flood plain are a function of other flow regimes attitude poff 1997 bunn 2002 lytle 2004 therefore the presented matrices mhd dul and duh can be used in this regard the overall impact on river regime in the ceyhan basin based on ri method indicated an incipient or moderate impact at upstream and downstream stations but a severe impact in the middle of the basin after the construction of the main storage dams aslantaş sir menzelet on the main channel of the ceyhan river the ri for headwater showed incipient impact as there was no change in tif and vif since ri m i f t i f v i f due to the absence of storage dams in the headwater area although the impact just below the aslantaş dam was severe the ri at the misis station was 0 45 0 57 indicating a moderate impact at that river outlet station the apparent recovery from severe at aslantaş to moderate at misis was due to two main factors first there is no significant reservoir on the river below the aslantaş dam so the runoff generated in the mid basin area between aslantaş and misis an area of around 5787 km2 will add to river flow in natural conditions second the return flow from irrigated areas becomes secondary extra flow returned to the river flow diminishing the initial impact on river regime the moderate river impact status estimated for the end of the ceyhan river is reasonable as the total constructed reservoir capacity is less than annual flow in the basin for comparison the ri value at the end of the highly regulated euphrates river to the immediate east of the ceyhan basin is below 0 20 and the impact has been classified as drastic torabi haghighi et al 2020b compared with the ri index the new metrics provide supplementary information on the flow regime alteration in the basin the ri indices only deal with the annual flow in terms of magnitude while the dul and duh focus on the extreme flow low and high flow and mhd deals with the frequency of drought occurrences in the study period 5 conclusions anthropogenicchanges in land and water resources unfavorably affect hydrological regimes understanding the hydrological change of rivers is crucial for effective water resources management particularly when there are various water interests in the headwater and lowland areas here we have demonstrated the application of three novel ratios downstream upstream low flow contribution ratio dul downstream upstream high flow contribution ratio duh and meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd for an integrated evaluation of flow regime alteration across the basin this study examined changes in flow regime characteristics from upstream to downstream of the ceyhan river flowing into the eastern mediterranean sea we applied different methods of assessment and found that the results were consistent between these methods and with land use change findings for the basin a severe impact on river flow regime was identified below the aslantaş dam after 1984 reflecting a cumulative impact of that dam constructed in 1984 and other upstream dams e g sir and menzelet constructed in 1989 1991 in comparison with the pre impact period 1975 1984 an incipient impact was observed at headwater stations a considerable change in land use in the last decade of the study period 2005 2015 in the headwater area led to changes in the magnitude of flow only while the variability and timing of flow regime were practically unaffected as there are no storage dams in the headwater area in heavily river regulated downstream areas however there were marked changes in the variability and timing of flow regime in the last decade these findings were confirmed with results obtained using the novel indices for analyzing the downstream upstream du contributions of low l and high h flow to annual flow dul and duh in the analysis using the novel meteorological hydrological drought mhd ratio to compare the number of drought events negative phase of spi and sdi the lowest value was found for the headwater area in the last decade 2005 2015 confirming the impact of recent intensive land use change for irrigation and the change in magnitude of flow in this area the results of the three new ratios were complied with historical land use change and river modification over the ceyhan basin and can be recommended for

4435,river regulation is challenging when there is diverse upstream and downstream interest leading to regional and international conflict however quantifying the upstream downstream flow regime changes and their causes are given less consideration in the river basin in this study we presented three new ratios for downstream upstream low flow contribution dul downstream upstream high flow contribution ratio duh and meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd for an integrated assessment of flow regime alteration across the river basin to test the methods we compared flow regime alteration upstream and downstream in the ceyhan basin in central turkey which was significantly modified by agriculture between 1984 and 2018 the irrigated area increased 2 8 fold rainfed farming decreased by 67 6 our analysis revealed a clear change in the contribution of low and high flow seasons to annual flow in the last station of the river at misis after 1984 but no considerable change in upstream tributaries in the last decade 2005 2014 and the second half 1995 2014 of the study the frequency of hydrological droughts increased while meteorological droughts followed a stationary pattern evaluation of the impact of anthropogenic activities on river regime by comparing flow regime characteristics after 1984 with those from 1975 to 1984 as post and pre impact periods revealed low to incipient impact upstream hanköy karaahmet and kadirli river headwaters severe impact below the aslantaş dam in the basin center and moderate impact at the last station on the ceyhan river the new metrics provide supplementary information on the flow regime alteration in the basin and can be introduced as a novel quantitative measure to recognize the driving factor of droughts keywords

for addressing many water resources management problems e g sediment load fish migration and water allocation developing the indices and approaches to quantify the impact of climate variability dam and hydropower construction and land use change to address the flow regime alteration from upstream to downstream can help decision makers and water resources planners to make informed decisions for the future this study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the upstream downstream flow regime alteration in a river basin the questions addressed by this paper include 1 to what extent can we quantify the impact of climate variability and anthropogenic activity on flow regime characteristics from upstream to downstream in a river basin 2 how can the changes in extreme flow characteristics be quantified from upstream to downstream 3 is there any association between hydrological and meteorological droughts from upstream to downstream to reply to these questions we developed three new ratios i downstream upstream low flow contribution ratio dul ii downstream upstream high flow contribution ratio duh and iii meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd combining these new ratios will lead to an integrated flow regime analysis across the basin these approaches were tested using the ceyhan river basin case in turkey the results obtained were compared with the river impact ri method torabi haghighi et al 2014 many previous studies have examined the impact of dam construction on the mediterranean climate system altın et al 2020 ludwig et al 2009 sadaoui et al 2018 schneider et al 2013 however there is a lack of knowledge on the impacts of dam construction combined with land use change on headwaters central reaches and downstream parts of the ceyhan river which flows to the eastern mediterranean sea altın et al 2020 isola et al 2017 in the semi arid or sub humid mediterranean climate zone hydrological processes vary widely in time and space due to high variabilities in precipitation regime the influence of topography and the spatial distribution of soil types and land use moussa et al 2007 thus statistical impact assessment is more convenient cost effective and time efficient in these regions the ceyhan delta is severely affected by flow regime alteration resulting from dam construction with the southern part of the delta being particularly affected ataol 2016 the largest dam above the delta the aslantaş dam has an important effect in preventing sediment arrival in the delta before construction of this dam in 1984 the annual sediment load in the ceyhan river was 5 5 million tons producing an important coastal ecosystem at the mouth of the river with nested coastal dunes lagoons swamps and marshes flanking the river outlet aksu et al 1992 isola et al 2017 in this study we assessed flow regime alteration upstream and downstream in the ceyhan basin using 40 years of flow and precipitation data 1975 2014 from five gauging stations on the ceyhan river we divided the data into four decades for analysis of temporal changes based on dam construction history in the basin we applied trend analysis to precipitation and river discharge data to distinguish between climate based and anthropogenic causes of change in stream flow during the 40 year study period 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and history of river regulation the ceyhan river basin 20 670 km2 in central turkey falls within the eastern mediterranean climate region fig 1 a the basin borders the seyhan river basin in the west northwest the asi basin in the south and the euphrates basin in the east northeast annual flow in the ceyhan river is around 7 18 km3 representing 4 of total river flow in turkey agrin 1999 the river is 509 km long and runs from the nurhak mountainsin the easterntaurus mountainrange to the north 2000 2500 m above sea level masl and flows southwest to the mediterranean sea near the city of adana the numerous streams and reservoirs of ceyhan river have allowed for rapid development of the local economy industries in the region have expanded rapidly in recent years especially the textile metallurgy food and chemical industries resulting in intensive use of water resources the average population density in the region is 70 inhabitants per square kilometer and 54 of the population lives in urban areas tanrıverdi et al 2010 agriculture in the basin is affected by drought as are other sectors such as urban water supply tourism energy production transportation and the environment gumus and algin 2017 ceyhan river regulation fig 1c and table 1 started in 1971 with construction of the mehmetli dam on the kesiksu river a western tributary of the ceyhan followed by dams on two other tributaries of the in eastern parts of the basin in 1972 aksu river kartalkaya dam point 10 on fig 1b and western kilgen river kozan dam point 13 on fig 1b fig 1 the main regulation practices 83 of total reservoir capacity of the ceyhan basin was carried out in the period 1984 2002 with construction of six major dams on the main corridor of the ceyhan and göksun rivers aslantaş 1984 menzelet 1989 sir 1991 berke 1999 kılavuzlu 2001 adatepe 2002 the process of river regulation was continued with dam construction on the basin s headwaters ayvalı 2005 kandil 2013 sarıgüzel 2013 to evaluate flow regime alteration from headwater to the mouth of the ceyhan river we used data from five selected gauging stations table 2 and fig 1b hanköy and karaahmet stations on highland tributaries söğütlü and göksun kadirli station on a lowland tributary sonboz and aslantaş and misis stations on the main corridor of the ceyhan river in the center and outlet of the basin respectively to assess the impact of regulation on a temporal scale the 40 years of available flow and precipitation data was divided into four 10 year sub periods 1975 1984 p1 1985 1994 p2 1995 2004 p3 and 2005 2014 p4 and two 20 year sub periods 1975 1994 h1 and 1995 2014 h2 the first of these 1975 1984 was considered the pre impact period as less than 8 of total reservoir capacity was constructed in this period table 1 and fig 1c the low and high flow durations in different periods vary from upstream to downstream figs s1 s4 in supplementary material sm for example for the whole period 1975 2014 for the downstream at misis fig s4 in sm december may has higher contribution high flow duration in annual flow while in the upstream at hanköy and karaahmet figs s1 and s2 in sm it is from january to june 2 2 methodology to evaluate upstream downstream flow regime alteration in the basin flow regime characteristics were analyzed at available stations from headwaters to the mouth of the ceyhan river in the mediterranean sea two possible causes of flow regime alteration natural phenomena and anthropogenic activities were assessed based on precipitation trend analysis land use change analysis and the history of river modification the full analysis of the basin comprised five steps i precipitation and flow trend analysis ii determination of upstream downstream alterations in the contribution of high and low flow seasons to annual flow iii determination of the incidence of upstream downstream meteorological and hydrological droughts in the ceyhan basin iv river regime impact analysis v land use land cover change analysis 2 2 1 precipitation and flow trend analysis to analyze the temporal hydro climatological status of the ceyhan basin trends and variations in mean annual and monthly precipitation and discharge were calculated trends in these parameters were evaluated using the mann kendall m k gilbert 1987 kendall 1975 mann 1945 based on the correlation between ranks of elements of a time series e g x xk k 1 2 n and is defined as 1 s i j s g n x j x i where 2 s g n x j x i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 x i x j the significance of trends can be tested by comparing the standardized variable z with the standardized normal variate at the desired significance level α 3 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 4 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 if abs z 1 96 the time series has a significant trend at a 95 significance level α 0 05 the positive or negative sign of the trend is revealed by the sign of β sen s slope 5 β m e d i a n x j x i j i w h e n i j 2 2 2 upstream downstream alterations in the contribution of high and low flow seasons to annual flow to determine the contribution of high and low flow seasons to annual flow we developed a matlab matlab 2019 code to extract the mean low and high flow for different durations as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 months for each year at all stations then for each period we calculated the percentage contributions of low flow and high flow seasons to annual flow based on the calculated percentages we developed the following two ratios to evaluate downstream upstream du changes in the contribution of low l and high h flow season to annual flow 6 dul clf do i clf up i 7 duh chf do i chf up i where dul is the ratio of contribution of low flow duration in downstream to upstream areas duh is the ratio of contribution of high flow duration in downstream to upstream areas clfdoi and clfupi are the contribution of low flow duration to annual flow downstream and upstream respectively and chfdoi and chfupi are the contribution of high flow to annual flow downstream and upstream respectively the ratios were calculated for different consecutive durations of low flow and high flow ranging from i 1 to 6 months for instance for i 3 we looked for the three consecutive months making the maximum and minimum contribution chf and clf to annual flow in each sub period or the whole period defining the wet and dry durations does not follow an explicit rule and was not specified for the study area therefore we examined different durations 1 6 months to cover all possible wet and dry spells to further understand flow regime alteration it is worth mentioning the duh and dul can be calculated for any pair of points in the basin that i have a flow record in the same period and ii have one of the points placed below another one this study considered the first available gauge in headwater karaahmet hanköy kardiliri of the ceyhan basin as upstream gauges and the last station misis in the basin as downstream ones we can develop a duh or dul spatial map across the basin if several gauges are upstream to downstream the gauge from the middle of the basin can be considered a downstream station for headwater tributaries or considered the upstream station for the lower station 2 2 3 upstream downstream meteorological and hydrological droughts in the ceyhan basin as precipitation is the main driver of river runoff if the frequency of hydrological droughts varies in line with meteorological droughts in different periods it can be concluded that the basin is less affected by human intervention torabi haghighi et al 2020b therefore the ratio between the number of years with hydrological and meteorological drought in upstream and downstream was used as an indicator for assessing upstream downstream change 8 m h d no md no hd where mhd is meteorological hydrological drought ratio and nomd and nohd are the number of meteorological and hydrological drought events in each period to calculate nomd and nohd we considered the number of negative phases of standardized precipitation index spi and streamflow drought index sdi developed by mckee et al 1993 and nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 respectively spi and sdi are derived from precipitation and discharge respectively and for both a negative value is considered to indicate meteorological and hydrological drought both indices are well known and have been applied in many cases in different climates globally diani et al 2019 torabi haghighi et al 2020d hsin fu yeh and chang 2019 details of the calculations for spi are available in mckee et al 1993 and for sdi in nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 although the two methods propose different drought categories from mild to extreme here we have only considered the number of drought years when the values of spi and sdi are below zero mckee et al 1993 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 2 2 4 flow regime impact ri the impact on river flow can be seen as changes in river flow magnitude timing and intra annual flow variability such changes were quantified here by developing the impact factors mif magnitude impact factor tif timing impact factor and vif variation impact factor torabi haghighi et al 2014 see fig s5 in sm for the concepts behind these factors dams can change one or more of these factors depending on their purposes combined river impact factor ri considers all these three major impacts as 9 ri m i f t i f v i f the value of ri varies between 1 natural river flow and 0 completely changed river flow the ri index range is defined by five different impact classes where a value of 0 8 1 0 represents a low impact less than20 alteration in flow regime characteristics 0 6 0 8 an incipient impact 0 4 0 6 a moderate impact 0 2 0 4 a severe impact and 0 0 0 2 a drastic impact greater than80 alteration in river flow regime based on the terms in eq 9 a graphical chart can be produced to visualize river flow impact fig s1 magnitude impact factor is calculated as 10 m i f a f p o s t a f p r e where afpre and afpost are mean annual flow in the pre impact and post impact period respectively for a specific gauging station variation impact factor quantifies the variation in the hydrograph as 11 vif 50 0 5 i rr 100 12 i rr r r i pre rri pos rri pre 100 where rripre and rripos are the river regime index rri in the pre change and post change periods respectively torabi haghighi and kløve 2013 details of rri calculation can be found in torabi haghighi and kløve 2013 timing impact factor takes into account shifts in the maximum minimum and 50 of the discharge cumulative density function torabi haghighi et al 2014 13 tif 50 0 247 t f 100 14 tf dt max dt min dt median 3 where dtmax dtmin and dtmedian are the time shifts in monthly maximum discharge monthly minimum discharge and cdf50 timing value respectively 2 2 5 land use change analysis in addition to river regulation land use change can be introduced as another driver of flow regime characteristics indeed it is the leading cause of flow regime change in the regions that are not directly influenced by dams e g upstream of dams therefore to address this reason for flow regime alteration the land use change has been analyzed for this purpose to understand the history of river modification fig 1c in the basin land use maps for two milestones 1985 the start of significant river regulation and 2018 were produced landsat multispectral images were obtained from the usgs dataset to prepare land use maps these consisted of landsat 5 thematic mapper images tm path row 175 035 for 07 06 1985 and landsat 8 operational land image oli path row 175 035 for 28 06 2018 landsat multispectral images encompass seven bands with spatial resolution 30 m for bands 1 5 and band 7 and 120 m for thermal band 6 quick atmospheric correction quac in envi 5 3 was applied for the atmospheric correction of landsat images a necessary step in accurately extracting quantitative information in image pre processing el khoury et al 2015 the fusion supervised classification maximum likelihood algorithm approach and decision tree method were employed to process and classify the landsat images in envi 5 3 pullanikkatil et al 2016 torabi haghighi et al 2018a 3 results 3 1 annual and monthly flow and precipitation trends annual flow analysis for the four gauging stations distributed across the ceyhan basin showed a significant negative trend p 0 05 in the flow regime fig 2 in contrast precipitation at the upstream stations hanköy karaahmet kadirli and the whole basin did not significantly change over the 40 year study period fig 2 no significant change in precipitation and the negative trend in annual flow indicate that the role of anthropogenic activities is greater than natural phenomena on river flow fig 2 a negative and positive tendency not a statistically significant trend in monthly precipitation was observed in 56 and 39 of months respectively at all stations figs s10 s13 in sm three upstream stations karaahmet kadirli and hanköy showed declining flow in all months and had a negative trend from april or may to september or october figs s10 s11 and s12 in sm this period almost matches the low flow duration figs 3ul1 6 s1 s2 s14 and s15 in sm from late spring to early autumn which complies with the high irrigation demand season in contrast at the downstream gauging station misis river flow showed a significant negative and positive trend in high january june and low july september flow duration fig 4dh 4dl s4 and s13 in sm it indicates a decline in flow for the most recognized high flow durations e g in april april may march may february march january march and december march which have 13 0 26 1 37 8 48 6 58 7 and 66 9 contribution to annual flow respectively fig 4 dh1 dh6 conversely the contribution of most low flow durations august august october august november have a positive trend with less than 4 3 9 and 14 contribution to annual flow fig 4 dl1 dl6 this again indicates a more substantial influence of anthropogenic activities i e dam construction and agricultural activities in the downstream part of the basin on the flow regime storing water in high flow season january to june resulting in a negative trend in downstream and releasing it in the low season for irrigation is a usual function of storage dams e g the aslantaş and menzelet dams on the main channel of the ceyhan river 3 2 upstream downstream alteration in high and low flow seasons here we have provided the results for hanköy stations upstream and misis station downstream the contribution analysis for two other headwater stations including kadirli and karaahmet are presented in figs s14 and s15 in sm in headwaters for the ceyhan basin i e hanköy station the contribution of low flow to annual flow was lower than at the outlet of the basin misis station while the contribution of high flow to annual flow was higher fig 3 and table 3 the ratio between the contribution of low flow in downstream and upstream dul for a 1 to 6 month duration was 4 1 3 98 3 44 3 22 2 53 and 2 17 respectively while for high flow duh it was 0 45 0 5 0 56 0 65 0 73 and 0 79 respectively the contribution of a 1 6 month duration of low flow in the highlands of the ceyhan basin upstream of hanköy station was 1 2 2 4 6 2 10 3 and 15 3 of annual flow respectively while in the lower basin misis station it was 4 2 8 7 13 9 19 6 25 8 and 33 1 respectively fig 3 and table 3 note that the contribution analysis for the two other headwater stations kadirli and karaahmet produced similar results as those found for the hanköy station see figs s14 and s15 in sm the impact of river regulation was evident in the contribution of upstream downstream low and high flow duration to annual flow a significant change in dul and duh was observed after the construction of the aslantaş dam in the main corridor of the ceyhan river in 1984 in the period 1975 1984 pre impact period dul varied between 1 37 and 1 64 while it increased to 2 12 5 26 in the period 1985 2015 post impact period table 3 and s17 in sm this means that before regulation the contribution of low flow downstream in annual flow was closer to that upstream while after river regulation it was greater particularly for the 1 4 month low flow seasons table 3 and s17 in sm on a monthly scale the 1 68 contribution of low flow to annual flow downstream misis station before 1984 increased to 5 for 1984 2015 fig 4dl1 this change and impact of regulation on low flow contribution was also seen for other durations with an increase from 3 9 6 6 9 8 13 54 and 20 44 to 10 27 16 29 22 91 29 9 and 37 27 for the 2 3 4 5 and 6 month duration respectively fig 4 dl2 dl6 and table 3 likewise a clear change in the contribution of high flow to annual flow due to river modification was seen downstream at misis station the contribution of high flow to annual flow at misis station changed from 19 85 35 06 49 81 61 17 71 9 and 79 56 before 1984 to 11 92 23 14 33 81 44 36 54 26 and 62 73 after 1984 for the 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 month durations respectively fig 4 dh1 dh6 and table 3 this reflects the function of dams in holding water in high flow season and releasing it during the irrigation season 3 3 upstream downstream meteorological and hydrological droughts over the ceyhan basin the temporal variation of meteorological and hydrological droughts indicates that in 57 and 68 of the study period the spi and sdi had the same direction positive or negative respectively fig s16 in sm in the whole period 1976 2015 the percentage of meteorological and hydrological drought years respectively was 55 and 50 at misis downstream 45 and 45 at kadirli 47 5 and 42 0 at karaahmet and 50 and 42 5 at hanköy in the headwater area thus the percentage of hydrological drought years increased from upstream to downstream areas fig 5 in recent years after 1995 the number of hydrological droughts has increased while the meteorological droughts occurred sporadically fig 5 and fig s16 in sm the mhd ratio for all four stations for the whole period 1976 2015 is close to 1 0 wp fig 5e while it decreased between sub periods fig 5e h1 and h2 p1 p4 from p1 1976 1985 to p4 2006 2015 mhd changed from 6 to 0 28 at hanköy headwaters and from 2 5 to 0 75 at misis river mouth fig 5e this variation was also visible in the second half 1976 1995 h1 compared with the first 1996 2015 h2 from 1 85 to 0 72 at hanköy 1 28 to 0 9 at karaahmet 1 28 to 0 75 at kadirli and 1 22 to 0 64 at misis fig 5e 3 4 spatial and temporal changes in flow regime characteristics based on the change in monthly flow at the different stations and different sub periods fig 6 a river impact index ri was calculated for different gauges including karaahmet hanköy kardiliri aslantaş and misis across the ceyhan basin fig 7 among the four stations the lowest impact was observed at hanköy 1995 2004 fig 6b2 and the highest severe impact fig 7 at aslantaş station after 1995 fig 7 fig 6d2 and 6d3 for more details of mif vif and tif see table s1 in sm due to the influence of aslantaş dam constructed in 1984 with a capacity of 1 15 km3 the ri value in the middle of the basin was 0 41 for the period 1985 1994 in comparison with the pre impact period 1976 1985 and thus the impact was classified as moderate fig 7 with continued regulation of the ceyhan river through the construction of the menzelet dam 1989 1 95 km3 and sir dam 1991 1 12 km3 ri in the mid basin decreased to 0 29 and 0 31 respectively thus the impact status changed to severe for the sub periods 1995 2000 and 2000 2005 fig 7 in different sub periods the results showed low to incipient impact in headwaters hanköy and karaahmet stations and the lowland tributary kadirli station fig 7 at the last station misis ri varied between 0 43 and 0 57 indicating a moderate impact in lower part of the basin fig 7 among the three indices of river flow regime evaluated vif showed the greatest degree of alteration throughout the region table s1 in sm in central and downstream stretches of the river vif decreased dramatically by 50 80 and played a major role in the declining ri index table s1 in sm in contrast the vif decrease was smaller 0 20 at the headwater stations hanköy karaahmet kadirli which were not fully affected by water regulation and withdrawals due to irrigation networks stations on tributaries karaahmet kadirli showed incipient impact due to water regulation as neither mif nor vif declined significantly at those points 3 5 land use change changes in land use and irrigated area in the ceyhan basin in the study period were assessed by comparing the irrigated area in 1985 and 2018 based on image processing from the landsat data four main land use land cover types were identified in the ceyhan river basin irrigated area dry farming rainfed area water bodies and other area land use land cover maps and changes in irrigated area and dry farming area in the basin between 1985 and 2018 are shown in fig 8 the main land use changes in the study period were an increase in irrigated agricultural area in the catchment 76 and a decrease in dry farming area 67 6 in 1985 irrigated and dry farming land each occupied around 56 000 ha over the next 33 years to 2018 irrigated land area increased to 156 000 ha and dry farming area decreased to 18 600 ha the density of irrigated land increased both upstream and downstream which would influence water exploitation across the ceyhan basin 4 discussion there are two major reasons for flow regime alteration natural and anthropogenic haghighi et al 2020d torabi haghighi et al 2020c in pristine basins with low or no anthropogenic interference changes in flow regime are caused solely by natural phenomena and should be distributed uniformly over the basin in basins with heavy water resource use and increasing water consumption over time changes in flow regimes are likely to be dominated by anthropogenic causess as a rule when moving from headwaters towards the lower part of a basin the influence of anthropogenic impacts will be cumulative and consequently the total impact on the flow regime will be higher extreme flows affect several hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes regulation of high flows dampening of floods is important as it reflects the capacity of river basins to retain store water especially during wet seasons rodríguez et al 2018 usually any abrupt change in flow regime e g at the misis station due to reservoir impounding is easily recognisable conversely gradual change e g in the hanköy station due to land use change or overexploitation of gw is challenging to detect in the present study the river flow regimes in upstream and downstream areas of a river basin were compared to help quantify and distinguish between natural and anthropogenic impacts on river flow we have measured the upstream downstream flow regime change by applying three novel ratios dul duh and mhd to the best of our knowledge these indices are the first approaches for integrating the upstream downstream flow regime alteration in the river basin the dul and duh ratios allowed the quantification of the change in extreme flow in the basin in the natural condition minor anthropogenic versus dominant climatic drivers the distribution of low or high flow is uniform across the basin and the magnitude of dul and duh is close to 1 or the difference between these two ratios is minimum table 3 period 1975 1984 this condition indicates that any temporal difference between dul and duh is due to climate change or possible human intervention is uniformly distributed across the basin furthermore any change in these two ratios or an increase in the difference between them can quantify the impact of damming or other human intervention in the river basin for example as human intervention occurs some parts of the high flow will be stored in the reservoir decreasing the duh table 3 and released during low flow duration increase in the dul table 3 to fulfill demands e g irrigation the suggested indices can reveal the overall change across the basin from upstream to downstream beyond the cause of change as seen these two indices can be introduced as the degree of departure from pre impact conditions and helpful in comparing a change over time even if there was an existing intervention furthermore for the basins with unreliable or insufficient flow data from the pre intervention period the range around 1 can be recommended for the baseline value of dul and duh during the pre impact period trend analysis is widely used for the assessment of flow regime alteration e g martínez fernández et al 2013 hammond and fleming 2021 however it did not reveal any differences between upstream and downstream flow regime characteristics two proposed new indices dul and duh can be considered as a supplementary approach for integrated flow regime alteration across the basin as shown annual and monthly trend analysis for the ceyhan basin revealed a significant negative trend in flow regime in all parts of the basin but no significant change in precipitation fig 2 analysis of the contribution of low and high flow seasons to annual flow in order to compare upstream downstream flow regime change revealed no marked change in their relative contributions in upstream areas but a clear shift in their contributions in downstream areas before and after 1984 table 3 and fig 3 before 1984 when intensive regulation of the ceyhan river through dams and hydropower began the difference between high flow and low flow contributions in upstream and downstream areas was lower than in the post impact period 1985 2015 the duh and dul ratio for different decades in the study period quantified the different changes between upstream and downstream areas of the basin in the pre impact 1975 1984 and post impact periods the meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd is another index developed in this study that can help address how the cause of flow regime change is anthropogenic or due to climate variability in addition to standardized precipitation index spi as a well known measure for analyzing the meteorological droughts e g irannezhad et al 2015 zaki et al 2020 the streamflow drought index sdi is a robust tool for examining changes in flow magnitude at different points in a river basin nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 kim et al 2021 if the variation in sdi follows that of standardized precipitation index spi precipitation is the leading influencer of flow regime characteristics conflicting patterns of variation in spi and sdi indicate a stronger influence of anthropogenic activities than climate on river flow magnitude torabi haghighi et al 2020c zaki et al 2020 to quantify this we developed the mhd ratio which compares the number of drought events negative phases of spi and sdi decreasing the ratio from more than 1 to below 1 in two consecutive periods in the ceyhan basin e g h1 and h2 in fig 4e can demonstrate the impact of dam construction fig 1 c and irrigation development fig 7 in the ceyhan basin after 1984 therefore the mhd can be introduced as a quantitative measure to recognize the driving factor of droughts the land use map for the ceyhan basin fig 7 confirmed that during the study period a significant land use change occurred in the hanköy basin while the irrigation in this area has not been supported by major dams see fig 1 and fig 5 the lowest value of the mhd ratio was observed at hanköy station in the last decade of the study period reflecting the intensive land use change in this area the combined influence of land use and climate change is considered highly important in altering natural flow regimes especially in streams and rivers in southern europe liuzzo et al 2015 sellami et al 2016 agriculture may be responsible for almost 95 of annual water use in a basin panagopoulos et al 2014 with intensive water abstraction governing the pattern of hydrological variability stefanidis et al 2016 it must be pointed that the analysis of annual flow volume alone is insufficient to characterize human intervention on rivers because many ecosystem services e g physical habitat and flood plain are a function of other flow regimes attitude poff 1997 bunn 2002 lytle 2004 therefore the presented matrices mhd dul and duh can be used in this regard the overall impact on river regime in the ceyhan basin based on ri method indicated an incipient or moderate impact at upstream and downstream stations but a severe impact in the middle of the basin after the construction of the main storage dams aslantaş sir menzelet on the main channel of the ceyhan river the ri for headwater showed incipient impact as there was no change in tif and vif since ri m i f t i f v i f due to the absence of storage dams in the headwater area although the impact just below the aslantaş dam was severe the ri at the misis station was 0 45 0 57 indicating a moderate impact at that river outlet station the apparent recovery from severe at aslantaş to moderate at misis was due to two main factors first there is no significant reservoir on the river below the aslantaş dam so the runoff generated in the mid basin area between aslantaş and misis an area of around 5787 km2 will add to river flow in natural conditions second the return flow from irrigated areas becomes secondary extra flow returned to the river flow diminishing the initial impact on river regime the moderate river impact status estimated for the end of the ceyhan river is reasonable as the total constructed reservoir capacity is less than annual flow in the basin for comparison the ri value at the end of the highly regulated euphrates river to the immediate east of the ceyhan basin is below 0 20 and the impact has been classified as drastic torabi haghighi et al 2020b compared with the ri index the new metrics provide supplementary information on the flow regime alteration in the basin the ri indices only deal with the annual flow in terms of magnitude while the dul and duh focus on the extreme flow low and high flow and mhd deals with the frequency of drought occurrences in the study period 5 conclusions anthropogenicchanges in land and water resources unfavorably affect hydrological regimes understanding the hydrological change of rivers is crucial for effective water resources management particularly when there are various water interests in the headwater and lowland areas here we have demonstrated the application of three novel ratios downstream upstream low flow contribution ratio dul downstream upstream high flow contribution ratio duh and meteorological hydrological drought ratio mhd for an integrated evaluation of flow regime alteration across the basin this study examined changes in flow regime characteristics from upstream to downstream of the ceyhan river flowing into the eastern mediterranean sea we applied different methods of assessment and found that the results were consistent between these methods and with land use change findings for the basin a severe impact on river flow regime was identified below the aslantaş dam after 1984 reflecting a cumulative impact of that dam constructed in 1984 and other upstream dams e g sir and menzelet constructed in 1989 1991 in comparison with the pre impact period 1975 1984 an incipient impact was observed at headwater stations a considerable change in land use in the last decade of the study period 2005 2015 in the headwater area led to changes in the magnitude of flow only while the variability and timing of flow regime were practically unaffected as there are no storage dams in the headwater area in heavily river regulated downstream areas however there were marked changes in the variability and timing of flow regime in the last decade these findings were confirmed with results obtained using the novel indices for analyzing the downstream upstream du contributions of low l and high h flow to annual flow dul and duh in the analysis using the novel meteorological hydrological drought mhd ratio to compare the number of drought events negative phase of spi and sdi the lowest value was found for the headwater area in the last decade 2005 2015 confirming the impact of recent intensive land use change for irrigation and the change in magnitude of flow in this area the results of the three new ratios were complied with historical land use change and river modification over the ceyhan basin and can be recommended for

4436,understanding how biophysical processes respond to the surface energy partitioning and water budget is essential for modeling land surface processes in general evapotranspiration et associated with vegetation dynamics can function as a vital nexus of the surface energy partitioning and water budget here a dual source et model the gis based priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory gis based pt jpl model was constructed by incorporating a component of vegetation dynamics for quantifying the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget in mainland china from 1982 to 2015 to evaluate the effect of vegetation greening on evaporative water consumption two simulation scenarios were compared with and without revegetation the results reveal that the increased leaf area index led to a reduction in surface albedo by an average rate of 0 001 yr 2 from 1982 to 2015 the net terrestrial radiation exhibited a notable upward trend at a rate of 0 0594 w m 2 yr 2 which could be caused by the decrease in surface albedo and the positive greenhouse effect the increase in net terrestrial radiation enhanced both sensible and latent heat flux thus leading to a significant growing trend of et at a rate of 0 39 mm yr 2 over mainland china the results of two simulation scenarios show that the evaporative water consumption with revegetation was 5 1 higher than that without revegetation and the ratio of water yield in 10 of 11 river basins decreased around 1 6 19 4 over the past three decades for revegetation these findings broaden the current knowledge about how to ensure ecologically sustainable restoration and manage the long term revegetation strategy keywords vegetation greening pt jpl model net terrestrial radiation evapotranspiration water yield 1 introduction vegetation dynamics can change rapidly with consequences for global energy partitioning and water budget ciais et al 2013 peters et al 2013 forzieri et al 2020 forest inventories and satellite measurements suggest an increase of vegetation greening at both regional and global scales pan et al 2011 xu et al 2013 los 2013 from 2000 to 2017 one third of the global vegetation area became greener which is equal to adding 5 4 106 km2 in leaf area over 18 years chen et al 2019 in particular china contributed one quarter of the global net increase in leaf area as a result of its ambitious programs to protect and expand forests for mitigating degradation chen et al 2019 leaf area index lai a vital structural attribute of vegetation is defined as half of the leaf area per unit horizontal surface of plants and commonly used to quantify the amount of foliage in the plant canopy kala et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 thus it can be used to depict vegetation dynamics and serve as a critical predictive variable for land surface processes and ecosystem modeling kala et al 2014 the persistent increase of lai caused by vegetation greening influences the surface albedo and hence affects the net terrestrial radiation rn available to drive latent as well as sensible heat fluxes kala et al 2014 which further alters surface energy partitioning forzieri et al 2020 changes in surface energy partitioning ultimately impact water budget bonan 2008 forzieri et al 2017 through evapotranspiration et which acts as a nexus of the surface energy partitioning and water budget in land surface processes senay et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 liu et al 2020 thus vegetation dynamics inevitably affect or provide feedback to surface energy partitioning and water budget myhre 2013 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2019 forzieri et al 2020 in this regard alkama and cescatti 2016 zeng et al 2017 and chen et al 2020 have explored the influence of biophysical feedbacks associated with global greening on surface air temperature in a decade williams and torn 2015 bagley et al 2017 and forzieri et al 2020 focused on how vegetation dynamics affect rn and quantified surface energy partitioning by taking global vegetation greening into account zhang et al 2016 and zeng et al 2018 explicitly examined and characterized the response of et to vegetation restoration surface energy partitioning and water budget were generally examined in isolation in existing studies with respect to vegetation greening but they cannot be considered separately at the lai related biophysical processes due to their tight interactions pitman 2003 bagley et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 to address this issue it is necessary to explicitly explore the response of surface energy partitioning and water budget to vegetation dynamics under the widespread vegetation greening kala et al 2014 ma et al 2017 the processes associated with surface energy partitioning and water budget can be simultaneously characterized by using the budyko framework liang et al 2017 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data long et al 2015 and land surface models lsms ma et al 2017 arsenault and coauthors 2018 kumar et al 2019 but those existing models and data still have limitations in simultaneously simulating lai related energy partitioning and water budget for example liang et al 2015 quantified the response of hydrological processes in the loess plateau of china to climate change and ecological restoration based on budyko hydrological model however the budyko framework does not simulate annual processes and it also gives no consideration to the effects of complex underlying surface conditions long et al 2015 monitored changes in total water storage based on the grace data which considered the effects of vegetation dynamics and human activities on evapotranspiration and water resources nevertheless the simulation results based on the grace data are limited by the relatively coarse spatial resolution ma et al 2017 used lsms by integrating a component of vegetation dynamics to simulate the exchanges of energy water and carbon between land and atmosphere over the continental united states however due to the large uncertainty of its physical mechanisms and parameters the performance of lsms combined with vegetation dynamics could be unsatisfactory in addition since vegetation can be affected by climate change the co2 fertilization effect nitrogen deposition and human land use management chen et al 2019 it is challenging for models to reconcile the processes and interactions between vegetation dynamics and its relevant factors at different spatial and temporal scales accordingly most ecohydrological models and lsms do not include vegetation dynamics but instead prescribe lai kala et al 2014 which brings uncertainty to the simulation of surface energy partitioning and water budget especially to the et in view of the above a robust model incorporating vegetation dynamics is needed to quantify the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget the dual source et model based on remotely sensed vegetation dynamics from fast developing satellite observations paves us a new path to understand the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget miralles et al 2011a 2011b as one of the dual source et models the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 can differentiate canopy transpiration intercepted evaporation and soil evaporation yang et al 2015 and accurately estimate terrestrial et with relatively few ground measurements data feng et al 2015 michel et al 2016 in addition the pt jpl model is not restricted to time or space compared with on site measurements it is thus feasible to combine the pt jpl model with remote sensing data for quantifying the effects of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget at regional scale currently the pt jpl model is mainly applied at site scale and does not consider vegetation dynamics gu et al 2018 jana et al 2016 moyano et al 2018 given sufficient eco physiological parameters there is a potential to incorporate vegetation dynamics scheme into the pt jpl model by coupling it with remote sensing data thus it is capable of exploring the influences of vegetation dynamics on surface energy partitioning and water budget at regional scale here a gis based pt jpl model incorporating vegetation dynamics will be developed to investigate the impacts of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget over mainland china and its 11 river basins the objective of this study is three fold 1 to develop a gis based pt jpl model for quantifying the impacts of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget at the regional scale 2 to examine the effects of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and energy budget and 3 to quantify the influence of vegetation greening on et and water yield at regional scale by conducting two simulation experiments i e with and without the involvement of revegetation simulation scenarios the findings were expected to give some insight into the management of planted vegetation and the long term revegetation strategy 2 data and methodology 2 1 data

model by making use of remote sensing data our approach leads to the establishment of a gis based pt jpl model by taking vegetation dynamics into consideration moreover the applicability of pt jpl model has been improved from site scale to regional scale it has no limitation to be applied in mainland china and its 11 major river basins according to the existing studies parameter m1 parameter topt and parameter β are the most sensitive parameters in the pt jpl model while others are non sensitive to the outputs of model tang et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 parameter m1 the empirical parameter of the fraction of par has a close relation with canopy resistance parameter topt the optimum plant growth temperature is closely associated with the average temperature during the growth season parameter β the sensitivity index of the soil constraint on vpd is the only constant parameter that affects soil evaporation hu et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the three most sensitive parameters were used to optimize the pt jpl model for the establishment of the gis based pt jpl model as follows parameter topt was estimated by the average temperature of the growing season parameter m1 and parameter β were optimized according to different land cover types in china in addition a set of parameter values e g m1 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 were selected and tested as model inputs for optimizing the et at regional scale the et outputs from the model were compared with the eddy covariance datasets at different land cover types in china compared with the observational et at different land cover types optimal parameters were considered to be got when the simulation results showed the minimum root mean square rmse values based on the data of annual land cover types from the modis the optimized parameters m1 parameters topt and parameters β were substituted into the model so as to incorporate vegetation dynamics into the gis based pt jpl model 2 4 model validation and scenario designs the gis based pt jpl model with vegetation dynamics performs well and generally captures the variations of et under different land cover types table 1 the mean rmse between simulated et according to the gis based pt jpl model and observations was 25 45 mm ranging from 10 08 to 58 36 mm and the mean bias was 3 07 mm ranging from 7 6 to 11 98 mm the performance of the gis based pt jpl model is apparently better than the original version table 1 with lower rmse and bias compared with observations the specific algorithms of the gis based pt jpl model with vegetation dynamics and its performance are described in shao et al 2019 to examine and quantify the effects of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget in the study region we conducted the gis based pt jpl model simulation experiments under two different scenarios 1 the first experiment actual vegetation scenario was based on the simulation with actual surface energy partitioning and water budget 2 the second experiment hypothetical vegetation scenario was based on the simulation without vegetation greening thereby the vegetation index lai surface albedo energy availability and pt jpl temporary factors remained unchanged based on the situation in 2000 in order to calculate surface energy partitioning and water budget without vegetation change in this study the pettitt test pettitt 1979 was applied to determine the change point of lai albedo and for each surface water and energy budget parameter p e q δw and p e 3 results 3 1 changes in lai and surface albedo in mainland china the annual mean lai values were used to represent the general vegetation condition across mainland china during the period 1982 2015 and evaluate the interannual variations in vegetation fig 2 a shows that the annual mean lai increased significantly between 1982 and 2015 at an overall rate of 0 003 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 however pettitt s test reveals that there are two different increasing periods 1982 1997 at a rate of 0 0018 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 and 1998 2015 at a rate of 0 0001 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 in other words the change point was around 1997 most vegetation restoration occurred in the period 1997 2004 the lai values for all 11 large river basins exhibit significant upward trends fig 2b with a mean rate of 0 0037 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 ranging from 0 0014 to 0 0072 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 fig 2c shows that the increases in lai values in the yangtze river yellow river pearl river hai river huai river and liao river basins were greater than the rest of the basins the general vegetation condition over mainland china improved substantially over the period 1982 2015 with the increasing values of lai the annual mean albedo in mainland china declined at a rate of 0 001 yr 2 p 0 05 from 1982 to 2015 and no obvious change point was detected by pettitt s test fig 3 a the surface albedo in 7 of the 11 river basins exhibited significant downward trends fig 3b with a mean rate of 0 0001 yr 2 ranging from 0 0004 to 0 0011 yr 2 it should be noted that the reduction in surface albedo mainly occurred in the basins where experienced significant vegetation restoration with an increase in lai figs 2c and 3c vegetation greening would induce more srad to be absorbed by the plant canopy and thus less lrad to be reflected back into the atmosphere 3 2 variations in incoming shortwave and longwave radiation fig 4 shows that there was no significant trend in the annual mean srad over mainland china from1982 to 2015 at a rate of 0 01 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 05 in contrast fig 5 a shows that the annual mean lrad increased greatly over the past three decades at an overall rate of 0 1523 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 05 the pettitt s test reveals that changes in lrad include two different periods 1982 1997 increasing at a rate of 0 2746 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 01 and 1998 2015 decreasing at a rate of 0 0841 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 05 in other words the change point is also around 1997 the lrad in all 11 river basins exhibits significant upward trends with a mean rate of 0 1937 w m 2 yr 2 ranging between 0 0727 and 0 3157 w m 2 yr 2 fig 5b fig 5c shows that the increase in lrad was nationwide across mainland china especially for the west part of xinjiang and tibet the sharp rise in lrad could be mainly attributed to the greenhouse effect wherein the annual mean co2 concentration of the world increased from 340 ppm in 1982 to 400 ppm in 2015 the slight decline in srad the apparent increase in lrad and the substantial increase in lai may have led to dramatic changes in surface energy budget during the period 1982 2015 over mainland china 3 3 impact of vegetation dynamics on the surface energy budget and partitioning based on eqs 1 6 the impacts of vegetation dynamics on the surface energy budget and partitioning were examined and quantified fig 6 shows that the annual mean rn in mainland china exhibited a significant upward trend between 1982 and 2015 at an overall rate of 0 0594 w mm 2 yr 2 however pettitt s test shows that the variation in rn includes two different periods 1982 1998 declining at a rate of 0 1691 w mm 2 yr 2 and 1999 2015 increasing at a rate of 0 0978 w mm 2 yr 2 indicating that the change point was around 1998 the rn in 7 of the 11 river basins over mainland china exhibits significant upward trends at a mean rate of 0 1279 w mm 2 yr 2 while the rn in 4 of them rn reduced significantly at a mean rate of 2117 w mm 2 yr 2 fig 6b fig 6c shows that the decline in rn mainly occurred in northeast china including the songhua river liao river hai river and huai river basins generally speaking the overall trend in rn in mainland china was positive during the period 1982 2015 with the impact of rising rn the 2 m air temperature in mainland china exhibited a significant upward trend from 1982 to 2015 at an overall rate of 0 04 c yr 2 this indicates that vegetation greening results in the enhancement of sensible heat flux and has a positive impact on climate warming in the study region fig 7 shows the variations of rnc over mainland china from 1982 to 2015 it can be seen from fig 7a that the rnc increased at an overall rate of 0 42 w mm 2 yr 2 p 0 01 the increase in rnc includes two different increasing periods 1982 2000 at a rate of 0 0736 w mm 2 yr 2 and 2001 2015 at a rate of 0 4295 w mm 2 yr 2 the abrupt change point for rnc is around 2000 fig 7b shows that the rnc in all 11 river basins increased dramatically with a mean rate of 0 3435 w mm 2 yr 2 ranging from 0 1564 to 0 6299 w mm 2 yr 2 the increase in rnc occurs over most of mainland china except for some scattered areas in northeast china this indicates that more energy was allocated to the plant canopy which would increase transpiration in contrast to rnc the annual mean rns over mainland china declined significantly from 1982 to 2015 at an overall rate of 0 3607 w mm 2 yr 2 the reduction in rns can also be divided into two different decreasing periods 1982 2001 at a rate of 0 1852 w mm 2 yr 2 and 2002 2015 at a rate of 0 2383 w mm 2 yr 2 and the abrupt change point in rns occurred around 2001 except for the tarim river basin the rns in10 of 11 basins exhibited a significant downward trend at a mean rate of 0 3716 w mm 2 yr 2 ranging between 0 8077 and 0 0863 w mm 2 yr 2 fig 8 b and c a decrease in rns indicates that less soil water will be evaporated from the soil surface 3 4 effects of vegetation greening on surface et and water budget fig 9 a shows the spatial distribution of the multiyear averaged et under the scenario with vegetation greening actual vegetation scenario the annual mean et in mainland china was 390 mm yr from 1982 to 2015 the evaporative water demand was the highest in southeast china and gradually declined from thre southeast exceeding 700 mm yr to northwest below 100 mm yr china in contrast fig 9b presents the spatial distribution of the multiyear averaged et under the scenario without vegetation greening hypothetical vegetation scenario in this case the annual mean et in mainland china was 370 mm yr during the same period i e 5 1 less than with the actual vegetation scenario the spatial distribution of evaporative water demand in the hypothetical scenario was similar to the actual scenario but the et magnitude at the same location was apparently lower than that in the first scenario fig 9c displays the spatial distribution of the difference between the multiyear averaged et under the two different scenarios with and without vegetation greening it is clear that the evaporative water demand under the actual vegetation scenario was higher than the scenario without vegetation greening in mainland china over the period 1982 2015 figs 9 and s1 fig 10 shows the box plot of changes in annual mean et under the two scenarios during 1982 2015 over the 11 river basins in mainland china it can be seen that the significant differences in et mainly occur in the yellow river yangtze river pearl river huai river hai river and liao river basins where the lai increased greatly the increase in et is the main cause for the enhancement of total et see fig s2 in the supplementary materials moreover except for the magnitude of et the increasing rate of et with vegetation greening is also apparently higher than without vegetation greening figs s3 and s4 in the supplementary materials in summary vegetation greening has led to an increase in evaporative water consumption over mainland china vegetation greening not only leads to an increase in evaporative water consumption but also affects the surface water budget in this study surface water yield wy was the calculated natural surface runoff without considering water allocation diversion projects and defined as the difference between p and et it was used to represent the effects of vegetation dynamics on surface water balance over the 11 river basins in mainland china during 1982 2015 as shown in fig 11 the annual mean p in all 11 river basins exhibited increasing trends at a mean rate of 1 62 mm yr 2 ranging from 0 35 to 2 80 mm yr 2 the increase in p occurred in most of mainland china fig 1 which could bring more surface water supply and wy from 1982 to 2015 however with vegetation greening the upward trend in p was partially offset by the increase in et fig 12 shows the box plot of changes in annual mean wy modeled with and without vegetation dynamics during 1982 2015 over the 11 river basins in 10 of 11 river basins it can be seen that the wys under the realistic vegetation greening scenario were apparently lower than the scenario without vegetation greening the relative decline ratio of wy with revegetation was 9 6 on average ranging from 1 6 to 19 4 although the wy in mainland china shows an upward trend in the majority of places figs 11 and 12 the vegetation greening over mainland china is in fact at the cost of more water consumption which increases the risk of wy reduction 4 discussion 4 1 attribution of changes in surface energy partitioning and water budget examining the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget highlights the significance of the biophysical feedbacks in land surface processes hence a gis based pt jpl model was developed based on the pt jpl model by taking vegetation dynamics into consideration this allows us to examine the effects of vegetation greening on regional energy partitioning and water budget over the past three decades to achieve this goal different simulation experiments were conducted to examine the influences of vegetation dynamics in surface energy and water budgets across mainland china and its 11 river basins our results show that large scale vegetation greening leads to an overall trend of increasing rn more surface energy was partitioned into the plant canopy and thus less soil water was lost through evaporation from the soil surface due to vegetation greening there was a reduction in wy across mainland china from 1982 to 2015 this is because the reduction in surface albedo caused by the increased lai betts 2000 alton et al 2009 kala et al 2014 zeng et al 2017 would lead to the increases in both rnsrad and vegetation absorptance alton et al 2009 shao et al 2019 moreover the positive greenhouse effect contributed to an apparent increase in rnlrad by absorbing and re emitting more infrared radiation emitted by the surface schimel et al 1995 thus the increases in both rnsrad and rnlrad lead to an increase in rn and thus enhanced surface energy as expected trends in et associated with vegetation greening exhibit significant increments primarily attributed to the response of surface energy the stomatal conductance and the total root biomass to the increased lai this is consistent with existing findings arora 2002 katul et al 2012 yang et al 2016b on account of these effects caused by the increased lai under the actual vegetation greening scenario the water budget was affected by the increased evaporative water consumption ultimately reducing the ratio of wy by 1 6 19 4 across mainland china although the annual mean precipitation in mainland china showed a distinct increase over the past three decades the upward trend in precipitation was partially offset by the increase in et which contributed to the reduction of wy 4 2 potential implications of changes in water and energy nexus here we quantified the increase in rn with improved vegetation cover due to the enhancement of rnsrad caused by surface albedo reduction and the increase of surface lrad resulting from the positive greenhouse effect the rn increased from 1982 to 2015 in mainland china based on the observed temperature data the temperature in mainland china increased at a rate of 0 04 yr2 and et increased at a rate of 0 31 mm yr2 which means that the rise in rn led to the increases in both latent and sensible heat fluxes and thus an increase in both heating and phase transition accordingly vegetation greening consumes more water through evapotranspiration gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a in fact the et in the scenario with actual vegetation greening increased at an overall rate of 0 39 mm yr 2 from 1982 to 2015 while the rate of et in the scenario without revegetation was simulated to be 0 30 mm yr 2 in other words the increasing rate of et in the actual vegetation scenario is 23 higher than that scenario without vegetation greening it should be noted that the lais of the 11 river basins in mainland china all exhibited significant upward trends however different basins have different adaptability to energy and water variations caused by revegetation basins in humid areas have strong adaptability because water resources in these areas are not a major constraint for plant growth the lai shows an obvious increasing trend in humid basins and these basins should be the main areas for the implementation of vegetation restoration for water limited areas such as the arid and semi arid basins in northern china excessive revegetation may exacerbate the difference between supply and demand for water resources menz et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b therefore revegetation and production activities need to be implemented according to water resource availability particularly with respect to the management of forest areas in arid basins where forests have higher evapotranspiration than grassland shrub and farmland jin et al 2017 in addition in water limited areas it is necessary to reduce the uptake of limited soil moisture by vegetation liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a 2018b in high density areas plants should be reduced regularly and species that absorb a lot of water need to be replaced by more suitable native species chen et al 2015 tijdeman and menzel 2020 for areas with widespread vegetation greening taking the biophysical feedback into consideration is of great significance zhang et al 2019a 2019b the results of this study are of significant implications for future programs of regional ecosystem sustainability and for providing more information to local decision makers 4 3 limitations of this study and future work there are however some limitations associated with the gis based pt jpl model and its data first its physiological parameters can be further improved in future research to provide a better simulation of the equilibrium vegetation cover corresponding to particular species second since the gis based pt jpl model is based on the priestly taylor approach it mainly considers the impact of energy budgets on et processes it does not directly take the effects of aerodynamics on et into account but uses a fixed priestly taylor coefficient around 1 26 to simplify the effects of aerodynamics thus the gis based pt jpl model is not very sensitive to the influence of co2 concentration variation however the elevated co2 concentration would reduce transpiration because of the less stomatal opening of leaves in order to absorb the necessary amount of co2 for photosynthesis niu et al 2013 for improving the accuracy of the estimation of et by the model li et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the gis based pt jpl model needs to incorporate the response of stomatal conductance to the elevated co2 in the further third the model s optimization and validation were affected by the number of observed records and the irregular distribution measurements of et flux towers for example the current flux tower network does not include barren land and the crop types are still underrepresented thus it is necessary to add flux towers at sites to improve the estimation accuracy of the response of et to vegetation dynamics at regional scale in addition parameters in future studies should be calibrated with higher resolution data for instance the et patterns can be captured better under the assistance of a higher resolution vegetation index moreover additional factors leading to the increase of evaporative water consumption should be included there are complex and interacting effects between vegetation and climate on et and it is impossible to make a complete distinction between vegetation and the effects of climate change because vegetation also can respond to changes in land use types and climate conditions on one hand the changes in vapor pressure on account of climate change oppose influences on et because of their two way interaction contributing to a relatively small net effect on et on the other hand by reducing the transpiration of plants or producing long term hysteresis effect on et of the ecosystem climate change can also affect et through vegetation dynamics yang et al 2016a moreover vegetation productivity and vpd can also be enhanced by increases in nitrogen mineralization rates and temperature liang et al 2017 after coupling the water cycles between land and atmosphere the increased et may enhance the local precipitation via hydrological recycling which thereby increases the proportion of p available for runoff wy and soil moisture spracklen et al 2012 accordingly future research needs to pay more attention to the interplay between lai related biophysical processes and evaporative water consumption under climate modulations 5 conclusions with the goal of mitigating land degradation china contributed 25 of the global net increase in leaves as a result of its greening programs it is considerately necessary to quantify the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget based on the gis based pt jpl model including vegetation dynamics and different simulation experiments we found that the lai over mainland china increased significantly at a rate of 0 003 m2 m 2 yr 2 during the period 1982 2015 while the land surface albedo declined at a rate of 0 001 yr 2 p 0 05 due to the reduction in surface albedo more srad was absorbed by the plant canopy and more rnsrad was generated at the land surface accordingly the rn increased significantly during 1982 2015 over mainland china at a rate of 0 0594 w m 2 yr 2 primarily on account of the enhancement of rnsrad caused by surface albedo reduction and the increase in lrad generated by a positive greenhouse effect meanwhile the net radiation of the canopy increased at a rate of 0 42 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 01 while the annual mean net radiation of the soil surface over the country declined significantly at a rate of 0 3607 w m 2 yr 2 from 1982 to 2015 evapotranspiration exhibited increases at a rate of 0 39 mm yr2 which is 23 higher than the case without vegetation greening therefore the water budget has been substantially affected by the increased evaporative water consumption ultimately the ratio of wy reduced by 1 6 19 4 over the 11 river basins in mainland china notably the vegetation greening over mainland china increased the risk of wy reduction particularly in arid and semiarid river basins we have characterized the net effects of vegetation greening on surface energy and water budgets in mainland china and its 11 river basins providing additional information on regional surface energy partitioning and water budget and associated environmental changes this is of great significance to

4436,understanding how biophysical processes respond to the surface energy partitioning and water budget is essential for modeling land surface processes in general evapotranspiration et associated with vegetation dynamics can function as a vital nexus of the surface energy partitioning and water budget here a dual source et model the gis based priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory gis based pt jpl model was constructed by incorporating a component of vegetation dynamics for quantifying the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget in mainland china from 1982 to 2015 to evaluate the effect of vegetation greening on evaporative water consumption two simulation scenarios were compared with and without revegetation the results reveal that the increased leaf area index led to a reduction in surface albedo by an average rate of 0 001 yr 2 from 1982 to 2015 the net terrestrial radiation exhibited a notable upward trend at a rate of 0 0594 w m 2 yr 2 which could be caused by the decrease in surface albedo and the positive greenhouse effect the increase in net terrestrial radiation enhanced both sensible and latent heat flux thus leading to a significant growing trend of et at a rate of 0 39 mm yr 2 over mainland china the results of two simulation scenarios show that the evaporative water consumption with revegetation was 5 1 higher than that without revegetation and the ratio of water yield in 10 of 11 river basins decreased around 1 6 19 4 over the past three decades for revegetation these findings broaden the current knowledge about how to ensure ecologically sustainable restoration and manage the long term revegetation strategy keywords vegetation greening pt jpl model net terrestrial radiation evapotranspiration water

and satellite measurements suggest an increase of vegetation greening at both regional and global scales pan et al 2011 xu et al 2013 los 2013 from 2000 to 2017 one third of the global vegetation area became greener which is equal to adding 5 4 106 km2 in leaf area over 18 years chen et al 2019 in particular china contributed one quarter of the global net increase in leaf area as a result of its ambitious programs to protect and expand forests for mitigating degradation chen et al 2019 leaf area index lai a vital structural attribute of vegetation is defined as half of the leaf area per unit horizontal surface of plants and commonly used to quantify the amount of foliage in the plant canopy kala et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 thus it can be used to depict vegetation dynamics and serve as a critical predictive variable for land surface processes and ecosystem modeling kala et al 2014 the persistent increase of lai caused by vegetation greening influences the surface albedo and hence affects the net terrestrial radiation rn available to drive latent as well as sensible heat fluxes kala et al 2014 which further alters surface energy partitioning forzieri et al 2020 changes in surface energy partitioning ultimately impact water budget bonan 2008 forzieri et al 2017 through evapotranspiration et which acts as a nexus of the surface energy partitioning and water budget in land surface processes senay et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 liu et al 2020 thus vegetation dynamics inevitably affect or provide feedback to surface energy partitioning and water budget myhre 2013 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2019 forzieri et al 2020 in this regard alkama and cescatti 2016 zeng et al 2017 and chen et al 2020 have explored the influence of biophysical feedbacks associated with global greening on surface air temperature in a decade williams and torn 2015 bagley et al 2017 and forzieri et al 2020 focused on how vegetation dynamics affect rn and quantified surface energy partitioning by taking global vegetation greening into account zhang et al 2016 and zeng et al 2018 explicitly examined and characterized the response of et to vegetation restoration surface energy partitioning and water budget were generally examined in isolation in existing studies with respect to vegetation greening but they cannot be considered separately at the lai related biophysical processes due to their tight interactions pitman 2003 bagley et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 to address this issue it is necessary to explicitly explore the response of surface energy partitioning and water budget to vegetation dynamics under the widespread vegetation greening kala et al 2014 ma et al 2017 the processes associated with surface energy partitioning and water budget can be simultaneously characterized by using the budyko framework liang et al 2017 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data long et al 2015 and land surface models lsms ma et al 2017 arsenault and coauthors 2018 kumar et al 2019 but those existing models and data still have limitations in simultaneously simulating lai related energy partitioning and water budget for example liang et al 2015 quantified the response of hydrological processes in the loess plateau of china to climate change and ecological restoration based on budyko hydrological model however the budyko framework does not simulate annual processes and it also gives no consideration to the effects of complex underlying surface conditions long et al 2015 monitored changes in total water storage based on the grace data which considered the effects of vegetation dynamics and human activities on evapotranspiration and water resources nevertheless the simulation results based on the grace data are limited by the relatively coarse spatial resolution ma et al 2017 used lsms by integrating a component of vegetation dynamics to simulate the exchanges of energy water and carbon between land and atmosphere over the continental united states however due to the large uncertainty of its physical mechanisms and parameters the performance of lsms combined with vegetation dynamics could be unsatisfactory in addition since vegetation can be affected by climate change the co2 fertilization effect nitrogen deposition and human land use management chen et al 2019 it is challenging for models to reconcile the processes and interactions between vegetation dynamics and its relevant factors at different spatial and temporal scales accordingly most ecohydrological models and lsms do not include vegetation dynamics but instead prescribe lai kala et al 2014 which brings uncertainty to the simulation of surface energy partitioning and water budget especially to the et in view of the above a robust model incorporating vegetation dynamics is needed to quantify the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget the dual source et model based on remotely sensed vegetation dynamics from fast developing satellite observations paves us a new path to understand the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget miralles et al 2011a 2011b as one of the dual source et models the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 can differentiate canopy transpiration intercepted evaporation and soil evaporation yang et al 2015 and accurately estimate terrestrial et with relatively few ground measurements data feng et al 2015 michel et al 2016 in addition the pt jpl model is not restricted to time or space compared with on site measurements it is thus feasible to combine the pt jpl model with remote sensing data for quantifying the effects of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget at regional scale currently the pt jpl model is mainly applied at site scale and does not consider vegetation dynamics gu et al 2018 jana et al 2016 moyano et al 2018 given sufficient eco physiological parameters there is a potential to incorporate vegetation dynamics scheme into the pt jpl model by coupling it with remote sensing data thus it is capable of exploring the influences of vegetation dynamics on surface energy partitioning and water budget at regional scale here a gis based pt jpl model incorporating vegetation dynamics will be developed to investigate the impacts of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget over mainland china and its 11 river basins the objective of this study is three fold 1 to develop a gis based pt jpl model for quantifying the impacts of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget at the regional scale 2 to examine the effects of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and energy budget and 3 to quantify the influence of vegetation greening on et and water yield at regional scale by conducting two simulation experiments i e with and without the involvement of revegetation simulation scenarios the findings were expected to give some insight into the management of planted vegetation and the long term revegetation strategy 2 data and methodology 2 1 data

model by making use of remote sensing data our approach leads to the establishment of a gis based pt jpl model by taking vegetation dynamics into consideration moreover the applicability of pt jpl model has been improved from site scale to regional scale it has no limitation to be applied in mainland china and its 11 major river basins according to the existing studies parameter m1 parameter topt and parameter β are the most sensitive parameters in the pt jpl model while others are non sensitive to the outputs of model tang et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 parameter m1 the empirical parameter of the fraction of par has a close relation with canopy resistance parameter topt the optimum plant growth temperature is closely associated with the average temperature during the growth season parameter β the sensitivity index of the soil constraint on vpd is the only constant parameter that affects soil evaporation hu et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the three most sensitive parameters were used to optimize the pt jpl model for the establishment of the gis based pt jpl model as follows parameter topt was estimated by the average temperature of the growing season parameter m1 and parameter β were optimized according to different land cover types in china in addition a set of parameter values e g m1 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 were selected and tested as model inputs for optimizing the et at regional scale the et outputs from the model were compared with the eddy covariance datasets at different land cover types in china compared with the observational et at different land cover types optimal parameters were considered to be got when the simulation results showed the minimum root mean square rmse values based on the data of annual land cover types from the modis the optimized parameters m1 parameters topt and parameters β were substituted into the model so as to incorporate vegetation dynamics into the gis based pt jpl model 2 4 model validation and scenario designs the gis based pt jpl model with vegetation dynamics performs well and generally captures the variations of et under different land cover types table 1 the mean rmse between simulated et according to the gis based pt jpl model and observations was 25 45 mm ranging from 10 08 to 58 36 mm and the mean bias was 3 07 mm ranging from 7 6 to 11 98 mm the performance of the gis based pt jpl model is apparently better than the original version table 1 with lower rmse and bias compared with observations the specific algorithms of the gis based pt jpl model with vegetation dynamics and its performance are described in shao et al 2019 to examine and quantify the effects of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget in the study region we conducted the gis based pt jpl model simulation experiments under two different scenarios 1 the first experiment actual vegetation scenario was based on the simulation with actual surface energy partitioning and water budget 2 the second experiment hypothetical vegetation scenario was based on the simulation without vegetation greening thereby the vegetation index lai surface albedo energy availability and pt jpl temporary factors remained unchanged based on the situation in 2000 in order to calculate surface energy partitioning and water budget without vegetation change in this study the pettitt test pettitt 1979 was applied to determine the change point of lai albedo and for each surface water and energy budget parameter p e q δw and p e 3 results 3 1 changes in lai and surface albedo in mainland china the annual mean lai values were used to represent the general vegetation condition across mainland china during the period 1982 2015 and evaluate the interannual variations in vegetation fig 2 a shows that the annual mean lai increased significantly between 1982 and 2015 at an overall rate of 0 003 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 however pettitt s test reveals that there are two different increasing periods 1982 1997 at a rate of 0 0018 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 and 1998 2015 at a rate of 0 0001 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 in other words the change point was around 1997 most vegetation restoration occurred in the period 1997 2004 the lai values for all 11 large river basins exhibit significant upward trends fig 2b with a mean rate of 0 0037 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 ranging from 0 0014 to 0 0072 mm2 mm 2 yr 2 fig 2c shows that the increases in lai values in the yangtze river yellow river pearl river hai river huai river and liao river basins were greater than the rest of the basins the general vegetation condition over mainland china improved substantially over the period 1982 2015 with the increasing values of lai the annual mean albedo in mainland china declined at a rate of 0 001 yr 2 p 0 05 from 1982 to 2015 and no obvious change point was detected by pettitt s test fig 3 a the surface albedo in 7 of the 11 river basins exhibited significant downward trends fig 3b with a mean rate of 0 0001 yr 2 ranging from 0 0004 to 0 0011 yr 2 it should be noted that the reduction in surface albedo mainly occurred in the basins where experienced significant vegetation restoration with an increase in lai figs 2c and 3c vegetation greening would induce more srad to be absorbed by the plant canopy and thus less lrad to be reflected back into the atmosphere 3 2 variations in incoming shortwave and longwave radiation fig 4 shows that there was no significant trend in the annual mean srad over mainland china from1982 to 2015 at a rate of 0 01 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 05 in contrast fig 5 a shows that the annual mean lrad increased greatly over the past three decades at an overall rate of 0 1523 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 05 the pettitt s test reveals that changes in lrad include two different periods 1982 1997 increasing at a rate of 0 2746 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 01 and 1998 2015 decreasing at a rate of 0 0841 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 05 in other words the change point is also around 1997 the lrad in all 11 river basins exhibits significant upward trends with a mean rate of 0 1937 w m 2 yr 2 ranging between 0 0727 and 0 3157 w m 2 yr 2 fig 5b fig 5c shows that the increase in lrad was nationwide across mainland china especially for the west part of xinjiang and tibet the sharp rise in lrad could be mainly attributed to the greenhouse effect wherein the annual mean co2 concentration of the world increased from 340 ppm in 1982 to 400 ppm in 2015 the slight decline in srad the apparent increase in lrad and the substantial increase in lai may have led to dramatic changes in surface energy budget during the period 1982 2015 over mainland china 3 3 impact of vegetation dynamics on the surface energy budget and partitioning based on eqs 1 6 the impacts of vegetation dynamics on the surface energy budget and partitioning were examined and quantified fig 6 shows that the annual mean rn in mainland china exhibited a significant upward trend between 1982 and 2015 at an overall rate of 0 0594 w mm 2 yr 2 however pettitt s test shows that the variation in rn includes two different periods 1982 1998 declining at a rate of 0 1691 w mm 2 yr 2 and 1999 2015 increasing at a rate of 0 0978 w mm 2 yr 2 indicating that the change point was around 1998 the rn in 7 of the 11 river basins over mainland china exhibits significant upward trends at a mean rate of 0 1279 w mm 2 yr 2 while the rn in 4 of them rn reduced significantly at a mean rate of 2117 w mm 2 yr 2 fig 6b fig 6c shows that the decline in rn mainly occurred in northeast china including the songhua river liao river hai river and huai river basins generally speaking the overall trend in rn in mainland china was positive during the period 1982 2015 with the impact of rising rn the 2 m air temperature in mainland china exhibited a significant upward trend from 1982 to 2015 at an overall rate of 0 04 c yr 2 this indicates that vegetation greening results in the enhancement of sensible heat flux and has a positive impact on climate warming in the study region fig 7 shows the variations of rnc over mainland china from 1982 to 2015 it can be seen from fig 7a that the rnc increased at an overall rate of 0 42 w mm 2 yr 2 p 0 01 the increase in rnc includes two different increasing periods 1982 2000 at a rate of 0 0736 w mm 2 yr 2 and 2001 2015 at a rate of 0 4295 w mm 2 yr 2 the abrupt change point for rnc is around 2000 fig 7b shows that the rnc in all 11 river basins increased dramatically with a mean rate of 0 3435 w mm 2 yr 2 ranging from 0 1564 to 0 6299 w mm 2 yr 2 the increase in rnc occurs over most of mainland china except for some scattered areas in northeast china this indicates that more energy was allocated to the plant canopy which would increase transpiration in contrast to rnc the annual mean rns over mainland china declined significantly from 1982 to 2015 at an overall rate of 0 3607 w mm 2 yr 2 the reduction in rns can also be divided into two different decreasing periods 1982 2001 at a rate of 0 1852 w mm 2 yr 2 and 2002 2015 at a rate of 0 2383 w mm 2 yr 2 and the abrupt change point in rns occurred around 2001 except for the tarim river basin the rns in10 of 11 basins exhibited a significant downward trend at a mean rate of 0 3716 w mm 2 yr 2 ranging between 0 8077 and 0 0863 w mm 2 yr 2 fig 8 b and c a decrease in rns indicates that less soil water will be evaporated from the soil surface 3 4 effects of vegetation greening on surface et and water budget fig 9 a shows the spatial distribution of the multiyear averaged et under the scenario with vegetation greening actual vegetation scenario the annual mean et in mainland china was 390 mm yr from 1982 to 2015 the evaporative water demand was the highest in southeast china and gradually declined from thre southeast exceeding 700 mm yr to northwest below 100 mm yr china in contrast fig 9b presents the spatial distribution of the multiyear averaged et under the scenario without vegetation greening hypothetical vegetation scenario in this case the annual mean et in mainland china was 370 mm yr during the same period i e 5 1 less than with the actual vegetation scenario the spatial distribution of evaporative water demand in the hypothetical scenario was similar to the actual scenario but the et magnitude at the same location was apparently lower than that in the first scenario fig 9c displays the spatial distribution of the difference between the multiyear averaged et under the two different scenarios with and without vegetation greening it is clear that the evaporative water demand under the actual vegetation scenario was higher than the scenario without vegetation greening in mainland china over the period 1982 2015 figs 9 and s1 fig 10 shows the box plot of changes in annual mean et under the two scenarios during 1982 2015 over the 11 river basins in mainland china it can be seen that the significant differences in et mainly occur in the yellow river yangtze river pearl river huai river hai river and liao river basins where the lai increased greatly the increase in et is the main cause for the enhancement of total et see fig s2 in the supplementary materials moreover except for the magnitude of et the increasing rate of et with vegetation greening is also apparently higher than without vegetation greening figs s3 and s4 in the supplementary materials in summary vegetation greening has led to an increase in evaporative water consumption over mainland china vegetation greening not only leads to an increase in evaporative water consumption but also affects the surface water budget in this study surface water yield wy was the calculated natural surface runoff without considering water allocation diversion projects and defined as the difference between p and et it was used to represent the effects of vegetation dynamics on surface water balance over the 11 river basins in mainland china during 1982 2015 as shown in fig 11 the annual mean p in all 11 river basins exhibited increasing trends at a mean rate of 1 62 mm yr 2 ranging from 0 35 to 2 80 mm yr 2 the increase in p occurred in most of mainland china fig 1 which could bring more surface water supply and wy from 1982 to 2015 however with vegetation greening the upward trend in p was partially offset by the increase in et fig 12 shows the box plot of changes in annual mean wy modeled with and without vegetation dynamics during 1982 2015 over the 11 river basins in 10 of 11 river basins it can be seen that the wys under the realistic vegetation greening scenario were apparently lower than the scenario without vegetation greening the relative decline ratio of wy with revegetation was 9 6 on average ranging from 1 6 to 19 4 although the wy in mainland china shows an upward trend in the majority of places figs 11 and 12 the vegetation greening over mainland china is in fact at the cost of more water consumption which increases the risk of wy reduction 4 discussion 4 1 attribution of changes in surface energy partitioning and water budget examining the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget highlights the significance of the biophysical feedbacks in land surface processes hence a gis based pt jpl model was developed based on the pt jpl model by taking vegetation dynamics into consideration this allows us to examine the effects of vegetation greening on regional energy partitioning and water budget over the past three decades to achieve this goal different simulation experiments were conducted to examine the influences of vegetation dynamics in surface energy and water budgets across mainland china and its 11 river basins our results show that large scale vegetation greening leads to an overall trend of increasing rn more surface energy was partitioned into the plant canopy and thus less soil water was lost through evaporation from the soil surface due to vegetation greening there was a reduction in wy across mainland china from 1982 to 2015 this is because the reduction in surface albedo caused by the increased lai betts 2000 alton et al 2009 kala et al 2014 zeng et al 2017 would lead to the increases in both rnsrad and vegetation absorptance alton et al 2009 shao et al 2019 moreover the positive greenhouse effect contributed to an apparent increase in rnlrad by absorbing and re emitting more infrared radiation emitted by the surface schimel et al 1995 thus the increases in both rnsrad and rnlrad lead to an increase in rn and thus enhanced surface energy as expected trends in et associated with vegetation greening exhibit significant increments primarily attributed to the response of surface energy the stomatal conductance and the total root biomass to the increased lai this is consistent with existing findings arora 2002 katul et al 2012 yang et al 2016b on account of these effects caused by the increased lai under the actual vegetation greening scenario the water budget was affected by the increased evaporative water consumption ultimately reducing the ratio of wy by 1 6 19 4 across mainland china although the annual mean precipitation in mainland china showed a distinct increase over the past three decades the upward trend in precipitation was partially offset by the increase in et which contributed to the reduction of wy 4 2 potential implications of changes in water and energy nexus here we quantified the increase in rn with improved vegetation cover due to the enhancement of rnsrad caused by surface albedo reduction and the increase of surface lrad resulting from the positive greenhouse effect the rn increased from 1982 to 2015 in mainland china based on the observed temperature data the temperature in mainland china increased at a rate of 0 04 yr2 and et increased at a rate of 0 31 mm yr2 which means that the rise in rn led to the increases in both latent and sensible heat fluxes and thus an increase in both heating and phase transition accordingly vegetation greening consumes more water through evapotranspiration gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a in fact the et in the scenario with actual vegetation greening increased at an overall rate of 0 39 mm yr 2 from 1982 to 2015 while the rate of et in the scenario without revegetation was simulated to be 0 30 mm yr 2 in other words the increasing rate of et in the actual vegetation scenario is 23 higher than that scenario without vegetation greening it should be noted that the lais of the 11 river basins in mainland china all exhibited significant upward trends however different basins have different adaptability to energy and water variations caused by revegetation basins in humid areas have strong adaptability because water resources in these areas are not a major constraint for plant growth the lai shows an obvious increasing trend in humid basins and these basins should be the main areas for the implementation of vegetation restoration for water limited areas such as the arid and semi arid basins in northern china excessive revegetation may exacerbate the difference between supply and demand for water resources menz et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b therefore revegetation and production activities need to be implemented according to water resource availability particularly with respect to the management of forest areas in arid basins where forests have higher evapotranspiration than grassland shrub and farmland jin et al 2017 in addition in water limited areas it is necessary to reduce the uptake of limited soil moisture by vegetation liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a 2018b in high density areas plants should be reduced regularly and species that absorb a lot of water need to be replaced by more suitable native species chen et al 2015 tijdeman and menzel 2020 for areas with widespread vegetation greening taking the biophysical feedback into consideration is of great significance zhang et al 2019a 2019b the results of this study are of significant implications for future programs of regional ecosystem sustainability and for providing more information to local decision makers 4 3 limitations of this study and future work there are however some limitations associated with the gis based pt jpl model and its data first its physiological parameters can be further improved in future research to provide a better simulation of the equilibrium vegetation cover corresponding to particular species second since the gis based pt jpl model is based on the priestly taylor approach it mainly considers the impact of energy budgets on et processes it does not directly take the effects of aerodynamics on et into account but uses a fixed priestly taylor coefficient around 1 26 to simplify the effects of aerodynamics thus the gis based pt jpl model is not very sensitive to the influence of co2 concentration variation however the elevated co2 concentration would reduce transpiration because of the less stomatal opening of leaves in order to absorb the necessary amount of co2 for photosynthesis niu et al 2013 for improving the accuracy of the estimation of et by the model li et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the gis based pt jpl model needs to incorporate the response of stomatal conductance to the elevated co2 in the further third the model s optimization and validation were affected by the number of observed records and the irregular distribution measurements of et flux towers for example the current flux tower network does not include barren land and the crop types are still underrepresented thus it is necessary to add flux towers at sites to improve the estimation accuracy of the response of et to vegetation dynamics at regional scale in addition parameters in future studies should be calibrated with higher resolution data for instance the et patterns can be captured better under the assistance of a higher resolution vegetation index moreover additional factors leading to the increase of evaporative water consumption should be included there are complex and interacting effects between vegetation and climate on et and it is impossible to make a complete distinction between vegetation and the effects of climate change because vegetation also can respond to changes in land use types and climate conditions on one hand the changes in vapor pressure on account of climate change oppose influences on et because of their two way interaction contributing to a relatively small net effect on et on the other hand by reducing the transpiration of plants or producing long term hysteresis effect on et of the ecosystem climate change can also affect et through vegetation dynamics yang et al 2016a moreover vegetation productivity and vpd can also be enhanced by increases in nitrogen mineralization rates and temperature liang et al 2017 after coupling the water cycles between land and atmosphere the increased et may enhance the local precipitation via hydrological recycling which thereby increases the proportion of p available for runoff wy and soil moisture spracklen et al 2012 accordingly future research needs to pay more attention to the interplay between lai related biophysical processes and evaporative water consumption under climate modulations 5 conclusions with the goal of mitigating land degradation china contributed 25 of the global net increase in leaves as a result of its greening programs it is considerately necessary to quantify the influences of vegetation greening on surface energy partitioning and water budget based on the gis based pt jpl model including vegetation dynamics and different simulation experiments we found that the lai over mainland china increased significantly at a rate of 0 003 m2 m 2 yr 2 during the period 1982 2015 while the land surface albedo declined at a rate of 0 001 yr 2 p 0 05 due to the reduction in surface albedo more srad was absorbed by the plant canopy and more rnsrad was generated at the land surface accordingly the rn increased significantly during 1982 2015 over mainland china at a rate of 0 0594 w m 2 yr 2 primarily on account of the enhancement of rnsrad caused by surface albedo reduction and the increase in lrad generated by a positive greenhouse effect meanwhile the net radiation of the canopy increased at a rate of 0 42 w m 2 yr 2 p 0 01 while the annual mean net radiation of the soil surface over the country declined significantly at a rate of 0 3607 w m 2 yr 2 from 1982 to 2015 evapotranspiration exhibited increases at a rate of 0 39 mm yr2 which is 23 higher than the case without vegetation greening therefore the water budget has been substantially affected by the increased evaporative water consumption ultimately the ratio of wy reduced by 1 6 19 4 over the 11 river basins in mainland china notably the vegetation greening over mainland china increased the risk of wy reduction particularly in arid and semiarid river basins we have characterized the net effects of vegetation greening on surface energy and water budgets in mainland china and its 11 river basins providing additional information on regional surface energy partitioning and water budget and associated environmental changes this is of great significance to

4437,precipitation plays a key role in shaping land surface processes in himalaya it is also the most challenging meteorological variable to model in climate change studies due to inadequate ground data gridded precipitation products gpps are useful alternatives to ground data but require validation especially in topographically complex and wet eastern himalaya this study presents a fine scaled ground validation of eleven gpps including five satellite based gpm imergv06 trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42v7rt chirps 2 0 and persiann ccs four reanalysis model based era5 era5 land agera5 and wrf and two gauge interpolated imd 0 25 and aphrodite 2v18 gpps in eastern himalaya hourly precipitation data from 27 rain gauges gauges from sikkim representing the eastern himalayan climatology is used to statistically validate the gpps and assess their ability to capture diurnal and seasonal patterns and extreme events overall gpm imerg wrf and imd 0 25 outperformed the other satellite model and interpolated gpps respectively in comparison to gauges near real time trmm 3b42rtv7 performed better than trmm 3b42v7 for high intensity precipitation and large storms but not in overall performance chirps 2 0 and persiann ccs showed the least detectability and highest errors however persiann ccs was better at reproducing known spatial patterns in ground precipitation the gpps underestimated overestimated precipitation frequencies and volumes below above 3000 masl and high low intensities the highest detectability and lowest errors were observed at mid elevation 1000 2000 masl and in monsoon jjaso and summer mam whereas winter ndjf precipitation was overestimated with high false hits strong diurnal cycles in precipitation were observed in gauges with peaks around late night early morning 2300 0300 h in monsoon and afternoon evening 1600 1900 h in summer satellite gpps captured the diurnal cycle in gauges albeit with subdued amplitudes whereas model gpps failed owing to their superior performance and fine spatiotemporal resolutions gpm imerg and wrf are recommended for hydrological studies in eastern himalaya the three era5 based products era5 era5 land agera5 along with trmm 3b42rtv7 and imd 0 25 showed the lowest bias in tracking large storms longer than 5 days and are advocated for understanding extreme events and in geohazard applications imd 0 25 is recommended for precipitation trend and variability analysis albeit with suitable bias correction to address the negative biase at high elevations and the positive bias in trans himalayan regions the study improves our understanding of remotely sensed and spatially gridded precipitation in the world s highest mountain range where ground observations are likely to be inadequate for years to come keywords climate variability extreme precipitation events gridded precipitation products ground validation himalaya precipitation 1 introduction precipitation is one of the main drivers of land surface processes regional biogeography and water security in tropical mountains wohl et al 2012 in topographically complex mountains precipitation patterns are driven by non linear interactions between geomorphology steep elevation gradient and large scale atmospheric circulations beniston 2006 bookhagen and burbank 2006 jiang 2007 thus precipitation is the most challenging meteorological variable to model in climate change studies from mountains with further complications added by the changes in regional atmospheric moisture circulations induced by global warming körner 2007 krishnan et al 2019 modeling studies from himalaya predict declining precipitation trends in the western himalaya especially at low elevations whereas precipitation is predicted to increase in the eastern himalaya especially in mid high elevations krishnan et al 2019 ren et al 2017 however the accuracies of such predictions are highly dependent on the availability of fine scale ground precipitation data there is a lack of spatially distributed long term meteorological station data in the himalaya in general and eastern himalaya in particular krishnan et al 2020 li et al 2018 ren et al 2017 this limits our ability to characterize the regional hydro climatology understand ecosystem climate dynamics at finer scales and accurately predict extreme precipitation events epes and geohazards like flash floods and landslides in himalaya jena et al 2020 krishnan et al 2020 zhan et al 2017 gridded precipitation products gpps have emerged as a valuable alternative to sparse and topographically challenged rain gauge data in hydro meteorological studies bookhagen and burbank 2010 collischonn et al 2008 sun et al 2018 provide a comprehensive review of major gpps divided under three common typologies rain gauge interpolated gpps satellite based and models and reanalysis products the rain gauge interpolated hereafter referred to as interpolated gpps gpps are developed from a network of rain gauge stations and usually suffer from errors due to sparse gauge networks in complex mountains and underestimation bias in snow dominated high altitudes ménégoz et al 2013 yatagai et al 2012 satellite based hereafter referred to as satellite gpps gpps retrieve precipitation information from passive microwave and infra red sensors using combining algorithms and provide global or quasi global coverage sun et al 2018 weather forecast models and reanalysis approaches hereafter referred to as model gpps apply numerical and physical schemes over interpolated and satellite observations to develop spatially and temporally consistent precipitation products bannister et al 2019 ménégoz et al 2013 recent advances in computational abilities and data techniques have significantly improved the accuracy of model gpps and allowed them to achieve finer resolutions lin et al 2018 roy et al 2018 however most gpps are known to suffer from uncertainties and inaccuracies due to low gauge densities in complex terrains and require validation andermann et al 2011 beck et al 2017 daloz et al 2020 such validation studies provide useful insights into the inherent patterns and uncertainties within these products and possible bias correction mechanisms bannister et al 2019 manz et al 2017 sun et al 2018 table 1 provides a summary of key studies on validation of gpps in himalaya which suffer from five key knowledge gaps 1 lack of studies at finer sub daily temporal resolutions as bulk of validation work is performed at daily and or monthly timescales such studies fail to assess the ability of gpps to reproduce sub daily cycles like extreme precipitation events and diurnal precipitation which play a crucial part in local and regional ecohydrology norris et al 2017 yamamoto et al 2011 2 lack of studies using independent ground rain gauge data for validation of gpps citing paucity of ground data the studies performing ground validation are usually restricted to small geographical regions or have a low number of independent gauges norris et al 2017 roy et al 2018 shukla et al 2014 most other studies from india use imd 0 25 and or aphrodite 1 v11 gpps as the reference but these interpolated gpps have relatively fewer gauges in the himalaya bharti and singh 2015 duncan and biggs 2012 prakash et al 2018 3 fewer studies have explored the biases within interpolated gpps like imd 0 25 and or aphrodite 1 v11 using independent ground precipitation bhardwaj et al 2017 khandu et al 2016 li et al 2018 although both the gpps report high gauge density the distribution of gauging stations is disproportionately biased towards himalayan foothills and fewer stations exist at higher elevations 1000 masl which can induce significant biases with elevation and seasonality 4 relatively fewer studies from wetter and humid eastern himalaya than western and central himalaya khandu et al 2016 ménégoz et al 2013 and 5 lack of studies on gpps ability to track large precipitation storms and extreme events like cloud bursts in himalaya bharti 2015 bharti and singh 2015 nandargi 2015 in the study an exhaustive set of eleven gpps are ground validated using a high density independent rain gauge network in sikkim himalaya a global biodiversity hotspot and representative region of eastern himalaya the gpps include five satellite trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42rtv7 gpm 3imerghhv06 chirps 2 0 and persiann ccs four model based era5 era5 land agera5 and wrf and two interpolated imd 0 25 aphrodite 2v1801r1 gpps the study addresses three research questions 1 how well the gpps can observe events with precipitation and non events without precipitation in reference to gauges across different elevations seasons and precipitation intensities 2 how well the gpps capture spatiotemporal patterns in ground precipitation at seasonal and diurnal scales and 3 which gpps are better at tracking large storm events in complex mountains the study uses a combination of statistical validation techniques including detection indices and error metrics comparison of diurnal and seasonal time series analysis and precipitation event analysis the next section presents the data and methodology for comparing different gpp datasets followed by detailed results and discussions the last section presents concluding remarks 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area nestled

and more tropical than the western himalaya bookhagen and burbank 2010 nandargi 2015 fig 1 sikkim is characterized by high altitudinal gradients 300 8586 meters above sea level masl and greatly varying precipitation patterns both across space and time including periodic records of extreme events like cloud bursts krishna 2005 the region experiences three distinct seasons south west monsoon jjaso winter ndjf and summer mam nandargi 2015 sharma and rai 2004 most of the precipitation is concentrated in monsoon although mid elevations of sikkim also observe significant summer precipitation driven by moisture from the bay of bengal along with localized recirculation of convective clouds nandargi 2015 winter precipitation is dominated by snowfall at high elevations 3000 masl and is attributed to western disturbances originating from western asia and occasionally the atlantic ocean and north east monsoon pant et al 2017 kumar et al 2020 the seasons are also distinct in terms of their evaporative demands with higher temperatures and evapotranspiration in summer and monsoon than in winter yadav et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 ground precipitation hourly ground precipitation data were collected from 27 stations installed with tipping bucket rain gauges hereafter the ground precipitation data is referred to as gauge across sikkim these include 17 stations accessed through the meteorological oceanographic satellite data archival centre mosdac portal of the indian space research organisation isro which has been previously used for the improvement of gpps in india and as a reference layer to thunderstorm characterization using remotely sensed data in north eastern india kilaru et al 2016 thakur et al 2019 the remaining 10 stations include three automatic weather stations vantage pro davis net usa and seven tipping bucket rain gauges fitted with dataloggers that were installed during this study the rain gauges were periodically calibrated manually using the volumetric method santana et al 2018 the gauging datasets are independent of the gpps studied i e they have not been used for calibration or correction of the studied gpps the gauges were spread across an elevation range of 290 4000 masl with the bulk of them concentrated in the wetter southern eastern and western parts of sikkim fig 1b and c the gauge dataset was subjected to stringent quality control after which 48 27 of the data from january 2014 to december 2017 was used for the final analysis in the absence of any universal quality control protocol for gauge data the quality check was done independently for each gauge using a set of rules devised using the previous experience of the region and the available literature each dataset was tested for abnormally large or physically improbable hourly and daily precipitation values unusually long set of consecutive values physically improbably long dry spells e g during monsoon and improbable zero values at hourly and daily time resolutions blenkinsop et al 2017 einfalt and michaelides 2008 additionally for the five stations where streamflow time series were available any suspect precipitation values were visually compared with streamflow using event hydrographs and marked not available na the distribution of final gauge data along elevation is given in appendix a fig a 1 digital elevation model dem at 90 m resolution from nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm v4 was used to extract elevation in units of meters above sea level masl jarvis et al 2008 2 2 2 gridded precipitation products gpps in steep mountainous regions like eastern himalaya hydrological processes tend to have smaller scopes thus gpps with the finest spatial and temporal resolutions are important for hydro climatic applications like streamflow modeling and downscaling of regional climate models for predicting climate change impacts the selection of candidate gpps was based on three important criteria a priority was given to gpps with high spatial 0 25 pixel size and temporal sub daily or daily resolutions b longer time series data availability and c enabling comparative assessment of different types of gpps i e satellite based model based and gauge interpolated as detailed in table 1 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products and gpm 3imerghhv06 have been extensively used satellite based gpps in himalayan studies but have not been validated for wetter eastern himalaya the inclusion of trmm 3b42rtv7 was to explore the effect of gauge correction or the absence of it on the performance of tmpa products in complex mountainous regions with low gauge density liu 2015 chirps 2 0 0 05 and persiann 0 05 are two of the finest resolution gpps available which merited their inclusion persiann ccs hourly was preferred over persiannp cdr daily due to its higher temporal resolution among the model based gpps era5 is recommended over other contemporary global reanalysis models citing better assimilation schemes baudouin et al 2020 era5 land and agera5 are specifically derived at finer resolution from era5 for land based agro ecological studies and hence were added to the validation exercise the inclusion of finer resolution 0 14 wrf based gpp allowed us to test the performance of a gpp which has shown promising results over the indian sub continent daloz et al 2021 among the gauge interpolated gpps the indian meteorological department s 0 25 gpp and aphrodite v1 are widely used as the reference in gpp validation studies from india and asia referring to their high gauge density bharti and singh 2015 jena et al 2020 prakash et al 2018 on a closer look at the distribution of gauging stations used for producing imd only three are in sikkim along with 11 stations in the neighboring sub himalayan west bengal this provides an opportunity to assess the performance of indian meteorological department s gpp in the complex mountainous terrains of sikkim himalaya against an independent set of gauges additionally to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first to ground validate the recently released aphrodite 2v1801r1 datasets in himalaya together the mix of satellite model based and interpolated gpps forms an exhaustive set to be validated in complex himalayan terrains table 2 2 2 2 1 satellite precipitation products trmm 3b42v7 hereafter 3b42 is the main research level product of the multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa research scheme of tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm by national aeronautics and space administration usa huffman et al 2010 trmm 3b42rtv7 hereafter 3b42 rt is the real time product from the tmpa scheme without any gauge correction and additional post processing huffman et al 2010 in the coming days the tmpa products have been succeeded by the global precipitation mission gpm products like the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation mission gpm 3imerghhv06 finalrun hereafter imerg being jointly developed by japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa and nasa huffman et al 2019 chirps 2 0 hereafter chirps is a quasi global high resolution gpp which uses tmpa to calibrate the global cold cloud duration precipitation estimates funk et al 2015 musie et al 2019 precipitation estimation from remote sensing information using artificial neural network cloud classification system

as initial and boundary conditions for the years 2015 2017 was included in the validation the wrf model has been run with 35 vertical levels and at a horizontal resolution of 45 km 45 km for large parts of south asia spectral nudging to the era interim data was applied for temperature horizontal winds and geopotential height an overview of the parameterization schemes used in the wrf simulations is given in appendix a table a 3 a nested domain at 15 km 15 km resolution was implemented covering all of india and these results were resampled to 0 14 0 14 for the analysis here daloz et al 2021 2 2 2 3 gauge interpolated precipitation products the two rain gauge interpolated gpps include the indian meteorological department s pan india 0 25 gpp hereafter imd pai et al 2014 and the pan asian aphrodite 2v1801r1 hereafter aph v18 both developed from overlapping set of rain gauges from asia yatagai 2019 yatagai et al 2020 2012 sunilkumar et al 2019 found good agreement between imerg and aph v18 as a reference over nepal himalaya whereas the numerous applications of imd gpp have already been described in the introduction section 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 data processing the data processing analysis and visualization were done using r version 3 6 3 r core team 2019 under the rstudio environment rstudio team 2019 and map layers were produced using open source qgis version 3 14 1 qgis team 2019 for each gpp the geographical coordinates of each gauge were overlaid on the gpp grid and pixels containing at least one gauge were selected all the gauges within a given pixel were aggregated using simple arithmetic mean for comparison with corresponding gpp precipitation salio et al 2015 the gpps with sub daily temporal resolution imerg 3b42 3b42 rt era5 era5 land and wrf and their corresponding gauge precipitation were aggregated to daily totals for the validation a minimum precipitation intensity threshold of 0 3 mm and 2 5 mm were used for hourly and daily datasets respectively and time stamps with precipitation below the thresholds were assigned zero value jiang et al 2016 prakash et al 2015 the validation was carried out over the maximum overlapping period between the years 2014 2017 except for aph v18 which data was available for the overlapping period 2014 2015 only gauge density is the number of gauges in a pixel and is critical to ground validation exercise especially in gpps with large pixel size maggioni et al 2017 xie and xiong 2011 the average number of gauges per pixel varied from 3 2 1 6 for gpps with large pixel size 0 25 to 1 08 0 05 for the smallest pixel size gpp 0 04 the average minimum gauge distance computed as the distance between a gauge and its closest neighboring pair was high 11 8 8 km with a median of 9 km alluding to the relative sparseness of the gauges in the region kidd et al 2017 the gauge distance was comparable to similar validation studies with dense gauge network from southern india sunilkumar et al 2015a and the mountainous regions of europe feidas et al 2018 porcù et al 2014 2 3 2 statistical analysis three sets of analyses were used to assess the performance of gpps against gauges 2 detection indices and continuous error metrics 2 comparison of diurnal and seasonal patterns and 3 capturing large precipitation storms and extreme events detection indices tested the ability of gpps to accurately observe events with precipitation and non events zero precipitation based on a contingency matrix appendix a table a 1 false alarm ratio far is the ratio of falsely detected hits against total hits by a gpp whereas probability of detection pod denotes the ratio of correctly identified hits by a gpp critical score index csi is the ratio of correctly identified hits against total gpp hits and the frequency bias index fbi is the ratio of total gauge hits against total gpp hits far pod and csi are useful for understanding the ability of the gpp to detect precipitation events whereas fbi indicates overestimation above 1 or underestimation 1 of precipitation event frequency by a gpp accuracy acc focuses on the detectability of both events and non events heidke skill score hss is a more robust detectability index that accounts for any random detectability of events and non events jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the continuous error metrics quantified the magnitude and direction of errors with reference they were calculated for the accurately detected time steps only to avoid double reporting of errors manz et al 2017 tang et al 2015 mean error me is a measure of systematic error reporting the magnitude and direction of deviation between gpp and gauge whereas mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse are metrics of random error highlighting on large errors relative root mean square error rrmse was calculated by normalizing the rmse with pixel wise mean precipitation rate to remove the bias contributed by the observed north south precipitation gradient in sikkim manz et al 2017 relative bias rb is the percentage bias in precipitation volumes between gpp and gauge and quantifies underestimation negative and overestimation positive biases pearson s correlation coefficient cc was used as a measure of linear agreement between the gpp and gauge the equations for the detection indices and continuous error metrics are given in appendix a table a 2 for more details see bharti and singh 2015 xu et al 2017 the indices were estimated across elevation precipitation intensities and seasons and from finer to coarser temporal resolutions to assess changes in performance with aggregation over time the influence of spatial heterogeneity measured as the standard deviation in elevation within each pixel on gpp performance was estimated similarly the effect of gauge density on gpp performance was assessed by comparing the difference in performance between pixels with only one gauge against those with more than gauges we also computed variability in gpp performance with different gauge densities using an iterative sampling with a bootstrapping approach for each pixel in a gpp the corresponding gauges were randomly sampled with replacement and averaged for each day the number of gauges sampled at a time increased from one to the maximum number of gauges per pixel the averaged gauge precipitation was compared with the averaged gpp precipitation to estimate relative bias for days when both gpp and gauge detect precipitation and false alarm ratio far no rain when gpp detects precipitation but the corresponding gauge or gauges don t monthly and hourly binned averages were plotted to understand annual and seasonal patterns in precipitation respectively precipitation storm events were demarcated for gauge data using a threshold of 2 5 mm and an interevent time of 1 day and events longer than 5 days were selected gpp precipitation volumes for corresponding pixels and event days were compared and relative bias was estimated a 44 day long large storm event between 29th may 2015 11th july 2015 was extracted for further analysis the cloud burst event has reportedly caused the biggest floods in the past two decades and several landslides in sikkim darjeeling and kalimpong regions biswas and pal 2016 pal et al 2016 3 results 3 1 validation of gpps 3 1 1 performance and statistical errors at daily resolution imerg satellite wrf model and imd interpolated performed the best among their respective gpp types fig 2 they had low far 0 36 and high pod 0 68 acc 0 72 csi 0 47 and cc 0 42 scores indicating higher detectability of both events and non events higher hss scores 0 42 by imerg 3b42 wrf and imd underlined that their superior detectability was not an artifact of random chance among satellite gpps imerg 3b42 and 3b42 rt showed comparable abilities to detect events and non events whereas chirps and persiann showed lowest performance and highest errors 3b42 was closest to gauges in precipitation volumes with the lowest error values whereas imerg and persiann underestimated and 3b42 rt and chirps overestimated them 3b42 rt and chirps showed stronger bias in detecting extreme events with high rmse rrmse and rb errors in model gpps wrf performed the best with the lowest far close to 1 fbi values and highest pod acc csi and hss scores whereas era5 era5 land and agera5 had the highest pod and comparable csi scores but very low accuracy acc and hss scores suggesting their higher detectability are attributable to chance wrf underestimated precipitation volumes and had a lower correlation whereas the era products significantly overestimated them albeit with better correlation era5 performed marginally better than era5 land and agera5 with lower errors among the interpolated gpps imd performed marginally better in precipitation detectability whereas aph v18 had lower errors both the interpolated gpps overestimated precipitation event frequency but imd overestimated the volume whereas aph v18 underestimated it the gpps with finer spatial resolutions chirps and persiann showed poor detectability and high errors on filtering the results for pixels with more than one gauge chirps and persiann showed marked improvement in far fbi and hss scores appendix a fig a 2 chirps also showed a significant decline in me rrmse and rb whereas opposite trends were observed in persiann similarly imd and aph v18 showed marked improvements in hss scores and a reduction in errors of pixels with more than one gauge elevational heterogeneity was negatively correlated with performance scores except era5 and error volumes except aph v18 in the coarse resolution gpps 0 25 x 0 25 grid appendix a fig a 3 the bootstrapping analysis on gpp performance as a function of gauge density suggests that the optimal number of gauges per pixel are three four and five for pixel sizes of 0 1 0 14 and 0 25 respectively in terms of relative bias appendix a fig a 4a the far no rain values stabilized at three gauges per pixel across the differentgpps appendix a fig a 4b we had at least one third of the pixels with three or more gauges for large pixel sized 0 25 gpps when compared at different temporal resolutions all the sub daily gpps showed marked improvement in performance indices and correlation at daily time step fig 3 the model gpps era5 and era5 land significantly overestimated precipitation frequency at sub daily timesteps whereas 3b42 and 3b42 rt marginally underestimated the same from hourly to daily resolutions the negative mean error me increased for imerg and wrf positive me decreased for 3b42 and 3b42 rt and transitioned from negative to positive error for era5 and era5 land the absolute values of mae and rmse increased with aggregation but relative random errors rrmse declined marginally 3 1 2 performance and errors across elevation the gpps showed similar patterns in performance and error metrics with elevation fig 4 the detectability of events and non events peaked at mid elevations 1000 3000 masl and declined on either side of it low elevation 0 1000 masl saw over detection of both events pod and non events far however the detectability improved between mid high elevations 1000 4000 masl imerg wrf and imd were least affected by elevation with relatively stable performance across the different elevations era5 performed marginally better than era5 land and agera5 at mid high elevations 1000 4000 masl all gpps except persiann showed positive errors and bias at low elevation 0 1000 masl and underestimation bias at high elevations 3000 masl persiann wrf and aph v18 showed consistent underestimation of precipitation volumes across elevations the overestimation bias in imd was dominated by large positive errors at low elevation 1000 masl minimal errors in mid elevations 1000 3000 masl and negative errors above it all gpps except the era5 products and imd show uniform decline in precipitation with increasing latitude and elevation albeit with varying degrees of slopes appendix a fig a 5 wrf showed a weak bi modal pattern with peaks at lower 500 m and mid elevation 2000 m and latitudes conversely the era5 gpps era5 era5 land and agera5 showed unimodal patterns with a precipitation peak around 1000 1500 m elevation and steep decline afterward except agera5 in which the slope of decline was gentle till 4000 m and then declined rapidly lastly imd showed a marginal decline in precipitation between 2000 4000 m elevation an anomaly that may contribute to overestimation bias at higher elevation as observed earlier 3 1 3 performance and errors across seasons the gpps performed exceedingly well during monsoon in comparison to summer with higher detectability and lower bias fig 5 overall imerg 3b42 wrf and imd performed well across all seasons except in winter persiann and aph v18 underestimated summer and monsoon precipitation volumes 3b42 rt and chirps grossly overestimated precipitation frequencies in winter and underestimated in monsoon and summer they also exhibited strong positive bias and large rrmse values in summer and winter imerg persiann imd and aph v18 performed the best in winter whereas 3b42 and wrf had the lowest errors 3b42 rt in summer and imd and era products era5 era5 land and agera5 in winter showed very strong overestimation bias in detecting precipitation frequency and volume 3 1 4 performance and errors at different precipitation intensities across the gpps the performance and error issues were associated with overestimation of the frequency and volume of very low intensity events 10 mm d 1 fig 6 imerg 3b42 wrf imd and aph v18 performed well across different intensities whereas imerg persiann wrf imd and aph v18 had the lowest errors among their respective gpp types the gpps rarely misidentified a non event at relatively higher intensities 10 mm d 1 with perfect detection scores except for chirps persiann and wrf which exhibited a modal peak in performance at low moderate intensities 10 90 mm d 1 however zero hss scores indicated that improved performance at intensities greater than 10 mm d 1 was attributable to either random chance or scarcity of data points era5 era5 land and agera5 largely misidentified the frequency and volume of low intensity precipitation 10 mm d 1 and underestimated intensities greater than 60 mm d 1 the initial increasing trends in mae and rmse with intensities indicate a positive correlation between error magnitude and precipitation intensity however the declining trend in rrmse and rb indicated that the bulk of the errors are concentrated around observing light precipitation events 3 2 diurnal and seasonal patterns in precipitation the gpps ability to capture seasonal and diurnal patterns is critical for modeling long term precipitation shifts as well as localised sub daily hydrological processes both the interpolated gpps imd and aph v18 as well as wrf imerg and chirps reproduced the seasonal patterns in gauge precipitation with significant errors fig 7 a the measured gauge precipitation peaked in june and july months whereas the precipitation estimates by satellite and model gpps peaked in july and august respectively imd and aphrodite captured the june peak but significantly underestimated july precipitation satellite gpps typically underestimated monsoon precipitation except 3b42 rt with largest negative errors in persiann 608 mm month 1 followed by imerg 433 mm month 1 chirps 399 mm month 1 and 3b42 297 mm month 1 fig 7b conversely the model based gpps except wrf overestimated precipitation in all seasons with the largest positive errors by agera5 631 mm month 1 followed by era5 422 mm month 1 and era5 land 381 mm month 1 3b42 rt 239 mm month 1 and wrf 336 mm month 1 showed the least error in monsoon the satellite gpps except 3b42 rt and wrf underestimated summer precipitation whereas the era5 products overestimated them imd showed positive error 115 mm month 1 in summer whereas both imd 160 mm month 1 and aph v18 233 mm month 1 showed negative errors in monsoon strong diurnal patterns in precipitation were observed in both gauge and sub daily satellite gpps imerg 3b42 3b42 rt and persiann fig 8 in gauges the monsoon precipitation peaked around midnight 2300 0100 h whereas imerg 3b42 3b42 rt and persiann showed a distinct pre dawn peak 0300 0400 h conversely the model based gpps era5 era5 land and wrf exhibited bi modal patterns in diurnal precipitation with a large primary peak in mid day and a smaller secondary peak in late night seasonally monsoon precipitation was dominated by the night early morning peaks whereas summer precipitation peaked in the afternoon evening period interestingly in gauge and sub daily satellite gpps the peak precipitation in summer shifted to the afternoon 1600 1900 h whereas winter rains did not exhibit any significant diurnal pattern the seasonal and elevational patterns in diurnal patterns were consistent among the gauges and the sub daily gpps the satellite gpps underestimated diurnal amplitudes in comparison to gauges around mid elevations 1500 3000 masl in both monsoon and summer 3 3 capturing precipitation from large storm events this section details the ability of gpps to capture large storm events in comparison to gauges which are critical for natural hazards and disaster preparedness in himalaya all gpps typically underestimated the precipitation volume of large storms except era5 products fig 9 the bias was least for interpolated gpps with imd 11 57 showing lesser bias than aph v18 33 34 among satellite gpps 3b42 rt 24 71 came closest to capturing large storms followed by 3b42 40 49 imerg 50 38 and chirps 54 40 whereas persiann 81 24 showed largest negative bias among model gpps only wrf 48 51 showed negative bias while agera5 45 85 era5 land 39 77 and era5 36 77 showed strong positive bias across elevation when compared for pixels at low and high elevations above and below 2000 masl all gpps showed significantly larger underestimation bias at high elevation except for persiann agera5 and imd the differential abilities of the different gpps in detecting large storms are further shown in fig 10 which compares the precipitation time series of gauge with gpps for a 44 day long storm event 29 05 2015 to 11 07 2015 starting in late summer and extending well into the monsoon the first part of the event 29 05 2015 to 15 06 2015 was reported as a cloud burst event with several days of high intensity 50 mm precipitation causing massive flash floods and numerous landslides in the teesta river basin and its tributaries pal et al 2016 the later part of the event 15 06 2015 to 11 07 2015 was more subdued with persistent medium to low intensity 7 50 mm precipitation the three era5 based gpps era5 era land and agera5 showed less than 14 bias and were the best gpps for capturing large storms along with imd which closely captured both parts of the events with minor lag era5 closely captured the initial part of the storm but overestimated the later low mid intensity phase whereas wrf largely missed the initial part of the event leading to significant negative bias aph v18 also closely followed the later part of the storm but underestimated the initial periods of peak precipitation the satellite gpps except for 3b42 rt significantly underestimated the initial high intensity part of the storm but were able to track the later low mid intensity phase well persiann and to a lesser extent chirps missed the entire event 4 discussion 4 1 validation of gpps the validation of pixel based gridded products with point data from gauges is confounded by issues of scale wind driven under catch interception and evaporation losses and spatiotemporal mismatch making it difficult to compare gpps of different pixel resolutions however it holds validity as a ground truthing exercise with numerous studies looking at its conceptual and empirical foundations bell and kundu 2003 jung et al 2014 tang et al 2018 the present study uses statistical validation techniques to explore capabilities and biases in a set of gpps in the complex and wet mountainous terrain of eastern himalaya overall imerg wrf and imd emerged as the best gpps for quantifying and mapping precipitation over time and space in eastern himalaya the underestimation and detection errors for imerg has been previously attributed to issues with the detection of low level clouds arulraj and barros 2019 the improved performance of imerg over its predecessors 3b42 agrees with previous studies from india and andes manz et al 2017 prakash et al 2018 the performance and error scores of 3b42 showed improvement in comparison to western himalaya although the patterns with elevation and seasonality were consistent bharti and singh 2015 hussain et al 2017 and were similar to reports from neighboring bhutan khandu et al 2016 xue et al 2013 3b42 rt showed lower detectability and positive bias than 3b42 for himalaya in agreement with reports from the indian subcontinent shah and mishra 2016 and global assessments beck et al 2019 liu 2015 similar exploration in the performance of imerg over tibet reported higher detection of false events by the gauge corrected product than in the non corrected product lu and yong 2018 the finest pixel resolution gpps chirps and persiann showed limited detectability in comparison to other gpps however chirps showed significant overestimation bias in contrast to the reports from neighboring bhutan khandu et al 2016 whereas the underestimation bias seen in persiann was in agreement with previous reports gebregiorgis and hossain 2015 among the model based gpps wrf outperformed the era products with better scores lower errors and reproduction of spatial precipitation patterns it holds promise for hydrometeorological usage in himalaya the three era products show very good detectability of events and good correlation coefficients with marginally better scores by era5 than era5 land and agera5 however the three products had high false hits lower accuracies and overestimated precipitation frequencies especially in winter suggesting that the era model over detected both events and non events with a strong positive bias for solid precipitation the spatial patterns of precipitation by era products show the highest precipitation in mid elevations of central sikkim which coupled with high overestimation bias hints at overdependence of the underlying parameterization schemes on elevation for modeling precipitation similar overestimation bias in other model based products has been previously observed in tropical andes silva et al 2011 imd and aphrodite are some of the longest available time series gpps for himalaya and are invaluable in assessing long term precipitation trends and variability the improved performance of imd in mid altitudes 1000 3000 masl could be attributable to the higher number of rain gauges located at mid elevations in the neighboring sub himalayan west bengal the overestimation in lower elevation is attributable to algorithmic issues and underestimation at higher elevations also observed in aph v18 to paucity of high altitude stations and the inability to observe solid precipitation ménégoz et al 2013 this further explains the abnormally higher annual precipitation 2500 mm and annual rainy days 150 days shown by imd at high elevation 3000 masl in central northern sikkim part of which are trans himalayan regions in with cold desert like climatology in comparison to aphrodite 1 data not shown here the precipitation maps provided by nandargi and dhar 2015 who used gauge interpolated data also suffered from the same anomaly and could be again attributed to the lack of spatially disaggregated and high elevation gauges in sikkim and eastern himalaya additionally the improved performance and reduced errors of imd and aph v18 in pixels with more than one gauge further stress on the inclusion of more stations for improvement of gauge interpolated products in complex terrains like himalaya where elevational heterogeneity was another major source of error the contrary patterns between in elevational heterogeneity and performance scores and error volumes in the gpps merits further investigations the overall improvement in performance across the gpps on aggregation from sub daily to daily time resolutions could be partially attributable to randomness however the observed decline in relative random errors rrmse suggests that the random error variance could be associated with an increase in individual errors random or measurement errors with a higher number of events and or larger errors by gpps at finer temporal resolutions due to temporal lags the weaker detectability at low elevations 1000 masl and high elevations 2000 masl and in winter could be confounded by the relatively higher gauge density in the low mid elevation 1000 3000 masl and the general inability of gpps in detecting solid precipitation at high elevations 3000 masl the gpps especially the three era5 products typically overestimated winter precipitation due to falsely identifying winter events although the scores might be influenced by the relatively fewer number of winter events the overestimation in summer and monsoon was relatively less high acc scores in winter indicate that the gpps identified non events with greater confidence except for era products the over detection and overestimation of light precipitation 10 mm d 1 and accurate but underestimation moderate high intensities 60 mm d 1 is consistent with previous reports highlighting the dual problems of false detection of shallow precipitation over mountains and under detection of convective precipitation ning et al 2017 sunilkumar et al 2015b it should be noted that most of the gauges are located in the southern half of sikkim and for some of the precipitation products relatively few grid boxes have been used for the comparison e g around 20 grid boxes for imerg see fig 1c due to the high altitudinal gradients in this region high resolution is important for representing the spatial precipitation pattern correctly and this may partly explain why imerg and wrf show better performance than other gpps the decline in precipitation with increasing elevation and latitude has been reported by bookhagen and burbank 2010 2006 using data from 3b42 while bookhagen and burbank 2006 report a modal peak in precipitation similar to seen in the era5 gpps bookhagen and burbank 2010 show a uniform decline in precipitation similar to the remaining gpps except imd the absence of negative relationships between precipitation with elevation and latitude is a point of concern highlighting the positive bias in imd gpp at high elevation and deeper into the himalaya most likely to be linked to the absence of gauging stations 4 2 seasonal and diurnal patterns in precipitation in sikkim the ability of the different gpps to capture spatiotemporal patterns in ground precipitation was visually assessed imerg wrf and persiann came closest to replicating the spatial patterns of precipitation in sikkim in reference to the annual precipitation isohyet prepared by karan 1989 other fine scaled gpps including chirps era5 land and agera5 failed to detect the regional peculiarities like scant precipitation 1500 mm yr 1 in the rain shadow parts of southern sikkim 1000 masl and high precipitation 3500 mm yr 1 in eastern and western sikkim 2000 masl in a validation exercise such conditions will show up as positive bias at low elevations and negative bias at higher elevations similar to the obtained results this underlines the limited abilities of gpps to mimic local peculiarities in complex mountain terrains despite the limited performance the finer spatial resolution of persiann allowed it to reproduce the reported spatial distribution of ground precipitation in karan 1989 the june july peak in gauge precipitation in sikkim is characteristically distinct seetharam 2008 soja and starkel 2007 due to the region s proximity to the bay of bengal where the indian monsoon originates in contrast the delayed peaks in july august reported from western himalaya khatiwada et al 2016 nandargi 2015 and nepal dahal et al 2019 gabet et al 2004 are explained by the time taken by the monsoon to travel westwards the underestimation of june precipitation by satellite and model gpps could be due to the relative under representation of ground stations from eastern himalaya in global precipitation datasets used for calibration by the gpps the observed diurnal precipitation cycles in gauge and satellite gpps were consistent with reports of nocturnal precipitation in himalaya a phenomenon unique to monsoon in himalaya against a predominantly afternoon precipitation seen in most of the inland regions across the globe barros and lang 2003 bhatt et al 2014 the amplitude of the diurnal cycle was lower in satellite gpps in comparison to gauges similar discrepancies in imerg s ability to detect low intensity precipitation and diurnal patterns have been observed across wet and dry periods oliveira et al 2016 the contrary diurnal patterns observed in model based gpps with stronger peaks in afternoon and late night have been attributed to the boundary layer data and parameterization schemes and the inability to track convective processes operating at coarser spatial resolutions bhatt et al 2014 krishnamurti et al 2007 bhatt et al 2014 have also demonstrated that the wrf model with boundary condition data from norwegian earth system model gives a better representation of diurnal cycles in himalaya than the wrf model with era interim reanalysis data as used in the present study bentsen et al 2013 sato et al 2008 and prein et al 2015 recommend finer spatial resolution grids of 7 km and 4 km respectively for effectively modeling convective processes in high altitudes conversely the satellite gpps are primarily based on cloud observations and not entirely dependent on parameterization schemes resulting in better diurnal representation even at relatively coarser spatial resolutions 4 3 capturing large precipitation storm events the monitoring of a continuous large storm with both cloud burst initial part and consistent low mid intensity precipitation later part provided useful insights into the capabilities of the gpps in complex terrains sikkim is one of the wettest parts of the himalaya and bears the brunt of the numerous storms originating from the bay of bengal nandargi 2015 large storms with extended periods of continuous precipitation are also the primary cause of periodic flash floods and landslides in the region hamada et al 2015 sengupta et al 2010 while studies have focused on the detectability of extreme daily events bharti and singh 2015 few have looked at the ability of gpps to track large precipitation storms and extreme events like cloud bursts which could enable landslide and geohazard forecasting in himalaya the underestimation bias exhibited by gpps is common as the precipitation intensities in large storms can vary considerably over space and time zhou et al 2015 for example during the same storm period the maximum daily rainfall reported by our gauge at kyongnosla alpine sanctuary in east sikkim 120 mm was almost half of that reported by other regional gauges at sevoke 220 mm and kalimpong 254 mm biswas and pal 2016 pal et al 2016 thus while considerable spatial variability in precipitation in a large regional storm is expected the era5 based gpps along with 3b42 rt and imd were still able to capture the precipitation pattern with a degree of certainty the improved capabilities of the era5 products over era interim in tracking large storms have been previously reported for eight historical storm events observed across the globe dullaart et al 2020 3b42 rt and imd were the other two gpps with the least bias whereas persiann performed the worst similar to reports from himalaya jena et al 2020 and mediterranean europe brunetti et al 2018 the improved performance of 3b42 rt over 3b42 was in concordance with previous studies from the usa and africa li et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 5 conclusions gridded products are crucial for precipitation data based applications in hydrology mitigating effects of extreme precipitation events and detecting deficiencies in downscaled regional climate model performance however careful ground validation of gpps is imperative in complex mountains like himalaya for improved model performance and accuracy of predictions significant knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the performance of different gpps in the wet eastern himalaya especially at fine spatiotemporal resolutions and in their ability to track large precipitation storms and extreme events like cloud bursts there is a general lack of literature on validation of interpolated gpps in himalaya which are widely used as reference datasets themselves the study tests the efficacy of different types of gpps and highlights their importance for understanding the precipitation patterns in topographically complex and data scarce regions like eastern himalaya significant inherent biases in different gpps are demonstrated across elevation seasonality and precipitation intensities and validation of gpps is strongly recommended using ground precipitation in the eastern himalayan region imerg and wrf provided the ideal combination of high spatial and temporal resolutions and are most suited for large catchment based hydrological studies in concordance to reports from china brunetti et al 2018 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 jiang et al 2018 the recently released version 2 of high asia refined analysis har v2 derived from wrf and era5 and the aimerg gpp produced by calibrating imerg with aphrodite 1 holds much promise for the region and requires validation ma et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the success of the three era5 based products in detecting large precipitation storms despite an overall over detection bias shows a horses for courses approach is more suited for choosing the appropriate gpps for a specific goal together with 3b42 rt and imd the three era5 products may be best suited for landslide and geohazards forecasting in himalaya brunetti et al 2018 dullaart et al 2020 despite showing poor detectability and high negative bias persiann could reproduce the spatial precipitation pattern and holds promise among the high spatial resolution gpps imd and aphrodite are widely used as reference datasets for validating satellite products in indian himalaya and our study is the first to evaluate their performance in complex topography using fine scale ground precipitation data the systemic negative bias shown by imd and aphrodite gpps at high elevation suggests a lack of representative gauge data and prior validation of the dataset with ground precipitation is advised before application as a reference dataset in future gpp validation studies from himalaya and india the significance of elevational heterogeneity and the importance of rain gauge density in the performance of gpps in mountains is reiterated further the ability inability of satellite model gpps in capturing diurnal precipitation cycle and small sub daily convective processes opens exciting opportunities and challenges in using gpps for modeling fine scale bio geochemical and ecohydrological cycles in himalaya we summarise that imerg wrf and imd are best among satellite based model based and interpolation based gpps respectively for detecting precipitation in the region the superior abilities of the satellite based gpps in reproducing seasonal and diurnal precipitation patterns seen in gauges than model based gpps are demonstrated we also highlight that modeling sub daily and sub regional cycles in complex montane terrains is still a major challenge which requires more focus and effort the improved performance of model based gpps in detecting large storms is encouraging especially for improving the accuracy of extreme event predictions using ensemble regional climate models being the first detailed exploration of precipitation in eastern himalaya the study highlights the importance of investing in climate monitoring of infrastructure and the potential of using gridded precipitation products for developing suitable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in himalaya the study will enhance the capabilities of both mechanistic and data based hydrological models to be used with appropriate choices of precipitation products in this region as well as the validation of downscaled and

4437,precipitation plays a key role in shaping land surface processes in himalaya it is also the most challenging meteorological variable to model in climate change studies due to inadequate ground data gridded precipitation products gpps are useful alternatives to ground data but require validation especially in topographically complex and wet eastern himalaya this study presents a fine scaled ground validation of eleven gpps including five satellite based gpm imergv06 trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42v7rt chirps 2 0 and persiann ccs four reanalysis model based era5 era5 land agera5 and wrf and two gauge interpolated imd 0 25 and aphrodite 2v18 gpps in eastern himalaya hourly precipitation data from 27 rain gauges gauges from sikkim representing the eastern himalayan climatology is used to statistically validate the gpps and assess their ability to capture diurnal and seasonal patterns and extreme events overall gpm imerg wrf and imd 0 25 outperformed the other satellite model and interpolated gpps respectively in comparison to gauges near real time trmm 3b42rtv7 performed better than trmm 3b42v7 for high intensity precipitation and large storms but not in overall performance chirps 2 0 and persiann ccs showed the least detectability and highest errors however persiann ccs was better at reproducing known spatial patterns in ground precipitation the gpps underestimated overestimated precipitation frequencies and volumes below above 3000 masl and high low intensities the highest detectability and lowest errors were observed at mid elevation 1000 2000 masl and in monsoon jjaso and summer mam whereas winter ndjf precipitation was overestimated with high false hits strong diurnal cycles in precipitation were observed in gauges with peaks around late night early morning 2300 0300 h in monsoon and afternoon evening 1600 1900 h in summer satellite gpps captured the diurnal cycle in gauges albeit with subdued amplitudes whereas model gpps failed owing to their superior performance and fine spatiotemporal resolutions gpm imerg and wrf are recommended for hydrological studies in eastern himalaya the three era5 based products era5 era5 land agera5 along with trmm 3b42rtv7 and imd 0 25 showed the lowest bias in tracking large storms longer than 5 days and are advocated for understanding extreme events and in geohazard applications imd 0 25 is recommended for precipitation trend and variability analysis albeit with suitable bias correction to address the negative biase at high elevations and the positive bias in trans himalayan regions the study improves our understanding of remotely sensed and spatially gridded precipitation in the world s highest mountain range where ground observations are likely to be inadequate for years to come keywords climate variability extreme precipitation events gridded precipitation products ground validation himalaya precipitation 1 introduction precipitation is one of the main drivers of land surface processes regional biogeography and water security in tropical mountains wohl et al 2012 in topographically complex mountains precipitation patterns are driven by non linear interactions between geomorphology steep elevation gradient and large scale atmospheric circulations beniston 2006 bookhagen and burbank 2006 jiang 2007 thus precipitation is the most challenging meteorological variable to model in climate change studies from mountains with further complications added by the changes in regional atmospheric moisture circulations induced by global warming körner 2007 krishnan et al 2019 modeling studies from himalaya predict declining precipitation trends in the western himalaya especially at low elevations whereas precipitation is predicted to increase in the eastern himalaya especially in mid high elevations krishnan et al 2019 ren et al 2017 however the accuracies of such predictions are highly dependent on the availability of fine scale ground precipitation data there is a lack of spatially distributed long term meteorological station data in the himalaya in general and eastern himalaya in particular krishnan et al 2020 li et al 2018 ren et al 2017 this limits our ability to characterize the regional hydro climatology understand ecosystem climate dynamics at finer scales and accurately predict extreme precipitation events epes and geohazards like flash floods and landslides in himalaya jena et al 2020 krishnan et al 2020 zhan et al 2017 gridded precipitation products gpps have emerged as a valuable alternative to sparse and topographically challenged rain gauge data in hydro meteorological studies bookhagen and burbank 2010 collischonn et al 2008 sun et al 2018 provide a comprehensive review of major gpps divided under three common typologies rain gauge interpolated gpps satellite based and models and reanalysis products the rain gauge interpolated hereafter referred to as interpolated gpps gpps are developed from a network of rain gauge stations and usually suffer from errors due to sparse gauge networks in complex mountains and underestimation bias in snow dominated high altitudes ménégoz et al 2013 yatagai et al 2012 satellite based hereafter referred to as satellite gpps gpps retrieve precipitation information from passive microwave and infra red sensors using combining algorithms and provide global or quasi global coverage sun et al 2018 weather forecast models and reanalysis approaches hereafter referred to as model gpps apply numerical and physical schemes over interpolated and satellite observations to develop spatially and temporally consistent precipitation products bannister et al 2019 ménégoz et al 2013 recent advances in computational abilities and data techniques have significantly improved the accuracy of model gpps and allowed them to achieve finer resolutions lin et al 2018 roy et al 2018 however most gpps are known to suffer from uncertainties and inaccuracies due to low gauge densities in complex terrains and require validation andermann et al 2011 beck et al 2017 daloz et al 2020 such validation studies provide useful insights into the inherent patterns and uncertainties within these products and possible bias correction mechanisms bannister et al 2019 manz et al 2017 sun et al 2018 table 1 provides a summary of key studies on validation of gpps in himalaya which suffer from five key knowledge gaps 1 lack of studies at finer sub daily temporal resolutions as bulk of validation work is performed at daily and or monthly timescales such studies fail to assess the ability of gpps to reproduce sub daily cycles like extreme precipitation events and diurnal precipitation which play a crucial part in local and regional ecohydrology norris et al 2017 yamamoto et al 2011 2 lack of studies using independent ground rain gauge data for validation of gpps citing paucity of ground data the studies performing ground validation are usually restricted to small geographical regions or have a low number of independent gauges norris et al 2017 roy et al 2018 shukla et al 2014 most other studies from india use imd 0 25 and or aphrodite 1 v11 gpps as the reference but these interpolated gpps have relatively fewer gauges in the himalaya bharti and singh 2015 duncan and biggs 2012 prakash et al 2018 3 fewer studies have explored the biases within interpolated gpps like imd 0 25 and or aphrodite 1 v11 using independent ground precipitation bhardwaj et al 2017 khandu et al 2016 li et al 2018 although both the gpps report high gauge density the distribution of gauging stations is disproportionately biased towards himalayan foothills and fewer stations exist at higher elevations 1000 masl which can induce significant biases with elevation and seasonality 4 relatively fewer studies from wetter and humid eastern himalaya than western and central himalaya khandu et al 2016 ménégoz et al 2013 and 5 lack of studies on gpps ability to track large precipitation storms and extreme events like cloud bursts in himalaya bharti 2015 bharti and singh 2015 nandargi 2015 in the study an exhaustive set of eleven gpps are ground validated using a high density independent rain gauge network in sikkim himalaya a global biodiversity hotspot and representative region of eastern himalaya the gpps include five satellite trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42rtv7 gpm 3imerghhv06 chirps 2 0 and persiann ccs four model based era5 era5 land agera5 and wrf and two interpolated imd 0 25 aphrodite 2v1801r1 gpps the study addresses three research questions 1 how well the gpps can observe events with precipitation and non events without precipitation in reference to gauges across different elevations seasons and precipitation intensities 2 how well the gpps capture spatiotemporal patterns in ground precipitation at seasonal and diurnal scales and 3 which gpps are better at tracking large storm events in complex mountains the study uses a combination of statistical validation techniques including detection indices and error metrics comparison of diurnal and seasonal time series analysis and precipitation event analysis the next section presents the data and methodology for comparing different gpp datasets followed by detailed results and discussions the last section presents concluding remarks 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area nestled between eastern nepal and bhutan the indian state of sikkim 27 28 n and 88 89 e presents the first altitudinal barrier for the monsoonal winds from the bay of bengal and thus is significantly wetter and more tropical than the western himalaya bookhagen and burbank 2010 nandargi 2015 fig 1 sikkim is characterized by high altitudinal gradients 300 8586 meters above sea level masl and greatly varying precipitation patterns both across space and time including periodic records of extreme events like cloud bursts krishna 2005 the region experiences three distinct seasons south west monsoon jjaso winter ndjf and summer mam nandargi 2015 sharma and rai 2004 most of the precipitation is concentrated in monsoon although mid elevations of sikkim also observe significant summer precipitation driven by moisture from the bay of bengal along with localized recirculation of convective clouds nandargi 2015 winter precipitation is dominated by snowfall at high elevations 3000 masl and is attributed to western disturbances originating from western asia and occasionally the atlantic ocean and north east monsoon pant et al 2017 kumar et al 2020 the seasons are also distinct in terms of their evaporative demands with higher temperatures and evapotranspiration in summer and monsoon than in winter yadav et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 ground precipitation hourly ground precipitation data were collected from 27 stations installed with tipping bucket rain gauges hereafter the ground precipitation data is referred to as gauge across sikkim these include 17 stations accessed through the meteorological oceanographic satellite data archival centre mosdac portal of the indian space research organisation isro which has been previously used for the improvement of gpps in india and as a reference layer to thunderstorm characterization using remotely sensed data in north eastern india kilaru et al 2016 thakur et al 2019 the remaining 10 stations include three automatic weather stations vantage pro davis net usa and seven tipping bucket rain gauges fitted with dataloggers that were installed during this study the rain gauges were periodically calibrated manually using the volumetric method santana et al 2018 the gauging datasets are independent of the gpps studied i e they have not been used for calibration or correction of the studied gpps the gauges were spread across an elevation range of 290 4000 masl with the bulk of them concentrated in the wetter southern eastern and western parts of sikkim fig 1b and c the gauge dataset was subjected to stringent quality control after which 48 27 of the data from january 2014 to december 2017 was used for the final analysis in the absence of any universal quality control protocol for gauge data the quality check was done independently for each gauge using a set of rules devised using the previous experience of the region and the available literature each dataset was tested for abnormally large or physically improbable hourly and daily precipitation values unusually long set of consecutive values physically improbably long dry spells e g during monsoon and improbable zero values at hourly and daily time resolutions blenkinsop et al 2017 einfalt and michaelides 2008 additionally for the five stations where streamflow time series were available any suspect precipitation values were visually compared with streamflow using event hydrographs and marked not available na the distribution of final gauge data along elevation is given in appendix a fig a 1 digital elevation model dem at 90 m resolution from nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm v4 was used to extract elevation in units of meters above sea level masl jarvis et al 2008 2 2 2 gridded precipitation products gpps in steep mountainous regions like eastern himalaya hydrological processes tend to have smaller scopes thus gpps with the finest spatial and temporal resolutions are important for hydro climatic applications like streamflow modeling and downscaling of regional climate models for predicting climate change impacts the selection of candidate gpps was based on three important criteria a priority was given to gpps with high spatial 0 25 pixel size and temporal sub daily or daily resolutions b longer time series data availability and c enabling comparative assessment of different types of gpps i e satellite based model based and gauge interpolated as detailed in table 1 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products and gpm 3imerghhv06 have been extensively used satellite based gpps in himalayan studies but have not been validated for wetter eastern himalaya the inclusion of trmm 3b42rtv7 was to explore the effect of gauge correction or the absence of it on the performance of tmpa products in complex mountainous regions with low gauge density liu 2015 chirps 2 0 0 05 and persiann 0 05 are two of the finest resolution gpps available which merited their inclusion persiann ccs hourly was preferred over persiannp cdr daily due to its higher temporal resolution among the model based gpps era5 is recommended over other contemporary global reanalysis models citing better assimilation schemes baudouin et al 2020 era5 land and agera5 are specifically derived at finer resolution from era5 for land based agro ecological studies and hence were added to the validation exercise the inclusion of finer resolution 0 14 wrf based gpp allowed us to test the performance of a gpp which has shown promising results over the indian sub continent daloz et al 2021 among the gauge interpolated gpps the indian meteorological department s 0 25 gpp and aphrodite v1 are widely used as the reference in gpp validation studies from india and asia referring to their high gauge density bharti and singh 2015 jena et al 2020 prakash et al 2018 on a closer look at the distribution of gauging stations used for producing imd only three are in sikkim along with 11 stations in the neighboring sub himalayan west bengal this provides an opportunity to assess the performance of indian meteorological department s gpp in the complex mountainous terrains of sikkim himalaya against an independent set of gauges additionally to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first to ground validate the recently released aphrodite 2v1801r1 datasets in himalaya together the mix of satellite model based and interpolated gpps forms an exhaustive set to be validated in complex himalayan terrains table 2 2 2 2 1 satellite precipitation products trmm 3b42v7 hereafter 3b42 is the main research level product of the multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa research scheme of tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm by national aeronautics and space administration usa huffman et al 2010 trmm 3b42rtv7 hereafter 3b42 rt is the real time product from the tmpa scheme without any gauge correction and additional post processing huffman et al 2010 in the coming days the tmpa products have been succeeded by the global precipitation mission gpm products like the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation mission gpm 3imerghhv06 finalrun hereafter imerg being jointly developed by japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa and nasa huffman et al 2019 chirps 2 0 hereafter chirps is a quasi global high resolution gpp which uses tmpa to calibrate the global

as initial and boundary conditions for the years 2015 2017 was included in the validation the wrf model has been run with 35 vertical levels and at a horizontal resolution of 45 km 45 km for large parts of south asia spectral nudging to the era interim data was applied for temperature horizontal winds and geopotential height an overview of the parameterization schemes used in the wrf simulations is given in appendix a table a 3 a nested domain at 15 km 15 km resolution was implemented covering all of india and these results were resampled to 0 14 0 14 for the analysis here daloz et al 2021 2 2 2 3 gauge interpolated precipitation products the two rain gauge interpolated gpps include the indian meteorological department s pan india 0 25 gpp hereafter imd pai et al 2014 and the pan asian aphrodite 2v1801r1 hereafter aph v18 both developed from overlapping set of rain gauges from asia yatagai 2019 yatagai et al 2020 2012 sunilkumar et al 2019 found good agreement between imerg and aph v18 as a reference over nepal himalaya whereas the numerous applications of imd gpp have already been described in the introduction section 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 data processing the data processing analysis and visualization were done using r version 3 6 3 r core team 2019 under the rstudio environment rstudio team 2019 and map layers were produced using open source qgis version 3 14 1 qgis team 2019 for each gpp the geographical coordinates of each gauge were overlaid on the gpp grid and pixels containing at least one gauge were selected all the gauges within a given pixel were aggregated using simple arithmetic mean for comparison with corresponding gpp precipitation salio et al 2015 the gpps with sub daily temporal resolution imerg 3b42 3b42 rt era5 era5 land and wrf and their corresponding gauge precipitation were aggregated to daily totals for the validation a minimum precipitation intensity threshold of 0 3 mm and 2 5 mm were used for hourly and daily datasets respectively and time stamps with precipitation below the thresholds were assigned zero value jiang et al 2016 prakash et al 2015 the validation was carried out over the maximum overlapping period between the years 2014 2017 except for aph v18 which data was available for the overlapping period 2014 2015 only gauge density is the number of gauges in a pixel and is critical to ground validation exercise especially in gpps with large pixel size maggioni et al 2017 xie and xiong 2011 the average number of gauges per pixel varied from 3 2 1 6 for gpps with large pixel size 0 25 to 1 08 0 05 for the smallest pixel size gpp 0 04 the average minimum gauge distance computed as the distance between a gauge and its closest neighboring pair was high 11 8 8 km with a median of 9 km alluding to the relative sparseness of the gauges in the region kidd et al 2017 the gauge distance was comparable to similar validation studies with dense gauge network from southern india sunilkumar et al 2015a and the mountainous regions of europe feidas et al 2018 porcù et al 2014 2 3 2 statistical analysis three sets of analyses were used to assess the performance of gpps against gauges 2 detection indices and continuous error metrics 2 comparison of diurnal and seasonal patterns and 3 capturing large precipitation storms and extreme events detection indices tested the ability of gpps to accurately observe events with precipitation and non events zero precipitation based on a contingency matrix appendix a table a 1 false alarm ratio far is the ratio of falsely detected hits against total hits by a gpp whereas probability of detection pod denotes the ratio of correctly identified hits by a gpp critical score index csi is the ratio of correctly identified hits against total gpp hits and the frequency bias index fbi is the ratio of total gauge hits against total gpp hits far pod and csi are useful for understanding the ability of the gpp to detect precipitation events whereas fbi indicates overestimation above 1 or underestimation 1 of precipitation event frequency by a gpp accuracy acc focuses on the detectability of both events and non events heidke skill score hss is a more robust detectability index that accounts for any random detectability of events and non events jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the continuous error metrics quantified the magnitude and direction of errors with reference they were calculated for the accurately detected time steps only to avoid double reporting of errors manz et al 2017 tang et al 2015 mean error me is a measure of systematic error reporting the magnitude and direction of deviation between gpp and gauge whereas mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse are metrics of random error highlighting on large errors relative root mean square error rrmse was calculated by normalizing the rmse with pixel wise mean precipitation rate to remove the bias contributed by the observed north south precipitation gradient in sikkim manz et al 2017 relative bias rb is the percentage bias in precipitation volumes between gpp and gauge and quantifies underestimation negative and overestimation positive biases pearson s correlation coefficient cc was used as a measure of linear agreement between the gpp and gauge the equations for the detection indices and continuous error metrics are given in appendix a table a 2 for more details see bharti and singh 2015 xu et al 2017 the indices were estimated across elevation precipitation intensities and seasons and from finer to coarser temporal resolutions to assess changes in performance with aggregation over time the influence of spatial heterogeneity measured as the standard deviation in elevation within each pixel on gpp performance was estimated similarly the effect of gauge density on gpp performance was assessed by comparing the difference in performance between pixels with only one gauge against those with more than gauges we also computed variability in gpp performance with different gauge densities using an iterative sampling with a bootstrapping approach for each pixel in a gpp the corresponding gauges were randomly sampled with replacement and averaged for each day the number of gauges sampled at a time increased from one to the maximum number of gauges per pixel the averaged gauge precipitation was compared with the averaged gpp precipitation to estimate relative bias for days when both gpp and gauge detect precipitation and false alarm ratio far no rain when gpp detects precipitation but the corresponding gauge or gauges don t monthly and hourly binned averages were plotted to understand annual and seasonal patterns in precipitation respectively precipitation storm events were demarcated for gauge data using a threshold of 2 5 mm and an interevent time of 1 day and events longer than 5 days were selected gpp precipitation volumes for corresponding pixels and event days were compared and relative bias was estimated a 44 day long large storm event between 29th may 2015 11th july 2015 was extracted for further analysis the cloud burst event has reportedly caused the biggest floods in the past two decades and several landslides in sikkim darjeeling and kalimpong regions biswas and pal 2016 pal et al 2016 3 results 3 1 validation of gpps 3 1 1 performance and statistical errors at daily resolution imerg satellite wrf model and imd interpolated performed the best among their respective gpp types fig 2 they had low far 0 36 and high pod 0 68 acc 0 72 csi 0 47 and cc 0 42 scores indicating higher detectability of both events and non events higher hss scores 0 42 by imerg 3b42 wrf and imd underlined that their superior detectability was not an artifact of random chance among satellite gpps imerg 3b42 and 3b42 rt showed comparable abilities to detect events and non events whereas chirps and persiann showed lowest performance and highest errors 3b42 was closest to gauges in precipitation volumes with the lowest error values whereas imerg and persiann underestimated and 3b42 rt and chirps overestimated them 3b42 rt and chirps showed stronger bias in detecting extreme events with high rmse rrmse and rb errors in model gpps wrf performed the best with the lowest far close to 1 fbi values and highest pod acc csi and hss scores whereas era5 era5 land and agera5 had the highest pod and comparable csi scores but very low accuracy acc and hss scores suggesting their higher detectability are attributable to chance wrf underestimated precipitation volumes and had a lower correlation whereas the era products significantly overestimated them albeit with better correlation era5 performed marginally better than era5 land and agera5 with lower errors among the interpolated gpps imd performed marginally better in precipitation detectability whereas aph v18 had lower errors both the interpolated gpps overestimated precipitation event frequency but imd overestimated the volume whereas aph v18 underestimated it the gpps with finer spatial resolutions chirps and persiann showed poor detectability and high errors on filtering the results for pixels with more than one gauge chirps and persiann showed marked improvement in far fbi and hss scores appendix a fig a 2 chirps also showed a significant decline in me rrmse and rb whereas opposite trends were observed in persiann similarly imd and aph v18 showed marked improvements in hss scores and a reduction in errors of pixels with more than one gauge elevational heterogeneity was negatively correlated with performance scores except era5 and error volumes except aph v18 in the coarse resolution gpps 0 25 x 0 25 grid appendix a fig a 3 the bootstrapping analysis on gpp performance as a function of gauge density suggests that the optimal number of gauges per pixel are three four and five for pixel sizes of 0 1 0 14 and 0 25 respectively in terms of relative bias appendix a fig a 4a the far no rain values stabilized at three gauges per pixel across the differentgpps appendix a fig a 4b we had at least one third of the pixels with three or more gauges for large pixel sized 0 25 gpps when compared at different temporal resolutions all the sub daily gpps showed marked improvement in performance indices and correlation at daily time step fig 3 the model gpps era5 and era5 land significantly overestimated precipitation frequency at sub daily timesteps whereas 3b42 and 3b42 rt marginally underestimated the same from hourly to daily resolutions the negative mean error me increased for imerg and wrf positive me decreased for 3b42 and 3b42 rt and transitioned from negative to positive error for era5 and era5 land the absolute values of mae and rmse increased with aggregation but relative random errors rrmse declined marginally 3 1 2 performance and errors across elevation the gpps showed similar patterns in performance and error metrics with elevation fig 4 the detectability of events and non events peaked at mid elevations 1000 3000 masl and declined on either side of it low elevation 0 1000 masl saw over detection of both events pod and non events far however the detectability improved between mid high elevations 1000 4000 masl imerg wrf and imd were least affected by elevation with relatively stable performance across the different elevations era5 performed marginally better than era5 land and agera5 at mid high elevations 1000 4000 masl all gpps except persiann showed positive errors and bias at low elevation 0 1000 masl and underestimation bias at high elevations 3000 masl persiann wrf and aph v18 showed consistent underestimation of precipitation volumes across elevations the overestimation bias in imd was dominated by large positive errors at low elevation 1000 masl minimal errors in mid elevations 1000 3000 masl and negative errors above it all gpps except the era5 products and imd show uniform decline in precipitation with increasing latitude and elevation albeit with varying degrees of slopes appendix a fig a 5 wrf showed a weak bi modal pattern with peaks at lower 500 m and mid elevation 2000 m and latitudes conversely the era5 gpps era5 era5 land and agera5 showed unimodal patterns with a precipitation peak around 1000 1500 m elevation and steep decline afterward except agera5 in which the slope of decline was gentle till 4000 m and then declined rapidly lastly imd showed a marginal decline in precipitation between 2000 4000 m elevation an anomaly that may contribute to overestimation bias at higher elevation as observed earlier 3 1 3 performance and errors across seasons the gpps performed exceedingly well during monsoon in comparison to summer with higher detectability and lower bias fig 5 overall imerg 3b42 wrf and imd performed well across all seasons except in winter persiann and aph v18 underestimated summer and monsoon precipitation volumes 3b42 rt and chirps grossly overestimated precipitation frequencies in winter and underestimated in monsoon and summer they also exhibited strong positive bias and large rrmse values in summer and winter imerg persiann imd and aph v18 performed the best in winter whereas 3b42 and wrf had the lowest errors 3b42 rt in summer and imd and era products era5 era5 land and agera5 in winter showed very strong overestimation bias in detecting precipitation frequency and volume 3 1 4 performance and errors at different precipitation intensities across the gpps the performance and error issues were associated with overestimation of the frequency and volume of very low intensity events 10 mm d 1 fig 6 imerg 3b42 wrf imd and aph v18 performed well across different intensities whereas imerg persiann wrf imd and aph v18 had the lowest errors among their respective gpp types the gpps rarely misidentified a non event at relatively higher intensities 10 mm d 1 with perfect detection scores except for chirps persiann and wrf which exhibited a modal peak in performance at low moderate intensities 10 90 mm d 1 however zero hss scores indicated that improved performance at intensities greater than 10 mm d 1 was attributable to either random chance or scarcity of data points era5 era5 land and agera5 largely misidentified the frequency and volume of low intensity precipitation 10 mm d 1 and underestimated intensities greater than 60 mm d 1 the initial increasing trends in mae and rmse with intensities indicate a positive correlation between error magnitude and precipitation intensity however the declining trend in rrmse and rb indicated that the bulk of the errors are concentrated around observing light precipitation events 3 2 diurnal and seasonal patterns in precipitation the gpps ability to capture seasonal and diurnal patterns is critical for modeling long term precipitation shifts as well as localised sub daily hydrological processes both the interpolated gpps imd and aph v18 as well as wrf imerg and chirps reproduced the seasonal patterns in gauge precipitation with significant errors fig 7 a the measured gauge precipitation peaked in june and july months whereas the precipitation estimates by satellite and model gpps peaked in july and august respectively imd and aphrodite captured the june peak but significantly underestimated july precipitation satellite gpps typically underestimated monsoon precipitation except 3b42 rt with largest negative errors in persiann 608 mm month 1 followed by imerg 433 mm month 1 chirps 399 mm month 1 and 3b42 297 mm month 1 fig 7b conversely the model based gpps except wrf overestimated precipitation in all seasons with the largest positive errors by agera5 631 mm month 1 followed by era5 422 mm month 1 and era5 land 381 mm month 1 3b42 rt 239 mm month 1 and wrf 336 mm month 1 showed the least error in monsoon the satellite gpps except 3b42 rt and wrf underestimated summer precipitation whereas the era5 products overestimated them imd showed positive error 115 mm month 1 in summer whereas both imd 160 mm month 1 and aph v18 233 mm month 1 showed negative errors in monsoon strong diurnal patterns in precipitation were observed in both gauge and sub daily satellite gpps imerg 3b42 3b42 rt and persiann fig 8 in gauges the monsoon precipitation peaked around midnight 2300 0100 h whereas imerg 3b42 3b42 rt and persiann showed a distinct pre dawn peak 0300 0400 h conversely the model based gpps era5 era5 land and wrf exhibited bi modal patterns in diurnal precipitation with a large primary peak in mid day and a smaller secondary peak in late night seasonally monsoon precipitation was dominated by the night early morning peaks whereas summer precipitation peaked in the afternoon evening period interestingly in gauge and sub daily satellite gpps the peak precipitation in summer shifted to the afternoon 1600 1900 h whereas winter rains did not exhibit any significant diurnal pattern the seasonal and elevational patterns in diurnal patterns were consistent among the gauges and the sub daily gpps the satellite gpps underestimated diurnal amplitudes in comparison to gauges around mid elevations 1500 3000 masl in both monsoon and summer 3 3 capturing precipitation from large storm events this section details the ability of gpps to capture large storm events in comparison to gauges which are critical for natural hazards and disaster preparedness in himalaya all gpps typically underestimated the precipitation volume of large storms except era5 products fig 9 the bias was least for interpolated gpps with imd 11 57 showing lesser bias than aph v18 33 34 among satellite gpps 3b42 rt 24 71 came closest to capturing large storms followed by 3b42 40 49 imerg 50 38 and chirps 54 40 whereas persiann 81 24 showed largest negative bias among model gpps only wrf 48 51 showed negative bias while agera5 45 85 era5 land 39 77 and era5 36 77 showed strong positive bias across elevation when compared for pixels at low and high elevations above and below 2000 masl all gpps showed significantly larger underestimation bias at high elevation except for persiann agera5 and imd the differential abilities of the different gpps in detecting large storms are further shown in fig 10 which compares the precipitation time series of gauge with gpps for a 44 day long storm event 29 05 2015 to 11 07 2015 starting in late summer and extending well into the monsoon the first part of the event 29 05 2015 to 15 06 2015 was reported as a cloud burst event with several days of high intensity 50 mm precipitation causing massive flash floods and numerous landslides in the teesta river basin and its tributaries pal et al 2016 the later part of the event 15 06 2015 to 11 07 2015 was more subdued with persistent medium to low intensity 7 50 mm precipitation the three era5 based gpps era5 era land and agera5 showed less than 14 bias and were the best gpps for capturing large storms along with imd which closely captured both parts of the events with minor lag era5 closely captured the initial part of the storm but overestimated the later low mid intensity phase whereas wrf largely missed the initial part of the event leading to significant negative bias aph v18 also closely followed the later part of the storm but underestimated the initial periods of peak precipitation the satellite gpps except for 3b42 rt significantly underestimated the initial high intensity part of the storm but were able to track the later low mid intensity phase well persiann and to a lesser extent chirps missed the entire event 4 discussion 4 1 validation of gpps the validation of pixel based gridded products with point data from gauges is confounded by issues of scale wind driven under catch interception and evaporation losses and spatiotemporal mismatch making it difficult to compare gpps of different pixel resolutions however it holds validity as a ground truthing exercise with numerous studies looking at its conceptual and empirical foundations bell and kundu 2003 jung et al 2014 tang et al 2018 the present study uses statistical validation techniques to explore capabilities and biases in a set of gpps in the complex and wet mountainous terrain of eastern himalaya overall imerg wrf and imd emerged as the best gpps for quantifying and mapping precipitation over time and space in eastern himalaya the underestimation and detection errors for imerg has been previously attributed to issues with the detection of low level clouds arulraj and barros 2019 the improved performance of imerg over its predecessors 3b42 agrees with previous studies from india and andes manz et al 2017 prakash et al 2018 the performance and error scores of 3b42 showed improvement in comparison to western himalaya although the patterns with elevation and seasonality were consistent bharti and singh 2015 hussain et al 2017 and were similar to reports from neighboring bhutan khandu et al 2016 xue et al 2013 3b42 rt showed lower detectability and positive bias than 3b42 for himalaya in agreement with reports from the indian subcontinent shah and mishra 2016 and global assessments beck et al 2019 liu 2015 similar exploration in the performance of imerg over tibet reported higher detection of false events by the gauge corrected product than in the non corrected product lu and yong 2018 the finest pixel resolution gpps chirps and persiann showed limited detectability in comparison to other gpps however chirps showed significant overestimation bias in contrast to the reports from neighboring bhutan khandu et al 2016 whereas the underestimation bias seen in persiann was in agreement with previous reports gebregiorgis and hossain 2015 among the model based gpps wrf outperformed the era products with better scores lower errors and reproduction of spatial precipitation patterns it holds promise for hydrometeorological usage in himalaya the three era products show very good detectability of events and good correlation coefficients with marginally better scores by era5 than era5 land and agera5 however the three products had high false hits lower accuracies and overestimated precipitation frequencies especially in winter suggesting that the era model over detected both events and non events with a strong positive bias for solid precipitation the spatial patterns of precipitation by era products show the highest precipitation in mid elevations of central sikkim which coupled with high overestimation bias hints at overdependence of the underlying parameterization schemes on elevation for modeling precipitation similar overestimation bias in other model based products has been previously observed in tropical andes silva et al 2011 imd and aphrodite are some of the longest available time series gpps for himalaya and are invaluable in assessing long term precipitation trends and variability the improved performance of imd in mid altitudes 1000 3000 masl could be attributable to the higher number of rain gauges located at mid elevations in the neighboring sub himalayan west bengal the overestimation in lower elevation is attributable to algorithmic issues and underestimation at higher elevations also observed in aph v18 to paucity of high altitude stations and the inability to observe solid precipitation ménégoz et al 2013 this further explains the abnormally higher annual precipitation 2500 mm and annual rainy days 150 days shown by imd at high elevation 3000 masl in central northern sikkim part of which are trans himalayan regions in with cold desert like climatology in comparison to aphrodite 1 data not shown here the precipitation maps provided by nandargi and dhar 2015 who used gauge interpolated data also suffered from the same anomaly and could be again attributed to the lack of spatially disaggregated and high elevation gauges in sikkim and eastern himalaya additionally the improved performance and reduced errors of imd and aph v18 in pixels with more than one gauge further stress on the inclusion of more stations for improvement of gauge interpolated products in complex terrains like himalaya where elevational heterogeneity was another major source of error the contrary patterns between in elevational heterogeneity and performance scores and error volumes in the gpps merits further investigations the overall improvement in performance across the gpps on aggregation from sub daily to daily time resolutions could be partially attributable to randomness however the observed decline in relative random errors rrmse suggests that the random error variance could be associated with an increase in individual errors random or measurement errors with a higher number of events and or larger errors by gpps at finer temporal resolutions due to temporal lags the weaker detectability at low elevations 1000 masl and high elevations 2000 masl and in winter could be confounded by the relatively higher gauge density in the low mid elevation 1000 3000 masl and the general inability of gpps in detecting solid precipitation at high elevations 3000 masl the gpps especially the three era5 products typically overestimated winter precipitation due to falsely identifying winter events although the scores might be influenced by the relatively fewer number of winter events the overestimation in summer and monsoon was relatively less high acc scores in winter indicate that the gpps identified non events with greater confidence except for era products the over detection and overestimation of light precipitation 10 mm d 1 and accurate but underestimation moderate high intensities 60 mm d 1 is consistent with previous reports highlighting the dual problems of false detection of shallow precipitation over mountains and under detection of convective precipitation ning et al 2017 sunilkumar et al 2015b it should be noted that most of the gauges are located in the southern half of sikkim and for some of the precipitation products relatively few grid boxes have been used for the comparison e g around 20 grid boxes for imerg see fig 1c due to the high altitudinal gradients in this region high resolution is important for representing the spatial precipitation pattern correctly and this may partly explain why imerg and wrf show better performance than other gpps the decline in precipitation with increasing elevation and latitude has been reported by bookhagen and burbank 2010 2006 using data from 3b42 while bookhagen and burbank 2006 report a modal peak in precipitation similar to seen in the era5 gpps bookhagen and burbank 2010 show a uniform decline in precipitation similar to the remaining gpps except imd the absence of negative relationships between precipitation with elevation and latitude is a point of concern highlighting the positive bias in imd gpp at high elevation and deeper into the himalaya most likely to be linked to the absence of gauging stations 4 2 seasonal and diurnal patterns in precipitation in sikkim the ability of the different gpps to capture spatiotemporal patterns in ground precipitation was visually assessed imerg wrf and persiann came closest to replicating the spatial patterns of precipitation in sikkim in reference to the annual precipitation isohyet prepared by karan 1989 other fine scaled gpps including chirps era5 land and agera5 failed to detect the regional peculiarities like scant precipitation 1500 mm yr 1 in the rain shadow parts of southern sikkim 1000 masl and high precipitation 3500 mm yr 1 in eastern and western sikkim 2000 masl in a validation exercise such conditions will show up as positive bias at low elevations and negative bias at higher elevations similar to the obtained results this underlines the limited abilities of gpps to mimic local peculiarities in complex mountain terrains despite the limited performance the finer spatial resolution of persiann allowed it to reproduce the reported spatial distribution of ground precipitation in karan 1989 the june july peak in gauge precipitation in sikkim is characteristically distinct seetharam 2008 soja and starkel 2007 due to the region s proximity to the bay of bengal where the indian monsoon originates in contrast the delayed peaks in july august reported from western himalaya khatiwada et al 2016 nandargi 2015 and nepal dahal et al 2019 gabet et al 2004 are explained by the time taken by the monsoon to travel westwards the underestimation of june precipitation by satellite and model gpps could be due to the relative under representation of ground stations from eastern himalaya in global precipitation datasets used for calibration by the gpps the observed diurnal precipitation cycles in gauge and satellite gpps were consistent with reports of nocturnal precipitation in himalaya a phenomenon unique to monsoon in himalaya against a predominantly afternoon precipitation seen in most of the inland regions across the globe barros and lang 2003 bhatt et al 2014 the amplitude of the diurnal cycle was lower in satellite gpps in comparison to gauges similar discrepancies in imerg s ability to detect low intensity precipitation and diurnal patterns have been observed across wet and dry periods oliveira et al 2016 the contrary diurnal patterns observed in model based gpps with stronger peaks in afternoon and late night have been attributed to the boundary layer data and parameterization schemes and the inability to track convective processes operating at coarser spatial resolutions bhatt et al 2014 krishnamurti et al 2007 bhatt et al 2014 have also demonstrated that the wrf model with boundary condition data from norwegian earth system model gives a better representation of diurnal cycles in himalaya than the wrf model with era interim reanalysis data as used in the present study bentsen et al 2013 sato et al 2008 and prein et al 2015 recommend finer spatial resolution grids of 7 km and 4 km respectively for effectively modeling convective processes in high altitudes conversely the satellite gpps are primarily based on cloud observations and not entirely dependent on parameterization schemes resulting in better diurnal representation even at relatively coarser spatial resolutions 4 3 capturing large precipitation storm events the monitoring of a continuous large storm with both cloud burst initial part and consistent low mid intensity precipitation later part provided useful insights into the capabilities of the gpps in complex terrains sikkim is one of the wettest parts of the himalaya and bears the brunt of the numerous storms originating from the bay of bengal nandargi 2015 large storms with extended periods of continuous precipitation are also the primary cause of periodic flash floods and landslides in the region hamada et al 2015 sengupta et al 2010 while studies have focused on the detectability of extreme daily events bharti and singh 2015 few have looked at the ability of gpps to track large precipitation storms and extreme events like cloud bursts which could enable landslide and geohazard forecasting in himalaya the underestimation bias exhibited by gpps is common as the precipitation intensities in large storms can vary considerably over space and time zhou et al 2015 for example during the same storm period the maximum daily rainfall reported by our gauge at kyongnosla alpine sanctuary in east sikkim 120 mm was almost half of that reported by other regional gauges at sevoke 220 mm and kalimpong 254 mm biswas and pal 2016 pal et al 2016 thus while considerable spatial variability in precipitation in a large regional storm is expected the era5 based gpps along with 3b42 rt and imd were still able to capture the precipitation pattern with a degree of certainty the improved capabilities of the era5 products over era interim in tracking large storms have been previously reported for eight historical storm events observed across the globe dullaart et al 2020 3b42 rt and imd were the other two gpps with the least bias whereas persiann performed the worst similar to reports from himalaya jena et al 2020 and mediterranean europe brunetti et al 2018 the improved performance of 3b42 rt over 3b42 was in concordance with previous studies from the usa and africa li et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 5 conclusions gridded products are crucial for precipitation data based applications in hydrology mitigating effects of extreme precipitation events and detecting deficiencies in downscaled regional climate model performance however careful ground validation of gpps is imperative in complex mountains like himalaya for improved model performance and accuracy of predictions significant knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the performance of different gpps in the wet eastern himalaya especially at fine spatiotemporal resolutions and in their ability to track large precipitation storms and extreme events like cloud bursts there is a general lack of literature on validation of interpolated gpps in himalaya which are widely used as reference datasets themselves the study tests the efficacy of different types of gpps and highlights their importance for understanding the precipitation patterns in topographically complex and data scarce regions like eastern himalaya significant inherent biases in different gpps are demonstrated across elevation seasonality and precipitation intensities and validation of gpps is strongly recommended using ground precipitation in the eastern himalayan region imerg and wrf provided the ideal combination of high spatial and temporal resolutions and are most suited for large catchment based hydrological studies in concordance to reports from china brunetti et al 2018 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 jiang et al 2018 the recently released version 2 of high asia refined analysis har v2 derived from wrf and era5 and the aimerg gpp produced by calibrating imerg with aphrodite 1 holds much promise for the region and requires validation ma et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the success of the three era5 based products in detecting large precipitation storms despite an overall over detection bias shows a horses for courses approach is more suited for choosing the appropriate gpps for a specific goal together with 3b42 rt and imd the three era5 products may be best suited for landslide and geohazards forecasting in himalaya brunetti et al 2018 dullaart et al 2020 despite showing poor detectability and high negative bias persiann could reproduce the spatial precipitation pattern and holds promise among the high spatial resolution gpps imd and aphrodite are widely used as reference datasets for validating satellite products in indian himalaya and our study is the first to evaluate their performance in complex topography using fine scale ground precipitation data the systemic negative bias shown by imd and aphrodite gpps at high elevation suggests a lack of representative gauge data and prior validation of the dataset with ground precipitation is advised before application as a reference dataset in future gpp validation studies from himalaya and india the significance of elevational heterogeneity and the importance of rain gauge density in the performance of gpps in mountains is reiterated further the ability inability of satellite model gpps in capturing diurnal precipitation cycle and small sub daily convective processes opens exciting opportunities and challenges in using gpps for modeling fine scale bio geochemical and ecohydrological cycles in himalaya we summarise that imerg wrf and imd are best among satellite based model based and interpolation based gpps respectively for detecting precipitation in the region the superior abilities of the satellite based gpps in reproducing seasonal and diurnal precipitation patterns seen in gauges than model based gpps are demonstrated we also highlight that modeling sub daily and sub regional cycles in complex montane terrains is still a major challenge which requires more focus and effort the improved performance of model based gpps in detecting large storms is encouraging especially for improving the accuracy of extreme event predictions using ensemble regional climate models being the first detailed exploration of precipitation in eastern himalaya the study highlights the importance of investing in climate monitoring of infrastructure and the potential of using gridded precipitation products for developing suitable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in himalaya the study will enhance the capabilities of both mechanistic and data based hydrological models to be used with appropriate choices of precipitation products in this region as well as the validation of downscaled and

4438,insights into the heterogeneity of human behaviours and attitudes toward risk require the understanding of the role played by a plurality of factors such as risk awareness and trust however our knowledge of the interplay of these factors is limited as is our knowledge of the patterns in risk attitudes and behaviours and their evolution over time this study explores the interplay between attitudes and behaviours related to flood risk awareness and structural flood protection in two communities in the eastern italian alps and how they changed over time to this end a questionnaire was submitted to a total of 420 residents in the year 2005 n 200 and 2018 n 220 and then analysed using latent class analysis no floods were recorded in the area during this period the results show that there is a group of residents characterized by low risk awareness and high trust in structural flood protection such individuals are likely to live in urban rather than mountain communities and are characterized by a lack of or limited experience with floods they are also prone to believe that such events will not happen in the future in 2005 this group represented less than half of the sample but its size substantially increased in 2018 this result has strong implications for local risk managers because this group of residents is less risk aware than the others and they may deserve special attention and targeted messages in flood risk communication campaigns this and other results are discussed including the potential development of generalizable models to provide emergency and risk managers with tools to unveil risk awareness patterns and to tailor risk communication actions to citizens attitudes and behaviours the paper ends with some considerations about the need not only to better understand but also to address diversity in flood risk awareness keywords attitudes towards structural flood protection flood risk awareness latent class cluster models 1 introduction flooding remains one of the most common natural hazards causing devastating impacts in europe and worldwide tanoue et al 2016 the high costs associated with flood events stem from the interactions among the physical built and social environments the expectation that flood damages may escalate over time with climate and land use change and socio economic growth in flood prone areas has raised policy makers awareness of the need to implement innovative flood risk management strategies and solutions borga et al 2014 domeneghetti et al 2015 flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection are important components of the societal response to floods and represent key elements to develop a comprehensive flood risk management strategy paton 2008 borga et al 2011 mondino et al 2020 hamilton et al 2020 previous literature highlighted how flood related behaviours are affected by a variety of personal characteristics such as socio demographics e g age and gender miceli et al 2008 salvati et al 2018 attitudes and beliefs bempah and øyhus 2017 psychological and personality traits heller et al 2005 information and knowledge wachinger et al 2013 past experience with flood events drobot et al 2007 and trust in authorities and in structural protection measures grothmann and reusswig 2006 scolobig et al 2012 this can lead to the presence of subgroups in a population which vary in terms of the above characteristics which exhibit heterogeneous flood perception and attitudes towards structural flood protection flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection are not only heterogeneous across different groups of citizens but they can also change over time mondino et al 2020 ridolfi et al 2020 time can play an important role in shaping risk awareness particularly in communities which did not experience a flood event for extended periods the lack of recent events in fact can cause a decrease in risk awareness thus making communities more vulnerable to flood risk burn 1999 mondino et al 2020 importantly variation of risk behaviour across groups and over time can be intertwined for example ridolfi et al 2020 modelled flood losses over time in four types of society named by the authors risk neglecting risk monitoring risk downplaying and risk controlling societies differing in terms of flood risk behaviour the authors found substantial differences across the four societies in terms of flood losses accounting for flood behaviour heterogeneity across population groups and for evolution of such groups over time can help explain why certain groups within broader communities are more risk aware and prepared than others quantifying the variability of flood risk awareness and capturing identifiable differences in populations is also fundamental to better understand societal responses to flood hazards in addition identifying subgroups with distinct configurations of heterogeneity provides policy and decision makers with information that is tailored to different groups rather than an average description of the overall population this could help to drive improved risk communication strategies where tailoring ensures that the information is relevant to the different risk profile groups thus potentially leading to a better flood risk preparedness moreover identifying subgroups with heterogeneous flood risk awareness may help to better gauge people s willingness to support government policies and take precautionary measures and to support the development of more effective mitigation strategies kellens et al 2013 given the above background and building upon the previous studies by scolobig et al 2012 and mondino et al 2020 this study aims to i identify subgroups of citizens within broader communities according to their patterns of flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection and ii analyse how these groups are changing over time in the absence of flood events and after the implementation of structural flood protection in order to identify and to profile subgroups of citizens differing in terms of risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection and investigate the evolution of such groups over time we adopt a latent class analysis lca approach lca is a statistical method used to group individuals into classes of an unobserved i e latent variable on the basis of the responses made on a set of nominal ordinal or continuous observed variables collins and lanza 2010 importantly lca is a model based approach which means that a statistical model is postulated for the population from which the sample is drawn and results can be used to make inferences about the whole population vermunt and magidson 2002 data for our analysis was collected via a questionnaire administered twice to a total of 420 residents in two communities in the eastern italian alps in the year 2005 n 200 and 2018 n 220 the two communities were hit by floods and debris flows in the years 2000 and 2002 and no other significant flood event occurred in the area up until the time of the second questionnaire administration 2 background several studies have investigated the factors that shape flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection among people who live in high risk zones bubeck et al 2012 lechowska 2018 di baldassarre et al 2018 clar 2019 starting from determinants of flood risk awareness several studies investigated how this is affected by citizens socio demographic characteristics findings suggest that risk awareness is shaped by a plurality of socio demographics such as age salvati et al 2018 gender mcdowell et al 2020 income burningham et al 2008 education karanci et al 2005 and presence of children living at home russell et al 1995 next to socio demographics previous experience of a flood has been recognised in the literature as one of the most important factors shaping risk awareness mondino et al 2020 wachinger et al 2013 concerning the effect of such factor however research results are not always consistent some scholars reported a positive influence of previous experience on risk awareness thistlethwaite et al 2018 some a negative one especially in the case of limited damage suffered halpern felsher et al 2001 and some a non significant whitmarsh 2008 or unclear effect bradford et al 2012 other factors outlined by the literature as affecting risk awareness are beliefs bempah and øyhus 2017 psychological and personality traits heller et al 2005 information and knowledge wachinger et al 2013 and trust in authorities su et al 2017 next to studies investigating the role of specific factors in shaping risk behaviour in the past fifty years multiple theories and frameworks have been developed to better understand how people live with risk such as the psychometric paradigm e g fischoof et al 1979 the cultural theory of risk e g douglas and wildavsky 1982 the social constructivist approaches to risk e g beck 1992 protection motivation theory grothmann and reusswig 2006 or dynamic protection motivation frameworks weyrich et al 2020 for example the psychometric paradigm stipulates that some risk characteristics are perceived similarly voluntariness is correlated with controllability catastrophic potential with inequity observability with knowledge about the risk immediacy with novelty examples of results of this research include cognitive maps in which several risk characteristics are combined into factors when it comes to attitudes towards structural flood protection the literature agrees that they often promote a false sense of safety in residents living in the floodplain white 1945 keys 2016 smith 2003 tobin 1995 maddocks et al 2007 ferdous et al 2020 this in turn promotes urban development in areas at risk of flooding white 1945 this phenomenon is commonly referred to as levee effect white 1945 but others refer to it also as levee paradox smith 2003 or safe development paradox e g burby 2006 the levee effect may eventually lead to a cycle of levee raising where communities demand higher levees to be built after each levee failure to maintain an illusion of complete flood protection keys 2016 di baldassarre et al 2018 thus reducing residents flood risk awareness and increasing exposure to flood risk furthermore recent studies based on socio hydrological modelling found that trust in flood protections and short lived collective memory of flood events could be associated with lower flood risk awareness and that lack of trust in flood controls and longer memory of flood events could be associated with higher risk awareness di baldassarre et al 2013 viglione et al 2014 related studies indicate that trust in flood protections is negatively associated with risk awareness flood preparedness intent to purchase insurance and adoption of flood mitigation measures grothmann and reusswig 2006 hung 2009 trust is also informed by experience when flood defences are visible individuals can gather information about the quality of risk management by observing the performance of structures based on these observations they can adjust trust in flood controls and risk perception terpstra 2011 given the plurality of factors influencing risk awareness and trust in protection works outlined above some studies focused on identifying groups of citizens that shares similar characteristics and on exploring how risk behaviour changes across groups for example martens et al 2009 identified four groups of citizens based on the motivation intention volition model martens et al 1998 and found the groups to differ significantly in terms of risk perception bodoque et al 2016 identified groups of citizens profiled according to socio demographics and found risk perception and awareness to vary substantially across groups one of the objectives of our study is to contribute and expand such literature by profiling groups of citizens according to a plurality of factors described in section 3 and eliciting how risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection differ among groups another body of literature explored changes in risk behaviour over time the existing studies suggest that people s attitudes and awareness towards flood risk change significantly with time mondino et al 2020 zabini et al 2021 usually immediately after an event flood risk is perceived to be higher than it actually is but the sense of danger begins to decrease shortly after the event therefore society tends to forget about the risk associated with floods after extended periods without events raaijmakers et al 2008 the literature also suggests that the positive influence of direct flood experience on private mitigating behaviours may disappear several years after the flood terpstra 2011 hence the time of the previous flood plays a major role on risk awareness since it can be expected that the experience of a flood that occurred a long time ago has little influence on current risk awareness and mitigating behaviours grothmann and reusswig 2006 as such it is likely that communities that did not experience a flood in recent years show a decrease in the level of worry and awareness bradford et al 2012 the second objective of our study is to expand such literature by not only investigating changes in citizens risk behaviour over time in an area which did not suffer major events for an extend period of time but also by investigating how time affects groups of citizens with different profile and risk behaviour 3 methods 3 1 study area in 2005 de marchi and scolobig 2012 administrated a questionnaire on risk awareness preparedness and social vulnerability in four small communities in the eastern italian alps bocenago roverè della luna romagnano and vermiglio rio cortina which were impacted by a series of intense floods debris flows and shallow landsliding in 2000 and 2002 tarolli et al 2011 lanni et al 2012 one of the aims of the study was to better understand the relationship between risk awareness and preparedness results are presented in scolobig et al 2012 to explore changes in risk awareness and preparedness in absence of extreme events as well as the impact of structural flood protection the same questionnaire was administrated in 2018 mondino et al 2020 by considering only two of the original four communities romagnano and vermiglio rio cortina the two communities were selected as a number of structural flood protection were implemented after the flood events in the impacted areas and as they both experienced hydrogeological extreme events in the early 2000 s followed by a prolonged absence of events until the time of the second data collection while the two communities are both located in the province of trento italy fig 1 they have contrasting features vermiglio 1261 m a s l is an alpine municipality located in the upper part of the vermigliana torrent valley romagnano 220 m a s l is an urban settlement in the floodplains of the adige river the number of inhabitants in vermiglio remained stable at 1850 across the past 20 years while in romagnano inhabitants went from 1200 in 2005 to 1600 in 2018 a 33 increase a description of the flood events and geomorphic responses landslides and debris flows which impacted the sites is reported in scolobig et al 2012 after the flood events structural flood protection was built in romagnano and vermiglio mainly consisting in check dams 3 2 data collection as in the first questionnaire round participants were kept anonymous and therefore could not be contacted again in the second round we used a cohort design which allows to have samples containing different individuals compared to 2005 a cohort study or repeated cross sectional study has the characteristic of sampling individuals with a shared characteristic which makes them part of a cohort e g being born in the same year living in the same town having experienced a certain event and so forth therefore the two or more samples taken over time could contain different individuals in different points in time while this does not allow for a within respondent comparison it still allows for a comparison between groups moreover this type of design works around the issue of high attrition rates i e participants dropping out of the study which implies a depletion of the sample over time hudson et al 2019 highlights high attrition rates as one of the main problems concerning longitudinal research within the flood risk domain information on the sampling procedure and samples characteristics can be found in mondino et al 2020 both in the first and second data collections data were collected through questionnaires administered during a face to face interview with the respondent the questionnaire used in the second round was built upon the first one with some minor changes due to the slightly different aims of the two studies however the questions used to assess the variables related to risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection were kept unchanged to allow for comparison the questionnaire includes items that are not discussed in this paper as they are out of the main scope the full questionnaire can be found in the appendix we selected three variables to interpret flood risk awareness perceived threat posed by flood events relative to a the town b the home and c one s physical integrity specifically participants were asked to what extend do you think flood events are a threat to your town home yourself for each variable respondents could answer on a scale from 1 minimal threat to 5 serious threat we also assessed a fourth variable feeling of safety through the question how safe do you feel living in your village respondents could answer on a scale from 1 not safe at all to 5 very safe to assess attitudes towards structural flood protection and investigate levee effect we asked respondents to what extent they agreed with the following statements i structural flood protection prevent serious damages ii structural flood protection are too expensive compared to their benefit iii structural flood protection make people feel safe iv structural flood protection favour economic development they could respond on a scale from 1 completely disagree to 5 completely agree to assess trust in structural flood protection we asked respondents to what extent i structural flood protection and ii early warning systems make them feel safe on a scale from 1 not safe at all to 5 very safe knowledge and experience about structural flood protection were measured by asking respondents whether i they are aware of the existence of structural flood protection ii they had direct experience in the past with structural flood protection iii they received information about structural flood protection from official sources i e local authorities in addition the questionnaire retrieved socio demographic data such as age gender income and education descriptive statistics for age and gender of all samples are reported in table 1 compared to 2005 in 2018 the sample was slightly older both in vermiglio and in romagnano as for gender in both locations the percentage of females slightly decreased and that of males slightly increased 3 3 latent class analysis most constructs in social science represent a set of behaviours and qualities i e risk aversion trust in institutions etc with a high level of abstraction these constructs are seldom directly observable hence researchers use a set of multiple observable variables to measure such aspects in a given study latent class lc models magidson and vermunt 2002 hagenaars and mccutcheon 2002 typically based on finite mixture modelling are used to empirically determine whether interrelationships exist among observed variables that explain the latent phenomena nurius and macy 2008 lc models enable the researcher to identify important interindividual differences and thus model distinct configurations of heterogeneity within a given sample this provides an opportunity to classify individuals from a heterogeneous population into more homogenous subgroups based on their scores on different instruments typically answers to likert scale questions lc models are based on the following assumptions i the population consists of a number of different classes with respect to individual characteristics i e socio demographics attitudes and perceptions ii individuals belonging to the same class have similar response pattern to attitudinal questions magidson and vermunt 2002 morey et al 2008 morey and thiene 2017 probability to fall in one class rather than another is estimated as a function of a set of covariates to identify profiles of citizens with different attitudes and behaviours ultimately lc allows not only to identify population groups but also to probabilistically retrieve their size that is the share of the population which exhibits a certain pattern of perceptions and attitudes given sufficient statistical power i e large enough sample size we investigated variation of risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection in the population by estimating two lcc models with the four variables related to risk awareness and the five variables related to structural flood protection described above 3 3 1 analysis framework we analysed the two datasets 2005 and 2018 by means of two different approaches firstly we explored the two datasets separately via a cross sectional analysis then we carried out a longitudinal analysis aimed at comparing results from 2005 and 2018 datasets this allows to disentangle the evolution of heterogeneity of citizens attitudes and to explore variation of preferences over time as it concerns the modelling approach we estimated two latent class models the first aims at investigating flood risk awareness and the second focuses on attitudes towards structural flood protection the overall framework used for data analysis is illustrated in fig 2 the goal of the estimated lcc models was to probabilistically allocate respondents in different groups classes based on responses they provided to the questions reported in section 3 2 the probability to fall in one class rather than another was estimated as function of a set of covariates which can be grouped in four categories i trust in structural flood protection ii past flood experience iii knowledge of flood risk iv socio demographics the relationship between such covariates and different lcc models is illustrated in fig 2 3 3 2 latent class model we investigated variation in citizens risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection by means of two latent class cluster lcc models vermunt and magidson 2002 thacher et al 2005 morey and thiene 2017 we choose lcc models over other clustering techniques such as cluster analysis as the latter relies on ad hoc and deterministic classification to identify clusters whereas lcc probabilistically assigns individuals to classes clusters and can reduce misclassification biases additional benefits over deterministic cluster approaches are i statistical criteria can be used to identify the optimal number of classes ii statistical significance of the model parameters can be assessed iii different types of variables ordinal categorical etc can be accomodated vermunt and magidson 2002 the estimation goal in lcc models is to compute response probabilities the probability that an individual in a certain class states a certain level on an attitudinal question and class membership probabilities the probability that an individual belongs to a particular class given his her observable characteristics e g socio demographics all individuals with the same observed characteristics have the same probability of belonging to a particular class we estimated the models by maximum likelihood the log likelihood function for ac class model is 1 ln l i i n l n c 1 c p r c z i q 1 q s 1 s π qs c x iqs where π qs c is the probability that individualistates level s on attitudinal question q conditional on belonging to class c p r c z i is the unconditional probability that individual i belongs to class c as a function of his her observable characteristics z i xiqs 1 if individuali s answer to attitudinal question q is level s and 0 otherwise maximum likelihood estimation was carried out with the r package polca linzer and lewis 2011 in order to identify the optimal number of classes the log likelihood function eq 1 was maximized for increasing number of classes each time a class was added we assessed whether it improved the model by referring to information criteria such as the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 and the bayesian information criterion bic schwartz 1978 such information criteria describe the goodness of fit of a model i e the discrepancy from the observed values and those predicted by the model the best performing model i e the model with the optimal number of classes is the one that minimizes the score of these criteria 4 results 4 1 results of 2005 questionnaire results obtained by the application of the two models provide indication for a three classes specification based on the information criteria reported in table 2 the classes in the two models are independent for the two models we report the average level for each variable weighted by estimated probabilities such probabilities are included in the supplementary material tables s 2 and s 4 the supplementary data also reports the outputs from the lcc models on attitudes towards protection expenditures tables s 5 s 7 and figure s 1 and the binary logit model on the adoption of protection measures table s 8 the supplement material also reports the results of chi square tests carried out to assesses whether probabilities across classes are statistically different tables s 2 s 4 and s 6 in all cases we found differences to be significant at 95 level 4 1 1 risk awareness the first lcc model explores how perceived threat related to floods varies across the population the variables are i feeling of safety ii perceived threat for town iii perceived threat for own habitation iv perceived threat for own physical integrity as covariates in the class membership function in addition to socio demographic characteristics we included also i previous flood experience ii perceived future flood risk iii trust in structural flood structural flood protection table 3 shows that the predicted membership probability class sizes is 46 for class 3 the largest followed by 32 for class 1 and 22 for class 2 the table also reports the effect of covariates on class membership probability coefficients for class 1 were fixed to zero for identification purposes so we define class 1 as the baseline class which means that the coefficients for the other two classes have to be interpreted in relation to the baseline this also means that class 1 includes all those individuals which are not included in the other two classes i e anyone else the estimated coefficients suggest that with respect to class 1 the baseline individuals who experienced flood events in the past and think such events will happen again in the future are more likely to belong to class 2 we term class 2 risk monitoring class following rippl 2002 and ridolfi et al 2020 this class includes more likely individuals with low trust in structural flood protections individuals with no previous flood experience who do not think similar flood events will happen in the future and who do not live in the mountain area are instead more likely to belong to class 3 termed here risk minimizing class class 1 includes everyone else and we name it risk downplaying fig 3 illustrates average estimated levels for each variable the risk monitoring class exhibits the lowest weighted average level for feeling of safety 3 40 this class also has the highest average level for the other three variables thereby indicating a stronger perceived threat compared to other classes specifically average levels are 3 76 for village vs 2 63 in class 1 and 2 27 in class 3 4 18 for own habitation vs 1 86 in class 1 and 1 31 in class 3 and 3 15 for own physical integrity vs 1 86 in class 1 and 1 19 in class 3 overall such results suggest that the risk monitoring class includes individuals with the highest risk awareness this is consistent with the profile identified in the class membership function the risk monitoring class includes citizens that have already experienced floods and think they will happen again in the future so it is plausible that they are more risk aware than members of other classes this may be exacerbated by their low trust in structural flood structural flood protection individuals in the risk minimizing class instead show the highest feeling of safety with an average weighted level of 4 79 they are also associated with the lowest average levels for all variables related to perceived threat these results suggest that individuals in this class have the lowest risk awareness among all classes and have a very low perceived threat for both their village and for themselves this is consistent with the profile emerged from the class membership function which highlights how individuals in this class are more likely to have no experience with floods and to think such events will not happen in the future they are also more likely to live in the valley area which has lower flood risk finally the risk downplaying class shows an intermediate feeling of safety and perceived threat but closer to the levels of the risk minimizing class 4 1 2 attitudes towards structural flood protection we investigated variation of attitudes towards structural flood protection by estimating a latent class model with the following variables i structural flood protection prevent serious damages ii structural flood protection are too expensive compared to their benefit iii structural flood protection make people feel safe iv structural flood protection favour economic development v structural flood protection make me feel safe vi warning systems make me feel safe for each of these variables respondents were asked to state their agreement on a scale from 1 do not agree at all to 5 completely agree an i do not know option was also included to profile the classes of individuals which we remind are independent from those estimated in the previous model with different attitudes towards structural flood protection we used as covariates the following information i knowledge of existing structural flood protection ii knowledge of flood risk from previous experience iii knowledge of flood risk from official information iv socio demographic characteristics namely place of residence education and age the predicted membership reported in table 4 shows that class 2 termed positive attitudes in the following is the largest 41 and the other two classes have similar size 31 for class 1 and 28 for class 3 the coefficients of the class membership function table 5 suggest that class 3 termed negative trust here more likely includes individuals with no knowledge of existing structural flood protection no knowledge on flood risks from official information and who live in mountain municipalities and do not have a degree the positive attitudes class instead include individuals with knowledge of existing structural flood protection and of flood risks thanks to both direct experience and official information they are also likely not to live in the mountain municipality fig 4 illustrates estimated average levels by class members of the positive class generally have the most positive attitude towards structural flood protection they are prone to believe that structural flood protection prevents serious damage average level equal to 4 48 make people feel safe 4 92 and albeit to a slightly lesser degree favour economic development 3 86 all these average scores are higher than those estimated in other classes members of the risk controlling class also tend to disagree more strongly than the others with the idea that structural flood protection is too expensive 1 33 finally this class is characterized by individuals who strongly perceive safety from both structural flood protection average score equal to 4 75 and early warning systems average score 4 31 overall these results suggest that having knowledge of existing structural flood protection and flood risks which positively affect probability to belong to this class has a positive effect on attitudes towards structural flood protection moving to the negative attitudes class the first interesting thing to notice is that its members have the highest probability of selecting the i do not know option for the first four variables table s 10 this is particularly evident for structural flood protection favours economic development for which probability of selecting such option is extremely high 91 2 this is consistent with the fact that individuals with lack of knowledge about existing structural flood protection are more likely to belong to this class those who expressed a level of agreement with the questions tend to have a positive view of how structural flood protection prevent serious damage average level equal to 3 41 intermediate between the other two classes but they have the lowest average levels for making people feel safe and favour economic development the generally more negative attitude towards structural flood protection is confirmed by the level of agreement with the idea that structural flood protection is too expensive by far the highest among classes 3 48 as it concerns the perception of personal safety members of this class have an average score similar to class 1 for structural flood protection and the lowest among all classes for warning systems 3 28 these results suggest that individuals with limited knowledge about structural flood protection members of this class tend to have more negative attitudes towards it this is consistent with the findings related to the positive attitudes class which highlighted how individuals with knowledge of structural flood protection tend to have more positive attitudes towards them instead levels for the intermediate attitudes class lie between those of the previous classes 4 2 results from 2018 data longitudinal analysis in what follows we first describe results of the analysis based on 2018 data we then turn to outline differences and similarities with those retrieved from the 2005 questionnaire the first important result is that as for the 2005 data the information criteria favour a specification with three classes for both models as shown in table 6 this suggests that the number of different profiles existing in the population did not change over time 4 2 1 risk awareness the 2018 model on risk awareness includes the same variables and the same covariates used for the 2005 one the overall profile of the classes is very similar to the one retrieved for 2005 there is a segment of the population with high risk awareness the risk monitoring class one with low risk awareness the risk minimizing class and an intermediate one risk downplaying class while the profile of the three classes i e risk awareness within each class is similar between the two years the size of the classes is substantially different specifically the segment including citizens with low risk awareness the risk minimizing class in both models is associated with a substantially higher membership probability in 2018 compared to 2005 62 vs 46 such difference was found to be statistically significant at 95 level via a chi squared test x squared 8 53 p value 0 014 this suggests that the fraction of individuals who do not feel threatened by floods may be increased over the last years moving to the covariates of the class membership function one notices how results are quite similar across years thereby suggesting that the profile of citizens having different risk awareness has not changed substantially over the last 15 years or so the major difference also in terms of policy implications seems to be related to the significant and positive effect of trust in structural flood protection on probability to belong to the risk minimizing class low risk awareness class such covariate had no significant effect in 2005 for the risk minimizing class which may suggest that over the years trust in structural flood protection assumed a larger role in people s risk awareness fig 5 shows average levels for each variable included in the model which are similar across the two years 4 2 2 attitudes towards structural flood protection the 2018 lcc model on attitudes towards structural flood protection includes the same variables and covariates accounted for in 2005 see section 4 1 2 by looking at both the profile identified by the class membership function table 7 and the average levels reported in fig 6 the overall pattern seems to be very similar across years by showing a class with generally positive attitudes towards structural flood protection positive attitudes class one class with more negative attitudes negative attitudes class and an intermediate one intermediate attitudes compared to 2005 the positive attitudes class is associated with a higher probability 56 vs 41 x squared 7 81 p value 0 02 which suggests that the number of citizens with positive attitudes towards structural flood protection increased over the years again this may be related to the possible association that citizens may perceive between lack of flood events and effectiveness of structural flood protection as the previous model highlighted how trust in structural flood protection leads to higher perceived safety there may be a link between the increase in the number of citizens with positive attitudes towards structural flood protection and the increase in the number of citizens who do not perceive a threat from floods moving to the covariates of the class membership function it is interesting to notice how knowledge of existing structural flood protection and awareness from personal experience official information affect class membership probabilities in both years in both cases it seems that informed aware citizens have more positive attitudes towards structural flood protection as such covariates have a positive effect on probability to belong to the positive attitudes class as it concerns demographics education has a similar effect in both years people without a degree are in both cases more likely to belong to the risk downplaying class and as such tend to have more negative attitudes towards structural flood protection compared to graduated individuals living in the non mountainous areas seems to have the same effect as well specifically it seems to positively affect probability to belong to the positive attitudes class in both years age instead does not seem to affect class membership in 2018 while it did in 2005 finally by looking at probabilities for each level of the variables table s 10 it is interesting to note how probability of a i do not know answer is generally lower in 2018 especially for the negative attitudes class table 8 provides a summary of class characteristics for the two lcc models in the two datasets 5 discussion and conclusions over the past three decades researchers have used various socio cognitive cultural theories or threat coping models to explain individuals risk awareness and adoption of protective behaviours e g slovic 1987 2000 kasperson et al 1988 kahneman and tversky 1979 thompson et al 1990 pidgeon et al 2003 meyer et al 2014 grothmann and reusswig 2006 ridolfi et al 2020 the contemporary theoretical and methodological frameworks give relevance to different cognitive social and institutional determinants of risk perception yet despite a robust body of knowledge explaining such determinants we do not know much about how they interact and how different risk attitudes and behaviours play out together in generating patterns using lca this study explored the interplay between attitudes and behaviours related to flood risk awareness and structural flood protection in two communities in the eastern italian alps it also explored if and how patterns change over time in order to do so the research design included a standardized questionnaire submitted to a total of 420 residents in the year 2005 n 200 and 2018 n 220 the results highlight how there is a risk minimizing class of residents characterized by low risk awareness high trust in structural flood protection and no experience with floods these people are also reluctant to believe that floods may happen in the future and tend to live in the non mountainous area in 2005 this group corresponded to less than half of the sample and it increased of almost 20 in 2018 this may be linked to the lack of major flood events occurred in the study area since 2005 which may have lowered citizens perception of threat and increased their feeling of safety our results also highlight how in relation to protection measures three different groups of citizens exist one with positive attitudes towards them one with more negative attitudes and an intermediate group citizens with positive attitudes towards protection measures are likely to have previous knowledge and experience with them and to live in the valley area at the opposite individuals characterized by more negative attitudes are likely to live in the mountain area and to have no previous flood experience knowledge of structural flood protection education also seems to play a role citizens without a degree seem to have more negative attitudes towards structural flood protection compared to graduated ones the longitudinal analysis shows how the class of individuals with positive attitudes towards protection measures increased over time a possible interpretation is that citizens may link the lack of damaging flood events in the last years to the existence of protection measures rather than to the occurrence of lower intensity events this calls for a proper communication of the limitations of structural flood protection by public authorities to prevent citizens from relying too heavily on them and consequently underestimating the importance of personal preparedness measures another important difference between the two years concerns the probability of not having well defined opinions about protection measures i e choosing the i do not know option on the measuring scale which was found to be higher in 2005 this may suggest that over time a larger number of citizens developed well structured opinions concerning protection measures overall such results are relevant but also worrying for local risk managers who should take into account the complex relationship between risk attitudes protection measures and flood events in this way these findings provide quantitative evidence in favour of the levee effect burby 2006 already recognized in the literature bye and horner 1998 handmer 2001 enserink 2004 de marchi and scolobig 2012 people with higher trust in structural protection measures tend to be less risk aware thus exposing themselves to higher damage potential due to their failure in recognizing the limitation of such measures yet our findings show that this is also related to lack of flood experience and underestimation of possible events in line with previous works burningham et al 2008 miceli et al 2008 fielding 2012 babcicky and seebauer 2017 importantly the levee effect related issues i e individuals feeling too safe and exposing themselves to higher risks seem to have increased over time as the fraction of the population exposed to them seems to be increased in 2018 compared to 2005 this further corroborates the need for risk managers to increase awareness and preparedness among citizens the main limitation of our study concerns the two samples 2005 and 2018 which have different sizes it would also be advisable for future studies to account for additional covariates which could explain heterogeneity in risk attitudes and behaviour such as socio cognitive cultural theories and exposure to risk communication strategies concerning the use of probabilistic models like lcc model to extend the impact of results our study suggests that generalizable models can be a useful tool for emergency and risk managers in predicting risk awareness patterns and prioritizing risk communication actions yet while these models certainly help us to better understand diversity in flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection they do not necessarily address it in order to do so it is essential to engage local communities in risk communication processes that open up a space for providing and exchanging

4438,insights into the heterogeneity of human behaviours and attitudes toward risk require the understanding of the role played by a plurality of factors such as risk awareness and trust however our knowledge of the interplay of these factors is limited as is our knowledge of the patterns in risk attitudes and behaviours and their evolution over time this study explores the interplay between attitudes and behaviours related to flood risk awareness and structural flood protection in two communities in the eastern italian alps and how they changed over time to this end a questionnaire was submitted to a total of 420 residents in the year 2005 n 200 and 2018 n 220 and then analysed using latent class analysis no floods were recorded in the area during this period the results show that there is a group of residents characterized by low risk awareness and high trust in structural flood protection such individuals are likely to live in urban rather than mountain communities and are characterized by a lack of or limited experience with floods they are also prone to believe that such events will not happen in the future in 2005 this group represented less than half of the sample but its size substantially increased in 2018 this result has strong implications for local risk managers because this group of residents is less risk aware than the others and they may deserve special attention and targeted messages in flood risk communication campaigns this and other results are discussed including the potential development of generalizable models to provide emergency and risk managers with tools to unveil risk awareness patterns and to tailor risk communication actions to citizens attitudes and behaviours the paper ends with some considerations about the need not only to better understand but also to address diversity in flood risk awareness keywords attitudes towards structural flood protection flood risk awareness latent class cluster models 1 introduction flooding remains one of the most common natural hazards causing devastating impacts in europe and worldwide tanoue et al 2016 the high costs associated with flood events stem from the interactions among the physical built and social environments the expectation that flood damages may escalate over time with climate and land use change and socio economic growth in flood prone areas has raised policy makers awareness of the need to implement innovative flood risk management strategies and solutions borga et al 2014 domeneghetti et al 2015 flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection are important components of the societal response to floods and represent key elements to develop a comprehensive flood risk management strategy paton 2008 borga et al 2011 mondino et al 2020 hamilton et al 2020 previous literature highlighted how flood related behaviours are affected by a variety of personal characteristics such as socio demographics e g age and gender miceli et al 2008 salvati et al 2018 attitudes and beliefs bempah and øyhus 2017 psychological and personality traits heller et al 2005 information and knowledge wachinger et al 2013 past experience with flood events drobot et al 2007 and trust in authorities and in structural protection measures grothmann and reusswig 2006 scolobig et al 2012 this can lead to the presence of subgroups in a population which vary in terms of the above characteristics which exhibit heterogeneous flood perception and attitudes towards structural flood protection flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection are not only heterogeneous across different groups of citizens but they can also change over time mondino et al 2020 ridolfi et al 2020 time can play an important role in shaping risk awareness particularly in communities which did not experience a flood event for extended periods the lack of recent events in fact can cause a decrease in risk awareness thus making communities more vulnerable to flood risk burn 1999 mondino et al 2020 importantly variation of risk behaviour across groups and over time can be intertwined for example ridolfi et al 2020 modelled flood losses over time in four types of society named by the authors risk neglecting risk monitoring risk downplaying and risk controlling societies differing in terms of flood risk behaviour the authors found substantial differences across the four societies in terms of flood losses accounting for flood behaviour heterogeneity across population groups and for evolution of such groups over time can help explain why certain groups within broader communities are more risk aware and prepared than others quantifying the variability of flood risk awareness and capturing identifiable differences in populations is also fundamental to better understand societal responses to flood hazards in addition identifying subgroups with distinct configurations of heterogeneity provides policy and decision makers with information that is tailored to different groups rather than an average description of the overall population this could help to drive improved risk communication strategies where tailoring ensures that the information is relevant to the different risk profile groups thus potentially leading to a better flood risk preparedness moreover identifying subgroups with heterogeneous flood risk awareness may help to better gauge people s willingness to support government policies and take precautionary measures and to support the development of more effective mitigation strategies kellens et al 2013 given the above background and building upon the previous studies by scolobig et al 2012 and mondino et al 2020 this study aims to i identify subgroups of citizens within broader communities according to their patterns of flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection and ii analyse how these groups are changing over time in the absence of flood events and after the implementation of structural flood protection in order to identify and to profile subgroups of citizens differing in terms of risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection and investigate the evolution of such groups over time we adopt a latent class analysis lca approach lca is a statistical method used to group individuals into classes of an unobserved i e latent variable on the basis of the responses made on a set of nominal ordinal or continuous observed variables collins and lanza 2010 importantly lca is a model based approach which means that a statistical model is postulated for the population from which the sample is drawn and results can be used to make inferences about the whole population vermunt and magidson 2002 data for our analysis was collected via a questionnaire administered twice to a total of 420 residents in two communities in the eastern italian alps in the year 2005 n 200 and 2018 n 220 the two communities were hit by floods and debris flows in the years 2000 and 2002 and no other significant flood event occurred in the area up until the time of the second questionnaire administration 2 background several studies have investigated the factors that shape flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection among people who live in high risk zones bubeck et al 2012 lechowska 2018 di baldassarre et al 2018 clar 2019 starting from determinants of flood risk awareness several studies investigated how this is affected by citizens socio demographic characteristics findings suggest that risk awareness is shaped by a plurality of socio demographics such as age salvati et al 2018 gender mcdowell et al 2020 income burningham et al 2008 education karanci et al 2005 and presence of children living at home russell et al 1995 next to socio demographics previous experience of a flood has been recognised in the literature as one of the most important factors shaping risk awareness mondino et al 2020 wachinger et al 2013 concerning the effect of such factor however research results are not always consistent some scholars reported a positive influence of previous experience on risk awareness thistlethwaite et al 2018 some a negative one especially in the case of limited damage suffered halpern felsher et al 2001 and some a non significant whitmarsh 2008 or unclear effect bradford et al 2012 other factors outlined by the literature as affecting risk awareness are beliefs bempah and øyhus 2017 psychological and personality traits heller et al 2005 information and knowledge wachinger et al 2013 and trust in authorities su et al 2017 next to studies investigating the role of specific factors in shaping risk behaviour in the past fifty years multiple theories and frameworks have been developed to better understand how people live with risk such as the psychometric paradigm e g fischoof et al 1979 the cultural theory of risk e g douglas and wildavsky 1982 the social constructivist approaches to risk e g beck 1992 protection motivation theory grothmann and reusswig 2006 or dynamic protection motivation frameworks weyrich et al 2020 for example the psychometric paradigm stipulates that some risk characteristics are perceived similarly voluntariness is correlated with controllability catastrophic potential with inequity observability with knowledge about the risk immediacy with novelty examples of results of this research include cognitive maps in which several risk characteristics are combined into factors when it comes to attitudes towards structural flood protection the literature agrees that they often promote a false sense of safety in residents living in the floodplain white 1945 keys 2016 smith 2003 tobin 1995 maddocks et al 2007 ferdous et al 2020 this in turn promotes urban development in areas at risk of flooding white 1945 this phenomenon is commonly referred to as levee effect white 1945 but others refer to it also as levee paradox smith 2003 or safe development paradox e g burby 2006 the levee effect may eventually lead to a cycle of levee raising where communities demand higher levees to be built after each levee failure to maintain an illusion of complete flood protection keys 2016 di baldassarre et al 2018 thus reducing residents flood risk awareness and increasing exposure to flood risk furthermore recent studies based on socio hydrological modelling found that trust in flood protections and short lived collective memory of flood events could be associated with lower flood risk awareness and that lack of trust in flood controls and longer memory of flood events could be associated with higher risk awareness di baldassarre et al 2013 viglione et al 2014 related studies indicate that trust in flood protections is negatively associated with risk awareness flood preparedness intent to purchase insurance and adoption of flood mitigation measures grothmann and reusswig 2006 hung 2009 trust is also informed by experience when flood defences are visible individuals can gather information about the quality of risk management by observing the performance of structures based on these observations they can adjust trust in flood controls and risk perception terpstra 2011 given the plurality of factors influencing risk awareness and trust in protection works outlined above some studies focused on identifying groups of citizens that shares similar characteristics and on exploring how risk behaviour changes across groups for example martens et al 2009 identified four groups of citizens based on the motivation intention volition model martens et al 1998 and found the groups to differ significantly in terms of risk perception bodoque et al 2016 identified groups of citizens profiled according to socio demographics and found risk perception and awareness to vary substantially across groups one of the objectives of our study is to contribute and expand such literature by profiling groups of citizens according to a plurality of factors described in section 3 and eliciting how risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection differ among groups another body of literature explored changes in risk behaviour over time the existing studies suggest that people s attitudes and awareness towards flood risk change significantly with time mondino et al 2020 zabini et al 2021 usually immediately after an event flood risk is perceived to be higher than it actually is but the sense of danger begins to decrease shortly after the event therefore society tends to forget about the risk associated with floods after extended periods without events raaijmakers et al 2008 the literature also suggests that the positive influence of direct flood experience on private mitigating behaviours may disappear several years after the flood terpstra 2011 hence the time of the previous flood plays a major role on risk awareness since it can be expected that the experience of a flood that occurred a long time ago has little influence on current risk awareness and mitigating behaviours grothmann and reusswig 2006 as such it is likely that communities that did not experience a flood in recent years show a decrease in the level of worry and awareness bradford et al 2012 the second objective of our study is to expand such literature by not only investigating changes in citizens risk behaviour over time in an area which did not suffer major events for an extend period of time but also by investigating how time affects groups of citizens with different profile and risk behaviour 3 methods 3 1 study area in 2005 de marchi and scolobig 2012 administrated a questionnaire on risk awareness preparedness and social vulnerability in four small communities in the eastern italian alps bocenago roverè della luna romagnano and vermiglio rio cortina which were impacted by a series of intense floods debris flows and shallow landsliding in 2000 and 2002 tarolli et al 2011 lanni et al 2012 one of the aims of the study was to better understand the relationship between risk awareness and preparedness results are presented in scolobig et al 2012 to explore changes in risk awareness and preparedness in absence of extreme events as well as the impact of structural flood protection the same questionnaire was administrated in 2018 mondino et al 2020 by considering only two of the original four communities romagnano and vermiglio rio cortina the two communities were selected as a number of structural flood protection were implemented after the flood events in the impacted areas and as they both experienced hydrogeological extreme events in the early 2000 s followed by a prolonged absence of events until the time of the second data collection while the two communities are both located in the province of trento italy fig 1 they have contrasting features vermiglio 1261 m a s l is an alpine municipality located in the upper part of the vermigliana torrent valley romagnano 220 m a s l is an urban settlement in the floodplains of the adige river the number of inhabitants in vermiglio remained stable at 1850 across the past 20 years while in romagnano inhabitants went from 1200 in 2005 to 1600 in 2018 a 33 increase a description of the flood events and geomorphic responses landslides and debris flows which impacted the sites is reported in scolobig et al 2012 after the flood events structural flood protection was built in romagnano and vermiglio mainly consisting in check dams 3 2 data collection as in the first questionnaire round participants were kept anonymous and therefore could not be contacted again in the second round we used a cohort design which allows to have samples containing different individuals compared to 2005 a cohort study or repeated cross sectional study has the characteristic of sampling individuals with a shared characteristic which makes them part of a cohort e g being born in the same year living in the same town having experienced a certain event and so forth therefore the two or more samples taken over time could contain different individuals in different points in time while this does not allow for a within respondent comparison it still allows for a comparison between groups moreover this type of design works around the issue of high attrition rates i e participants dropping out of the study which implies a depletion of the sample over time hudson et al 2019 highlights high attrition rates as one of the main problems concerning longitudinal research within the flood risk domain information on the sampling procedure and samples characteristics can be found in mondino et al 2020 both in the first and second data collections data were collected through questionnaires administered during a face to face interview with the respondent the questionnaire used in the second round was built upon the first one with some minor changes due to the slightly different aims of the two studies however the questions used to assess the variables related to risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection were kept unchanged to allow for comparison the questionnaire includes items that are not discussed in this paper as they are out of the main scope the full questionnaire can be found in the appendix we selected three variables to interpret flood risk awareness perceived threat posed by flood events relative to a the town b the home and c one s physical integrity specifically participants were asked to what extend do you think flood events are a threat to your town home yourself for each variable respondents could answer on a scale from 1 minimal threat to 5 serious threat we also assessed a fourth variable feeling of safety through the question how safe do you feel living in your village respondents could answer on a scale from 1 not safe at all to 5 very safe to assess attitudes towards structural flood protection and investigate levee effect we asked respondents to what extent they agreed with the following statements i structural flood protection prevent serious damages ii structural flood protection are too expensive compared to their benefit iii structural flood protection make people feel safe iv structural flood protection favour economic development they could respond on a scale from 1 completely disagree to 5 completely agree to assess trust in structural flood protection we asked respondents to what extent i structural flood protection and ii early warning systems make them feel safe on a scale from 1 not safe at all to 5 very safe knowledge and experience about structural flood protection were measured by asking respondents whether i they are aware of the existence of structural flood protection ii they had direct experience in the past with structural flood protection iii they received information about structural flood protection from official sources i e local authorities in addition the questionnaire retrieved socio demographic data such as age gender income and education descriptive statistics for age and gender of all samples are reported in table 1 compared to 2005 in 2018 the sample was slightly older both in vermiglio and in romagnano as for gender in both locations the percentage of females slightly decreased and that of males slightly increased 3 3 latent class analysis most constructs in social science represent a set of behaviours and qualities i e risk aversion trust in institutions etc with a high level of abstraction these constructs are seldom directly observable hence researchers use a set of multiple observable variables to measure such aspects in a given study latent class lc models magidson and vermunt 2002 hagenaars and mccutcheon 2002 typically based on finite mixture modelling are used to empirically determine whether interrelationships exist among observed variables that explain the latent phenomena nurius and macy 2008 lc models enable the researcher to identify important interindividual differences and thus model distinct configurations of heterogeneity within a given sample this provides an opportunity to classify individuals from a heterogeneous population into more homogenous subgroups based on their scores on different instruments typically answers to likert scale questions lc models are based on the following assumptions i the population consists of a number of different classes with respect to individual characteristics i e socio demographics attitudes and perceptions ii individuals belonging to the same class have similar response pattern to attitudinal questions magidson and vermunt 2002 morey et al 2008 morey and thiene 2017 probability to fall in one class rather than another is estimated as a function of a set of covariates to identify profiles of citizens with different attitudes and behaviours ultimately lc allows not only to identify population groups but also to probabilistically retrieve their size that is the share of the population which exhibits a certain pattern of perceptions and attitudes given sufficient statistical power i e large enough sample size we investigated variation of risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection in the population by estimating two lcc models with the four variables related to risk awareness and the five variables related to structural flood protection described above 3 3 1 analysis framework we analysed the two datasets 2005 and 2018 by means of two different approaches firstly we explored the two datasets separately via a cross sectional analysis then we carried out a longitudinal analysis aimed at comparing results from 2005 and 2018 datasets this allows to disentangle the evolution of heterogeneity of citizens attitudes and to explore variation of preferences over time as it concerns the modelling approach we estimated two latent class models the first aims at investigating flood risk awareness and the second focuses on attitudes towards structural flood protection the overall framework used for data analysis is illustrated in fig 2 the goal of the estimated lcc models was to probabilistically allocate respondents in different groups classes based on responses they provided to the questions reported in section 3 2 the probability to fall in one class rather than another was estimated as function of a set of covariates which can be grouped in four categories i trust in structural flood protection ii past flood experience iii knowledge of flood risk iv socio demographics the relationship between such covariates and different lcc models is illustrated in fig 2 3 3 2 latent class model we investigated variation in citizens risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection by means of two latent class cluster lcc models vermunt and magidson 2002 thacher et al 2005 morey and thiene 2017 we choose lcc models over other clustering techniques such as cluster analysis as the latter relies on ad hoc and deterministic classification to identify clusters whereas lcc probabilistically assigns individuals to classes clusters and can reduce misclassification biases additional benefits over deterministic cluster approaches are i statistical criteria can be used to identify the optimal number of classes ii statistical significance of the model parameters can be assessed iii different types of variables ordinal categorical etc can be accomodated vermunt and magidson 2002 the estimation goal in lcc models is to compute response probabilities the probability that an individual in a certain class states a certain level on an attitudinal question and class membership probabilities the probability that an individual belongs to a particular class given his her observable characteristics e g socio demographics all individuals with the same observed characteristics have the same probability of belonging to a particular class we estimated the models by maximum likelihood the log likelihood function for ac class model is 1 ln l i i n l n c 1 c p r c z i q 1 q s 1 s π qs c x iqs where π qs c is the probability that individualistates level s on attitudinal question q conditional on belonging to class c p r c z i is the unconditional probability that individual i belongs to class c as a function of his her observable characteristics z i xiqs 1 if individuali s answer to attitudinal question q is level s and 0 otherwise maximum likelihood estimation was carried out with the r package polca linzer and lewis 2011 in order to identify the optimal number of classes the log likelihood function eq 1 was maximized for increasing number of classes each time a class was added we assessed whether it improved the model by referring to information criteria such as the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 and the bayesian information criterion bic schwartz 1978 such information criteria describe the goodness of fit of a model i e the discrepancy from the observed values and those predicted by the model the best performing model i e the model with the optimal number of classes is the one that minimizes the score of these criteria 4 results 4 1 results of 2005 questionnaire results obtained by the application of the two models provide indication for a three classes specification based on the information criteria reported in table 2 the classes in the two models are independent for the two models we report the average level for each variable weighted by estimated probabilities such probabilities are included in the supplementary material tables s 2 and s 4 the supplementary data also reports the outputs from the lcc models on attitudes towards protection expenditures tables s 5 s 7 and figure s 1 and the binary logit model on the adoption of protection measures table s 8 the supplement material also reports the results of chi square tests carried out to assesses whether probabilities across classes are statistically different tables s 2 s 4 and s 6 in all cases we found differences to be significant at 95 level 4 1 1 risk awareness the first lcc model explores how perceived threat related to floods varies across the population the variables are i feeling of safety ii perceived threat for town iii perceived threat for own habitation iv perceived threat for own physical integrity as covariates in the class membership function in addition to socio demographic characteristics we included also i previous flood experience ii perceived future flood risk iii trust in structural flood structural flood protection table 3 shows that the predicted membership probability class sizes is 46 for class 3 the largest followed by 32 for class 1 and 22 for class 2 the table also reports the effect of covariates on class membership probability coefficients for class 1 were fixed to zero for identification purposes so we define class 1 as the baseline class which means that the coefficients for the other two classes have to be interpreted in relation to the baseline this also means that class 1 includes all those individuals which are not included in the other two classes i e anyone else the estimated coefficients suggest that with respect to class 1 the baseline individuals who experienced flood events in the past and think such events will happen again in the future are more likely to belong to class 2 we term class 2 risk monitoring class following rippl 2002 and ridolfi et al 2020 this class includes more likely individuals with low trust in structural flood protections individuals with no previous flood experience who do not think similar flood events will happen in the future and who do not live in the mountain area are instead more likely to belong to class 3 termed here risk minimizing class class 1 includes everyone else and we name it risk downplaying fig 3 illustrates average estimated levels for each variable the risk monitoring class exhibits the lowest weighted average level for feeling of safety 3 40 this class also has the highest average level for the other three variables thereby indicating a stronger perceived threat compared to other classes specifically average levels are 3 76 for village vs 2 63 in class 1 and 2 27 in class 3 4 18 for own habitation vs 1 86 in class 1 and 1 31 in class 3 and 3 15 for own physical integrity vs 1 86 in class 1 and 1 19 in class 3 overall such results suggest that the risk monitoring class includes individuals with the highest risk awareness this is consistent with the profile identified in the class membership function the risk monitoring class includes citizens that have already experienced floods and think they will happen again in the future so it is plausible that they are more risk aware than members of other classes this may be exacerbated by their low trust in structural flood structural flood protection individuals in the risk minimizing class instead show the highest feeling of safety with an average weighted level of 4 79 they are also associated with the lowest average levels for all variables related to perceived threat these results suggest that individuals in this class have the lowest risk awareness among all classes and have a very low perceived threat for both their village and for themselves this is consistent with the profile emerged from the class membership function which highlights how individuals in this class are more likely to have no experience with floods and to think such events will not happen in the future they are also more likely to live in the valley area which has lower flood risk finally the risk downplaying class shows an intermediate feeling of safety and perceived threat but closer to the levels of the risk minimizing class 4 1 2 attitudes towards structural flood protection we investigated variation of attitudes towards structural flood protection by estimating a latent class model with the following variables i structural flood protection prevent serious damages ii structural flood protection are too expensive compared to their benefit iii structural flood protection make people feel safe iv structural flood protection favour economic development v structural flood protection make me feel safe vi warning systems make me feel safe for each of these variables respondents were asked to state their agreement on a scale from 1 do not agree at all to 5 completely agree an i do not know option was also included to profile the classes of individuals which we remind are independent from those estimated in the previous model with different attitudes towards structural flood protection we used as covariates the following information i knowledge of existing structural flood protection ii knowledge of flood risk from previous experience iii knowledge of flood risk from official information iv socio demographic characteristics namely place of residence education and age the predicted membership reported in table 4 shows that class 2 termed positive attitudes in the following is the largest 41 and the other two classes have similar size 31 for class 1 and 28 for class 3 the coefficients of the class membership function table 5 suggest that class 3 termed negative trust here more likely includes individuals with no knowledge of existing structural flood protection no knowledge on flood risks from official information and who live in mountain municipalities and do not have a degree the positive attitudes class instead include individuals with knowledge of existing structural flood protection and of flood risks thanks to both direct experience and official information they are also likely not to live in the mountain municipality fig 4 illustrates estimated average levels by class members of the positive class generally have the most positive attitude towards structural flood protection they are prone to believe that structural flood protection prevents serious damage average level equal to 4 48 make people feel safe 4 92 and albeit to a slightly lesser degree favour economic development 3 86 all these average scores are higher than those estimated in other classes members of the risk controlling class also tend to disagree more strongly than the others with the idea that structural flood protection is too expensive 1 33 finally this class is characterized by individuals who strongly perceive safety from both structural flood protection average score equal to 4 75 and early warning systems average score 4 31 overall these results suggest that having knowledge of existing structural flood protection and flood risks which positively affect probability to belong to this class has a positive effect on attitudes towards structural flood protection moving to the negative attitudes class the first interesting thing to notice is that its members have the highest probability of selecting the i do not know option for the first four variables table s 10 this is particularly evident for structural flood protection favours economic development for which probability of selecting such option is extremely high 91 2 this is consistent with the fact that individuals with lack of knowledge about existing structural flood protection are more likely to belong to this class those who expressed a level of agreement with the questions tend to have a positive view of how structural flood protection prevent serious damage average level equal to 3 41 intermediate between the other two classes but they have the lowest average levels for making people feel safe and favour economic development the generally more negative attitude towards structural flood protection is confirmed by the level of agreement with the idea that structural flood protection is too expensive by far the highest among classes 3 48 as it concerns the perception of personal safety members of this class have an average score similar to class 1 for structural flood protection and the lowest among all classes for warning systems 3 28 these results suggest that individuals with limited knowledge about structural flood protection members of this class tend to have more negative attitudes towards it this is consistent with the findings related to the positive attitudes class which highlighted how individuals with knowledge of structural flood protection tend to have more positive attitudes towards them instead levels for the intermediate attitudes class lie between those of the previous classes 4 2 results from 2018 data longitudinal analysis in what follows we first describe results of the analysis based on 2018 data we then turn to outline differences and similarities with those retrieved from the 2005 questionnaire the first important result is that as for the 2005 data the information criteria favour a specification with three classes for both models as shown in table 6 this suggests that the number of different profiles existing in the population did not change over time 4 2 1 risk awareness the 2018 model on risk awareness includes the same variables and the same covariates used for the 2005 one the overall profile of the classes is very similar to the one retrieved for 2005 there is a segment of the population with high risk awareness the risk monitoring class one with low risk awareness the risk minimizing class and an intermediate one risk downplaying class while the profile of the three classes i e risk awareness within each class is similar between the two years the size of the classes is substantially different specifically the segment including citizens with low risk awareness the risk minimizing class in both models is associated with a substantially higher membership probability in 2018 compared to 2005 62 vs 46 such difference was found to be statistically significant at 95 level via a chi squared test x squared 8 53 p value 0 014 this suggests that the fraction of individuals who do not feel threatened by floods may be increased over the last years moving to the covariates of the class membership function one notices how results are quite similar across years thereby suggesting that the profile of citizens having different risk awareness has not changed substantially over the last 15 years or so the major difference also in terms of policy implications seems to be related to the significant and positive effect of trust in structural flood protection on probability to belong to the risk minimizing class low risk awareness class such covariate had no significant effect in 2005 for the risk minimizing class which may suggest that over the years trust in structural flood protection assumed a larger role in people s risk awareness fig 5 shows average levels for each variable included in the model which are similar across the two years 4 2 2 attitudes towards structural flood protection the 2018 lcc model on attitudes towards structural flood protection includes the same variables and covariates accounted for in 2005 see section 4 1 2 by looking at both the profile identified by the class membership function table 7 and the average levels reported in fig 6 the overall pattern seems to be very similar across years by showing a class with generally positive attitudes towards structural flood protection positive attitudes class one class with more negative attitudes negative attitudes class and an intermediate one intermediate attitudes compared to 2005 the positive attitudes class is associated with a higher probability 56 vs 41 x squared 7 81 p value 0 02 which suggests that the number of citizens with positive attitudes towards structural flood protection increased over the years again this may be related to the possible association that citizens may perceive between lack of flood events and effectiveness of structural flood protection as the previous model highlighted how trust in structural flood protection leads to higher perceived safety there may be a link between the increase in the number of citizens with positive attitudes towards structural flood protection and the increase in the number of citizens who do not perceive a threat from floods moving to the covariates of the class membership function it is interesting to notice how knowledge of existing structural flood protection and awareness from personal experience official information affect class membership probabilities in both years in both cases it seems that informed aware citizens have more positive attitudes towards structural flood protection as such covariates have a positive effect on probability to belong to the positive attitudes class as it concerns demographics education has a similar effect in both years people without a degree are in both cases more likely to belong to the risk downplaying class and as such tend to have more negative attitudes towards structural flood protection compared to graduated individuals living in the non mountainous areas seems to have the same effect as well specifically it seems to positively affect probability to belong to the positive attitudes class in both years age instead does not seem to affect class membership in 2018 while it did in 2005 finally by looking at probabilities for each level of the variables table s 10 it is interesting to note how probability of a i do not know answer is generally lower in 2018 especially for the negative attitudes class table 8 provides a summary of class characteristics for the two lcc models in the two datasets 5 discussion and conclusions over the past three decades researchers have used various socio cognitive cultural theories or threat coping models to explain individuals risk awareness and adoption of protective behaviours e g slovic 1987 2000 kasperson et al 1988 kahneman and tversky 1979 thompson et al 1990 pidgeon et al 2003 meyer et al 2014 grothmann and reusswig 2006 ridolfi et al 2020 the contemporary theoretical and methodological frameworks give relevance to different cognitive social and institutional determinants of risk perception yet despite a robust body of knowledge explaining such determinants we do not know much about how they interact and how different risk attitudes and behaviours play out together in generating patterns using lca this study explored the interplay between attitudes and behaviours related to flood risk awareness and structural flood protection in two communities in the eastern italian alps it also explored if and how patterns change over time in order to do so the research design included a standardized questionnaire submitted to a total of 420 residents in the year 2005 n 200 and 2018 n 220 the results highlight how there is a risk minimizing class of residents characterized by low risk awareness high trust in structural flood protection and no experience with floods these people are also reluctant to believe that floods may happen in the future and tend to live in the non mountainous area in 2005 this group corresponded to less than half of the sample and it increased of almost 20 in 2018 this may be linked to the lack of major flood events occurred in the study area since 2005 which may have lowered citizens perception of threat and increased their feeling of safety our results also highlight how in relation to protection measures three different groups of citizens exist one with positive attitudes towards them one with more negative attitudes and an intermediate group citizens with positive attitudes towards protection measures are likely to have previous knowledge and experience with them and to live in the valley area at the opposite individuals characterized by more negative attitudes are likely to live in the mountain area and to have no previous flood experience knowledge of structural flood protection education also seems to play a role citizens without a degree seem to have more negative attitudes towards structural flood protection compared to graduated ones the longitudinal analysis shows how the class of individuals with positive attitudes towards protection measures increased over time a possible interpretation is that citizens may link the lack of damaging flood events in the last years to the existence of protection measures rather than to the occurrence of lower intensity events this calls for a proper communication of the limitations of structural flood protection by public authorities to prevent citizens from relying too heavily on them and consequently underestimating the importance of personal preparedness measures another important difference between the two years concerns the probability of not having well defined opinions about protection measures i e choosing the i do not know option on the measuring scale which was found to be higher in 2005 this may suggest that over time a larger number of citizens developed well structured opinions concerning protection measures overall such results are relevant but also worrying for local risk managers who should take into account the complex relationship between risk attitudes protection measures and flood events in this way these findings provide quantitative evidence in favour of the levee effect burby 2006 already recognized in the literature bye and horner 1998 handmer 2001 enserink 2004 de marchi and scolobig 2012 people with higher trust in structural protection measures tend to be less risk aware thus exposing themselves to higher damage potential due to their failure in recognizing the limitation of such measures yet our findings show that this is also related to lack of flood experience and underestimation of possible events in line with previous works burningham et al 2008 miceli et al 2008 fielding 2012 babcicky and seebauer 2017 importantly the levee effect related issues i e individuals feeling too safe and exposing themselves to higher risks seem to have increased over time as the fraction of the population exposed to them seems to be increased in 2018 compared to 2005 this further corroborates the need for risk managers to increase awareness and preparedness among citizens the main limitation of our study concerns the two samples 2005 and 2018 which have different sizes it would also be advisable for future studies to account for additional covariates which could explain heterogeneity in risk attitudes and behaviour such as socio cognitive cultural theories and exposure to risk communication strategies concerning the use of probabilistic models like lcc model to extend the impact of results our study suggests that generalizable models can be a useful tool for emergency and risk managers in predicting risk awareness patterns and prioritizing risk communication actions yet while these models certainly help us to better understand diversity in flood risk awareness and attitudes towards structural flood protection they do not necessarily address it in order to do so it is essential to engage local communities in risk communication processes that open up a space for providing and exchanging information on how we live with risk credit authorship contribution statement cristiano franceschinis conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft mara thiene

4439,maximizing the benefits of cascade hydropower stations will inevitably reduce the benefits of some upstream hydropower stations in order to promote the joint operation and mutual cooperation between cascade hydropower stations the scientific and fair allocation of compensation benefits between cascade hydropower stations is required in this paper a variation coefficient shapley value method for the compensation benefits allocation of multi owner cascade hydropower stations is proposed by combining individual characteristic weight coefficients with the shapley value of each hydropower station the propensity to disrupt ptd method is adopted to quantitatively evaluate the stability of the allocation results then an exemplary cascade of three hydropower stations on the nanhe river in china is used as a case to calculate the compensation benefits via the proposed variation coefficient shapley value method and compared with other typical allocation methods the results show that the leading hydropower station can get more compensation benefits as well as the second and third stage hydropower stations get reasonable compensation benefits the stability of the cascade alliance in the compensation benefits allocation of the proposed method surpasses that of the other methods this indicates the ability of the proposed method to both consider the individual marginal contribution and individual characteristics of each hydropower station when participating in joint operation the proposed method proves to achieve a fair and rational compensation benefits allocation among the cascade hydropower stations and can potentially improve the utilization efficiency of water resources in the river basin keywords compensation benefits allocation multi owners cascade hydropower stations variation coefficient method shapley value method stability evaluation 1 introduction the large scale development of hydropower resources in china has promoted cascade hydropower station groups in each large basin he et al 2019a 2019b these groups are no longer pursuing the maximum power generation of individual hydropower station but are rather effectively implementing limited water resources to maximize the comprehensive benefits across the cascade penghao et al 2019 however upon the development of cascade hydropower stations the owners of the upstream and downstream hydropower stations may be distinct in order to optimize the state of the entire cascade upstream leading hydropower station and other hydropower stations with greater runoff regulation capabilities often sacrifice their individual benefits to improve the benefits of the downstream hydropower stations afzali et al 2008 barros et al 2003 yilanci et al 2019 in order to promote the joint operation and mutual cooperation of cascade hydropower stations chen et al 2019 the fair and reasonable allocation of compensation benefits among multi owner cascade hydropower stations is required chen et al 2020 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2012 2018 in recent years extensive work has been performed related to the allocation of compensation benefits for cascade hydropower stations key allocation methods include treaties agreements and rules single index method amit and sasidharan 2019 kwak et al 2013 comprehensive index method chen et al 2020 lehtoranta et al 2013 proportional allocation method bai et al 2015 and shapley value method li et al 2019 liu and sun 2013 reinhardt and dada 2005 treaties agreements and rules usually generally refer to those reached by the various stakeholders on specific issues e g construction fund investment proportions generator unit sequences operation mode maintenance requirements and costs upon the allocation of hydropower stations compensation benefits so as to achieve the purpose of managing or constraining various stakeholders for example the yugoslavia and romania governments have signed an agreement on the construction and operation of the danube tiemen hydropower station and the shipping hub this includes issues such as total investment and its proportion and maintenance costs ensuring an efficient construction process and effective use of water resources sun and duan 2000 the single index method allocates benefits based on the proportion of specific characteristic parameters of the given hydropower station amit and sasidharan 2019 and kwak et al 2013 employed the water head allocation method whereby the proportion of the compensation benefits is considered to equal the proportion of the increased reservoir benefits however only the net head proportion of the reservoirs was considered wang et al 2016 evaluated the hydropower generation compensation benefits of cascade hydropower stations in a basin with allocation based on individual characteristic parameters e g installed capacity guaranteed output regulation storage and rated water the comprehensive index method consider several important indexes affecting the allocation calculates the allocation result of each hydropower station according to variety of allocation methods and then gives different weights to each allocation method according to the specific situation and criteria of each cascade hydropower station finally obtains the comprehensive compensation benefits allocation result which can be divided into multi objective comprehensive analysis method fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method entropy weight method and deviation square method hakimiasiabar et al 2010 employed the comprehensive analysis method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to analyze the key factors affecting the compensation benefits allocation of cascade hydropower stations and subsequently established an allocation model lehtoranta et al 2013 adopted the deviation square method to compensate for the benefits at pielinen lake and to allocate the cost of integrated water conservancy projects this method is able to greatly avoid the large differences between indexes for the single index method and eliminates the subjectivity influence of other comprehensive index methods the proportional allocation method allocates the compensation benefits between the givers and the beneficiaries based on a fixed proportion in 1997 the government of sichuan province issued the sichuan province basin cascade hydropower station reservoir regulation benefits compensation management measures the first regulation on the benefits compensation of cascade reservoirs in china in particular the value of 7 3 was set as the proportion of the compensation benefits allocation between the givers and beneficiaries in 2002 the china development and reform commission organized the compensation benefits allocation method of hydropower cascades recommended draft whereby the proportion 5 5 was proposed as the new compensation benefits allocation between the givers and beneficiaries the shapley value method is a mathematical method employed to solve the problem of benefits allocation in a cooperative game this method fully considers the marginal contribution of each hydropower station in the alliance for the allocation of benefits li et al 2019 adopted the shapley value method as well as other cooperative game theory methods to determine potential benefits sharing solutions when investigating transboundary cooperative water benefits sharing in the lancang mekong river basin china liu and sun 2013 proposed a model based on an improved shapley value method with the ability to quantitatively estimate the compensation of the diversion benefits within the upstream flood discharge project this method was verified using data from the fenren water diversion system providing a feasible basis for the allocation and compensation of benefits for upstream and downstream hydropower stations despite the great progress made using the aforementioned allocation methods they are associated with several limitations for example treaties agreements and rules do not standardize the determination of compensation benefits allocation and lack an objective implementation principle the single index method results in large differences in the benefits value following allocation based on individual characteristic parameters e g installed capacity or regulating storage of the hydropower station and the benefit value can even fall to zero in some situations thus the single index method can at times exhibit a bias the multi objective comprehensive analysis method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method generally rely on expert influences when determining the weights which can be highly subjective and consequently influences the results the deviation square method is able to rationally integrate subjective and objective factors however its weight function is just an estimate the proportional allocation method is simple to implement yet its allocation mechanism is unclear and lacks theoretical support the shapley value method considers the marginal contribution value of each hydropower station in the compensation benefits however it tends to produce unreasonable allocation results as it ignores the individual characteristics and preferences of the hydropower station therefore the scientific and reasonable allocation of compensation benefits remains as an urgent problem to be solved allocation methods must determine whether the principles of compensation benefits allocation are met if the principles are satisfied the allocation result is theoretically stable and the allocation method is potentially acceptable however the principles only determined a reasonable upper limit of the benefits to be allocated to each hydropower station while the lower limit was unreasonable if the compensation benefits allocated to hydropower stations are small then the allocation method is obviously unfair and will not be accepted therefore it is necessary to evaluate the stability of the current allocation methods gately 1974 propensity to disrupt ptd method is commonly applied to quantitatively evaluate the stability of cooperative game solutions for example in a study investigating cross border cooperation and benefits sharing teasley and mckinney 2011 selected a stable and reasonable allocation scheme via the use of a stability evaluation method the variation coefficient method which assigns different weights to the indexes based on their degree of variation faber and korn 1991 chengjiang et al 2014 teasley and mckinney 2011 is typically employed in the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators due to its strong objectivity this method can potentially solve the compensation benefits allocation of hydropower station based on the above review of existing methods in the current paper we combine the advantages of the variation coefficient method and the shapley value method to propose a new method for the compensation benefits allocation of cascade hydropower stations denoted as the variation coefficient shapley value vc sv method the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the operating model and research methodology section 3 applies the vc sv method to the compensation benefits allocation problem of cascade hydropower stations and compares the results and stability of several allocation methods section 4 concludes the paper 2 operation model and research methodology 2 1 cascade hydropower stations operation model optimal power generation operation models have been established in order to maximize the power generation benefits of single hydropower stations and those under different alliance modes feng et al 2017 yu et al 2012 2 1 1 objective function the maximum annual power generation benefits of a single hydropower station can be described as follows 1 max b i single max t 1 t a i q i t h i t δ t p i similarly the maximum annual power generation benefits of different alliance modes is given as 2 max b j alliance max i 1 n t 1 t k i a i q i t h i t δ t p i where i is the ith hydropower station in the cascade j is the jth alliance mode max b i single denotes the power generation benefits

the jth alliance is 0 2 1 2 constraints 1 water balance 3 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t s i t δ t t t where vi t and vi t 1 are the water storage capacity of the ith hydropower station at the beginning and end of period t respectively ii t and si t are the reservoir inflow and surplus flow of the ith hydropower station at period t respectively 2 hydraulic connection the hydraulic connection includes the water head connection eq 4 and water flow connection eq 5 4 z i 1 t down f z i t q i 1 t s i 1 t 5 i i t q i t q i 1 t s i 1 t where in eq 4 the water level below the dam of i 1th hydropower station z i 1 t down is related to both its discharge q i 1 t s i 1 t and the reservoir water level of the downstream ith hydropower station z i t if the i 1th and ith hydropower stations belong to the discontinuous cascade z i 1 t down is only related to q i 1 t s i 1 t where in eq 5 the reservoir inflow of the ith hydropower station i i t consists of power discharge qi 1 t and surplus flow si

level constraints respectively 5 power output limits 8 n i t m i n a i q i t h i t n i t max t t where a i q i t h i t is the output of the ith hydropower station at period t and n i t m i n and n i t max are the corresponding minimum and maximum power output constraints respectively 6 discharge flow limits 9 q i t min d q i t d q i t max d t t where q i t d is the discharge flow of the ith hydropower station at period t and q i t min d and q i t max d are the corresponding minimum and maximum discharge flow constraints respectively 2 2 compensation benefits allocation methods 2 2 1 principles of compensation benefits allocation for the reasonable compensation benefits allocation of the joint optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations the following principles must be met 1 the principle of completeness the sum of the benefits allocated by the hydropower stations in the alliance should be equal to the incremental benefits of the alliances cooperation 2 the principle of fairness the benefits allocated by each hydropower station in the alliance should be proportional to the contribution or degree of sacrifice the hydropower station in the alliance 3 the principle of rationality a individual rationality namely the benefits of each hydropower station after allocation should not be lower than the power generation benefits during its independent operation b group rationality namely the total benefits of any combination of hydropower stations alliance should not be less than the total benefits of the sub alliance formed by these several hydropower stations 2 2 2 variation coefficient method the variation coefficient method is an objective weighting method employed for the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators it has strong objectivity and potential ability to solve the compensation benefits allocation of hydropower stations this method employs the variation degree of the individual characteristic parameters to derive the weights of each hydropower station if we consider n hydropower stations each of which with m individual characteristic parameters then their characteristic parameter matrix can be denoted as o o ij n m the method adopted by the variation coefficient method to calculate the individual characteristic weights is described in the following 1 each characteristic parameter value is normalized and the parameter value matrix is standardized as o the maximum minimum and median types parameters are normalized via eqs 10 12 respectively cao 2013 10 y ij o ij o min j o max j o min j 0 4 0 6 11 y ij o max j o ij o max j o min j 0 4 0 6 12 y ij 1 o ij o j max i 1 2 n o ij o j 0 4 0 6 where y ij is the standard value of the jth characteristic parameter of the ith hydropower station y ij 0 6 1 o max j and o min j z min j are the maximum and minimum characteristic values of the jth characteristic parameter respectively and o j is the median of the characteristic parameter in the current study we normalized the parameters within the range of 0 6 1 and its rationality has been verified by cao 2 the average o j and mean square deviation d j of the jth characteristic parameter value are calculated as follows 13 o j i 1 n o ij n 14 d j i 1 n o ij o j 2 n 3 the variation coefficient δ j of the jth characteristic parameter value is calculated as follows 15 δ j d j o j 4 the weight value ω j of the jth characteristic parameter is calculated as follows 16 ω j δ j j 1 m δ j 5 the proportion p ij of the jth characteristic parameter value of the ith hydropower station is calculated as follows 17 p ij y ij i 1 n y ij 6 the comprehensive weight value υ i of the ith hydropower station is calculated as follows 18 υ i j 1 m ω j p ij where υ i is the individual characteristic weight coefficient of the ith hydropower station 2 2 3 shapley value method the shapley value method is typically used to mathematically solve the problem of multi party cooperative game benefits allocation chun 1989 cong and yan 2016 xu et al 2008 this method allocates compensation benefits according to the expected value of participants marginal costs thus ensuring the effectiveness and fairness of the allocation assume that n hydropower stations are participating in cooperative game g n v where n 1 2 3 n and v denotes alliance if i n then πi represents the position replaced by i if s n then s i 1 i 2 i 3 i k and π s π i 1 π i 2 π i 3 π ik let πv be a characteristic function u and assuming that the shapley value taken by g is an n dimensional vector the we have 19 π v s u s v π s 20 φ v φ 1 v φ 2 v φ 3 v φ n v where π and s denote the substitution and sub alliance of n respectively u is the power generation benefits of the joint hydropower station and φ i v is the shapley value of the ith hydropower station the basic axioms for the application of the shapley values are described as follows 1 the axiom of symmetry the shapley value is independent of the order of the hydropower stations in the alliance and the order does not affect the sum of the interests of all hydropower station interests 21 φ π i π v φ i v where φ π i π v is the shapley value of the ith hydropower station under replacement π 2 the axiom of validity the sum of the shapley values of all hydropower stations in alliance is equal to the value of the corresponding alliance if a certain hydropower station does not contribute to the alliance the allocated benefit of the hydropower station is 0 22 i d φ i v v d where d is a subset of g 3 the axiom of additivity the shapley value of two merged independent alliances equals is the sum of the shapley values of the two independent alliances 23 φ i ν ω φ i v φ i ω 24 ν ω s v s ω s where φ i v and φ i ω are the shapley values of the two alliances if axioms 1 3 are satisfied then the shapley value of each hydropower station has the following unique solution 25 σ i s n s 1 n s n ν s ν s i where s is the number of the hydropower stations in the alliance s 1 n s n is the alliance probability of alliance s and ν s ν s i is the marginal contribution value of the ith hydropower station to alliance s 2 2 4 variation coefficient shapley value vc sv method in this study we first calculate the individual characteristic weight coefficient of each hydropower station via the variation coefficient method and then integrate this with the shapley value of each hydropower station to propose the vc sv method more specifically eqs 10 18 are used to calculate the individual characteristic weight coefficient υ i of each hydropower station eq 25 is then employed to calculate the shapley value σ i of each hydropower station finally the vc sv method is described as 26 θ i υ i σ i 27 x i θ i i 1 n θ i where xi is the allocation proportion of the ith hydropower station υ i is the individual characteristic weight coefficient of the ith hydropower station and σ i is the shapley value of the ith hydropower station 2 2 5 calculation of compensation benefits in the current study we allocate the compensation benefits under a joint operation hydropower station cascade the compensation benefits of each hydropower station are equal to the difference between the total benefits generated with the cascade under joint operation minus those generated by the cascade under the independently operating hydropower stations and then multiplied by the allocation proportion of each hydropower station this allocation process is in agreement with the principle of completeness of compensation benefits allocation 2 3 stability evaluation of allocation results the propensity to disrupt ptd method is commonly applied to quantitatively evaluate the stability of cooperative game solutions gately 1974 teasley and mckinney 2011 it represents the proportion of the alliances loss to the member i s loss suffered by member i leaving the alliance under a specific allocation 28 ptd i 1 x i v i j i x j v n i where ptd i is the propensity to disrupt member i under a specific allocation xi is the income obtained from the allocation of member i in the alliance v i is the income obtained when member i implements a single operation and v n i is the total income of the alliance that lost member i the smaller the ptd the lager the member s income compared to its contribution to the alliance and the alliance tends to keep these members in the alliance on the contrary the lager the ptd the smaller the member s income compared to its contribution to the alliance and the alliance does not have much requirement for its to go or stay fig 1 presents the framework of compensation benefits allocation and stability evaluation process using the vc sv method and ptd 3 case study 3 1 research area nanhe river is a first level tributary located at the right bank of the middle reaches of hanjiang river which belongs to the yangtze river basin of china the main stream of the nanhe river has a total length of 255 km and watershed area of 6497 km2 it is rich in hydropower resources and currently holds 13 hydropower stations on its main stream and tributaries we selected a typical cascade of hydropower stations with three different regulating capacities on the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of nanhe river as the case studies sanliping hydropower station a is the leading hydropower station of the cascade with a multi year regulating capacity siping hydropower station b and guoduwan hydropower station c are the second and third stage of the cascade with yearly and daily regulating capacities respectively hydropower station a belongs to china hubei energy group fangxian hydropower development co ltd while hydropower station b and c belong to china gezhouba group co ltd despite belonging to the same company the power generation revenues of the latter two are calculated independently we construct several hypothetical alliance modes in order to investigate the rationality of the proposed compensation benefits allocation method fig 2 and table 1 depict the positional relationship and key parameters of the three hydropower stations respectively 3 2 optimization calculation of power generation operation hydrological frequency analysis was performed using 39 years of measured runoff sequences from 1959 4 to 1998 3 taking the 50 frequency monthly runoff as the inflow process of hydropower station a because there is no confluence of tributaries between the hydropower stations of the cascade the interval inflow is estimated according to the area proportion of the upper basin to the dam site the inflow of each downstream hydropower station is equal to the outflow of the upstream hydropower station plus the interval inflow since the three hydropower stations belong to the discontinuous cascade the water head connection between them is not considered here the grid purchase price of hydropower station a b and c are rmb 0 3330 0 3445 0 4145 yuan per kwh respectively in the study we consider the following five alliance modes abc operating independent ab joint c independent ac joint b independent bc joint a independent abc joint operating different cascade hydropower stations operation models are established according to these five alliance modes the dynamic programming method he et al 2019c wu et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 as an effective and widely used classical method for the optimal operation of hydropower stations is adopted to solve these models figs 3 5 depict the output process of each hydropower station under the different alliances table 2 reports the corresponding annual power generation and benefits 3 3 compensation benefits allocation proportion by different methods 3 3 1 single index method the single index method performs allocation based on the proportion of an individual hydropower station characteristic parameter e g the installed capacity regulating storage guaranteed output annual power generation water head and kinetic energy benefit increment as follows 29 x i y i i 1 n y i where xi is the allocation proportion of the ith hydropower station and yi is the characteristic parameter value of the ith hydropower station according to formula 29 select the installed capacity guaranteed output regulating storage and average annual power generation of three hydropower stations to calculate the compensation benefits allocation proportions the results are shown in table 3 3 3 2 contribution method the contribution method assumes that high conversion the efficiency from the hydropower station units water energy into electric energy and subsequently into power generation benefits enhances the contribution to the joint operation power generation revenue this method can be described as 30 x i p i k i i 1 n p i k i where ki is the power generation efficiency coefficient of the ith hydropower station and represents the coefficient of potential energy into electric energy and pi is the grid purchase price of ith hydropower station which represents the coefficient of the electric energy transformed into power generation benefits table 4 reports the allocation proportions of the compensation benefits based on eq 30 3 3 3 variation coefficient method table 5 shows the allocation proportions of compensation benefits calculated via eqs 10 18 of the variation coefficient method using four characteristic parameters of the three hydropower stations namely the installed capacity guaranteed output regulating storage and average annual generated energy 3 3 4 shapley value method tables 6 8 present the marginal contribution value of each hydropower station under joint compensation adjustment determined via the shapley value method the alliance probability and marginal contribution value of the three hydropower stations under different alliance modes are calculated using eq 25 with total contribution values of the three hydropower stations a b and c calculated as rmb 10 0 9 5 and 7 0 million yuan the corresponding allocation proportions for each hydropower station are 0 377 0 358 and 0 264 respectively 3 3 5 vc sv method the individual characteristic weight coefficients calculated for the three hydropower stations are 0 397 0 365 and 0 238 respectively and the corresponding proportions from the shapley value method are 0 377 0 358 and 0 264 respectively according to eqs 26 to 27 the calculation of the allocation proportions of each hydropower station by the vc sv method are 0 436 0 381 and 0 183 respectively 3 4 result and analysis 3 4 1 allocation proportions analysis table 9 and fig 6 intuitively display the allocation proportions comparison results calculated by the different methods as the leading hydropower station of cascade hydropower station a has best regulation capacity and is able to improve the overall power generation benefits of the cascade as a member of the joint operation furthermore as the second and third stage hydropower stations of the cascade hydropower station b exhibits a greater regulation capacity compared to hydropower station c and helps to compensate and regulate the hydropower station c therefore hydropower station a should be allocated the largest proportion of compensation benefits potentially increasing its enthusiasm to participate in the cascade joint operation as a leading hydropower station similarly the compensation benefits allocated to hydropower station b should exceed those allocated hydropower station c with the exception of the contribution method all the other methods are able to satisfy the principle of fairness of compensation benefits allocation although the contribution method can directly reflect the ability of each hydropower station to convert potential energy into power generation revenue the allocation proportion of each hydropower station is essentially the same in addition this method does not reflect the regulation capacity contribution of the leading hydropower station to the cascade the allocation proportions calculated by the single index method according to the individual characteristic parameters of each hydropower station have a large difference which indicate that this method is not stable for compensation benefits allocation the allocation proportions of hydropower station c calculated by the variation coefficient method and shapley value method both exceeded 0 23 however based on previous experience as the biggest beneficiary in the cascade the proportion of hydropower station c should not reach such a high value as it has no regulating capacity the allocation proportions calculated via the vc sv method hydropower station a and b have higher allocation proportions than via the variation coefficient method and shapley value method furthermore the allocation proportions of hydropower station c is less than 0 19 the results indicate that the vc sv method generally outperforms the other methods our proposed method not only considers the contribution rate of each hydropower station in the cascade joint operation but also accounts for the individual characteristics of each hydropower station 3 4 2 compensation benefits analysis the total cascade power generation benefits of these three hydropower stations are 1 771 108 yuan and 1 506 108 yuan for joint and independent operation respectively the compensation benefits for the joint operation is 0 265 108yuan which satisfies the group rationality of the compensation benefits allocation principle figs 7 9 compare the benefits of the three hydropower stations pre and post allocation which indicate the benefits of each hydropower station after allocation to be greater than the benefits before allocation thus the individual rationality of the compensation benefits allocation principle is satisfied table 10 reports the allocation of compensation benefits calculated from the different methods and fig 10 presents the radar chart with the exception of the contribution method the compensation benefits of hydropower station a are greater than that of hydropower station b than that of hydropower station c the compensation benefits for hydropower stations a and b calculated by vc sv method are rmb 0 116 108yuan and 0 101 108yuan which are higher than that by the contribution method variation coefficient method and shapley value method the compensation benefits of hydropower stations c calculated by vc sv method is 0 049 108yuan on the contrary had the lowest compensation benefits the results reveal that hydropower station a as the upstream hydropower stations with large regulation capacity greatly improves the total power generation benefits of the cascade the more compensation benefits is conducive to promote them actively participate in cascade joint operation the downstream hydropower station c can also receive appropriate compensation benefits 3 4 3 stability evaluation of allocation results further using ptd method to quantitatively evaluate the stability of the compensation benefits allocation of different methods according to formula 28 the ptd values are shown in table 11 it can be seen from table 11 the single index method only take into account the single aspect of each hydropower stations characteristic parameters the large difference of the ptd values between each hydropower station also illustrate the unstable of the method by the proposed vc sv method the ptd values of hydropower station a and b are smaller than using the contribution method variation coefficient method and shapley value method indicating that hydropower station a and b have a greater contribution to the alliance and leaving the alliance will result in greater losses for the alliance so the alliance tends to keep hydropower them stay in it the reason why the ptd value of the hydropower station c is relatively large is that its regulation capacity is weak and the contribution in the alliance is small but the benefits is greater and the alliance does not have much requirement for it to go or stay more benefits of hydropower station c is returned to the upstream hydropower stations which also shows that the result of the allocation is fairer to each hydropower station and more acceptable to all hydropower stations that is the proposed allocation method is more reasonable and stable 4 conclusions a reasonable and fair compensation benefits allocation is crucial for the promotion of cascade hydropower stations to form an alliance and participate in joint operation in the current study we proposed a vc sv method to calculate hydropower stations compensation benefits and implemented the ptd method to evaluate the stability of the allocation results the proposed framework was applied to a typical cascade with three hydropower stations on the nanhe river china under the proposed vc sv method the sanliping siping and guoduwan hydropower stations all obtained higher joint compensation benefits compared to their independently operated values while the compensation benefits of sanliping hydropower station is slightly greater than that of siping and is significantly larger than that of guoduwan the stability evaluation results revealed that as the upstream hydropower stations of the cascade the larger the regulation capacity of hydropower station is the greater it contributes to the cascade alliance hence the smaller the pdt value is and the alliance more tends to keep this hydropower station stay in it as the downstream hydropower station the larger ptd value is linked to its weak regulation capacity so the less important it is in the alliance by comparing with other typical methods the proposed vc sv method considers both the individual characteristics and the contribution of each hydropower station to the alliance suggesting that it is more objective reasonable and stable than the other methods here we employed the proposed method to solve the allocation of power generation compensation benefits for cascade hydropower stations how to solve problems of the compensation benefits allocation for multi objectives such as flood control power generation water supply and ecology of reservoir groups is

4439,maximizing the benefits of cascade hydropower stations will inevitably reduce the benefits of some upstream hydropower stations in order to promote the joint operation and mutual cooperation between cascade hydropower stations the scientific and fair allocation of compensation benefits between cascade hydropower stations is required in this paper a variation coefficient shapley value method for the compensation benefits allocation of multi owner cascade hydropower stations is proposed by combining individual characteristic weight coefficients with the shapley value of each hydropower station the propensity to disrupt ptd method is adopted to quantitatively evaluate the stability of the allocation results then an exemplary cascade of three hydropower stations on the nanhe river in china is used as a case to calculate the compensation benefits via the proposed variation coefficient shapley value method and compared with other typical allocation methods the results show that the leading hydropower station can get more compensation benefits as well as the second and third stage hydropower stations get reasonable compensation benefits the stability of the cascade alliance in the compensation benefits allocation of the proposed method surpasses that of the other methods this indicates the ability of the proposed method to both consider the individual marginal contribution and individual characteristics of each hydropower station when participating in joint operation the proposed method proves to achieve a fair and rational compensation benefits allocation among the cascade hydropower stations and can potentially improve the utilization efficiency of water resources in the river basin keywords compensation benefits allocation multi owners cascade hydropower stations variation coefficient method shapley value method stability evaluation 1 introduction the large scale development of hydropower resources in china has promoted cascade hydropower station groups in each large basin he et al 2019a 2019b these groups are no longer pursuing the maximum power generation of individual hydropower station but are rather effectively implementing limited water resources to maximize the comprehensive benefits across the cascade penghao et al 2019 however upon the development of cascade hydropower stations the owners of the upstream and downstream hydropower stations may be distinct in order to optimize the state of the entire cascade upstream leading hydropower station and other hydropower stations with greater runoff regulation capabilities often sacrifice their individual benefits to improve the benefits of the downstream hydropower stations afzali et al 2008 barros et al 2003 yilanci et al 2019 in order to promote the joint operation and mutual cooperation of cascade hydropower stations chen et al 2019 the fair and reasonable allocation of compensation benefits among multi owner cascade hydropower stations is required chen et al 2020 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2012 2018 in recent years extensive work has been performed related to the allocation of compensation benefits for cascade hydropower stations key allocation methods include treaties agreements and rules single index method amit and sasidharan 2019 kwak et al 2013 comprehensive index method chen et al 2020 lehtoranta et al 2013 proportional allocation method bai et al 2015 and shapley value method li et al 2019 liu and sun 2013 reinhardt and dada 2005 treaties agreements and rules usually generally refer to those reached by the various stakeholders on specific issues e g construction fund investment proportions generator unit sequences operation mode maintenance requirements and costs upon the allocation of hydropower stations compensation benefits so as to achieve the purpose of managing or constraining various stakeholders for example the yugoslavia and romania governments have signed an agreement on the construction and operation of the danube tiemen hydropower station and the shipping hub this includes issues such as total investment and its proportion and maintenance costs ensuring an efficient construction process and effective use of water resources sun and duan 2000 the single index method allocates benefits based on the proportion of specific characteristic parameters of the given hydropower station amit and sasidharan 2019 and kwak et al 2013 employed the water head allocation method whereby the proportion of the compensation benefits is considered to equal the proportion of the increased reservoir benefits however only the net head proportion of the reservoirs was considered wang et al 2016 evaluated the hydropower generation compensation benefits of cascade hydropower stations in a basin with allocation based on individual characteristic parameters e g installed capacity guaranteed output regulation storage and rated water the comprehensive index method consider several important indexes affecting the allocation calculates the allocation result of each hydropower station according to variety of allocation methods and then gives different weights to each allocation method according to the specific situation and criteria of each cascade hydropower station finally obtains the comprehensive compensation benefits allocation result which can be divided into multi objective comprehensive analysis method fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method entropy weight method and deviation square method hakimiasiabar et al 2010 employed the comprehensive analysis method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to analyze the key factors affecting the compensation benefits allocation of cascade hydropower stations and subsequently established an allocation model lehtoranta et al 2013 adopted the deviation square method to compensate for the benefits at pielinen lake and to allocate the cost of integrated water conservancy projects this method is able to greatly avoid the large differences between indexes for the single index method and eliminates the subjectivity influence of other comprehensive index methods the proportional allocation method allocates the compensation benefits between the givers and the beneficiaries based on a fixed proportion in 1997 the government of sichuan province issued the sichuan province basin cascade hydropower station reservoir regulation benefits compensation management measures the first regulation on the benefits compensation of cascade reservoirs in china in particular the value of 7 3 was set as the proportion of the compensation benefits allocation between the givers and beneficiaries in 2002 the china development and reform commission organized the compensation benefits allocation method of hydropower cascades recommended draft whereby the proportion 5 5 was proposed as the new compensation benefits allocation between the givers and beneficiaries the shapley value method is a mathematical method employed to solve the problem of benefits allocation in a cooperative game this method fully considers the marginal contribution of each hydropower station in the alliance for the allocation of benefits li et al 2019 adopted the shapley value method as well as other cooperative game theory methods to determine potential benefits sharing solutions when investigating transboundary cooperative water benefits sharing in the lancang mekong river basin china liu and sun 2013 proposed a model based on an improved shapley value method with the ability to quantitatively estimate the compensation of the diversion benefits within the upstream flood discharge project this method was verified using data from the fenren water diversion system providing a feasible basis for the allocation and compensation of benefits for upstream and downstream hydropower stations despite the great progress made using the aforementioned allocation methods they are associated with several limitations for example treaties agreements and rules do not standardize the determination of compensation benefits allocation and lack an objective implementation principle the single index method results in large differences in the benefits value following allocation based on individual characteristic parameters e g installed capacity or regulating storage of the hydropower station and the benefit value can even fall to zero in some situations thus the single index method can at times exhibit a bias the multi objective comprehensive analysis method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method generally rely on expert influences when determining the weights which can be highly subjective and consequently influences the results the deviation square method is able to rationally integrate subjective and objective factors however its weight function is just an estimate the proportional allocation method is simple to implement yet its allocation mechanism is unclear and lacks theoretical support the shapley value method considers the marginal contribution value of each hydropower station in the compensation benefits however it tends to produce unreasonable allocation results as it ignores the individual characteristics and preferences of the hydropower station therefore the scientific and reasonable allocation of compensation benefits remains as an urgent problem to be solved allocation methods must determine whether the principles of compensation benefits allocation are met if the principles are satisfied the allocation result is theoretically stable and the allocation method is potentially acceptable however the principles only determined a reasonable upper limit of the benefits to be allocated to each hydropower station while the lower limit was unreasonable if the compensation benefits allocated to hydropower stations are small then the allocation method is obviously unfair and will not be accepted therefore it is necessary to evaluate the stability of the current allocation methods gately 1974 propensity to disrupt ptd method is commonly applied to quantitatively evaluate the stability of cooperative game solutions for example in a study investigating cross border cooperation and benefits sharing teasley and mckinney 2011 selected a stable and reasonable allocation scheme via the use of a stability evaluation method the variation coefficient method which assigns different weights to the indexes based on their degree of variation faber and korn 1991 chengjiang et al 2014 teasley and mckinney 2011 is typically employed in the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators due to its strong objectivity this method can potentially solve the compensation benefits allocation of hydropower station based on the above review of existing methods in the current paper we combine the advantages of the variation coefficient method and the shapley value method to propose a new method for the compensation benefits allocation of cascade hydropower stations denoted as the variation coefficient shapley value vc sv method the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the operating model and research methodology section 3 applies the vc sv method to the compensation benefits allocation problem of cascade hydropower stations and compares the results and stability of several allocation methods section 4 concludes the paper 2 operation model and research methodology 2 1 cascade hydropower stations operation model optimal power generation operation models have been established in order to maximize the power generation benefits of single hydropower stations and those under different alliance modes feng et al 2017 yu et al 2012 2 1 1 objective function the maximum annual power generation benefits of a single hydropower station can be described as follows 1 max b i single max t 1 t a i q i t h i t δ t p i similarly the maximum annual power generation benefits of different alliance modes is given

the jth alliance is 0 2 1 2 constraints 1 water balance 3 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t s i t δ t t t where vi t and vi t 1 are the water storage capacity of the ith hydropower station at the beginning and end of period t respectively ii t and si t are the reservoir inflow and surplus flow of the ith hydropower station at period t respectively 2 hydraulic connection the hydraulic connection includes the water head connection eq 4 and water flow connection eq 5 4 z i 1 t down f z i t q i 1 t s i 1 t 5 i i t q i t q i 1 t s i 1 t where in eq 4 the water level below the dam of i 1th hydropower station z i 1 t down is related to both its discharge q i 1 t s i 1 t and the reservoir water level of the downstream ith hydropower station z i t if the i 1th and ith hydropower stations belong to the discontinuous cascade z i 1 t down is only related to q i 1 t s i 1 t where in eq 5 the reservoir inflow of the ith hydropower station i i t consists of power discharge qi 1 t and surplus flow si

hydropower station at period t and q i t min d and q i t max d are the corresponding minimum and maximum discharge flow constraints respectively 2 2 compensation benefits allocation methods 2 2 1 principles of compensation benefits allocation for the reasonable compensation benefits allocation of the joint optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations the following principles must be met 1 the principle of completeness the sum of the benefits allocated by the hydropower stations in the alliance should be equal to the incremental benefits of the alliances cooperation 2 the principle of fairness the benefits allocated by each hydropower station in the alliance should be proportional to the contribution or degree of sacrifice the hydropower station in the alliance 3 the principle of rationality a individual rationality namely the benefits of each hydropower station after allocation should not be lower than the power generation benefits during its independent operation b group rationality namely the total benefits of any combination of hydropower stations alliance should not be less than the total benefits of the sub alliance formed by these several hydropower stations 2 2 2 variation coefficient method the variation coefficient method is an objective weighting method employed for the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators it has strong objectivity and potential ability to solve the compensation benefits allocation of hydropower stations this method employs the variation degree of the individual characteristic parameters to derive the weights of each hydropower station if we consider n hydropower stations each of which with m individual characteristic parameters then their characteristic parameter matrix can be denoted as o o ij n m the method adopted by the variation coefficient method to calculate the individual characteristic weights is described in the following 1 each characteristic parameter value is normalized and the parameter value matrix is standardized as o the maximum minimum and median types parameters are normalized via eqs 10 12 respectively cao 2013 10 y ij o ij o min j o max j o min j 0 4 0 6 11 y ij o max j o ij o max j o min j 0 4 0 6 12 y ij 1 o ij o j max i 1 2 n o ij o j 0 4 0 6 where y ij is the standard value of the jth characteristic parameter of the ith hydropower station y ij 0 6 1 o max j and o min j z min j are the maximum and minimum characteristic values of the jth characteristic parameter respectively and o j is the median of the characteristic parameter in the current study we normalized the parameters within the range of 0 6 1 and its rationality has been verified by cao 2 the average o j and mean square deviation d j of the jth characteristic parameter value are calculated as follows 13 o j i 1 n o ij n 14 d j i 1 n o ij o j 2 n 3 the variation coefficient δ j of the jth characteristic parameter value is calculated as follows 15 δ j d j o j 4 the weight value ω j of the jth characteristic parameter is calculated as follows 16 ω j δ j j 1 m δ j 5 the proportion p ij of the jth characteristic parameter value of the ith hydropower station is calculated as follows 17 p ij y ij i 1 n y ij 6 the comprehensive weight value υ i of the ith hydropower station is calculated as follows 18 υ i j 1 m ω j p ij where υ i is the individual characteristic weight coefficient of the ith hydropower station 2 2 3 shapley value method the shapley value method is typically used to mathematically solve the problem of multi party cooperative game benefits allocation chun 1989 cong and yan 2016 xu et al 2008 this method allocates compensation benefits according to the expected value of participants marginal costs thus ensuring the effectiveness and fairness of the allocation assume that n hydropower stations are participating in cooperative game g n v where n 1 2 3 n and v denotes alliance if i n then πi represents the position replaced by i if s n then s i 1 i 2 i 3 i k and π s π i 1 π i 2 π i 3 π ik let πv be a characteristic function u and assuming that the shapley value taken by g is an n dimensional vector the we have 19 π v s u s v π s 20 φ v φ 1 v φ 2 v φ 3 v φ n v where π and s denote the substitution and sub alliance of n respectively u is the power generation benefits of the joint hydropower station and φ i v is the shapley value of the ith hydropower station the basic axioms for the application of the shapley values are described as follows 1 the axiom of symmetry the shapley value is independent of the order of the hydropower stations in the alliance and the order does not affect the sum of the interests of all hydropower station interests 21 φ π i π v φ i v where φ π i π v is the shapley value of the ith hydropower station under replacement π 2 the axiom of validity the sum of the shapley values of all hydropower stations in alliance is equal to the value of the corresponding alliance if a certain hydropower station does not contribute to the alliance the allocated benefit of the hydropower station is 0 22 i d φ i v v d where d is a subset of g 3 the axiom of additivity the shapley value of two merged independent alliances equals is the sum of the shapley values of the two independent alliances 23 φ i ν ω φ i v φ i ω 24 ν ω s v s ω s where φ i v and φ i ω are the shapley values of the two alliances if axioms 1 3 are satisfied then the shapley value of each hydropower station has the following unique solution 25 σ i s n s 1 n s n ν s ν s i where s is the number of the hydropower stations in the alliance s 1 n s n is the alliance probability of alliance s and ν s ν s i is the marginal contribution value of the ith hydropower station to alliance s 2 2 4 variation coefficient shapley value vc sv method in this study we first calculate the individual characteristic weight coefficient of each hydropower station via the variation coefficient method and then integrate this with the shapley value of each hydropower station to propose the vc sv method more specifically eqs 10 18 are used to calculate the individual characteristic weight coefficient υ i of each hydropower station eq 25 is then employed to calculate the shapley value σ i of each hydropower station finally the vc sv method is described as 26 θ i υ i σ i 27 x i θ i i 1 n θ i where xi is the allocation proportion of the ith hydropower station υ i is the individual characteristic weight coefficient of the ith hydropower station and σ i is the shapley value of the ith hydropower station 2 2 5 calculation of compensation benefits in the current study we allocate the compensation benefits under a joint operation hydropower station cascade the compensation benefits of each hydropower station are equal to the difference between the total benefits generated with the cascade under joint operation minus those generated by the cascade under the independently operating hydropower stations and then multiplied by the allocation proportion of each hydropower station this allocation process is in agreement with the principle of completeness of compensation benefits allocation 2 3 stability evaluation of allocation results the propensity to disrupt ptd method is commonly applied to quantitatively evaluate the stability of cooperative game solutions gately 1974 teasley and mckinney 2011 it represents the proportion of the alliances loss to the member i s loss suffered by member i leaving the alliance under a specific allocation 28 ptd i 1 x i v i j i x j v n i where ptd i is the propensity to disrupt member i under a specific allocation xi is the income obtained from the allocation of member i in the alliance v i is the income obtained when member i implements a single operation and v n i is the total income of the alliance that lost member i the smaller the ptd the lager the member s income compared to its contribution to the alliance and the alliance tends to keep these members in the alliance on the contrary the lager the ptd the smaller the member s income compared to its contribution to the alliance and the alliance does not have much requirement for its to go or stay fig 1 presents the framework of compensation benefits allocation and stability evaluation process using the vc sv method and ptd 3 case study 3 1 research area nanhe river is a first level tributary located at the right bank of the middle reaches of hanjiang river which belongs to the yangtze river basin of china the main stream of the nanhe river has a total length of 255 km and watershed area of 6497 km2 it is rich in hydropower resources and currently holds 13 hydropower stations on its main stream and tributaries we selected a typical cascade of hydropower stations with three different regulating capacities on the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of nanhe river as the case studies sanliping hydropower station a is the leading hydropower station of the cascade with a multi year regulating capacity siping hydropower station b and guoduwan hydropower station c are the second and third stage of the cascade with yearly and daily regulating capacities respectively hydropower station a belongs to china hubei energy group fangxian hydropower development co ltd while hydropower station b and c belong to china gezhouba group co ltd despite belonging to the same company the power generation revenues of the latter two are calculated independently we construct several hypothetical alliance modes in order to investigate the rationality of the proposed compensation benefits allocation method fig 2 and table 1 depict the positional relationship and key parameters of the three hydropower stations respectively 3 2 optimization calculation of power generation operation hydrological frequency analysis was performed using 39 years of measured runoff sequences from 1959 4 to 1998 3 taking the 50 frequency monthly runoff as the inflow process of hydropower station a because there is no confluence of tributaries between the hydropower stations of the cascade the interval inflow is estimated according to the area proportion of the upper basin to the dam site the inflow of each downstream hydropower station is equal to the outflow of the upstream hydropower station plus the interval inflow since the three hydropower stations belong to the discontinuous cascade the water head connection between them is not considered here the grid purchase price of hydropower station a b and c are rmb 0 3330 0 3445 0 4145 yuan per kwh respectively in the study we consider the following five alliance modes abc operating independent ab joint c independent ac joint b independent bc joint a independent abc joint operating different cascade hydropower stations operation models are established according to these five alliance modes the dynamic programming method he et al 2019c wu et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 as an effective and widely used classical method for the optimal operation of hydropower stations is adopted to solve these models figs 3 5 depict the output process of each hydropower station under the different alliances table 2 reports the corresponding annual power generation and benefits 3 3 compensation benefits allocation proportion by different methods 3 3 1 single index method the single index method performs allocation based on the proportion of an individual hydropower station characteristic parameter e g the installed capacity regulating storage guaranteed output annual power generation water head and kinetic energy benefit increment as follows 29 x i y i i 1 n y i where xi is the allocation proportion of the ith hydropower station and yi is the characteristic parameter value of the ith hydropower station according to formula 29 select the installed capacity guaranteed output regulating storage and average annual power generation of three hydropower stations to calculate the compensation benefits allocation proportions the results are shown in table 3 3 3 2 contribution method the contribution method assumes that high conversion the efficiency from the hydropower station units water energy into electric energy and subsequently into power generation benefits enhances the contribution to the joint operation power generation revenue this method can be described as 30 x i p i k i i 1 n p i k i where ki is the power generation efficiency coefficient of the ith hydropower station and represents the coefficient of potential energy into electric energy and pi is the grid purchase price of ith hydropower station which represents the coefficient of the electric energy transformed into power generation benefits table 4 reports the allocation proportions of the compensation benefits based on eq 30 3 3 3 variation coefficient method table 5 shows the allocation proportions of compensation benefits calculated via eqs 10 18 of the variation coefficient method using four characteristic parameters of the three hydropower stations namely the installed capacity guaranteed output regulating storage and average annual generated energy 3 3 4 shapley value method tables 6 8 present the marginal contribution value of each hydropower station under joint compensation adjustment determined via the shapley value method the alliance probability and marginal contribution value of the three hydropower stations under different alliance modes are calculated using eq 25 with total contribution values of the three hydropower stations a b and c calculated as rmb 10 0 9 5 and 7 0 million yuan the corresponding allocation proportions for each hydropower station are 0 377 0 358 and 0 264 respectively 3 3 5 vc sv method the individual characteristic weight coefficients calculated for the three hydropower stations are 0 397 0 365 and 0 238 respectively and the corresponding proportions from the shapley value method are 0 377 0 358 and 0 264 respectively according to eqs 26 to 27 the calculation of the allocation proportions of each hydropower station by the vc sv method are 0 436 0 381 and 0 183 respectively 3 4 result and analysis 3 4 1 allocation proportions analysis table 9 and fig 6 intuitively display the allocation proportions comparison results calculated by the different methods as the leading hydropower station of cascade hydropower station a has best regulation capacity and is able to improve the overall power generation benefits of the cascade as a member of the joint operation furthermore as the second and third stage hydropower stations of the cascade hydropower station b exhibits a greater regulation capacity compared to hydropower station c and helps to compensate and regulate the hydropower station c therefore hydropower station a should be allocated the largest proportion of compensation benefits potentially increasing its enthusiasm to participate in the cascade joint operation as a leading hydropower station similarly the compensation benefits allocated to hydropower station b should exceed those allocated hydropower station c with the exception of the contribution method all the other methods are able to satisfy the principle of fairness of compensation benefits allocation although the contribution method can directly reflect the ability of each hydropower station to convert potential energy into power generation revenue the allocation proportion of each hydropower station is essentially the same in addition this method does not reflect the regulation capacity contribution of the leading hydropower station to the cascade the allocation proportions calculated by the single index method according to the individual characteristic parameters of each hydropower station have a large difference which indicate that this method is not stable for compensation benefits allocation the allocation proportions of hydropower station c calculated by the variation coefficient method and shapley value method both exceeded 0 23 however based on previous experience as the biggest beneficiary in the cascade the proportion of hydropower station c should not reach such a high value as it has no regulating capacity the allocation proportions calculated via the vc sv method hydropower station a and b have higher allocation proportions than via the variation coefficient method and shapley value method furthermore the allocation proportions of hydropower station c is less than 0 19 the results indicate that the vc sv method generally outperforms the other methods our proposed method not only considers the contribution rate of each hydropower station in the cascade joint operation but also accounts for the individual characteristics of each hydropower station 3 4 2 compensation benefits analysis the total cascade power generation benefits of these three hydropower stations are 1 771 108 yuan and 1 506 108 yuan for joint and independent operation respectively the compensation benefits for the joint operation is 0 265 108yuan which satisfies the group rationality of the compensation benefits allocation principle figs 7 9 compare the benefits of the three hydropower stations pre and post allocation which indicate the benefits of each hydropower station after allocation to be greater than the benefits before allocation thus the individual rationality of the compensation benefits allocation principle is satisfied table 10 reports the allocation of compensation benefits calculated from the different methods and fig 10 presents the radar chart with the exception of the contribution method the compensation benefits of hydropower station a are greater than that of hydropower station b than that of hydropower station c the compensation benefits for hydropower stations a and b calculated by vc sv method are rmb 0 116 108yuan and 0 101 108yuan which are higher than that by the contribution method variation coefficient method and shapley value method the compensation benefits of hydropower stations c calculated by vc sv method is 0 049 108yuan on the contrary had the lowest compensation benefits the results reveal that hydropower station a as the upstream hydropower stations with large regulation capacity greatly improves the total power generation benefits of the cascade the more compensation benefits is conducive to promote them actively participate in cascade joint operation the downstream hydropower station c can also receive appropriate compensation benefits 3 4 3 stability evaluation of allocation results further using ptd method to quantitatively evaluate the stability of the compensation benefits allocation of different methods according to formula 28 the ptd values are shown in table 11 it can be seen from table 11 the single index method only take into account the single aspect of each hydropower stations characteristic parameters the large difference of the ptd values between each hydropower station also illustrate the unstable of the method by the proposed vc sv method the ptd values of hydropower station a and b are smaller than using the contribution method variation coefficient method and shapley value method indicating that hydropower station a and b have a greater contribution to the alliance and leaving the alliance will result in greater losses for the alliance so the alliance tends to keep hydropower them stay in it the reason why the ptd value of the hydropower station c is relatively large is that its regulation capacity is weak and the contribution in the alliance is small but the benefits is greater and the alliance does not have much requirement for it to go or stay more benefits of hydropower station c is returned to the upstream hydropower stations which also shows that the result of the allocation is fairer to each hydropower station and more acceptable to all hydropower stations that is the proposed allocation method is more reasonable and stable 4 conclusions a reasonable and fair compensation benefits allocation is crucial for the promotion of cascade hydropower stations to form an alliance and participate in joint operation in the current study we proposed a vc sv method to calculate hydropower stations compensation benefits and implemented the ptd method to evaluate the stability of the allocation results the proposed framework was applied to a typical cascade with three hydropower stations on the nanhe river china under the proposed vc sv method the sanliping siping and guoduwan hydropower stations all obtained higher joint compensation benefits compared to their independently operated values while the compensation benefits of sanliping hydropower station is slightly greater than that of siping and is significantly larger than that of guoduwan the stability evaluation results revealed that as the upstream hydropower stations of the cascade the larger the regulation capacity of hydropower station is the greater it contributes to the cascade alliance hence the smaller the pdt value is and the alliance more tends to keep this hydropower station stay in it as the downstream hydropower station the larger ptd value is linked to its weak regulation capacity so the less important it is in the alliance by comparing with other typical methods the proposed vc sv method considers both the individual characteristics and the contribution of each hydropower station to the alliance suggesting that it is more objective reasonable and stable than the other methods here we employed the proposed method to solve the allocation of power generation compensation benefits for cascade hydropower stations how to solve problems of the compensation benefits allocation for multi objectives such as flood control power generation water supply and ecology of reservoir groups is
